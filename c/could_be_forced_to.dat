Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days.

25|$|Other {{legislative}} initiatives by the Conservatives benefited {{its primary}} supporters, the planters and business class. Taxes {{across the board}} were reduced, and funding was cut for public social and educational programs that assisted poor whites and blacks. Oral contracts were made to be legally binding, breach of contract was enforced as a criminal offense, and those in debt to planters <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> work off their debt. In addition, the University of South Carolina along with The Citadel were reopened to elite classes and generously supported by the state government.|$|E
25|$|Emulsion {{polymerisation}} is the commonest {{means of}} making {{a wide variety of}} industrial polymers, such as paints, adhesives and tyre rubber. It is a complex process involving many simultaneous and separate processes and where historically only a few types of data were available. The complexity and the limited data types meant that conflicting assumptions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> agree with experiment: there was no proper understanding of the process. Gilbert developed and applied mathematical and experimental tools whereby the effects resulting from individual processes could be isolated for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{remuneration}} of generators in {{the spot}} market did not generate interest from private producers to obtain high returns and therefore install new capacity. As a result, the Government {{was concerned with}} {{the possibility that a}} lack of new generation capacity could lead both to higher spot prices and higher tariffs, lower reserve margins and eventually lead to a supply crisis in which it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> invest in the sector. In order to address this problem, in 2003 and 2004, the Government instituted rules for allowing competitively bid long-term contract prices to be reflected in consumer tariffs and empowered the regulator to shift to a cost-based market if evidence of market manipulation emerged.|$|E

50|$|In 1853, {{the colonial}} {{government}} passed the first Land Purchase Act which empowered it to purchase estates from absentee landowners and to resell the land at lower prices to local farmers.

25|$|When {{faced by}} a {{stronger}} force, the nomads could simply retreat {{deep into the}} steppe {{and wait for the}} invaders to leave. With no cities and little wealth other than the herds they took with them the nomads had nothing they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> defend. An example of this is given by Herodotus's detailed account of the futile Persian campaigns against the Scythians. The Scythians, like most nomad empires, had permanent settlements of various sizes, representing various degrees of civilisation. The vast fortified settlement of Kamenka on the Dnieper River, settled {{since the end of the}} 5th century BC, became the centre of the Scythian kingdom ruled by Ateas, who lost his life in a battle against Philip II of Macedon in 339 BC.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, {{the rebel}} forces were {{assembled}} {{and started to}} march on Yamaguchi. Yoshitaka remained convinced that the Sugi and Naitō would remain loyal, such that when the combined forces of Sue, Sugi and Naitō reached Yamaguchi, Yoshitaka could not mount an effective defence and had to flee the city, which the rebels set on fire. Yoshitaka and his close retainers assembled up to 2,000 men at the temple Hōsen-ji (法泉寺) in Ube, where they intended to make the mountain temple a stronghold {{in which they could}} fortify themselves; however, this plan evaporated in the night as the defenders deserted or defected to the enemy. Five thousand rebel troops surrounded Hōsen-ji the next day. The former regent Nijō Tadafusa went down the mountain to negotiate with the rebels, where he suggested Yoshitaka <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> retire in favour of his heir, but the rebels would not agree to this.|$|E
25|$|Women {{invariably}} grew {{their hair}} long and, {{as in other}} European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair {{was seen as a}} mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{patient was}} {{admitted}} to Queens General Hospital on November 17, 1935. Beds in the new hospital were reserved for patients who {{could not afford to}} pay; those who <b>could</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> use one of the private hospitals in the borough. On March 1, 1936, the Queensboro Hospital was merged into Queens General. At this time, Queensboro Hospital was renamed the Queensboro Pavilion for Communicable Diseases. Additional storm drains were installed around hospital and in the surrounding neighborhood in 1939. Around this time the Queensboro Pavilion was renovated. Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis was dedicated at the west end of the campus on January 28, 1941 by Mayor La Guardia, who stated that it was designed to be converted into a general hospital [...] "twenty-five years from now." ...|$|R

500|$|McKinley's most {{formidable}} rival {{for the nomination}} was former president Harrison, but in February 1896, Harrison declared he would not run for president a third time. [...] The eastern bosses were hostile to McKinley for failing {{to agree to the}} offer they had made to Hanna, and they decided to seek support for local favorite son candidates, believing that McKinley <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> bargain for support at the convention if he was denied a majority. [...] The bosses supported candidates such as Speaker Reed, Senator Quay and former vice president Levi P. Morton of New York. [...] Hanna spent much money and effort to undercut Reed in his native New England, and on [...] "McKinley Clubs" [...] in Pennsylvania to force Quay to spend time and money shoring up his base.|$|E
500|$|In April 1869 Sir Charles Mordaunt (1836–1897) learnt {{that his}} wife had had three {{separate}} affairs, and that her lovers included the heir to the throne. Although Mordaunt did not carry out his threat of citing the prince as co-respondent in the subsequent divorce case, Edward was subpoenaed to appear in court as a witness. Although Edward did not want to appear—and the queen wrote to the Lord Chancellor to see if this could be avoided—the law was such that the heir to the throne <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> appear if necessary. The prince appeared voluntarily and was in the witness box for seven minutes, during which time he denied having had a sexual relationship with Mordaunt's wife; he was not cross-examined. Edward's biographer, Colin Matthew, wrote that [...] "the hearing coincided with general criticism of the very different deportments of both the queen and the prince. The latter was several times booed in public". Despite the [...] "taboo on open criticism on [...] actions, an undercurrent of dissatisfaction existed" [...] with him and his actions. For Edward, although such affairs could be discussed between friends, scandal was to be avoided wherever possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} of Elizabeth I, Edward VI's successor after Mary I, was also inclined to severity. An Act passed in 1572 called for offenders to be burned through the ear {{for a first}} offence and that persistent beggars should be hanged. However, the Act also made the first clear distinction between the [...] "professional beggar" [...] and those unemployed {{through no fault of}} their own. Early in her reign, Elizabeth I also passed laws directly aimed at providing relief for the poor. For example, in 1563, her Act for the Relief of the Poor required all parish residents with ability to pay to contribute to poor collections. Those who “of his or their forward willful mind shall obstinately refuse to give weekly to the relief of the poor according to his or their abilities” could be bound over to justices of the peace and fined £10. Additionally, the 1572 Vagabonds Act further enabled Justices of the Peace to survey and register the impotent poor, determine how much money was required for their relief, then assess parish residents weekly for the appropriate amount. Her 1575 Poor Act required towns to create “a competent stock of wool, hemp, flax, iron and other stuff” for the poor to work on and houses of correction for those who refused to work where recalcitrant or careless workers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> work and punished accordingly.|$|E
50|$|After {{the fall}} of France, in late June, the Finnish {{ambassador}} in Stockholm heard from the diplomatic sources that Britain <b>could</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> negotiate peace with Germany.

5000|$|Opponents of this {{proposition}} portrayed it {{as a measure}} to [...] "silence the unions," [...] since private corporations would not be affected.

500|$|After {{failing to}} corner Tatsuzou and puzzled about Tatsuya's motives, the party finally persuade Tatsuya {{to reveal the}} truth. During the {{original}} confrontation with Nyarlathotep, Maya was killed, prompting {{the rest of the}} group (Tatsuya, Lisa, Jun and Eikichi) to reset events. Tatsuya refused to forget the events of the Other Side, creating a dangerous loophole: if all the other members of the original group <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> remember, the Other Side would be brought back into existence, destroying the present reality. After revealing this, Tatsuya is allowed to join the party in place of either Kei or Eriko. After returning to Sumaru proper, the city is raised by Tatsuzou as part of Torifune. Successfully infiltrating Torifune and defeating Tatsuzou and his [...] "god" [...] Gozen, the city returns to the surface, but the party are drawn into the Collective Unconscious by Nyarlathotep. Making their way into his domain, they discover Nyarlathotep has kidnapped Eikichi, Lisa and Jun in an effort to force their memories of the Other Side into reality. Defeating the Shadow Selves guarding them, the party saves each of them, then confront Nyarlathotep, who mocks Tatsuya for refusing to fulfill his part of Philemon's agreement. After Nyarlathotep is defeated, Tatsuya fulfills his side of the bargain, and after saying his final goodbyes separates his Other Side consciousness from his current self. With the city returned to normal and any specific memories of the Other Side gone, the party return to their normal lives.|$|E
500|$|Kronans {{displacement}} – the ship's weight {{calculated by}} how much water it displaced while floating – is not known precisely, {{since there are no}} exact records of the dimensions. By using contemporary documents describing the approximate measurements, it has been estimated at around 2,300tonnes. By its displacement in relation to the number and weight of guns, Kronan was over-gunned, though this was not uncommon for the era. European shipwrights had not been building three-deckers on a large scale before the 1650s; by the 1660s, designs were still quite experimental. Contemporary records show that English and French three-deckers tended to be rather unstable because they were built high, narrow and with too much artillery. Some English ships had to be reinforced with a [...] "girdle" [...] of built-up planking at the waterline to perform satisfactorily. In rough seas these ships <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> close the lowest row of gunports, depriving them of their heaviest and most effective guns. In these situations they were effectively just over-priced two-deckers. Kronans construction was not inherently flawed; the ship handled harsh weather conditions in 1675 and again only a week before capsizing, but she could be dangerous if handled poorly. Later, during the 18th century, ships with the same weight of guns had more tonnage to support their guns, usually weighing 3,000–5,000tonnes, which made them more stable. When Kronan was built, she was the third or fourth largest ship in the world, but as the trend moved towards ever greater ships, she was surpassed by other large warships. At the time Kronan sank, she was down to seventh place.|$|E

2500|$|The new Queens General Hospital {{campus was}} {{referred}} to as a [...] "miniature city" [...] due to its many buildings, and its self-sustaining facilities such as the power plant, a heating plant, and the laundry building. Among the then-modern medical innovations at the hospital were specialized X-ray equipment, radium for the treatment of cancer (a practice now obsolete), and an iron lung. The first patient was admitted to Queens General Hospital on November 17, 1935. Beds in the new hospital were reserved for patients who could not afford to pay; those who <b>could</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> use one of the private hospitals in the borough. On March 1, 1936, the Queensboro Hospital was merged into Queens General. At this time, Queensboro Hospital was renamed the Queensboro Pavilion for Communicable Diseases. By July 1936 the hospital was overcrowded, operating at 126.3 percent capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Sotomayor, {{joined by}} Justice Ginsburg, concur in the {{judgment}} only.

2500|$|Section 23 is a {{positive}} right. It {{has been found that}} section 23 thus guards against linguistic minorities being assimilated if their educational rights are denied {{for a long period of}} time, and this has led to section 24 of the Charter, which provides remedies for rights infringements, to be applied flexibly and creatively. [...] For example, in Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education) (2003), it was found that the government <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> report to a judge as construction on schools progressed, in order to ensure the schools were built within a sufficient amount of time.|$|E
2500|$|Air Canada said it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> cancel {{flights and}} strand {{thousands}} of passengers if Aveos {{is unable to}} complete repairs to several planes.

2500|$|In February 2014 BBC Director-General Tony Hall {{announced}} that cuts of £100 million {{would have to}} be made at the corporation; Hall stated that the corporation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> close one of its television services as a cost-savings measure. On 5 March 2014 Hall announced a proposal to convert BBC Three to an online-only service, with an almost 50% cut in its programming budget, and a larger emphasis on short form content due to the cut in funding. These changes formed part of a package of proposals from the BBC, including extending CBBC's hours, respending £30m on BBC One audiences for drama, and launching a one-hour timeshift channel of BBC One. There was notable backlash against the measures, with celebrities including Greg James, Matt Lucas and Jack Whitehall speaking out. A petition against the move on change.org has gathered over 300,000 signatures. However, there was some support from media commentators, and those who backed a [...] "slimmer" [...] BBC.|$|E
