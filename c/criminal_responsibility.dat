5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

From a thorough literature review encompassing both literature on crime and organised crime in particular, as well as literature on CSR practices and motivations, this paper establishes a motivational model for <b>criminal</b> social <b>responsibility.</b> The idea of <b>criminal</b> social <b>responsibility</b> is then investigated through a case study of the internationally recognised terrorist group Hamas.

25|$|There {{are various}} {{justifications}} for the exemption of the insane from <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a defence {{in a criminal}} trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies public policies in relation to <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> by applying a rationale of compassion, accepting that it is morally wrong to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that {{the definition of a}} crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A utilitarian and humanitarian approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.|$|E

In 1995, Brazil recognized its responsibilities for the deaths and established a Commission to provide compensation to the families of the victims. The Amnesty Law prevented the State to initiate the criminal proceedings related to the responsibilities of those involved in the disappearances, torture and killings. On December 2010, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights decided that Brazil is responsible for the enforced disappearances in the Araguaia's region and, following its previous jurisprudence, determined that the State initiate adequate investigation and criminal proceedings related to the facts that amount to crimes against the humanity.

The reality of the person in authority definition shift unquestionably deserves attention and a proper analysis.
