Two are Roman: a Nerva with S.C. on the reverse; and a Claudius Augustus, bearing by way of <b>countermark</b> a depressed oblong, of 20/100 by 14/100 (of inch), with a raised figure, erect, draped, and holding a sceptre or thyrsus. There is also a Constantius struck at Antioch.

It has the normal olive-branch, but without the terminating crescent (which, however, is not invariably present) on the proper right, whilst the left shows a poor imitation of the legend <Greek word> [...] (NH). The silvering of the reverse has been so corroded that no signs of the goddess's galeated head are visible. My friend, Mr. W. E.

50|$|<b>Countermarking</b> can be {{done for}} a variety of reasons. If the {{currency}} is reformed, existing coins may be rendered void. In this situation, coins already in circulation could be marked with the new value (according to the new currency system). The life span of existing coins could thus be extended, which might under some circumstances be a cheaper alternative to recalling the coins, melting them and striking replacements. Similarly, foreign coins could be marked as legal or accepted currency, thus allowing them to circulate in the area where they were <b>countermarked.</b> <b>Countermarking</b> can also be done for political reasons, i.e. a new state or régime demonstrating its authority by <b>countermarking</b> coins issued by the previous state.|$|R

5000|$|Some experts {{recommend}} {{not to use}} the term <b>countermark</b> and counterstamp as homonyms, but in different contexts. A counterstamp is applied by a die, and by machine to an existing coin, while a <b>countermark</b> is punched onto the coin, mostly by hand, using a punch and a hammer or a primitive hand-operated machine. Often countermarks are applied by private persons, {{as is the case with}} chops (often referred to as chopmarks), which were punched by money changers, bankers or shroffs onto foreign coins circulating in China in the 19th century. In contrast the use of counterstamps should be authorized by a local or national Government.|$|E

40|$|The {{absolute}} configuration of 2 -sec-butyl- 4, 5 -dihydrothiazole (DHT) in urine of adult male mice was determined through chiral trifluoroacetyl derivative capillary chromatography {{by comparing the}} retention time with synthetic standards. (S) -DHT was extracted from fresh urine, while neither (R) -DHT nor the racemization of (S) -DHT were detected. We can conclude that DHT in urine possesses the S configuration, although we cannot exclude a minor component in the R configuration. (S) -DHT was then characterized for binding to the complex of major urinary proteins of male mouse urine (MUP) and for a behavioral response, the competitive scent marking behavior (<b>countermarking).</b> The binding constant of (S) -DHT to MUP (determined by competitive displacement) was 8. 2 ± 0. 6 µM (mean ± SD) and was 10. 5 ± 0. 6 µM for R-DHT, thus excluding a relevant difference in binding. (S) -DHT modified <b>countermarking</b> in a peculiar way. Male mice were slow in <b>countermarking</b> urinary spots streaked 2 days earlier {{and on top of}} which (S) -DHT was added shortly before the test. This response was not seen when adding (S) -DHT to freshly streaked urinary spots or to clean paper. Unlike (S) -DHT, (R) -DHT prompted <b>countermarking</b> rather than delaying it. We can further conclude that (S) -DHT in male mouse urine is an aversive chemosignal for <b>countermarking...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{publication}} of {{the bulk of the}} silver coins by K. A. K.

According to Lönnqvist, the newly dated coins in the silver coin hoards give an earliest possible burial date for the coin hoards to 52/3-66 CE, based on an interpretation of a <b>countermark.</b> However, the archaeological and numismatic nature of the silver coin hoard burials may suggest that the coin hoards may have been buried in the early 3rd century CE.

40|$|SummaryDuring social interactions, an individual’s {{behavior}} is largely {{governed by the}} subset of signals emitted by others. Discrimination of “self” from “other” regulates the territorial urine <b>countermarking</b> behavior of mice. To identify the cues for this social discrimination and understand how they are interpreted, we designed an olfactory-dependent <b>countermarking</b> assay. We find major urinary proteins (MUPs) sufficient to elicit <b>countermarking,</b> and unlike other vomeronasal ligands that are detected by specifically tuned sensory neurons, MUPs are detected by a combinatorial strategy. A chemosensory signature of “self” that modulates {{behavior is}} developed via experience through exposure to a repertoire of MUPs. In contrast, aggression can be elicited by MUPs in an experience-independent but context-dependent manner. These findings reveal that individually emitted chemical cues can be interpreted based on their combinatorial permutation and relative ratios, and they can transmit both fixed and learned information to promote multiple behaviors...|$|R

40|$|To provide {{information}} about specific depositors, scent marks need to encode a stable signal of individual ownership. The highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) influences scents and contributes to the recognition of close kin and avoidance of inbreeding when MHC haplotypes are shared. MHC diversity between individuals has also been proposed as a primary source of scents used in individual recognition. We tested this {{in the context of}} scent owner recognition among male mice, which scent mark their territories and <b>countermark</b> scents from other males. We examined responses towards urine scent according to the scent owner's genetic difference to the territory owner (MHC, genetic background, both and neither) or genetic match to a familiar neighbour. While urine of a different genetic background from the subject always stimulated greater scent marking than own, regardless of familiarity, MHC-associated odours were neither necessary nor sufficient for scent owner recognition and failed to stimulate countermarking. Urine of a different MHC type to the subject stimulated increased investigation only when this matched both the MHC and genetic background of a familiar neighbour. We propose an associative model of scent owner recognition in which volatile scent profiles, contributed by both fixed genetic and varying non-genetic factors, are learnt in association with a stable involatile ownership signal provided by other highly polymorphic urine components...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) is widely {{assumed to be a}} primary determinant of individual-recognition scents in many vertebrates [1 – 6], but there has been no functional test of this in animals with normal levels of genetic variation. Mice have evolved another polygenic and highly polymorphic set of proteins for scent communication, the major urinary proteins (MUPs) [7 – 12], which may provide a more reliable identity signature ([13, 14] and A. L. Sherborne, M. D. T., S.  Paterson, F. J., W. E. R. O., P. Stockley, R. J. B., and J. L. H., unpublished data). We used female preference for males that <b>countermark</b> competitor male scents [15 – 17] to test the ability of wild-derived mice to recognize individual males differing in MHC or MUP type on a variable genetic background. Differences in MHC type were not used for individual recognition. Instead, recognition depended on a difference in MUP type, regardless of other genetic differences between individuals. Recognition also required scent contact, consistent with detection of involatile components through the vomeronasal system [6, 18]. Other differences in individual scent stimulated investigation but did not result in individual recognition. Contrary to untested assumptions of a vertebrate-wide mechanism based largely on MHC variation, mice use a species-specific [12] individual identity signature that can be recognized reliably despite the complex internal and external factors that influence scents [2]. Specific signals for genetic identity recognition in other species now need to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|Mammals scent {{mark their}} territories to {{advertise}} occupancy and ownership. However, signaling with scent for territorial defense {{can have a}} negative effect by advertising an individual’s presence and location to predators. In this study, we measured responses to a simulated territorial intrusion by conspecific adult male Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) either in the localized presence or in the absence of odor of a predator to test the hypothesis that the territorial defense of free-living beavers would be disrupted by the presence of predation risk in their natural environment. We predicted that beavers would significantly reduce their willing-ness to <b>countermark</b> intruder’s scent {{in the presence of the}} scent of predators (wolf [Canis lupus] and lynx [Lynx lynx]), com-pared with a control (no odor), as responses are in general stronger to predator scent marks than nonpredator scent. Therefore, we also predicted that the effects of nonpredatory mammal scent (neophobic control) (eland [Taurotragus oryx] and horse [Equus cabalus]) are to be expected somewhere in between the effects of the predator odor and a control. Our results suggest that both predator and nonpredator scents reduce beavers response to a simulated intruder’s scent mounds and therefore disrupt their territorial defense. However, predator scent had a stronger effect than nonpredator scent. Beavers may therefore be at great risk on territories with predators present because of the trade-off between predator avoidance and territorial defense. Our study demonstrates the potential of predation risk as a powerful agent of counterselection on olfactory signaling behavior.

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} go {{deep into}} {{behavioral}} olfactory strategies possibly used by ring-tailed lemurs in reproductive competition and to {{shed some light on}} the function of female scent marks deposited outside the breeding season. We followed 16 captive adults at the Pistoia Zoo (Tuscany, Italy) for > 1, 500 h from May 1997 to March 1999. Male direct and indirect olfactory investigation on females showed complementary distributions, the former peaking during the breeding and the latter during the birth season. Males are thus able to monitor female reproductive conditions throughout the whole year. During the birth season there was an increase of female genital marking. The olfactory advertisement probably guarantees that the extremely brief estrus does not remain unnoticed and allows male intrasexual competition a long period to operate. Male indirect olfactory monitoring and <b>countermarking</b> on female signals peaked during the birth season, which suggests that male intrasexual competition is achieved both by getting female chemical messages and by concealing them from other males. Female <b>countermarking</b> on other female genital marks peaked during the breeding season. High-ranking females had higher frequencies of <b>countermarking</b> than those of low-ranking females, which suggests that the advantage of obliterating scent signals of other females is greater than the disadvantage of revealing one’s own reproductive condition...|$|R
