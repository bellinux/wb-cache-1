5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is <b>cable</b> <b>operated,</b> acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{company can}} trace its history {{back to the}} Edinburgh Street Tramways Company of 1871, also {{involving}} at various times the tramway companies of Leith, Musselburgh and Edinburgh North. The City Council (Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department) took over operation of the tramways in 1919, at which time most of the system was <b>cable</b> <b>operated.</b> Electrification of the tram network was completed in 1923, but the first motor buses had arrived in 1919.|$|E

25|$|Braking was in {{the form}} of all-round discs, complemented with a Bosch 5.7 {{4-channel}} ABS system and electronic brake force distribution. The parking brake was a <b>cable</b> <b>operated</b> drum integral within the rear discs.|$|E
25|$|The {{cable car}} begins moving when a {{clamping}} device {{attached to the}} car, called a grip, applies pressure to ("grips") the moving cable. Conversely, the car is stopped by releasing pressure on the cable (with or without completely detaching) and applying the brakes. This gripping and releasing action may be manual, {{as was the case}} in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent <b>cable</b> <b>operated</b> people mover type systems. Gripping must be an even and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the passengers.|$|E
25|$|Edinburgh’s first trams were horse-drawn; {{they began}} {{operation}} on 6 November 1871, and ran between Haymarket and Leith. The following year saw {{the establishment of}} the circle route, which ran via Marchmont and Church Hill to the West End of Princes Street; the fare was one penny, or two pence for a return. In 1881 and 1882 steam engine hauled trams were tried out at Portobello, but they were unsuccessful. From 1888 <b>cable</b> <b>operated</b> trams were introduced: they were hauled by a wire rope in a conduit under the road surface. By {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, Edinburgh’s cable car system had increased to include 200 cars, servicing 25 route-miles of track.|$|E

2500|$|The {{change in}} the body style from the Mark B was both {{functional}} and aesthetic. The Mark C utilised the same 180° steering lock and worm and sector steering system that {{was seen in the}} prototype Commercial and the front wings allowed for ample clearance at full lock. They also addressed a demand from customers for a [...] "greater smoothness of line", and allowed a more robust location for the mounting of the front lights. Other improvements included rod and <b>cable</b> <b>operated</b> brakes on all three wheels, which [...] "appreciably shortens stopping distances." ...|$|E

50|$|South Atlantic 2 (SAT-2): SAT-2 was {{the first}} {{submarine}} cable to be constructed to enable commercial and private use of the Internet. It replaced the original SAT-1 <b>cable,</b> <b>operates</b> at 560 Mbit/s, and has been operational since 1993.|$|R
50|$|A cable landing station {{may or may}} not be required, {{depending}} on whether, for example, the submarine cable requires power in order to provide power to submarine repeaters or amplifiers. The voltages applied to the cables can be high - 3,000 to 4,000 volts for a typical trans-Atlantic telecommunications cable system, and 1,000 volts for a cross-channel telecommunications cable system. Submarine power <b>cables</b> can <b>operate</b> at many kilovolts: for example, the Fenno-Skan power <b>cable</b> <b>operates</b> at 400 kV DC.|$|R
2500|$|The AC-6 is a [...] {{wing span}} {{development}} of the [...] span AC-5M, with longer, higher aspect ratio wings terminating in winglets. Like the AC-5, the AC-6 wing employs a Wortmann FX 60-157 airfoil. Assembly of the wing to the fuselage uses a cam pin and incorporates automatic hookups for the ailerons and air brakes. The landing gear is a retractable [...] tire monowheel gear suspended with a pneumatic-hydraulic shock absorber. The wheel has a lever and <b>cable</b> <b>operated</b> drum brake. The cockpit can accommodate pilots up to [...] in height. The canopy provides 300° field of view and is jettisonable.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{examples}} {{were installed}} in Cornish mines {{by the end of}} the century, but these were usually of the single-rod type, which was perceived as safer in use. When <b>cable</b> <b>operated</b> winding gear became available the man engines continued in use, particularly in cases where the mineshaft was not truly vertical and winding engines drawing suspended cages could not be used; with the provision of a few well-placed rollers, and “fend offs” mounted on trunnions, the rods could reach the bottom of a shaft even at a substantial deviation from the vertical. Economics also played a part: the rods needed for pumping could be used for this extra function at little increased cost. Even when skips or kibbles were used in such shafts, (running on [...] "skipways") the tipping motion would make them impractical for carrying men.|$|E

40|$|Feeder {{circuit and}} branch circuit cable sizes are {{determined}} {{primarily on the}} basis of ampacity and voltage drop considerations. Rising costs of energy suggest a reassessment of currently used voltage drop criteria. Some degree of cable over sizing reduces cable resistance and <b>cable</b> <b>operating</b> temperature resulting in lower cable losses. A simplified method of analysis is presented which incorporates the effects of <b>cable</b> <b>operating</b> temperature. The analysis permits determination of cable loss savings for various choices of cable sizes. The method is extended to include cost of cable and expected future costs of energy so that an economical choice of cable size may be determined. An example is presented to illustrate the method. It is shown that a relatively simple modification of currently used ampacity tables permits determination of cable sizes taking into account today's energy economics...|$|R
