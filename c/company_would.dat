5|$|Command of A Company was {{temporarily}} {{handed over to}} the second-in-command, Captain Bob Murdoch. Present at Pakchon in November 1950, O'Dowd understood first-hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact. The challenge was to protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the Chinese occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company's position after they broke contact. The Australians would also have to clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces, {{while at the same time}} the evacuation of a large number of wounded and Chinese prisoners would hamper their movement. As such the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success. Consequently, the lead <b>company</b> <b>would</b> not move until mid-afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to break contact, while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves. Orders were delivered at 14:30. B <b>Company</b> <b>would</b> lead the withdrawal down the ridge line, carrying any wounded that still required evacuation, as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position. C <b>Company</b> <b>would</b> wait for the artillery to neutralise the Chinese on the old B Company position, before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company. A <b>Company</b> <b>would</b> then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company, in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break. Finally, D <b>Company</b> <b>would</b> withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw.|$|E

50|$|The {{reasoning}} {{provided in}} the essay was that certain companies first destroy forests and make paper out of them, which is in turn used to send bulk mail.
