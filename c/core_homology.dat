40|$|The cdc 19 (+) gene encodes an {{essential}} {{member of the}} MCM family of replication proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have examined the structure and function of the Cdc 19 p protein using molecular and genetic approaches. We find that overproduction of wild-type Cdc 19 p in wild-type cells has no effect, but cdc 19 -P 1 mutant cells do not tolerate elevated levels of other MCM proteins or overexpression of mutant forms of Cdc 19 p. We have found genetic interactions between cdc 19 (+) and genes encoding subunits of DNA polymerase {delta small} and the replication initiator cdc 18 (+). We have constructed a series of point mutations and sequence deletions throughout Cdc 19 p, which allow us to distinguish essential from nonessential regions of the protein. Not surprisingly, conserved residues in the MCM homology domain are required for protein function, but some residues outside the <b>core</b> <b>homology</b> domain are dispensable...|$|E
40|$|The Rhs {{family of}} {{composite}} genetic elements was assessed for variation among independent Escherichia coli {{strains of the}} ECOR reference collection. The location {{and content of the}} RhsA-B-C-F subfamily correlates highly with the clonal structure of the ECOR collection. This correlation exists at several levels: the presence of Rhs <b>core</b> <b>homology</b> in the strain, the location of the Rhs elements present, and the identity of the Rhs core-extensions associated with each element. A provocative finding was that an identical 1518 -bp segment, covering core-extension-b 1 and its associated downstream open reading frame, is present in two distinct clonal groups, but in association with different Rhs elements. The sequence identity of this segment when contrasted with the divergence of other chromosomal segments suggests that shuffling of Rhs core extensions has been a relatively recent variation. Nevertheless the copies of core-extension-b 1 were placed within the respective Rhs elements before the emergence of the clonal groups. In the course of this analysis, two new Rhs elements absent from E. coli K- 12 were discovered: RhsF, a fourth member of the RhsA-B-C-F subfamily, and RhsG, the prototype of a third Rhs subfamily...|$|E
50|$|Based on <b>core</b> {{sequence}} <b>homology,</b> it {{is believed}} that the RAG-1 protein evolved from a transposon of the Transib superfamily. Although the transposon origins of these genes are well-established, there is still no consensus on when the ancestral RAG1/2 became present in the vertebrate genome. Because agnathans (a class of jawless fish) lack a core RAG1 element, it was traditionally assumed that RAG1 invaded after the agnathan/gnathostome split 1001 to 590 million years ago (MYA). However, the core sequence of RAG1 has been identified in the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin), the amphioxi Branchiostoma floridae (Florida lancelet). Sequences with homology to RAG1 have also been identified in Lytechinus veriegatus (green sea urchin), Patiria minata (sea star), and the mollusk Aplysia californica.|$|R
40|$|Tight {{junctions}} are {{dynamic components}} of epithelial and endothelial cells that regulate the paracellular transport of ions, solutes, and immune cells. The assembly and permeability of these junctions {{is dependent on}} the zonula occludens (ZO) proteins, members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homolog (MAGUK) protein family, which are characterized by a <b>core</b> Src <b>homology</b> 3 (SH 3) -GUK module that coordinates multiple protein-protein interactions. The structure of the ZO- 1 SH 3 -GUK domain confirms that the interdependent folding of the SH 3 and GUK domains is a conserved feature of MAGUKs, but differences in the orientation of the GUK domains in three different MAGUKs reveal interdomain flexibility of the core unit. Using pull-down assays, we show that an effector loop, the U 6 region in ZO- 1, forms a novel intramolecular interaction with the core module. This interaction is divalent cation-dependent and overlaps with the binding site for the regulatory molecule calmodulin on the GUK domain. These findings provide insight into the previously observed ability of the U 6 region to regulate TJ assembly in vivo and the structural basis for the complex protein interactions of the MAGUK family...|$|R
40|$|MOTIVATION: The {{prediction}} of {{the regions of}} homology models that can be 'restrained by' or 'copied from' the basis structures is a vital step in correct model generation, because these regions are the models most accurate part. However, there is no ideal method for the identification of their limits. In most algorithms their length depends {{on the number of}} family members and definitions of secondary structure. RESULTS: The algorithm SCORE steps away from the conventional definitions of the core to identify from large numbers of basis structures those regions that can be considered structurally related to a target sequence. The use of phi, psi constraints to accurately pinpoint the regions that are conserved across a family and environmentally constrained substitution tables to extend these regions allows SCORE to rapidly (generally in under 1 s, an order of magnitude faster than methods such as MODELLER) identify and build the <b>core</b> of <b>homology</b> models from the alignments of the target sequence to the basis structures. The SCORE algorithm was used to build 114 model cores. In only two cases was the core size less than 50 % of the structure and all the cores built had an RMSD of 3. 7 A or less to the target structure...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{regulation of}} human immunoglobulin heavy chain expression, we have cloned DNA downstream {{from the two}} human C � genes, corresponding to the position in the mouse IgH cluster of a locus control region (LCR) that includes an enhancer which regulates isotype switching. Within 25 kb downstream of both the human immunoglobulin C� 1 and C� 2 genes we identified several segments of DNA which display B lymphoid–specific DNase I hypersensitivity as well as enhancer activity in transient transfections. The corresponding sequences downstream {{from each of the}} two human C � genes are nearly identical to each other. These enhancers are also homologous to three regions which lie in similar positions downstream from the murine C � gene and form the murine LCR. The strongest enhancers in both mouse and human have been designated HS 12. Within a 135 -bp <b>core</b> <b>homology</b> region, the human HS 12 enhancers are � 90 % identical to the murine homolog and include several motifs previously demonstrated to be important for function of the murine enhancer; additional segments of high sequence conservation suggest the possibility of previously unrecognized functional motifs. On the other hand, certain functional elements in the murine enhancer, including a B cell–specific activator protein site, {{do not appear to be}} conserved in human HS 12.

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{previously}} described cross-linking assay and half-FRT site substrates to examine the requirements for synapsis, strand exchange, and strand scission. The cross-linking assay showed that the minimum functional FRT site needed for synapsis contains two inverted FLP-binding elements surrounding an 8 -bp core. This indicates that four FLP molecules interact with four binding elements in a synaptic complex. The analysis using half-sites showed that the enzyme can catalyze efficient strand exchange between a half-site and the intact FRT site. The reaction occurred only if the half-site had at least 2 bp {{but no more than}} 4 bp of the adjoining core sequence. The exchange occurred exclusively at the regions of limited <b>core</b> <b>homology</b> between the respective half-site and the FRT site. The absence of strand exchange between an intact site and a half-site bearing regions of core nonhomology indicates that 1 bp of homology is not sufficient for the formation of stable recombinant structures. Qian et al. (X. -H. Qian, R. B. Inman, and M. M. Cox, J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 21779 - 21788, 1990) have recently shown that the FLP protein can catalyze the formation of dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric complexes with half-FRT sites. We show that only half-sites that contained at least 2 bp of adjacent core could form stable dimer products and be cleaved by the enzyme. Stable dimers were formed between a noncleavable half-site and a cleavable half-site, suggesting that only a single cleavage event is needed for the formation of the dimer...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} (FGF) 23 {{inhibits}} renal phosphate reabsorption by activating FGF receptor (FGFR) 1 c in a Klotho-dependent fashion. The phosphaturic activity of FGF 23 is abrogated by proteolytic cleavage at the RXXR motif that {{lies at the}} boundary between the FGF <b>core</b> <b>homology</b> domain and the 72 -residue-long C-terminal tail of FGF 23. Here, we show that the soluble ectodomains of FGFR 1 c and Klotho are sufficient to form a ternary complex with FGF 23 in vitro. The C-terminal tail of FGF 23 mediates binding of FGF 23 to a de novo site generated at the composite FGFR 1 c-Klotho interface. Consistent with this finding, the isolated 72 -residue-long C-terminal tail of FGF 23 impairs FGF 23 signaling by competing with full-length ligand for binding to the binary FGFR-Klotho complex. Injection of the FGF 23 C-terminal tail peptide into healthy rats inhibits renal phosphate excretion and induces hyperphosphatemia. In a mouse model of renal phosphate wasting attributable to high FGF 23, the FGF 23 C-terminal peptide reduces phosphate excretion, leading to an increase in serum phosphate concentration. Our data indicate that proteolytic cleavage at the RXXR motif abrogates FGF 23 activity by a dual mechanism: by removing the binding site for the binary FGFR-Klotho complex that resides in the C-terminal region of FGF 23, and by generating an endogenous inhibitor of FGF 23. We propose that peptides derived from the C-terminal tail of FGF 23 or peptidomimetics and small-molecule organomimetics of the C-terminal tail can be used as therapeutics to treat renal phosphate wasting...|$|E
40|$|Rap {{endonuclease}} targets recombinant joint molecules {{arising from}} phage lambda Red-mediated genetic exchange. Previous studies revealed that Rap nicks DNA at the branch point of synthetic Holliday junctions and other DNA structures with a branched component. However, on X junctions incorporating a three base-pair <b>core</b> of <b>homology</b> {{or with a}} fixed crossover, Rap {{failed to make the}} bilateral strand cleavages characteristic of a Holliday junction resolvase. Here, we demonstrate that Rap can mediate symmetrical resolution of 50 bp and chi Holliday structures containing larger homologous cores. On two different mobile 50 bp junctions Rap displays a weak preference for cleaving the phosphodiester backbone between 5 '-GC dinucleotides. The products of resolution on both large and small DNA substrates can be sealed by T 4 DNA ligase, confirming the formation of nicked duplexes. Rap protein was also assessed for its capacity to influence the global conformation of junctions in {{the presence or absence of}} magnesium ions. Unlike the known Holliday junction binding proteins, Rap does not affect the angle of duplex arms, implying an unorthodox mode of junction binding. The results demonstrate that Rap can function as a Holliday junction resolvase in addition to eliminating other branched structures that may arise during phage recombination...|$|R
40|$|The six conserved MCM {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for normal DNA replication. They share a central <b>core</b> of <b>homology</b> that contains sequences related to DNA-dependent and AAA(+) ATPases. It {{has been suggested that}} the MCMs form a replicative helicase because a hexameric subcomplex formed by MCM 4, - 6, and - 7 proteins has in vitro DNA helicase activity. To test whether ATPase and helicase activities are required for MCM protein function in vivo, we mutated conserved residues in the Walker A and Walker B motifs of MCM 4, - 6, and - 7 and determined that equivalent mutations in these three proteins have different in vivo effects in fission yeast. Some mutations reported to abolish the in vitro helicase activity of the mouse MCM 4 / 6 / 7 subcomplex do not affect the in vivo function of fission yeast MCM complex. Mutations of consensus CDK sites in Mcm 4 p and Mcm 7 p also have no phenotypic consequences. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses and in situ chromatin-binding experiments were used to study the ability of the mutant Mcm 4 ps to associate with the other MCMs, localize to the nucleus, and bind to chromatin. We conclude that the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis is different for different MCM subunits...|$|R

The KatF protein expressed in vitro migrates with an apparent size of 42 kDa. Comparison of the katF sequence to the sequence of rpoD, which encodes the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, revealed a 181 bp region with 65 % homology and a 38 bp segment that was 87 % homologous. A 62 amino acid region of the predicted KatF protein sequence {{was found to be}} 85 % homologous to the corresponding sequence of sigma 70, including a segment implicated in <b>core</b> polymerase binding. <b>Homology</b> was also observed with the heat shock regulatory protein encoded by htpR...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} identified a protein factor, PEBP 2 (polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein), {{in the nuclear}} extract from mouse NIH 3 T 3 cells which binds to the sequence motif, PEA 2, located within the polyomavirus enhancer A element. Upon cellular transformation with activated oncogene c-Ha-ras, this factor frequently undergoes drastic molecular modifications into an altered form having a considerably reduced molecular size. In this study, the altered form, PEBP 3, was purified to near homogeneity. The purified PEBP 3 comprised two sets of families of polypeptides, alpha- 1 to alpha- 4 and beta- 1 to beta- 2, which were 30 to 35 kilodaltons and 20 to 25 kilodaltons in size, respectively. Both kinds of polypeptides possessed DNA-binding activities with exactly the same sequence specificity. Individual alpha or beta polypeptides complexed with DNA showed faster gel mobilities than did PEBP 3. However, the original gel retardation pattern was restored when alpha and beta polypeptides were mixed together in any arbitrary pair. These observation along {{with the results of}} UV- and chemical-cross-linking studies led us to conclude that PEBP 3 is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits, potentially having a divalent DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, PEBP 3 was found to bind a second, hitherto-unnoticed site of the polyomavirus enhancer that is located within the B element and coincides with the sequence previously known as the simian virus 40 enhancer <b>core</b> <b>homology.</b> From comparison of this and the original binding sites, the consensus sequence for PEBP 3 was defined to be PuACCPuCA. These findings provided new insights into the biological significance of PEBP 3 and PEBP 2...|$|E
40|$|Thrombospondin (TS) is a modular {{adhesive}} glycoprotein {{that contains}} three domains previously {{implicated in the}} attachment of cells to TS. These include the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain, the carboxy terminal cell or platelet-binding domain, and an RGDA sequence of TS. We have characterized a mAb against human TS, designated A 4. 1, which inhibits the attachment of human melanoma cells (G 361) to TS. The epitope for A 4. 1 lies within the amino terminal half of the central stalklike region of TS which is distinct from the three known cell attachment sites. This region of TS is recovered in a 50 -kD peptide after chymotryptic digestion of TS in EDTA. It contains the procollagen- like domain of TS as well as three type I repeats of a 60 -residue segment homologous to two malarial proteins and the complement proteins properdin, and factors C 6 through C 9. The purified chymotryptic fragment is an effective attachment factor for G 361 cells. A 4. 1 blocks adhesion to the 50 -kD domain, as do some sulfated glycoconjugates. RGD (and RGE) peptides and mAbs against other domains of TS are not inhibitory. Peptides (19 mers) based on the <b>core</b> <b>homology</b> sequence of the three type I repeats of TS are potent attachment factors for these cells, and this adhesion is also inhibited by sulfated glycoconjugates. A polyclonal antibody raised against one of these peptides inhibits adhesion of G 361 cells to the peptides, to the 50 -kD fragment and to intact TS. Thus a new cell-adhesion site has been identified in TS whose sequence {{is very similar to}} the site identified in region II of the circumsporozoite protein of malaria parasites (Rich, K. A., F. W.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequences of}} the RhsB and RhsC elements of Escherichia coli K- 12 have been determined. These sequence data reveal a new repeated sequence, called H-rpt (Hinc repeat), which {{is distinct from}} the Rhs core repetition that is found in all five Rhs elements. H-rpt is found in RhsB, RhsC, and RhsE. Characterization of H-rpt supports {{the view that the}} Rhs elements are composite structures assembled from components with very different evolutionary histories and that their incorporation into the E. coli genome is relatively recent. In each case, H-rpt is found downstream from the Rhs core and is separated from the core by a segment of DNA that is unique to the individual element. The H-rpt's of RhsB and RhsE are very similar, diverging by only 2. 1 %. They are 1, 291 bp in length, and each contains an 1, 134 -bp open reading frame (ORF). RhsC has three tandem copies of H-rpt, all of which appear defective in that they are large deletions and/or have the reading frame interrupted. Features of H-rpt are analogous to features typical of insertion sequences; however, no associated transposition activity has been detected. A 291 -bp fragment of H-rpt is found near min 5 of the E. coli K- 12 map and is not associated with any Rhs <b>core</b> <b>homology.</b> The complete core sequences of RhsB and RhsC have been compared with that of RhsA. As anticipated, the three core sequences are closely related, all having identical lengths of 3, 714 bp each. Like RhsA, the RhsB and RhsC cores constitute single ORFs that begin with the first core base. In each case, the core ORF extends beyond the core into the unique sequence. Of the three cores, RhsB and RhsA are the most similar, showing only 0. 9 % sequence divergence, while RhsB and RhsC are the least similar, diverging by 2. 9 %. All three cores conserve the 28 repetitions of a peptide motif noted originally for RhsA. A secondary structure is proposed for this motif, and the possibility of its having an extracellular binding function is discussed. RhsB contains one additional unique ORF, and RhsC contains two additional unique ORFs. One of these ORFs includes a signal peptide that is functional when fused to TnphoA...|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} (Nav) produce sodium currents {{that underlie}} the initiation and propagation of action potentials in nerve and muscle cells. Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) bind to the intracellular C-terminal region of the Nav α subunit to modulate fast inactivation of the channel. In this study we solved the crystal structure of a 149 -residue-long fragment of human FHF 2 A which unveils the structural features of the <b>homology</b> <b>core</b> domain of all 10 human FHF isoforms. Through analysis of crystal packing contacts and site-directed mutagenesis experiments we identified a conserved surface on the FHF core domain that mediates channel binding in vitro and in vivo. Mutations at this channel binding surface impaired the ability of FHFs to co-localize with Navs at the axon initial segment of hippocampal neurons. The mutations also disabled FHF modulation of voltage-dependent fast inactivation of sodium channels in neuronal cells. Based on our data, we propose that FHFs constitute auxiliary subunits for Navs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains are {{critically}} {{involved in}} cellular signaling and diseases. PTB domains are categorized into three distinct structural classes namely IRS-like, Shc-like and Dab-like. All PTB domains {{consist of a}} <b>core</b> pleckstrin <b>homology</b> (PH) domain with additional structural elements in Shc and Dab groups. The core PH fold of the PTB domain contains a seven stranded b-sheet and a long C-terminal helix. Principal Findings: In this work, the PTB domain of Dok 1 protein has been characterized, by use of NMR spectroscopy, in solutions containing sub-denaturing and denaturing concentrations of urea. We find that the Dok 1 PTB domain displays, at sub-denaturing concentrations of urea, alternate conformational states for residues located in the C-terminal helix and in the b 5 strand of the b-sheet region. The b 5 strand of PTB domain {{has been found to}} be experiencing significant chemical shift perturbations in the presence of urea. Notably, many of these residues in the helix and in the b 5 strand are also involved in ligand binding. Structural and dynamical analyses at 7 M urea showed that the PTB domain is unfolded with islands of motionally restricted regions in the polypeptide chain. Further, the C-terminal helix appears to be persisted in the unfolded state of the PTB domain. By contrast, residues encompassing b-sheets, loops, and the short N-terminal helix lack any preferred secondary structures. Moreover, these residues demonstrated an intimate contact with the denaturant. Significance: This study implicates existence of alternate conformational states around the ligand binding pocket of the PT...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a {{major health}} problem with a {{prevalence}} of 1 % in the United States population, and {{a significant percentage of}} infected patients progress to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Interferon therapy has demonstrated that the immune system can be modulated to alter the acute course of the disease, but long-term treatments remain elusive. Prevention of hepatitis C infection is therefore an important strategy to mitigate the impact of this disease. Initial attempts at vaccination have focused on recombinant envelope vaccines, which have shown an ability to protect against very low titre challenges of HCV in chimps. The need for vaccines capable of protecting against higher titre challenges has led to the search for alternative vaccine strategies. The most highly conserved structural protein in the HCV genome is the core protein, and vaccine strategies targeting the core protein have been proposed to increase vaccine efficacy. The variability of HCV core sequences and genotypes in the Ann Arbor patient population are not known, and the present study was undertaken to assess the theoretical feasibility of developing a HCV core vaccine by excluding promiscuous core (C) gene variability as a mechanism of vaccine failure. Results of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis from 13 of 14 patients studied reveal a 93 % nucleotide and 96. 4 % amino acid <b>core</b> sequence <b>homology</b> in the C gene regions studied. Genotype analysis revealed four of 14 to be type 1 a and nine of 14 to be type 1 b with one infection not being sufficiently characterized to determine genotype.

40|$|RNA {{replication}} of all positive-strand RNA viruses is {{closely associated with}} intracellular membranes. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA replication occurs on the perinuclear region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), both in its natural plant host and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The only viral component in the BMV RNA replication complex that localizes independently to the ER is 1 a, a multifunctional protein with an N-terminal RNA capping domain and a C-terminal helicase-like domain. The other viral replication components, the RNA polymerase-like protein 2 a and the RNA template, depend on 1 a for recruitment to the ER. We show here that, in membrane extracts, 1 a is fully susceptible to proteolytic digestion {{in the absence of}} detergent and thus, a finding consistent with its roles in RNA replication, is wholly or predominantly on the cytoplasmic face of the ER with no detectable lumenal protrusions. Nevertheless, 1 a association with membranes is resistant to high-salt and high-pH treatments that release most peripheral membrane proteins. Membrane flotation gradient analysis of 1 a deletion variants and 1 a segments fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that sequences in the N-terminal RNA capping module of 1 a mediate membrane association. In particular, a region C-terminal to the <b>core</b> methyltransferase <b>homology</b> was sufficient for high-affinity ER membrane association. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that even though these determinants mediate ER localization, they fail to localize GFP to the narrow region of the perinuclear ER, where full-length 1 a normally resides. Instead, they mediate a more globular or convoluted distribution of ER markers. Thus, additional sequences in 1 a that are distinct from the primary membrane association determinants contribute to 1 a's normal subcellular distribution, possibly through effects on 1 a conformation, orientation, or multimerization on the membrane...|$|R

40|$|Members of the photolyase/cryptochrome {{family are}} flavoproteins that share an {{extraordinary}} conserved <b>core</b> structure (photolyase <b>homology</b> region, PHR), but {{the presence of}} a carboxy-terminal extension is limited to the cryptochromes. Photolyases are DNA-repair enzymes that remove UV-light-induced lesions. Cryptochromes of plants and Drosophila act as circadian photoreceptors, involved in light entrainment of the biological clock. Using knockout mouse models, mammalian cryptochromes (mCRY 1 and mCRY 2) were identified as essential components of the clock machinery. Within the mammalian transcription- translation feedback loop generating rhythmic gene expression, mCRYs potently inhibit the transcription activity of the CLOCK/BMAL 1 heterodimer and protect mPER 2 from 26 S-protesome-mediated degradation. By analyzing a set of mutant mCRY 1 proteins and photolyase/mCRY 1 chimeric proteins, we found that the carboxyl terminus has a determinant role in mCRY 1 function by harboring distinguished domains involved in nuclear import and interactions with other clock proteins. Moreover, the carboxyl terminus must cross-talk with the PHR to establish full transcription repression capacity in mCRY 1. We propose that the presence of the carboxyl terminus in cryptochromes, which varies in sequence composition among mammalian, Drosophila, and plant CRYs, is critical for their different functions and possibly contributed to shape the different architecture and biochemistry of the clock machineries in these organisms...|$|R

Inhibitor studies indicated that apical cell expansion in P. patens is blocked by synthetic AGP binding b-glucosyl Yariv reagent (bGlcYR). The anti-(1 ! 5) -a-L-arabinan monoclonal antibody LM 6 binds to some AGPs in P. patens, to all plasma membranes, and to the cell wall surface at the most apical region of growing protonemal filaments. Moreover, LM 6 labeling of cell walls at the tips of apical cells of P. patens was abolished {{in the presence of}} bGlcYR, sug-gesting that the localized movement of AGPs from the plasma membrane to the cell wall is a component of the mechanism of tip growth.

An open reading frame of 1905 bases encoding a putative protein of 635 amino acid residues was isolated. A substantial part of the protein shares a significant degree of homology with the sequence of other known members of the IB topoisomerase family, in a highly conserved region of these enzymes termed the <b>core</b> domain.

In fact, the protein expressed in Escherichia coli did not show any relaxation activity in vitro {{and was unable to}} complement a mutant deficient in topoisomerase I activity. The results of Southern blot experiments strongly suggested that the cloned gene was not a pseudogene. Northern analysis revealed that the gene was transcribed in its full length and also excluded the possibility that some form of splicing is necessary to produce a mature messenger. Furthermore, our results indicate that the gene is preferentially expressed in actively growing L. donovani promastigotes and that it is also expressed in other kinetoplastid parasites...|$|R
40|$|Solution {{scattering}} {{studies were}} performed on a ligand-binding domain (S 1 S 2) of a glutamate receptor ion channel (GluR) in order to study GluR-binding and signal-transduction mechanisms. The core of the ligand-binding domain is homologous to prokaryotic periplasmic binding proteins (PBP), whose binding mechanism involves a dramatic cleft closure: the Venus flytrap. Several models of GluR function have proposed that a similar cleft closure is induced by agonist binding. We have directly tested this putative functional homology by measuring the radius of gyration of S 1 S 2 in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of agonists. In contrast to the PBP, S 1 S 2 shows no reduction in radius of gyration upon agonist binding, excluding a comparably large conformational change. Furthermore, we determined an ab initio molecular envelope for our S 1 S 2 construct, which also contains the peptides that connect the PBP <b>homology</b> <b>core</b> to the three transmembrane domains and to an N-terminal domain. By fitting an atomic model of the ligand-binding domain core to the envelope of our extended construct, {{we were able to}} establish the likely position of these connecting peptides.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of scaled skin of reptiles {{is one of}} their main features that distinguish them from the other amniotes, birds and mammals. The different scale patterns observed in extant reptiles result from a long evolutive history that allowed each species to adapt to its specific environment. The present review deals with comparative aspects of epidermal keratinization in reptiles, chelonians (turtles and tortoises), lepidosaurian (lizards, snakes, sphenodontids), archosaurians (crocodilians). Initially the morphology and cytology of reptilian scales is outlined to show the diversity in the epidermis among different groups. The structural proteins (alpha-keratins and associated proteins), and enzymes utilized to form the corneous layer of the epidermis are presented. Aside cytokeratins (alpha-keratins), used for making the cytoskeleton, reptilian alpha-keratinocytes produce interkeratin (matrix) and corneous cell envelope proteins. Keratin bundles and degraded cell organelles constitute most of the corneous material of alpha-keratinocytes. Matrix, histidine-rich and sulfur-rich proteins are produced in the soft epidermis and accumulated in the cornified cell envelope. Main emphasis is given to the composition and to the evolution of the hard keratins (beta-keratins). Beta-keratins constitute the hard corneous material of scales. These small proteins are synthesized in beta-keratinocytes and are accumulated into small packets that rapidly merge into a compact corneous material and form densely cornified layers. Beta-keratins are smaller proteins (8 - 20 kDa) in comparison to alpha-keratins (40 - 70 kDa), and this size may determine their dense packing in corneocytes. Both glycine-sulfur-rich and glycine-proline-rich proteins have been so far sequenced in the corneous material of scales in few reptilian species. The latter keratins possess C- and N-amino terminal amino acid regions with sequence homology with those of mammalian hard keratins. Also, reptilian beta-keratins possess a central <b>core</b> with <b>homology</b> with avian scale/feather keratins. Multiple genes code for these proteins and their discovery and sequentiation is presently an active field of research. These initial findings however suggest that ancient reptiles already possessed some common genes that have later diversified to produce the specific keratin-associated proteins in their descendants: extant reptiles, birds and mammals. The evolution of these small proteins in lepidosaurians, chelonians and archosaurians represent the next step to understand the evolution of cornification in reptiles and derived amniotes (birds and mammals) ...|$|R
40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus {{that is the}} causative {{agent of}} {{varicella}} (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Current treatments include nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir and its derivatives. These drugs inhibit viral replication by targeting the viral DNA polymerase. However, there are numerous additional, potential virus specific targets within the virus replication process. Recently, van Zeijl et al. and Visalli et al. described novel compounds that prevent the cleavage and packaging of viral genomic DNA into the provirus capsid (encapsidation) by targeting the capsid portal proteins. The studies performed in this thesis were designed to investigate potential interacting regions of the VZV portal (pORF 54) and scaffold (pORF 33. 5) proteins. Little {{is known about the}} interaction of portal and scaffold proteins in VZV, however the interaction of these two proteins has been studied in a close relative, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1). A defined region of the HSV- 1 scaffold protein (pORF 26. 5) that interacts with the portal protein (pUL 6) was identified by Singer et al. These previous studies showed that a 12 amino acid stretch of the HSV- 1 scaffold protein was essential for binding to the HSV- 1 portal protein. This data was used to design a VZV scaffold peptide to use as a target in a procedure called “phage display panning”. Individual phage that showed affinity through a series of panning steps were amplified in E. coli and the DNA sequenced to determine the unique 12 -mer amino acid stretch expressed by each individual phage isolate. Sequences were scored based on homology of the 12 -mer peptides to pORF 54. Several phage were isolated at random from the original, un-panned phage library and used as controls (control). Four phage from the panning experiments gave homology scores greater than the control phage. The region of homology for the four peptide sequences was examined {{in the context of the}} portal structure and location within the capsid. Additionally, phage sequences were compared to each other to identify trends in the amino acids sequences. This analysis was used to identify amino acids that might have increased affinity for one or more regions of pORF 54. A <b>core</b> region of <b>homology</b> was identified within the phage sequences that included large polar amino acids. Many of the sequences contained three or more consecutive large polar amino acids histidine (H), arginine (K), and lysine (K). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of polypeptides for misfolding and aggregation {{is linked to}} a numerious of still uncurable diseases like the Alzheimer's disease or type II diabetes. Protein aggregation also complicates the production, storage and therapeutic application of protein-based therapeutic agents. A prominent representative of such biomolecules is insulin, {{one of the most}} used biopharmaceutical product. The protein aggregation process can be blocked by compounds that can interact with polypeptides prone for misfolding by stabilizing their conformation. Our group has already designed and investigated an inhibitor against the cytotoxic self-association and fibrilization of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Cytotoxic aggregates of IAPP destroy the pancreatic b-cell and suppress the insulin production, which is associated with the disease pattern of type II diabetes. The designed inhibitor is an IAPP analog that mimics a nonamyloidogenic and noncytotoxic IAPP conformation. The resctricted flexibility of the IAPP analog IAPP-GI was obtained by two N-methyl rests in one fo the IAPP core sequences (IAPP(22 - 27) : NFGAIL). Studies suggest that this sequence is important for the intermolecular IAPP self-recognition and self-assocation. Other IAPP analogs with N-methyl rests on different positions in the core sequence (22 - 27) had in comparison to IAPP-GI a weaker inhibitory effect on the IAPP-aggregation. In this study first of all the self- and hetero-association of IAPP and the IAPP analogs were investigated. The results of this examination indicate a self-assembly of IAPP and the analogs despite of the N-methylation in a nanomolar range. All analogs have a high affinity to IAPP. These data suggest that other IAPP sequences like (10 - 18) und (30 - 37) are taking part in the self-association of the analogs and in the interaction with IAPP. Based on recently presented clinical and pathopysiological references, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes might be linked to each other and the observation of an amyloid <b>core</b> sequence <b>homology</b> of the amyloidogenic peptids leading to this two protein misfolding diseases, we next examined the effect of the IAPP analogs on the cytotoxic aggregation of the b-amyloid peptide Ab(1 - 40). In this study the IAPP analogs, especially IAPP-GI, have been shown to bind with high affinity to Ab(1 - 40) and to block its self-assembly to cytotoxic species with low nanomolar activity. Additionally these results indicate an interaction of these two amyloidogenic peptides Ab(1 - 40) and IAPP, a formation of noncytotoxic hetero-complexes and a partially cross-attenuation of their aggregation. The formed Ab(1 - 40) /IAPP hetero-complexes have been proved to be instable. In contrast the Ab(1 - 40) /IAPP-GI hetero-complexes could not form a b-sheet structure leading to a cytotoxic self-association and fibrilization of Ab(1 - 40). IAPP has been shown to have also a high degree of sequence similarity with insulin. Moreover it was recently reported that insulin can block the IAPP fibrilization. Due to this references we next investigeted if IAPP and the analogs can influence the fibrilization of Insulin. Our studies showed that IAPP-GI can not only effect the insulin fibrilization, it can also attenuate its cytotoxic oligomerisation without to influence the biological activity of the insulin molecules. Freshly solubilized IAPP and the IAPP analogs could olny partialy suppress the insulin aggregation. Our findings indicate a conformationally specificity of the insulin/IAPP and insulin/IAPP analogs interaction, which leads to an inhibition of the insulin aggregation. Other studies of our group had already characterized IAPP-GI as a high effective IAPP-Inhibitor and IAPP receptor agonist. In summary, we have shown in this study, that IAPP-GI can also interact with a high affinity with Ab(1 - 40) and insulin. Moreover these and results of other studies have shown that IAPP-GI can block the aggregaton to cytotoxic oligomers and fibrills of both peptides...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{understand}} better the serotonin- 2 A (5 -HT 2 A) receptor were concentrated on the characterization of the structural and chemical features of the agonist binding site. Design and synthesis of conformationally-restricted analogues of known 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonists, coupled with a homology-based model of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor that was developed during these studies, has enabled a more detailed understanding of the site. Conformationally-restricted analogues 6 and 7, designed to incorporate in their structure an oxygen-pattern that is atypical of hallucinogenic arylalkylamines, were synthesized and found to have Ki values for [125 I]-DOI-labeled 5 -HT 2 A cloned rat receptors of 6. 3 and 1. 8 nM, respectively. Next, a series of substituted tetrahydronaphthofurans was designed and synthesized {{in an attempt to}} constrain the 2 -aminoalkyl substituent of arylalkylamines to an anti-periplanar orientation, hypothesized to be the physiologically relevant conformer for binding to the 5 -HT 2 A receptor. These compounds were tested using in vitro assays, for their affinity and efficacy at selected 5 -HT receptors. The benzofuran-containing analogues, 11 and 14, had significantly higher affinity for the serotonin receptors than the benzodihydrofuran-containing compounds, 9, 10, 12 and 13. The compound (8 -bromo- 6 -methoxy- 4, 5 -dihydro- 3 H-naphtho[1, 8 - bc]furan- 5 -yl) amino-methane, 14, had Ki values for [125 I]-DOI-labeled 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 C cloned rat receptors of 2. 6 and 1. 1 nM, respectively. Despite their high affinity, the compounds of this naphthofuran series were found to lack full intrinsic activity at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor. ^ A 5 -HT 2 A receptor homology model was produced utilizing an in silico activated form of the rhodopsin protein as the structural <b>core</b> for the <b>homology</b> model. The computer model has offered distinct binding modes for ergolines, tryptamines, and arylalkylamines, the three main drug families that affect this receptor, that are compatible with the known SARs of these drug classes. A conformationally-restricted analogue of mescaline was designed based on analysis of the computer model. The resulting compound 17, (2, 3 -dihydro- 4, 5, 6 -trimethoxy- 1 H-inden- 1 -yl) aminomethane, was found to possess 3 -fold higher affinity and equal efficacy at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor when compared to the parent compound, mescaline. This compound, 17, was also tested in a drug discrimination paradigm and found to substitute fully for LSD, thus validating the predictive power of the receptor model. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) {{is a key}} multi-enzyme assembly {{linking the}} glycolytic pathway to the TCA cycle via the specific conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and, as such, {{is responsible for the}} maintenance of glucose homeostasis in humans. PDC comprises a central pentagonal dodecahedral core of 60 dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E 2) and 12 E 3 binding protein (E 3 BP) subunits. Presently, two conflicting models of PDC (E 2 +E 3 BP) core organisation exist: the ‘addition’ (60 + 12) and ‘substitution’ (48 + 12) models. In addition to its catalytic role, the multi-domain E 2 /E 3 BP core provides the structural framework to which 30 pyruvate decarboxylase (E 1) heterotetramers and 6 - 12 dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E 3) homodimers are proposed to bind at maximal occupancy. The formation of specific E 2 :E 1 and E 3 BP:E 3 subcomplexes are characteristic of eukaryotic PDCs and are critical for normal complex function. Despite the availability of limited structural data, the exact subunit organisation and mechanism of operation of the mammalian E 2 /E 3 BP core remains unknown. This thesis describes the large-scale purification of tagged, recombinant human PDC cores, full-length rE 2 and rE 2 /E 3 BP, truncated E 2 /E 3 BP, peripheral rE 3 enzyme as well as native E 2 /E 3 BP core (bE 2 /E 3 BP) purified from bovine heart. The ability to purify large amounts of pure protein has enabled the characterisation of the individual cores as well as the E 2 /E 3 BP:E 3 complex using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. Full-length rE 2 /E 3 BP, rE 2, bE 2 /E 3 BP, truncated E 2 /E 3 BP (tLi 19 /tLi 30) and rE 2 /E 3 BP:E 3 were analysed in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). While AUC of the cores supported the substitution model of core organisation, the stoichiometry of interaction was determined to be 2 : 1 (rE 2 /E 3 BP:E 3). This was further complemented by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS), implying the possible existence of a network of E 3 ‘cross-bridges’ linking pairs of E 3 BP molecules {{across the surface of the}} E 2 core assembly. Low resolution solution structures obtained for rE 2 /E 3 BP, bE 2 /E 3 BP and tLi 19 /tLi 30 by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and SANS revealed the presence of icosahedral cores with open pentagonal faces favouring the substitution model of core organisation. These solution structures also indicated high structural similarity between the recombinant and native cores, as well as with the crystal structure obtained previously for the truncated bacterial E 2 <b>core.</b> In addition, <b>homology</b> modelling and superimpositions of high- and low-resolution structures of the core revealed conservation of the overall pentagonal dodecahedral morphology despite evolutionary diversity. Evidence for the substitution model of core organisation was further substantiated by negative stain EM of the recombinant and bovine E 2 /E 3 BP cores. SANS stoichiometry data indicated the binding of 10 E 3 dimers per E 2 /E 3 BP core. Although this could correspond to approximately 1 : 1 stoichiometry between E 2 /E 3 BP:E 3, subsequent radiolabelling studies suggested possible variation in core subunit composition between the native and recombinant E 2 /E 3 BP cores. Therefore, as opposed to the 48 E 2 + 12 E 3 BP substitution model based on AUC and SAXS studies with the recombinant E 2 /E 3 BP core, rE 2 /E 3 BP cores produced in this study indicated a higher level of incorporation of E 3 BPs with a maximum core composition of 40 E 2 + 20 E 3 BP. On the basis of this new finding we have proposed the ‘variable E 3 BP substitution model’, wherein the number of E 3 BPs within the core can range from 0 to a maximum of 20, thus resulting in variable populations of E 2 /E 3 BP cores. Despite this core variability, the highly controlled regulatory mechanisms in vivo may bias the core composition towards an average of 48 E 2 + 12 E 3 BP. However, as the over-expression of the recombinant E 2 /E 3 BP core in our study is not as tightly regulated as in vivo, higher number of E 3 BPs (> 12) is observed to be integrated into the core. This new level of architectural complexity and variable subunit composition in mammalian PDC core organisation is likely to have important implications for the catalytic mechanism, overall complex efficiency and tissue-specific regulation by the intrinsic PDC kinases (PDKs) in normal and disease states. The E 2 cores of the PDC family are known to be highly flexible, exhibiting inherent size variability reflective of the ‘breathing’ of the core. Integration of E 3 BP into the E 2 core assembly would then be expected to have significant consequences for the structural assembly, affecting the ‘breathing’ and in turn the function and regulation of the complex. Unfolding studies to assess core stability via circular dichroism (CD) and tryptophan fluorescence revealed lower stability of the rE 2 /E 3 BP core as compared to cores composed exclusively of rE 2 subunits, thus implying the contribution of E 3 BP towards core destabilisation. In addition, crosslinking studies indicated weak dimerisation of rE 3 BP, which may be a key factor promoting core destabilisation. The lower stability of the E 2 /E 3 BP core may be of benefit in mammals where sophisticated fine tuning is required to obtain cores with optimal catalytic and regulatory efficiencies. SAXS solution structures of E 2 /E 3 BP cores obtained were unable to locate the exact positions of E 3 BP within the core. However, SANS in combination with contrast matching of selectively deuterated components as well as cryo-EM, EM tomography and single molecule studies could be used in future for determination of the exact locations of E 3 BP, and validating the importance of E 2 /E 3 BP core organisation and subunit composition for overall PDC function and regulation.
