Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was {{positive about the}} episode, calling it [...] "probably the strongest all-round script we've had this year, <b>chock</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> good lines". He added, [...] "The concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised, particularly the bizarre sight of them laying siege to Amy and Rory's cottage with household and gardening implements". He concluded that it [...] "was one of those stories that you would only find in Doctor Who, and shows once again that the series can provide genuine thought-provoking, interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills".|$|E

Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters noted that, though he has to deal mainly with [...] "moral questions, Flame confronts an emotional complication—in the conventional form of a woman". Abeel argued that [...] "For beneath his stony exterior, it's Flame's romantic soul that will prove his worst enemy. This masterful film is at once a portrait of wartime heroism and a poignant journey into a boy's secret heart." ...|$|E

Clubs Alex McLevy graded the episode a 'B', praising the episode for focusing the season's overarching storyline and for the emotional reunions between Johnson and the core S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He was positive of the ongoing Ghost Rider storyline and the episode's action sequences, but thought Aida's story was [...] "the much more intriguing long-term story ... it offers the unusual opportunity for Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. to dig into some juicy subtext and weighty concepts".|$|E

Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your feet up on the table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it was a terrific episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was {{a good example of how}} far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology. Now, Fringe is a seamless whole".|$|E

[...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Is it as good as her epic 'Bad Romance' video? Sadly, I don't think so. But it's better than anything else out there." [...] Jennifer Cady of the website E! Online praised Beyoncé's [...] "always fierce" [...] look during the video.

500|$|Song of Innocence was {{released}} in October 1968 by Capitol Records. It received radio exposure on both AM and FM stations with songs such as the title track and [...] "Holy Thursday", which became the album's best-known recording. The album was not a commercial success and only sold 75,000 copies by October 1969. In a contemporary review, Billboard magazine called it [...] "an aesthetic mix of music and philosophy... <b>chock</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> mysticism, creativity, and change", believing that Axelrod's idyllic music would be interesting enough to impact the record charts. Writing for Gramophone, Alasdair Clayre said Axelrod's impressions of Blake [...] "reveal a depth of imagination and skill warranting attention {{beyond the confines of}} pop music", proving he could compose innovatively for a large orchestra, which Clayre felt comprised the best of California's studio musicians on the album. He questioned whether the [...] "occasional guitar gobbling" [...] reflected Axelrod's genuine ideas or [...] "an obligatory concession to contemporary sound" [...] on an otherwise compelling record. The magazine's Nigel Hunter found the record's songs to be [...] "of absorbing power and depth", but complained of the electric guitar parts. Nat Freedland from Entertainment World was more critical, accusing Axelrod of [...] "indulging himself here to little avail". Stereo Review magazine's Paul Kresh panned Song of Innocence as a pretentious, inadequate album dependent on movie music tricks and outdated techniques such as forced climaxes and gaudy orchestration. He said it fell severely short of the concept Axelrod aspired to and that [...] "only the most uneducated will be taken in by the mountains of misterioso claptrap that surround these squeaking musical mice".|$|E

I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled." [...] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode [...] "was a complete waste of time", and that although he [...] "wanted Nikki and Paulo to die", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think [...] "Exposé" [...] "will do much to change anyone's minds" [...] about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] for Lost. New York Magazine put [...] "Exposé" [...] at the top of its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes". However, TV Guides Matt Roush very much praised the episode for [...] "weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons", Roush {{went on to say that}} [...] "Exposé" [...] was [...] "a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what they're doing after all." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television". The IGN staff later ranked [...] "Exposé" [...] 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as [...] "one of the series' darkest and most fun episodes".|$|E

[...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, {{he had no idea}} what was going on: [...] "I can’t wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is <b>chock</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but did not think it was as good as Gaga's previous work.
