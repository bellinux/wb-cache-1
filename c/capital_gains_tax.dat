He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} oligopoly model {{to study how}} international differences in profit and <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> affect foreign acquisitions. Reductions in foreign profit taxes tend to trigger inefficient foreign acquisitions, while reductions in foreign <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> may trigger efficient foreign acquisitions. Foreign acquisitions can increase domestic tax revenues even when profit taxes are evaded. The reason is that bidding competition between foreign firms ensures that all benefits from the acquisition, including tax advantages, are captured by a domestic seller paying <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>taxes.</b> Tax code issues, such as the treatment of goodwill, are shown to affect the pattern of foreign acquisitions. ...|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the session, Rice {{prominently}} {{broke with}} Democrats to oppose the removal of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> breaks and to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked-out workers.

After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax.</b> His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E

In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During {{the economic recovery}} from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts.

There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them.

He faced a Massachusetts state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses, and had picked his cabinet and advisors based more on managerial abilities than partisan affiliation. He declined a governor's salary of $135,000 during his term. Upon entering office {{in the middle of}} a fiscal year, he faced an immediate $650million shortfall and a projected $3billion deficit for the next year. Unexpected revenue of $1.0–1.3billion from a previously enacted <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> increase and $500million in new federal grants decreased the deficit to $1.2–1.5billion. Through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and removal of corporate tax loopholes, the state achieved surpluses of around $600–700million during Romney's last two full fiscal years in office, although it began running deficits again after that.|$|E

We find that <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> <b>taxes</b> discourage cash-to-stock transactions and that this effect is stronger in sequential acquisitions. In addition, we show that <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> <b>taxes</b> promote sequential acquisitions and thus carry a beneficial welfare effect by avoiding the waste of productive resources due to unprofitable mergers.
