500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir {{of myself as a}} young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> room and offered me a stipend." ...|$|E

500|$|By now Blenheim {{was under}} assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had {{happened}} on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off. Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – [...] "...it <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head to beat parley", he later wrote, [...] "which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms." [...] Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, {{it was not until}} 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.|$|E
500|$|... "Gold Coat" [...] was Chinese Nü Yrs lead single, {{released}} on 7 October 2015. Six days later, the label Brainfeeder announced they would release the EP on 30 October 2015. Two {{days before the}} release of the EP, [...] the music blog Pigeons & Planes premiered [...] "Xiangjiao". Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked really weird and for some reason the word Chinese New Year <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head. I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E

[...] She described the relationship as [...] "a really wonderful friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And that one time they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet", and she did what she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened.|$|E

[...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E

La Follette was outraged by Sawyer's proposal; the experience profoundly affected his nascent political career as, by his own lights: “Nothing else ever <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> life that exerted such a powerful influence upon me as that affair. It was the turning point, in a way, of my career. Sooner or later I probably would have done what I did in Wisconsin. But it would have been later.

But it shocked me into a complete realization of the extremes to which this power that Sawyer represented would go to secure the results it was after.” ...|$|E
