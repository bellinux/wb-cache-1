500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. <b>Chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp.

50|$|Mixing sodium {{chlorite}} solution {{with a weak}} food-grade acid solution (commonly citric acid), both stable, produces short-lived acidified {{sodium chlorite}} (ASC) which has potent decontaminating properties. Upon mixing the main active ingredient, <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> is produced in equilibrium with chlorite anion.

ASC is used for sanitation of the hard surfaces which come in contact with food and as a wash or rinse for a variety of foods including red meat, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetables. Because the oxo-chlorine compounds are unstable when properly prepared, there should be no measurable residue on food if treated appropriately. ASC also is used as a teat dip for control of mastitis in dairy cattle.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{decomposition of}} aqueous <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> has been reinvestigated at pH 0. 7 - 1. 9, ionic strength 1. 0 M (HSO 4 -/SO 42 -), and temperature 25. 0 (0. 1 °C. Optical absorbances {{were collected in}} the 240 - 450 nm wavelength range for up to 90 % decomposition for time series lasting as long as 2 days. The number of absorbing species was investigated by matrix rank analysis; no absorbing intermediate was formed in significant concentration during the decomposition. Of the many mechanistic models tested, the one that fit best included the following reactive intermediates: HOCl, Cl 2 O 2, Cl 2 O 3, ¥ClO, ¥OH. The stoichiometric ratio of ClO 2 produced to Cl(III) consumed varies with pH and [Cl-]. Reaction of Cl 2 O 3 with Cl(III) yields chlorate exclusively. Reaction of Cl 2 O 3 with Cl- favors ClO 2 over chlorate, but does not entirely exclude chlorate, because it is produced by hydrolysis of Cl 2 O 2. Invoking Cl 2 O 3 explains the variation in stoichiometric ratio {{as well as the}} maximum observed in the initial rate of ClO 2 formation as a function of pH.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} phenomenon-based modeling of pulp bleaching. Previous bleaching models typically utilize one or two empirical correlations to predict the kinetics in kappa number development. Empirical correlations are simple to develop, but their parameters are often tied to the validation system. A major benefit of physico-chemical phenomenon models {{is that they are}} valid regardless of the reaction environment. Furthermore, modeling the bleaching processes at molecular level provides a new way to examine the relative importance of various phenomena, the validity of theories and the bottlenecks of bleaching applications. The first part of the thesis introduces a model for the pulp suspension environment and describes the physico-chemical models in use (reaction kinetics, mass transfer, thermodynamics). The second part deals with inorganic oxychlorine reactions related to chlorine dioxide bleaching. The reaction kinetics and mechanism are documented for iron- mediated chlorite decomposition, <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> self-decomposition, and for the reaction between hypochlorous acid and <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid.</b> The rate coefficient temperature dependency is reported for the two latter reactions. The reaction kinetic models were utilized in assessing the potential chlorate formation routes encountered in pulp bleaching. It was concluded that <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> self-decomposition is unlikely to contribute to chlorate formation in bleaching applications. The iron-mediated chlorite decomposition and the reaction between hypochlorous acid and <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> are expected to produce chlorate. The last part introduces a model for chlorine dioxide delignification. Here the pulp suspension model was combined with a broad set of chemical reactions describing the ClO 2 bleaching chemistry. The incorporated reactions cover lignin oxidation, lignin chlorination, hexenuronic acid degradation, lignin dissolution, oxidation of extractives and the essential inorganic oxychlorine reactions. The model predictions were compared against experimental delignification results in order to validate the model and obtain the previously unknown reaction rate parameters. The predictions were generally in good agreement with experimental results. Deviations related primarily to hypochlorous acid driven processes: organochlorine formation, hexenuronic acid degrading reactions, chlorite depletion or chlorate formation. The simulation results suggest that organochlorine formation is restricted by the amount of chlorination-susceptible substrates in pulp rather than the availability of chlorine. It was also concluded that, in addition to the fully inorganic reactions, chlorite is also likely to be consumed in reactions with pulp-related compounds, for instance with aldehydes...|$|E

40|$|Sanitation of {{environmental}} surfaces with chlorine based-disinfectants {{is a principal}} measure to control outbreaks of norovirus or Clostridium difficile. The microbicidal activity of chlorine-based disinfectants depends on the free available chlorine (FAC), but their oxidative potential is rapidly eliminated by organic matter. In this study, the microbicidal activities of weakly acidified <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> water (WACAW) and sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO) against feline calcivirus (FCV) and C. difficile spores were compared in protein-rich conditions. WACAW inactivated FCV and C. difficile spores better than NaClO under all experimental conditions used in this study. WACAW above 100 ppm FAC decreased FCV > 4 log 10 within 30 sec {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 % each of bovine serum albumin (BSA), polypeptone or meat extract. Even in the presence of 5 % BSA, WACAW at 600 ppm FAC reduced FCV > 4 log 10 within 30 sec. Polypeptone inhibited the virucidal activity of WACAW against FCV more so than BSA or meat extract. WACAW at 200 ppm FAC decreased C. difficile spores > 3 log 10 within 1 min in the presence of 0. 5 % polypeptone. The microbicidal activity of NaClO was extensively diminished in the presence of organic matter. WACAW recovered its FAC to the initial level after partial neutralization by sodium thiosulfate, while no restoration of the FAC was observed in NaClO. These results indicate that WACAW is relatively stable under organic matter-rich conditions and therefore may be useful for treating environmental surfaces contaminated by human excretions...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of Cl(III) were investigated utilizing iodometric titration {{in combination with}} DMSO and EDTA to prevent undesired side reactions. Among {{a large group of}} suggested Cl(III) decomposition reactions, two reactions were found to be adequate to describe the Cl(III) decomposition in the absence of metals and HOCl. The rate parameters (k - rate coefficient, Ea - activation energy) were determined for these reactions. The reaction between Cl(III) and HOCl is known to start with the formation of a Cl 2 O 2 intermediate. The Cl 2 O 2 intermediate was found to be formed through both, hypochlorous acid and chlorine. The kinetic parameters were obtained for the reaction between <b>chlorous</b> <b>acid</b> and hypochlorous acid. The reaction rate between chlorine and chlorite was found to be restricted by the kinetics of the HOCl/Cl 2 equilibrium. The extremely fast Cl 2 O 2 consuming reactions were identified among a group of suggested reactions and their relative rates were determined. Kinetic parameters were identified for several aldehydes with Cl(III). Aldehyde groups were shown to be present in kraft pulps and a considerable amount of aldehydes was found to be formed during chlorine dioxide bleaching. These aldehydes seemed to originate both from carbohydrates and lignin and the amount was dependent on the ClO 2 dosage used. According to the results obtained, it was concluded that the reaction between Cl(III) and aldehydes may contribute substantially to the overall Cl(III) consumption during chlorine dioxide bleaching. Chlorine dioxide prebleaching (D 0 -stage) experiments were conducted to gain more knowledge of the rate of the different reactions and on the time-dependent behavior of various components. Kappa number reduction, hexenuronic acid depletion, chlorination and chlorine dioxide consumption were all found to be fast reactions, with almost everything occurring during the first minute of bleaching. Cl(III) was an exception. The amount of Cl(III) first increased rapidly and then decreased slowly...|$|E
