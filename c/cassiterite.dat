However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E

25|$|In 1839 Young was {{appointed}} manager at James Muspratt's chemical works Newton-le-Willows, near St Helens, Merseyside, and in 1844 to Tennants, Clow & Co. at Manchester, {{for whom he}} devised a method of making sodium stannate directly from <b>cassiterite.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is mining of copper, iron, manganese, gold, <b>cassiterite</b> (tin ore), and phosphates. These {{operations}} provide {{employment and}} generate international aid. Gold production increased 32% in 2011 at six gold mine sites, making Burkina Faso the fourth-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa, Mali and Ghana.|$|E
25|$|In South America, arsenical bronze was the {{predominant}} alloy in Ecuador and north and central Peru, {{because of the}} rich arsenic bearing ores present there. By contrast, the south and central Andes, southern Peru, Bolivia and parts of Argentina, were rich in the tin ore <b>Cassiterite</b> and thus did not use arsenical bronze.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a number}} of {{economically}} important minerals exist in Belize, none {{has been found in}} quantities large enough to warrant their mining. Those minerals include dolomite, barite (source of barium), bauxite (source of aluminum), <b>cassiterite</b> (source of tin), and gold. In 1990 limestone, used in roadbuilding, was the only mineral resource being exploited for either domestic or export use.|$|E

25|$|In April 2009, Brownback {{introduced}} the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of conflict minerals, such as <b>cassiterite,</b> wolframite, and tantalum.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock {{and most of the}} lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the tin ore, <b>cassiterite,</b> was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite. In {{the southern part of the}} moor, the <b>cassiterite</b> was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial deposits of tin ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
25|$|Tin is smelted from <b>cassiterite,</b> {{a mineral}} found in {{hydrothermal}} veins in granite, and the uplands of Dartmoor, in Devon, England, were a particularly productive area. The techniques {{used for the}} extraction of tin from Dartmoor followed a progression from streaming through open cast mining to underground mining. Today, there are extensive archaeological remains of these three phases of the industry, {{as well as of}} the several stages of processing that were necessary to convert the ore to tin metal.|$|E
25|$|Porto Velho's {{modern history}} {{begins with the}} {{discovery}} of <b>cassiterite</b> around the city, and of gold on the Madeira River, {{at the end of the}} 1950s. In addition, the government's decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rondônia, and Porto Velho's population increased to three hundred thousand. This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, are nothing but shanty towns.|$|E
25|$|The {{transitional}} {{government did not}} provide protection or assistance to IDPs, who continued to rely exclusively on humanitarian organizations for assistance. The {{transitional government}} generally allowed domestic and international humanitarian organizations to provide assistance to IDPs. Fighting between the FARDC and armed groups sometimes restricted the ability of humanitarian organizations to assist IDPs (see section 1.g.). The transitional government did not attack or target IDPs, nor did it forcibly return or resettle IDPs under dangerous conditions. However, in April MONUC reported that FARDC soldiers had subjected numerous IDPs to forced labor in <b>cassiterite</b> mines in Mitwaba, Katanga Province.|$|E
25|$|The Romans used {{hydraulic}} mining methods {{on a large}} scale to prospect for the veins of ore, especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as hushing. They built numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead. There, the water stored in large reservoirs and tanks. When a full tank was opened, the flood of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold veins. The rock was then worked upon by fire-setting to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The resulting thermal shock cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work <b>cassiterite</b> deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cassiterite</b> {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000. Recorded coltan production has soared from 147 tonnes in 1999 to 1,300 tonnes in 2001, and coltan was the country's biggest single export earner in 2001. At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-export is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{valuable}} {{minerals and}} rocks {{are referred to}} as industrial minerals. For example, muscovite, a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator. Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or <b>cassiterite</b> (SnO2), an ore of tin. Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both corundum, Al2O3.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{gold and silver}} and their related deposits, tin, iron, and mercury occur, sometimes in later units, mostly in later volcanics, and Molybdenum occurs in the mountains, often along with older copper deposits or in oligocene deposits in the east. The belt of tin deposits resides mostly within the eastern slopes from Durango to Guanajuato. In these areas, tin occurs in rhyolitic ignimbrites in many, possibly over 1000, small deposits of <b>cassiterite.</b> Typically these deposits are divided from overlying ignimbrites by breccia, which may also contain ore. Many of these {{are thought to be}} hydrothermal deposits To the east of these units is a belt of more mercury deposits, followed by another belt of manganese deposits, although these deposits are mostly limited to Chihuahua and Hidalgo. Iron occurs in three different regions placed by different mechanisms. Along the Pacific there the numerous skarn and replacement deposits mentioned above with relation to gold. Iron occurs in Durango in the form of magnetite lava flows, which are often surrounded by smaller hematite deposits, thought to be ash flows. There is also a belt of iron deposits further east.|$|E
500|$|The primary mining of {{tantalum}} is in Australia, {{where the}} largest producer, Global Advanced Metals, {{formerly known as}} Talison Minerals, operates two mines in Western Australia, Greenbushes in the Southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region. The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late-2008 due to the global financial crisis. Less {{than a year after}} it reopened, Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again [...] "... softening tantalum demand ...", and other factors, tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012. Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the Greenbushes operation before being sold to customers. Whereas the large-scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada, the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum. Some other countries such as China, Ethiopia, and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum, and they produce a significant percentage of the world's output of it. Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of the tin mining there. During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits, not only is <b>cassiterite</b> (SnO2) found, but a small percentage of tantalite also included. The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum, which is leached from the slag.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{means of}} recovery, known as streaming or streamworking, involved {{the collection of}} alluvial deposits from river and stream beds where they had accumulated after being eroded from the ore-bearing lodes. The geological processes {{that resulted in the}} deposition of the <b>cassiterite</b> in the stream beds often resulted in very pure tin gravel which was mixed with gravels of other, unwanted, minerals such as quartz, mica and feldspar, collectively known an [...] "gangue". It was relatively easy to separate these minerals {{on the basis of their}} very different specific gravities – <b>cassiterite</b> about 7 and gangue 3 or less. The separation was performed by passing a stream of water over the gravels: the gangue would be washed away faster than the wanted tin gravel.|$|E
2500|$|Britain’s only unique export in {{this period}} {{is thought to be}} tin. [...] It was {{probably}} gathered in streams in Cornwall and Devon as <b>cassiterite</b> pebbles and traded in this raw, unrefined state. It was used to turn copper into bronze from around 2200 BC and widely traded throughout Britain and into Ireland. [...] Other possible European sources of tin are located in Brittany and Iberia, but it is not thought they were exploited so early as these areas did not have Bronze until after it was well established in Britain and Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|Coffee {{production}} of 14,578,560 tons in 2000 compares to a pre-civil war variation between 35,000 and 40,000 tons [...] By 2002 tea became Rwanda’s largest export, with export earnings from tea reaching US$18 million equating to 15,000 tons of dried tea. Rwanda's natural resources are limited. A small mineral industry provides about 5% {{of foreign exchange}} earnings. Concentrates exist of the heavy minerals <b>cassiterite</b> (a primary source of tin), and coltan (used to manufacture electronic capacitors, used in consumer electronics products such as cell phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers).|$|E
2500|$|Porto Velho ( [...] , Old Port) is {{the capital}} of the Brazilian state of Rondônia, in the upper Amazon River basin, and a Catholic Metropolitan Archbishopric. The {{population}} is 426,558 people (as of the IBGE 2010 census). Located on the border of Rondônia and the state of Amazonas, the town is an important trading center for <b>cassiterite,</b> the mining of which represents the most important economic activity in the region, as well as a transportation and communication center. It is on the eastern shore of the Madeira River, one of the main tributaries of the Amazon River. It is also Rondônia's largest city, and the largest state capital of Brazil by area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} species of {{tourmaline}} is schorl, the sodium iron (divalent) endmember of the group. It {{may account for}} 95% or more of all tourmaline in nature. The early history of the mineral schorl shows that the name [...] "schorl" [...] was in use prior to 1400 because a village known today as Zschorlau (in Saxony, Germany) was then named [...] "Schorl" [...] (or minor variants of this name). This village had a nearby tin mine where, in addition to <b>cassiterite,</b> black tourmaline was found. The first description of schorl with the name [...] "schürl" [...] and its occurrence (various tin mines in the Saxony Ore Mountains) was written by Johannes Mathesius (1504–1565) in 1562 under the title [...] "Sarepta oder Bergpostill". Up to about 1600, additional names used in the German language were [...] "Schurel", [...] "Schörle", and [...] "Schurl". Beginning in the 18th century, the name Schörl was mainly used in the German-speaking area. In English, the names shorl and shirl {{were used in the}} 18th century. In the 19th century the names common schorl, schörl, schorl and iron tourmaline were the English words used for this mineral.|$|E
2500|$|Oxide {{minerals}} {{are divided}} into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O2− as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (Cu2O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (Al2O3), and hematite (Fe2O3). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO2) is the chief ore of titanium; other examples include <b>cassiterite</b> (SnO2; ore of tin), and pyrolusite (MnO2; ore of manganese). [...] In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH−. Bauxites are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals diaspore, gibbsite, and bohmite; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions). [...] Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of X2+Y3+2O4. Examples of species include spinel (MgAl2O4), chromite (FeCr2O4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (Fe2+Fe3+2O4), {{which makes it a}} multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{sources of}} <b>cassiterite</b> today {{are found in}} {{alluvial}} or placer deposits containing the resistant weathered grains. The best sources of primary <b>cassiterite</b> {{are found in the}} tin mines of Bolivia, where it is found in hydrothermal veins. Rwanda has a nascent <b>cassiterite</b> mining industry. Fighting over <b>cassiterite</b> deposits (particularly in Walikale) is a major cause of the conflict waged in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. [...] This has led to <b>cassiterite</b> being considered a conflict mineral.|$|E

5000|$|Crystal {{twinning}} {{is common}} in <b>cassiterite</b> and most aggregate specimens show crystal twins. The typical twin is bent at a near-60-degree angle, forming an [...] "elbow twin". Botryoidal or reniform <b>cassiterite</b> is called wood tin.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} {{replacement}} of <b>cassiterite</b> in hydrothermal deposits. It {{is associated with}} dzhalindite, <b>cassiterite</b> and quartz.

50|$|<b>Cassiterite</b> is a {{tin oxide}} mineral, SnO2. It is {{generally}} opaque, {{but it is}} translucent in thin crystals.
