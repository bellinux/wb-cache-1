30|$|Fast {{convergence}} {{rate and}} low computational complexity features are important issues for {{high data rate}} applications such as speech processing, echo <b>cancelation,</b> <b>network</b> echo cancelation, and channel equalization. The least-mean-squares (LMS) and the normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithms are useful {{for a wide range}} of adaptive filter applications because of their low computational complexity. However, the performance of the LMS-type algorithms is corrupted when the input signals are colored [1, 2].|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” Interference between nodes {{directly}} {{limits the}} capacity of mobile ad hoc networks. This paper focuses on spatial interference cancelation with perfect channel state information (CSI), and analyzes the corresponding network capacity. Specifically, by using multiple antennas, zero-forcing beamforming is applied at each receiver for canceling the strongest interferers. Given spatial interference <b>cancelation,</b> the <b>network</b> transmission capacity is analyzed in this paper, which {{is defined as the}} maximum transmitting node density under constraints on outage and the signal-to-interference-noise ratio. Assuming the Poisson distribution for the locations of network nodes and spatially i. i. d. Rayleigh fading channels, mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are applied for deriving scaling laws for transmission capacity. Specifically, for small target outage probability, transmission capacity is proved to increase following a power law, where the exponent is the inverse of the size of antenna array or larger depending on the pass loss exponent. As shown by simulations, spatial interference cancelation increases transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more even if only one extra antenna is added to each node. I...|$|R

40|$|General {{linear model}} (GLM) is a {{standard}} and widely used fMRI analysis tool. It enables the detection of hypothesis-driven brain activations. In contrast, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a powerful technique, which enables the detection of data-driven spatially independent networks. Hybrid approaches that combine {{and take advantage of}} GLM and ICA have been proposed. Yet the choice of the best method is still a challenge, considering that the techniques may yield slightly different results regarding the number of brain regions involved in a task. A poor statistical power or the deviance from the predicted hemodynamic response functions is possible cause for GLM failures in extracting some activations picked by ICA. However, there might be another explanation for different results obtained with GLM and ICA approaches, such as <b>networks</b> <b>cancelation.</b> In this paper, we propose a new supplementary method that can give more insight into the functional data as well as help to clarify inconsistencies between the results of studies using GLM and ICA. We introduce a contributive sources analysis (CSA), which provides a measure of the number and the strength of the neural networks that significantly contribute to brain activation. CSA, applied to fMRI data of anti-saccades, enabled us to verify whether the brain regions involved in the task are dominated by a single network or serve as key nodes for particular networks interaction. Moreover, when applying CSA to the atlas-defined regions-of-interest, results indicated that activity of the parieto-medial temporal network was suppressed by the eye field network and the default mode network. Thus, this effect of <b>networks</b> <b>cancelation</b> explains the absence of parieto-medial temporal activation within the GLM results. Together, those findings indicate that brain activations are a result of complex network interactions. Applying CSA appears to be a useful tool to reveal additional findings outside the scope of the "fixed-model" GLM and data-driven ICA approaches...|$|R
