5|$|The lack of <b>codification</b> of Sharia {{leads to}} {{considerable}} variation in its interpretation and application. Furthermore, {{there is no}} system of judicial precedent, as Wahhabism rejects the imitation of past scholarship (taqlid) in favor of independent reasoning (ijtihad).|$|E

5|$|Buckner {{proposed}} {{a number of}} progressive ideas, {{most of which were}} rejected by the legislature. Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax equalization, creation of a parole system for convicts, and <b>codification</b> of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideas that}} {{underpin}} our modern world–meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on–were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them {{he added a}} rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest <b>codification</b> of laws {{since the fall of}} the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a decree}} from 1972, the Ministry of Justice {{prepared}} proposals for the <b>codification</b> of law; it carried out methodological management of legal {{work in the}} national economy. The Ministry directed and coordinated the work of state bodies and public organisations to promote legal knowledge and to clarify the law among the population about the judicial agencies, as well as general management of the civil registry, state, and legal profession. The Ministry was liable to the Party, the state, and the people. The Ministry's main goal was to strengthen socialist legality {{and the rule of}} law within Soviet judicial institutions.|$|E
50|$|Byzantium {{inherited}} {{its main}} political, {{cultural and social}} institutions from Rome. Similarly, Roman law constituted {{the basis for the}} Byzantine legal system. For many centuries, the two great <b>codifications</b> of Roman law, carried out by Theodosius II and Justinian respectively, were the cornerstones of Byzantine legislation. Of course, over the years these Roman codes were adjusted to the current circumstances, and then replaced by new <b>codifications,</b> written in Greek. However, the influence of Roman law persisted, and it is obvious in <b>codifications,</b> such as Basilika, which was based on Corpus Juris Civilis. In the 11th century, Michael Psellos prides himself for being acquainted with the Roman legal legacy ("Ἰταλῶν σοφία").|$|R

5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently ignored by the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation {{became the basis for}} the formation around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete <b>codification</b> and execution, or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the quaestor Tribonian to oversee this task. The {{first draft of}} the Codex Iustinianus, a <b>codification</b> of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It {{was followed by the}} Digesta (or Pandectae), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the Institutiones, a textbook explaining the principles of law. The Novellae, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements the Corpus. As opposed {{to the rest of the}} corpus, the Novellae appeared in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 {{categories}} for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories {{had the effect}} of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the <b>codification</b> of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.|$|E
50|$|As {{a member}} of the Congress of Nueva Granada (1850) and as senator of Istmo de Panamá (1853), he {{authored}} many legal <b>codifications</b> and was instrumental in bringing about the autonomy of the Colombian federal state of Panama. His extensive drafts of legal <b>codifications,</b> the so-called Proyectos Arosemena, were to become the basis of Panamanian and Colombian legislation {{in the second half of}} the 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Maltese courts became British {{subject on}} 5 October 1813, {{months before the}} Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a <b>codification</b> of a mixed system of Civil Law, which {{included}} Roman Law, Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force.|$|E
5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed <b>codification</b> of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} a circuit judge, Melvin was {{appointed}} by the governor to assist in completing the <b>codification</b> of West Virginia state laws. Following a dispute between Charles Town and Shepherdstown over the location of Jefferson County's court, he was selected {{to serve as the}} circuit court judge in Charles Town for the fall term, which began on September 12, 1872. On August 24, 1872, Melvin was elected for a full eight-year term as judge of the First Judicial District, which began on January 1, 1873.|$|E
50|$|Maimonides's Mishneh Torah is {{considered}} by Jews even today {{as one of the}} chief authoritative <b>codifications</b> of Jewish law and ethics. It is exceptional for its logical construction, concise and clear expression and extraordinary learning, so that it became a standard against which other later <b>codifications</b> were often measured. It is still closely studied in rabbinic yeshivot (academies). A popular medieval saying that also served as his epitaph states, From Mosheh (of the Torah) to Mosheh (Maimonides) there was none like Mosheh. It chiefly referred to his rabbinic writings.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cultures}} {{attempt to}} codify their prescriptions concerning individual sexual behaviors. Such <b>codifications</b> are frequently enacted as laws, extending their application beyond the culture to other cultures under {{the purview of}} the laws, including dissenters.|$|R

5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the <b>codification</b> of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building a canal (Darius Canal) which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, {{he found that the}} <b>codification</b> of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E
5|$|Institutionally, Reitz {{did much}} for the <b>codification</b> and review {{of the laws of}} the Orange Free State. With his colleagues C.J. Vels, O.J. Truter, and J.G. Fraser Reitz {{published}} the first Ordonnantie boek van den Oranje Vrijstaat (Ordinance Book of the Orange Free State) in 1877, making the acts and ordinances of the republic available to the larger public. He also {{played a role in the}} revision of the constitution of the Orange Free State, with regard to articles on citizenship and the right to vote, was chairman of the examination committee for aspirant practitioners, and contributed to the improvement of the prison system and the district administration.|$|E
50|$|The Libel Act 1843, {{commonly}} known as Lord Campbell's Libel Act, was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It enacted several important <b>codifications</b> of and modifications to the common law tort of libel.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>codifications</b> {{also became}} {{more common in}} common law systems. For example, a {{criminal}} code is found {{in a number of}} common law jurisdictions in Australia and the Americas, and continues to be debated in England.|$|R
50|$|The Georgia Constitution grants {{cities and}} {{counties}} {{a significant amount of}} home rule authority. As such, {{cities and counties}} enact local ordinances for their governance, and most highly populated cities and counties have published <b>codifications</b> of their ordinances.|$|R
5|$|The {{legal status}} and rights of Roman slaves {{also began to}} change. During the time of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54 AD), a {{constitution}} was enacted that made the killing of an old or infirm slave an act of murder, and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen. Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for the killing of slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown {{that they were being}} mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be direct results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal <b>codification</b> of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.|$|E
5|$|As Western Europe {{witnessed}} {{the formation of}} new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the Sasanian Empire, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted {{throughout most of the}} 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics {{that they did not have}} in Western Europe. Legal developments included the <b>codification</b> of Roman law; the first effort—the Codex Theodosianus—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{theology}} espoused by their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. They believed {{in the presence of}} malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but {{there is little evidence that}} Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 <b>codification</b> of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E
50|$|Rabbi Glasner also {{published}} Shevivei Eish, a shorter work of {{commentary on the}} weekly Torah reading and the Festivals (translated in Resources below) which also includes novellae on various discussions in the Talmud and <b>codifications</b> in Maimonides Code.|$|R
50|$|Canon {{law for the}} Latin Church is codified in the Code of Canon Law, {{of which}} {{there have been two}} <b>codifications,</b> the first promulgated by Pope Benedict XV in 1917, and the second by Pope John Paul II in 1983.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Tanakh, there are two further textual traditions in Judaism: Mishnah (tractates expounding on Jewish law) and the Talmud (commentary of Misneh and Torah).
