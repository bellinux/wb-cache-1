40|$|Leptin {{may play}} a role in {{appetite}} regulation and metabolism, but its reproductive role is less clear. In photoperiodic Siberian hamsters, seasonal changes in fatness, leptin gene expression, and metabolism occur synchronously with activation or suppression of reproduction, analogous to puberty. Here, we test the hypothesis that seasonal changes in leptin secretion mediate the photoperiodic regulation of reproduction. Mature male and ovariectomized estrogen-treated female Siberian hamsters were kept in long (LD; 16 h of light, 8 hof darkness) or short days (SD; 8 hoflight, 16 h of darkness) for 8 weeks, and recombinant murine leptin (15 �g/day) was infused for 2 weeks IN SEASONAL MAMMALS such as the Siberian hamster, photoperiod-regulated changes in reproduction are associated with major seasonal cycles of metabolism and food intake. These metabolic rhythms persist in <b>castrated</b> <b>animal...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} immune responses to thymus-dependent and -independent antigens were evaluated in normal male and female mice and in castrated male mice. Both IgM antibody production in the primary response and IgG antibody production in the secondary response were enhanced in females vs. males of equivalent age. Castration of the male converted this animal to a female in terms of responsiveness to the thymus-dependent group of antigens, while inducing equivalent or even greater enhanced responsiveness over the female to the thymus-independent antigen, polyvinylpyrrolidone. Further characteristics {{of the changes in}} lymphoid organs were determined in the <b>castrated</b> <b>animal</b> vs. normal males and females. It was shown that the spleen and thymus became markedly hyperplastic, the organ weights exceeding the female, which in turn were greater than in the male. The enhanced weight of the thymus was shown to be due to increased numbers of cortisone-sensitive cells, the absolute number of cortisone-resistant cells remaining equivalent to normal males and females. Thus, the increased thymic weight of the female also resided in the cortisone-sensitive population. Peripheral lymphocyte counts in castrated animals exceeded both normal males and females. Further experiments in gonadectomized males provided evidence that increased thymic cell activity per se played a role in enhanced response to thymus-dependent antigens, but that a thymic-derived hormone mediated the enhanced effect to the thymus-independent antigen in the <b>castrated</b> <b>animal.</b> The capacity for loss of androgenic hormone-producing tissue to generate enhanced differentiation of stem cells was denoted by experiments in which numbers of spleen colonies and uptake of 59 Fe, employed as an index of hematopoiesis 1 wk after reconstitution of lethally irradiated castrated and normal recipients, were enhanced in gonadectomized male animals. Thus, in summary, changes in sex hormone levels exerted a marked influence on immune responsiveness and stem cell differentiation, by increasing numbers of functioning cells, by promoting cellular differentiation, as well as by promoting cellular function via hormonal effects...|$|E
40|$|The Karimojong {{have two}} genres of songs: eete and emong. Emong {{is a kind}} of song that {{individuals}} other than the composer refrain from singing in public; these songs mention specific castrated animals owned and herded by the composer/singer.

Nevertheless, references to oxen constitute only a small portion of the lyrics of these songs, which describe the life-worlds of singers as they engage in the daily subsistence activities of pastoralism.

The study involved 52 calves, Holstein-Zebu, 20 ± 3 months old, in a completely randomised design divided into four treatments of 13 animals: non-castrated, surgically castrated, immunocastrated and non-castrated with homeopathy. Analysis of variance was performed, and the Tukey test was applied (P< 0. 05). The Pearson correlation coefficient was estimated and principal components analysis was performed. The <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> had lower total weight gain and carcass yield than the animals in the remaining treatment groups. The immunocastrated bulls had a greater subcutaneous fat thickness than the non-castrated bulls. The castrated bulls exhibited lower frequencies of mounting, excitement and dominance behaviour than the animals in the remaining treatment groups.

40|$|OVARIAN tumours may {{be induced}} in {{rats and mice}} by at least three techniques. One method, used most {{commonly}} in rats, is by transplantation of an ovary to the spleen of a <b>castrated</b> <b>animal</b> or to some other site drained by the liver. This method {{gave rise to a}} hormonal theory of ovarian tumour induction put forward by Biskind and Biskind (1944). The oestrogens produced by this transplanted ovary drained to the liver, where they were destroyed. The consequent lack of circulating oestrogen led to an increase in pituitary gonadotrophin production, which in turn acted on the transplanted ovaries and resulted in the growth of tumours in them. Intact ovarian function was found to inhibit ovarian tumour production in intrasplenic ovaries (Biskind and Biskind, 1948), presumably by controlling gonadotrophin production. The other two most commonly used methods of ovarian tumour induction are by giving sterilising doses of X-rays (Furth and Butterworth, 1936), or by administering to mice certain chemical carcinogens, of which the most effective seems to be 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene, or DMBA (Howell, Marchant an...|$|E
40|$|The {{epithelium}} of {{the so-called}} prostate gland of Suncus murinus temminckii Fitzinger was observed electron microscopically. The several rough endoplasmic reticulum are in a row at the infra- and perinuclear region of the cell, but at the apical portion of the cell and at the supranuclear region the rough endoplasmic reticulum presents an vesicular form. The Golgi apparatus is well developed at the supranuclear region and the dense small granules which seem to be condensed, were often observed within the distended vacuoles of the Golgi apparatus. Many dense and homogeneous secretory granules are scattered from the supranuclear region to the apical portion of the cell. These granules situating at the apical portion of the cell are surrounded by a membrane-bounded vacuole, in which the small microvilli-like cytoplasmic projections to the granule were apparently observed. The secretory granules become coarse and low in electron density from the periphery of it, but a finger-print-like structure {{is present in the}} center of the secreting granule. The fingerprint- like structure is also obsrved in the secreted granule in the lumen of the gland. The free surface of the epithelial cell usually appeared ruffled and possessed many long microvilli. The cells are progressively reduced in the gland of the <b>castrated</b> <b>animal</b> and the organellae become less organized and the secretory granules decrease in the size and number, but not utterly diminished in this experiment.

40|$|Summary. Hypophysial portal {{blood and}} {{peripheral}} blood {{were obtained from}} conscious, unrestrained rams to measure simultaneously the secretion of LHRH and LH in entire rams and rams which had been castrated for 2 =n- 5 days (short-term castration) and for 1 =n-months (long-term castration). The apparatus for portal blood collection was surgically implanted using a transnasal trans-sphenoidal approach and, 4 =n-days later, portal blood and peripheral blood were collected simultaneously at 10 -min intervals for 8 =n-h from 15 sheep. LHRH was clearly secreted in pulses in all three physiological conditions, but there were marked differences in pulse frequencies, which averaged 1 pulse/ 2 =n-h in entire rams, 1 pulse/ 70 min in short-term castrated rams and 1 pulse/ 36 min in long-term castrated rams. In entire and short-term castrated animals, LH profiles were also clearly pulsatile and each LHRH pulse in hypophysial portal blood was associated with an LH pulse in the peripheral blood. In long-term castrated animals, LH pulses were not as well defined, {{because of the high}} basal levels and small pulse amplitudes, and the temporal relationship between LHRH and LH pulses was not always clear. These results demonstrate the pulsatile nature of LHRH secretion under the three physiological conditions and suggest that the irregular LH profiles characteristic of long-term castrates are due to an inability of the pituitary gland to transduce accurately the hypothalamic signal. The very high frequency of the LHRH pulses {{may be one of the}} major reasons for this, and is probably also responsible for the high rate of LH secretion in the long-term <b>castrated</b> <b>animal...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we have {{evaluated}} the gene expression profile of prolactin and prolactin receptor in the pituitary and the uterus of female mice with metoclopramide-induced hyperprolactinemia treated with estrogen and/or progesterone. For this purpose, 49 Swiss female mice were allocated to seven groups. Interventions: 50 -day treatment with metoclopramide, progesterone and estrogen. Our {{results showed that}} in the pituitary, metoclopramide-induced hyperprolactinemia increased prolactin expression. In the <b>castrated</b> <b>animals,</b> progesterone, with or without estrogen, produced an increase in prolactin. Pituitary prolactin receptor and the estrogen and progesterone treatment {{were responsible for the}} rise in PRLR-S 2. In the uterus, no differences in prolactin expression were found between the different study groups. PRLR-S 1 had its expression reduced in all <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> as against the castrated group treated with vehicle. In the noncastrated animals, PRLR-S 2 rose in the metoclopramide-treated group, and, in the <b>castrated</b> <b>animals,</b> its expression diminished in all groups in relation to the vehicle-treated castrated controls. An increase in PRLR-S 3 was found in the oophorectomized animals treated with a combination of estrogen and progesterone. PRLR-L rose in the oophorectomized animals treated with progesterone in isolation or in association with estrogen. These findings suggest that metoclopramide associated to progesterone or estrogen may determine an increase in pituitary prolactin and PRLR-S 2 expression.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of the endometrium {{in the first}} half of the normal cycle is caused by the follicular hormone. The transformation into the secretion phase in the second half is caused by the hormone developed by the yellow substance of the corpus luteum. The term “menstrual” bleeding must be preserved for the discharged endometrium which has been proliferated first by the follicular hormone, and then transformed into the secretion phase (pregravid phase) by the corpus luteum hormone. The growth of the uterus in childhood and its pubescence depends on the follicular hormone (vegetative activity of the ovary), just as does the preservation of turgor in the genitals of the puberal woman. Many years ago, cyclic genital activity in the <b>castrated</b> <b>animal</b> was first produced by the injection of hormone, and this effect is now employed as a test for ovarian hormones. I succeeded eighteen months ago in producing complete menstruation in the castrated woman. The size of the doses of ovarian hormones administered is the important factor. In numerous experiments I have shown that—according to our present conceptions—very large doses of follicular hormones are required to produce the proliferation phase of the endometrium. The required dose is about 200, 000 mouse units (= 1 million international units). For transformation of the proliferated endometrium into the secretion phase, 35 rabbit units of corpus luteum hormone are needed. The doses of follicular hormones up to now employed in therapeutics do not exert any traceable influence on the endometrium of the castrated woman. Neither have I noticed, that with doses of 600 or 1, 000 mouse units, a shrivelling of the uterus which is due to long lasting functional troubles may be done away with. I have therefore proceeded to treat serious hormonal affections of the ovaries with very large doses of ovarian hormones...|$|E
40|$|Despite many {{reports on}} the {{absorptive}} function of th e seminal vesicles, {{the results have been}} varied aacording to drugs and experimental animals used for the studies. To evaluate the relationship between vital situation of the endocrine system and absorptive function of the seminal vesicle, studies were carried out to observe the absorptive state of aqueous solution of 131 I Na from the seminal vesicle in experimentally and clinically. 1) Results of animal experiments. Absorption of 131 IN a s o lution from the seminal vesicles of male adult rabbit was proved to be very fast, which was almost equivalent to absorption of 1311 Na from subcutaneous tissue. In abdition, the absorptive function of the seminal vesicles was found to be greatly influenced by endocrine situations. Namely the highest absorptive function was seen in young animals, followed by animals given male sexual hormone, given female sexual hormone, normal adult rabbit and lastly <b>castrated</b> <b>animal.</b> 2) Results of clinical experiments. In normal adult men, n o rmal senile men and 10 cases of various type of hypogonadism, absorptive function test of the seminal vesicles was performed to evaluate relationship between the function and X-ray picture of the seminal vericles and urinary excretion of various hormones. The results indicated that the absorptive function is better in younger age groups with gradual decrease according to advancing of age. In patients with hypogonadism, decreased absorptive function was observed in all cases except for Klinefelter's syndrome. On the relationship between the absorptive function and the results of endocrine studies, the most closed relation was found in urinary gonadotropin excretion. Whenever abnormal urinany gonadotropin excretion was observed, the absorptive function of the seminal vesicles showed abnormal results. There was no noticeable relationship between the absorptive function and X-ray picture of the seminal vesicles as far as the size of seminal vesicle is concerned. However there was a definite relationship between the absorptive function and the angle of main axis. Namely persons having the greater angles of the main tubuli showed the lowere absorptive functions. From the results of above experimental and c l inical studies, the absorptive function of the seminal vesicles was proved to highly depend upon the vital endocrine situation of the individual body, especially on activity of sexual hormones. This suggests us that the absorptive function is widely applicable to quantitative determination of androgen activity...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} reduces gender-related {{differences in}} the prevalence of cardiovascular disease by fading the vascular protective effects afforded by estrogen in females. However, the impact of estrogen treatment on and the contribution of androgens to vascular function in vessels from male diabetics are largely unknown. We investigated the effects of androgen deficiency and in vivo estrogen treatment by assessing the responsiveness {{to a number of}} vasoactive agents and the formation of eicosanoid mediators in aortic rings from intact and castrated streptozotocin-diabetic rats which had been implanted with 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) or its vehicle for 5 days. Castration was found to attenuate contractility to noradrenaline, to enhance tone-related release of NO, as shown by curves for N-methyl-L-arginine and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and to increase endothelium-dependent relaxation to carbachol and histamine, compared with intact animals. Smooth muscle sensitivity to exogenous NO and platelet thromboxane A 2 production were unchanged but prostacyclin release by aortic tissue dropped by about 40 % following castration. Treatment with E 2 to intact animals still attenuated contractility to noradrenaline and potentiated relaxation to SOD and histamine but affected no other parameters. In contrast, when E 2 was administered to <b>castrated</b> <b>animals,</b> responses to SOD, carbachol and histamine were significantly impaired. Thus, androgen deprivation appears to improve vascular function in male diabetic rats, whereas E 2 treatment exerts some beneficial effects in intact, but not in <b>castrated</b> <b>animals.</b> Our findings therefore provide new insights into the role of sex hormones in the development of diabetic vascular complications...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the influence of}} androstenedione, 5 -alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17 -beta-estradiol on the chromatin organization and the cell kinetics (distribution of the cells into the G 0 -G 1, S and G 2 + M fractions) of MXT mouse mammary tumors grafted onto animals that were left intact or that were oophorectomized and/or treated with aminoglutethimide. The cell kinetics and chromatin pattern were monitored by analyzing Feulgen-stained MXT imprint smears through a cell image processor, the SAMBA 200 system. We have also assayed the estrogen and progesterone receptors of these MXT tumors, which appeared to possess both of these biological markers. Our results show that ovariectomy or aminoglutethimide treatment slowed down the MXT tumor growth without any additive effect between them. Androstenedione exerted a stimulating influence on the cell kinetics, which were {{very similar to those}} observed after estradiol administration; the treatment of <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> with aminoglutethimide completely abolished this androstenedione-induced stimulating influence, however. This androgen lacked any apparent efficiency to transform cell nuclei from a state of castration-induced chromatin condensation into a thinly textured and decondensed state, as did estradiol. Dihydrotestosterone was able to activate the cell kinetics of MXT tumor grafted onto <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> {{as well as those of}} MXT neoplasms grafted on oophorectomized mice treated with aminoglutethimide. Dihydrotestosterone also possesses the property to transform condensed chromatin into decondensed chromatin. It thus appeared that androstenedione and dihydrotestosterone could activate MXT cell proliferation, as did estradiol, although it appeared that their mechanisms of action were quite distinct from each other.

Considering a few difficultes {{which seem to}} hinder the popularization of the castration technique in the real environment of Ituri (North Eastern Zaire), the authors suggest the trend towards the reducing of the age margin regularly observed during the running of that operation. It appeared that the age between 3 and 5 months seems favourable for the popularizer {{as well as for}} the animal and the breeder regarding the operation, the stress and the meat quality.

40|$|The {{secretory}} {{activity of}} the subcommissural organ (SCO) is affected by adrenalectomy, adrenalectomy + castration, and {{by an increase in}} ambient temperature in adrenalectomized and adrenalectomized + <b>castrated</b> <b>animals.</b> Adrenalectomy inhibits the {{activity of the}} SCO. After adrenalectomy + castration the decrease in the secretory activity of the SCO is more rapid. In contrast, an increase in the ambient temperature in adrenalectomized animals induces a recrudescence of the activity of the SCO. The increase in temperature in castrated + adrenalectomized lizards does not affect the inhibition produced by this type of surgical treatment. The histological changes are discussed on the basis of results obtained in the present study and in previous experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Castration was {{frequently}} used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their [...] "power". Castrated men — eunuchs - were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. Castration also figured {{in a number}} of religious castration cults. Other religions, such as Judaism, were strongly opposed to the practice. The Leviticus Holiness code, for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> are excluded from sacrifice.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess whether}} {{naturally}} occurring 5 a-androstanediols (5 a-androstane- 3 a, 17 -diol and 5 -androstane- 33, 17 [-diol) {{play a role}} in the regulation of male sexual behavior in the rat, their capability to restore copulatory behavior in <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> was evaluated. Androstanediols were chronically administered either alone or in combination with 50 a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or with estradiol- 17 1 (E,). Animals treated with testosterone (T), DHT, E,, and vehicle, either alone or in different combinations, served as controls. The occurrence of mounting, intromission, and ejaculation as well as detailed parameters of copulatory be-havior were recorded twice per week for 3 weeks. At the end of treatments, the weights of sex accessory organs were also recorded. When 3 P, 5 a-androstanediol (3 -diol; 500 g/day) was administered in combination with DHT (300 pg/day), full copulatory behavior was restored in all subjects in a manner similar to that obtained with E, plus DHT or T plus DHT combi-nations, thus indicating an estrogen-like behavioral effect of 3 [-diol. Administration of 3 a, 5 a-androstanediol (3 a-diol; 500 pg/ day) combined with DHT also restored sexual behavior, though to a lesser extent. When 3 ca-diol (500 tig/day) was simulta-neously administered with E, (5 lig/day), the copulatory behavior of <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> was fully restored in a fashion similar to that observed after administration of DHT plus E, and T plus E, combinations, indicating a potent androgen-like effect of 3 a-diol. The behavioral effect of 3 p-diol plus E, was significantly less potent. When given alone, each androstanediol only partially restored copulatory behavior.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect of androgens on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in basal and stress conditions in adult male rats is well documented. Major sex-related neuroendocrine changes take place during puberty. There is a robust rise in production and secretion of gonadal steroids, which {{is thought to}} underlie numerous neural and behavioural changes brought on after puberty. The present study investigated {{the effect of the}} pubertal rise in gonadal steroid levels on the subsequent adult corticosterone profile, particularly the sensitivity of the adult HPA axis to testosterone. <b>Animals</b> were <b>castrated</b> either prepubertally (28 days) or in adulthood (11 weeks) and adult animals were subsequently treated with subcutaneous implants containing either testosterone or cholesterol. Using an automated blood sampling system, blood was collected from each freely moving, conscious rat every 10 min (i) over a 24 h period; (ii) in response to 10 min of noise stress, and (iii) following an immunological challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Analysis revealed that testosterone treatment did not significantly affect overall corticosterone release over the 24 h period in adult <b>animals</b> <b>castrated</b> before puberty in contrast to <b>animals</b> <b>castrated</b> in adulthood in which testosterone significantly suppressed corticosterone secretion. Following either a noise stress or LPS injection, testosterone treatment did not affect the hypothalamic or adrenal stress response in <b>animals</b> <b>castrated</b> prepubertally. Testosterone significantly suppressed the corticotrophin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin mRNA as well as the corticosterone response to LPS in <b>castrated</b> <b>animals</b> that had had their testes intact over puberty. These data provide evidence that puberty is a critical organizational period during which rising levels of gonadal steroids programme the sensitivity of the adult HPA axis to gonadal steroids in adulthood...|$|R
