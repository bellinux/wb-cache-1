40|$|The {{hope and}} promise of {{co-operative}} marketing were to return all profits fairly to the producers and {{to control the}} price of dairy products through collective market power. Soon the South Coast and West Camden Co-op opened its own selling floors in Sussex Street, Sydney. Illawarra and Shoalhaven farmers immediately withdrew their consignments from ‘the system’ and sent their produce instead to the fledgling co-operative. On Mondays and Thursdays steamers arrived from Wollongong, Kiama and Shoalhaven. Carrier after carrier had to be engaged to convey the butter, bacon and cheese sent from the South Coast to the Co-op’s floor while many agents had {{nothing else to do}} but stand outside their doors and watch their business disappear, their carts returned empty from the wharf. The Co-op finished business on the evening of its opening day with all its <b>consignments</b> <b>sold</b> at a very good price...|$|R

5000|$|In late July 1927, Rodgers' bandmates {{learned that}} Ralph Peer, a {{representative}} of the Victor Talking Machine Company, was coming to Bristol to hold an audition for local musicians. Rodgers and the group arrived in Bristol on August 3, 1927, and auditioned for Peer in an empty warehouse. Peer agreed to record them the next day. As the band discussed how they would be billed on the record, an argument ensued, the band broke up, and Rodgers arrived at the recording session the next morning alone. However, in an on-camera interview, Claude Grant of the Tenneva Ramblers gave a totally different reason for the band's breakup. Rodgers had taken some guitars on <b>consignment.</b> He <b>sold</b> them but did not pay back the music stores which supplied the guitars. Grant said that the band broke up because they did not agree with that. The interview BL-16 to 19 is listed here: http://www.etsu.edu/cass/Archives/Collections/afindaid/a111.html On Wednesday, August 4, Jimmie Rodgers completed his first session for Victor in Camden, New Jersey. It lasted from 2:00 pm to 4:20 pm and yielded two songs: [...] "The Soldier's Sweetheart" [...] and [...] "Sleep, Baby, Sleep". For the test recordings, Rodgers received $100.|$|R
