5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping <b>centers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution <b>centers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E
