25|$|Ethanol fuel is {{the most}} common biofuel worldwide, {{particularly}} in Brazil. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat, corn, sugar beets, sugar cane, molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel, but <b>cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> such as bagasse, the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, {{is the most}} common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.|$|E

The fungi are also able to ferment starch to lactic acid (Ping Huang et al. 2005; Yin et al. 1997; Zhou et al. 1999). Furthermore, several researches have been reported about the fungus, by which cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes were secreted (Bakir et al. 2001; Murashima et al. 2002). The saprophytic fungus has high potential for lactic acid production from various abundant <b>cellulosic</b> <b>biomasses,</b> such as agricultural (rice straw, wheat straw), forestry (wood) and industrial waste (old paper, paper sludge) (Lynd et al. 1991, 1999; Lynd et al. 2001; Wyman 2003; Gao et al. 2008; Marques et al. 2008; Hama et al. 2015). Rhizopus fungi can produce l-lactic acid from simple media with not only several monosaccharides, but also starch and lignocelluloses with lower production cost than that by other lactic acid bacteria though many kinds of microorganisms such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus (Woiciechowski et al. 1999; Thongchul and Yang 2003; Wang et al. 2010). Additionally, Rhizopus can produce three major end products of l-lactic acid, fumaric acid and ethanol, unlike homofermentative lactic acid bacteria. These products are affected by culture condition, and sufficient aeration induces efficient lactic acid (Cui et al. 1998; Skory et al. 1998).|$|R

AaBGL 1 has unique features for hydrolysis of cellooligosaccharides in terms of not only showing high specific activity for cellooligosaccharides with increasing degree of polymerization (DP) up to 5, but also being detected no transglycosylation products on hydrolysis of cellobiose and insoluble cellooligosaccharides by paper chromatography (Sakamoto et al. 1985 b; unpublished data).
