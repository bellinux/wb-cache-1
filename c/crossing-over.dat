5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by <b>crossing-over</b> during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or <b>crossing-over</b> can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication {{of a single}} original gene, this is usually {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of <b>crossing-over,</b> translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That <b>crossing-over</b> can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} human {{activity}} on what is now Seattle's Central Waterfront predates the settlement that became the city of Seattle. The Duwamish had a winter village of approximately 8 longhouses roughly {{at the intersection of}} First Avenue South and Yesler Way. With about 200 people, {{it was one of the}} most sizable villages along Elliott Bay. Its name, Djicjila'letc ("little <b>crossing-over</b> place") is still used by the Duwamish today.|$|E
25|$|For {{aboriginal}} {{peoples and}} later European settlers, Partridge Island {{was an important}} sea link {{to other parts of}} Nova Scotia because of its location at one of the narrowest points on the Minas Basin. The Mi'kmaq name for the settlement at Partridge Island was Awokum, which means <b>crossing-over</b> point or short cut. In the 1730s, two French settlers, John Bourg and Francis Arseneau, operated a ferry service that crossed the basin from Partridge Island.|$|E
25|$|The nerves {{within the}} corticospinal tract are {{involved}} in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the <b>crossing-over</b> of fibres, muscles are supplied {{by the side of}} the brain opposite to that of the muscle. The nerves within the corticobulbar tract {{are involved in}} movement in muscles of the head. They are involved in swallowing, phonation, and movements of the tongue. By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in Oa1 {{have been}} well {{characterized}} and studied using various techniques like southern blot analyses, single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Most of these mutations {{have been reported to}} be occurring in the N-terminus and few in the trans-membrane regions but very rarely in the much conserved cytoplasmic C-terminus. Populations belonging to different ethnic groups have been extensively analyzed and a database has been created recording the details of mutations related to OA1. A total of 25 missense, 2 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splicing mutations have been reported till date. In addition to these mutations, there also occur several deletions in one or many of the exons of Oa1 gene, especially exon 2. These deletions are presumed to be because of unequal <b>crossing-over</b> due to the presence of flanking Alu regions. In some cases, the entire Oa1 gene is deleted along with other contiguous genes. Many different polymorphisms have also been detected, mainly in intron 1.|$|E
25|$|Mi-I (Mia), Mi-II(Vw), Mi-VII and Mi-VIII {{are carried}} on glycophorin A. Mi-I {{is due to}} a {{mutation}} at amino acid 28 (threonine to methionine: C->T at nucleotide 83) resulting in a loss of the glycosylation at the asparagine26 residue. Mi-II {{is due to a}} mutation at amino acid 28 (threonine to lysine:C->A at nucleotide 83). Similar to the case of Mi-I this mutation results in a loss of the glycosylation at the asparagine26 residue. This alteration in glycosylation is detectable by the presence of a new 32kDa glycoprotein stainable with PAS. Mi-VII is due to a double mutation in glycophorin A converting an arginine residue into a threonine residue and a tyrosine residue into a serine at the positions 49 and 52 respectively. The threonine-49 residue is glycosylated. This appears to be the origin of one of the Mi-VII specific antigens (Anek) which is known to lie between residues 40-61 of glycophorin A and comprises sialic acid residue(s) attached to O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide(s). This also explains the loss of a high frequency antigen ((EnaKT)) found in normal glycophorin A which is located within the residues 46-56. Mi-VIII is due to a mutation at amino acid residue 49 (arginine->threonine). M-VIII shares the Anek determinant with MiVII. Mi-III, Mi-VI and Mi-X are due to rearrangements of glycophorin A and B in the order GlyA (alpha)-GlyB (delta)-GlyA (alpha). Mil-IX in contrast is a reverse alpha-delta-alpha hybrid gene. Mi-V, MiV(J.L.) and Sta are due to unequal but homologous <b>crossing-over</b> between alpha and delta glycophorin genes. The MiV and MiV(J.L.) genes are arranged in the same 5' alpha-delta 3' frame whereas Sta gene is in a reciprocal 5'delta-alpha 3' configuration.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, McClintock was {{the first}} person to {{describe}} the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits. They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits. Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically. McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9. [...] This information provided necessary data for the <b>crossing-over</b> study she published with Creighton; they also showed that <b>crossing-over</b> occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes. In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.|$|E
500|$|McClintock {{received}} a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation that made possible {{six months of}} training in Germany during 1933 and 1934. She had planned to work with Curt Stern, who had demonstrated <b>crossing-over</b> in Drosophila just weeks after McClintock and Creighton had done so; however, Stern emigrated to the United States. Instead, [...] she worked with geneticist Richard B. Goldschmidt, who {{was the head of}} the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. She left Germany early amidst mounting political tension in Europe, and returned to Cornell, remaining there until 1936, when she accepted an Assistant Professorship offered to her by Lewis Stadler in the Department of Botany at the University of Missouri-Columbia. While still at Cornell, she was supported by a two-year Rockefeller Foundation grant obtained for her through Emerson's efforts.|$|E
2500|$|The lily is {{a favored}} {{organism}} for the cytological examination of meiosis since the chromosomes {{are large and}} each morphological stage of meiosis can be easily identified microscopically. Hotta et al. [...] presented evidence for a common pattern of DNA nicking and repair synthesis in male meiotic cells of lilies and rodents during the zygotene–pachytene stages of meiosis when crossing over was presumed to occur. [...] The presence of a common pattern between organisms as phylogenetically distant as lily and mouse led the authors {{to conclude that the}} organization for meiotic <b>crossing-over</b> in at least higher eukaryotes is probably universal in distribution.|$|E
2500|$|The radio version {{ran from}} 4 October 1952 to 19 March 1955, for 129 episodes. The same cast {{performed}} on both shows. The writers, scripts, and directors were reused between {{the radio and}} TV incarnations, but the radio broadcasts were not limited by studio sets and became more expansive in scope than the television programs. Although there was seldom any deliberate <b>crossing-over</b> of storylines, some of the television villains regularly appeared on the radio (notably Prince Bacarratti), and during the [...] "Planet X" [...] story, both the TV and radio versions explored the rogue planet's invasion of the Space Patrol universe.|$|E
5000|$|The linked {{frequency}} of crossing over between two gene loci (markers) is the <b>crossing-over</b> value [...] For fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination {{in a particular}} region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant {{and the same is}} then true for the <b>crossing-over</b> value which is used in the production of genetic maps.|$|E
5000|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} this <b>crossing-over</b> event {{occurred in a}} heterozygous catarrhine female sometime after the platyrrhine/catarrhine divergence. [...] Following the <b>crossing-over,</b> any male and female progeny receiving at least one X chromosome with both M and L genes would be trichromats. Single M or L gene X chromosomes would subsequently be lost from the catarrhine gene pool, assuring routine trichromacy.|$|E
50|$|This process {{might involve}} {{suppression}} of <b>crossing-over,</b> translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That <b>crossing-over</b> can be suppressed by selection {{has been known}} for many years; Detlefsen and Roberts were able to reduce recombination between the loci for white eyes (w) and miniature wings (m) in Drosophila melanogaster from the normal 36% to 6% in one line and 0.6% in another.|$|E
50|$|Because of the repetitions in 1q21.1, {{there is}} a larger chance on an unequal <b>crossing-over</b> during meiosis.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{popular and}} {{overlapping}} theories that explain {{the origins of}} <b>crossing-over,</b> coming from the different theories {{on the origin of}} meiosis. The first theory rests upon the idea that meiosis evolved as another method of DNA repair, and thus <b>crossing-over</b> is a novel way to replace possibly damaged sections of DNA. The second theory comes from the idea that meiosis evolved from bacterial transformation, with the function of propagating diversity.|$|E
50|$|The {{recombination}} frequency between two loci observed is the <b>crossing-over</b> value. It is {{the frequency of}} crossing over between two linked gene loci (markers), and depends on the mutual distance of the genetic loci observed. For any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant, {{and the same is}} then true for the <b>crossing-over</b> value which is used in the production of genetic maps.|$|E

5000|$|One of Sturtevant’s {{principal}} contributions was {{his introduction}} to the concept that the frequency of <b>crossing-over</b> between two genes could help determine their proximity on a linear genetic map. His experiments determined that the frequency of double crossing over {{can be used to}} deduce gene order. He demonstrated this concept by constructing crosses of three segregating genes, called [...] "three-factor crosses". He found that using three genes as opposed to two provided most accurate information about gene order on chromosome. With this system, Sturtevant discovered that double <b>crossing-over</b> occurs at frequency of equal to or less than product of two single crossing over frequencies. He also surmised that unequal <b>crossing-over</b> was possibly a main force of evolution. [...] "Sturtevant... elaborated on these ideas by incorporating the conception of linear arrangement and by constructing the first chromosome map. Double crossing over and interference were deductions that arose from this result" [...] (Sturtevant, An Introduction to Genetics p. 361).|$|E
5000|$|... it {{undergoes}} rapid concerted evolution via unequal <b>crossing-over</b> {{and gene}} conversion. This promotes intra-genomic homogeneity of the repeat units, although high-throughput sequencing showed {{the occurrence of}} frequent variations within plant species.|$|E
50|$|Because of the repetitions in 1q21.1, {{there is}} a larger chance of an unequal <b>crossing-over</b> during meiosis. CNVs occur due to non-allelic {{homologous}} recombination mediated by low copy repeats (sequentially similar regions).|$|E
5000|$|Freddy Fender remade [...] "Secret Love" [...] for his 1975 album release Are You Ready For Freddy? {{recorded}} {{in the summer of}} 1975 at the SugarHill Recording Studios (Houston): issued as a single in October 1975 [...] "Secret Love" [...] afforded Fender the third of his four #1 hits on the Billboard C&W, also <b>crossing-over</b> to the Top 40 of Billboard Hot 100 (Fender would score one subsequent Top 40 hit, his fourth C&W #1 hit [...] "Youll Lose a Good Thing" [...] <b>crossing-over</b> to the #32 on the Hot 100.) Fender remade [...] "Secret Love" [...] for his 2002 album La Musica de Baldemar Huerta.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>crossing-over</b> (discovered by Thomas Hunt Morgan) {{mediated}} by formation and unwinding (by means of peculiar enzymatic complexes such as helicase) of uncommon four-helix DNA structures known as G-quadruplexes (discovered by Martin Gellert, Marie N. Lipsett, and David R. Davies).|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} such {{mechanisms}} is important firstly since they promote useful functions, as {{for example the}} immune system recombination (on individual scale) and the <b>crossing-over</b> (on evolutionary scale); secondly since they may sometimes become harmful because of some malfunctioning, causing for example neurodegenerative disorders.|$|E
5000|$|Palomo was in {{the process}} of <b>crossing-over</b> to United States {{television}} audiences where he guest starred on shows such as [...] "Arrested Development" [...] and [...] "Kingpin" [...] and was to star in a CBS series. His last movie was A Day Without a Mexican.|$|E
50|$|Tandem repeats {{are usually}} caused by {{slippage}} during replication, unequal <b>crossing-over</b> and gene conversion, satellite DNA and microsatellites are forms of tandem repeats in the genome. Although tandem repeats count {{for a significant}} proportion in genome, the largest proportion in mammalian is the other type, interspersed repeats.|$|E
50|$|In meiosis, {{the process}} of <b>crossing-over</b> occurs between non-sister chromatids, which results in new allelic {{combinations}} in the gametes. In <b>crossing-over,</b> a Spo11 enzyme makes staggered nicks {{in a pair of}} sister chromatid strands (in a tetrad organization of prophase). Subsequent enzymes trim back the 5' ends of the strand and a protein complex binds to the 3' single-stranded ends. Rad51 protein is recruited and binds in a protein complex to search for a complementary sequence analogous to double-strand-break repair. The filament searches for the homologous chromosome, strand invasion occurs where the new chromosome forms a D-loop over the bottom sister chromatid, then the ends are annealed. This process can yield double Holliday junctions that when cut in a transversal pattern by endonucleases form 2 heteroduplex strand products.|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of genetic}} linkage was first {{discovered}} by the British geneticists William Bateson, Edith Rebecca Saunders and Reginald Punnett. Thomas Hunt Morgan expanded the idea of linkage after noticing that in some instances the observed rate of <b>crossing-over</b> events differed from the expected rate of <b>crossing-over</b> events. He attributed the depressed rates of recombination to the smaller spatial separation of genes on a chromosome; Hypothesizing that genes which are more closely positioned on a chromosome will have smaller rates of recombination than those that are spaced farther apart. The unit of measurement describing the distance between two linked genes is the Centimorgan, and is named after Thomas Hunt Morgan. A centimorgan {{is equivalent to the}} percent of recombination. two loci with 2% recombination frequency are located 2 centimorgans apart.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} base-pairs {{to which it}} {{corresponds}} varies widely across the genome (different regions of a chromosome have different propensities towards crossover) and it also depends on if the meiosis where the <b>crossing-over</b> takes place {{is a part of}} oogenesis (formation of female gametes) or spermatogenesis (formation of male gametes).|$|E
5000|$|... "Amapola" [...] is a 1920 song by Cádiz-born {{composer}} José María Lacalle García (later Joseph Lacalle), with Spanish lyrics. After {{the composer}} died in 1937, English language lyrics {{were written by}} Albert Gamse. In the 1930s, the song became a standard of the rhumba repertoire, later <b>crossing-over</b> into pop music charts.|$|E
5000|$|The Mirettes had a Top 20 R&B {{hit with}} {{their version of}} [...] "In the Midnight Hour" [...] which reached number 18 on the R&B chart in Billboard {{magazine}} {{in the spring of}} 1968, almost <b>crossing-over</b> to the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 with a chart peak of number 45.|$|E
50|$|Following synapsis, {{a type of}} {{recombination}} {{referred to}} as synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) occurs frequently. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired non-sister homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause <b>crossing-over.</b> Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (see Genetic recombination).|$|E
50|$|In 1931 Beadle {{was awarded}} a National Research Council Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, where he {{remained}} from 1931 until 1936. During this period he continued his work on Indian corn and began, in collaboration with Professors Theodosius Dobzhansky, S. Emerson, and Alfred Sturtevant, work on <b>crossing-over</b> in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.|$|E
50|$|The {{case for}} the {{accumulative}} origin for supergenes was originally {{based on the work}} of Nabours on polymorphism for colour and pattern in Grouse Locusts (Tetrigidae). In Acridium arenosum the colour-patterns are controlled by thirteen genes on the same chromosome, which reassort (recombine) fairly easily. They also occur in Apotettix eurycephalus where they form two tightly linked groups, between which there is 7% <b>crossing-over.</b> Furthermore, in Paratettix texanus there appears to be complete suppression of <b>crossing-over</b> among 24 out of 25 of the colour-pattern genes, which can be distinguished by comparing their effects with those found in other species. Analysis of Nabour's data by Darlington & Mather concluded that the genes responsible for the morphs of Paratettix texanus have been gradually aggregated into a group which acts as a single switch-mechanism. This explanation was accepted by E.B. Ford and incorporated into his accounts of ecological genetics.|$|E
