5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} <b>cooperative</b> <b>program</b> so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E

25|$|The early co-op {{program was}} not required; {{students}} could enter as traditional students or cooperative education students. Despite this, by the 1935 academic year, nearly 80% {{of the student}} body had chosen the <b>cooperative</b> <b>program.</b> Students initially studied for eight-week-long terms alternating with eight-week-long work experiences. Male students generally took apprenticeships with craftsmen or jobs in factories; female students often served as nursing or teaching assistants. In 1921, when the program was inaugurated, fewer than 1% of available co-op jobs were located outside of Ohio, but this had grown to about 75% within 15 years.|$|E

25|$|In 1911 {{the school}} {{relocated}} to the Stroh building, {{just south of}} downtown Milwaukee. That same year the School of Engineering offered its first degree in electrical engineering. During this time Werwath recruited school sponsors from companies around Milwaukee, including Allen Bradley. This resulted in a <b>cooperative</b> <b>program</b> where students could be employed at local businesses {{to help pay for}} their tuition. In 1912 the School of Engineering initiated its first student publication, electroforce, and in 1913 the school gained its first fraternity, Phi Delta Omega. Also in 1912 Wisconsin provided official recognition to the School of Engineering, granting its programs a state license in both vocational training and engineering education. On March 17, 1917, an official charter was given to the School of Engineering to grant the bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. This day is now celebrated every year on campus with school-sponsored and student-led events. The School of Engineering also approved the first units of Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and Student Army Training Corps (SATC).|$|E

The resulting implementation of the IA-64 64-bit architecture was the Itanium, finally introduced in June 2001. The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64, which was AMD's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture (Intel uses the name Intel 64, previously EM64T).
