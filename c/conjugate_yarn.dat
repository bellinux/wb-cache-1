PET/PTT <b>conjugate</b> <b>yarn</b> has a three-dimension spiral and {{permanent}} crimp, which endow the yarn and loomage with excellent performances of crimp extension and crimp recovery. The residual deformation and internal {{stress of the}} self-crimp yarn can be eliminated after the moist heat treatment, {{in order to develop}} the favorable crimp extension and crimp recovery of the self-crimp yarn, and to give the loomage soft handle and good dimension stability. Crimp shrinkage, crimp module, etc, of the different types of PET/PTT yarn, were tested, and the axial morphology of the yarn was observed, to investigate the effect of linear density, moist heat temperature on PET/PTT yarn...|$|E
