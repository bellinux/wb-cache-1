This paper presents a system which is able to play chess but also fulfills the requirements of multi-modal systems. The system uses a <b>camcoder</b> for following the chess game and for the communication with the player uses audio and video devices...|$|E
40|$|Utilization {{of video}} camera at {{physical}} measurement This thesis is aimed {{to use of}} a <b>camcoder</b> during physical measurements purposed for high school students. The thesis includes theoretical part, which is about physics lesson basic structure viewed {{from the point of}} educational goals. Further it describes a manual for recording the video for video analysis and basic presentation of the Tracker program. The practical part shows applicable excercises and their physical analysis. Exemplary working sheets in an electronic form filled in according to videoanalyses in the Tracker program are included as well...|$|E

Methods: Analyse of printed or non-printed (electronic) documents. Production of texts for DVD presentation Production of video records. Creation of scenarios Selection of <b>camcoder</b> Editing video records Option of terrain Production of model DVD presentation. Creation of program interface Creation of computer graphics Results: Snowboarding is sport with huge complex of skills which we need to train continuously with constant repeating alias these skills are good to practice. The DVD can be used by beginners as an introduction to snowboarding, or the more advanced snowboarders for making their techniques more perfect or to enlarge their knowledge of this nice sport. Key words: Snowboarding, methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{multi-modal}} multi-sensor PROMETHEUS database {{was created}} in support {{of research and development}} activities [PROMETHEUS (FP 7 -ICT- 214901) : [URL] aiming at the creation of a framework for monitoring and interpretation of human behaviors in unrestricted indoor and outdoor environments. The distinctiveness of the PROMETHEUS database comes from the unique sensor sets, used in the various recording scenarios, but also from the database design, which covers a range of real-world applications, correlated to smart-home automation and indoors/outdoors surveillance of public areas. Numerous single-person and multi-person scenarios, but also scenarios with interactions between groups of people, motivated by these applications were implemented with the help of skilled actors and supernumerary personnel. In these scenarios, the actors and personnel were instructed to implement a range of typical and atypical behaviors, and simulations of emergency and crisis situations. In summary, the database contains more than 4 h of synchronized recordings from heterogeneous sensors (an infrared motion detection sensor, thermal imaging cameras, overview/surveillance video cameras, close-view video cameras, a 3 D camera, a stereoscopic camera, a general-purpose <b>camcoder,</b> microphone arrays, and motion capture equipment) collected in common setups, simulating smart-home environment, airport, and ATM security environment. Selected scenes of the database were annotated for the needs of human detection and tracking. The entire audio part of the database was annotated for the needs of sound event detection, sound source enumeration, emotion recognition, etc...|$|E

Over 12 {{years he}} was a professional coach hockey teams in France (with various interruptions from 1971 to 1994), where he trained teams in Tours, Villard de Lans and Grenoble. The last named team is most associated with him. Les Loups de Brleurs - Wolves in the burner. My father's name is Milan Šprincl. From the age of 5 years he`s playing hockey. From the age of 18 years it played at a professional level in the Czech first league. The most important places in his life are hockey stadiums in Jihlava and Hodonin. Both stadiums stands {{on the site of}} a old cemetery in neighborhood there is a Baroque cemeterychapel. I tried to play hockey, but I failed. I continue in the family tradition of hockey and also the grandfather's work in Grenoble. Documentary film with elements of experimental manipulations and fiction passages will map to the development of French hockey and also the mystique associated with hockey. Attempts to reveal a seemingly random connections between hockey and sacred land {{for the rest of the}} dead. At the same time this film plans to close a series of films with the theme of my personal family history, to which I perceive in abstract forms. The film is shot on VHS <b>camcoder.</b> I shoot hockey stadiums (especially in Hodonin and Jihlava) in which interests me as architectural monumentality of these sports, but also the context in which they are found (hockey arena on former cemeteries, etc.). The next part takes place in France, near Grenoble, where he focuses on the current state of French hockey (interviews with prominent personalities of French hockey - Jean Leblond / Vice President of the French hockey, Dany Grandor / former player Grenobelu - officer team, Stéphane Bailles / first hockey scout in France, Jean - Luc Dalaison / journalist Le Dauphiné and others) and link to my grandfather, who is one of the most important figures in the history of the hockey team Bruleurs Les Loups de Grenoble. Another important part is i work with historical documents (articles in French and Czech press about his grandfather, his personal correspondence, notebooks with notes for training and game strategy, and also relics of his time in France) and a part takes place on the ice rink, where you will be using the other game lines and projections manipulated match in hockey (tells the legend of the mountain Vercors of wolves who ate people). Part of the film is the creation of costumes (especially hockey jerseys) and props...|$|E
