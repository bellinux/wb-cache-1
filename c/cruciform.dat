40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and photophysical characterization of 12 compounds from two new fluorophore architectures, {{in order to}} study the photophysics of <b>cruciforms</b> in relation to stilbenes. Therefore, analogues of <b>cruciforms</b> missing a styryl or arylethynyl branch were synthesized. The response {{of some of these}} T-shaped fluorophores to metal salts and protons in CH 2 Cl 2 was studied. Likewise, the solvatochromicity of all derivatives was studied. The derivatives lacking a distyrylbenzene moiety were found to be photochemically unstable and possessed characteristics similar to stilbenes. Derivatives containing a distyryl branch were found to be photochemically stable, with responses analogous to <b>cruciforms.</b> Committee Member/Second Reader: Jiri Janata; Faculty Mentor: Uwe Bun...|$|R

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are <b>cruciform.</b> While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E

40|$|We have induced a local {{conformational}} transition by positive {{torsional stress}} in small synthetic circular DNA molecules containing <b>cruciforms</b> with immobile or tetramobile branched junctions. The immobile species {{correspond to the}} extruded and intruded extrema of the tetramobile junction. Under normal conditions the sequences of all the branched species prevent them from being re-absorbed into the circle. We have induced positive stress by addition of ethidium to the circle, in a low ionic strength medium. Alterations in gel electrophoretic mobility under increasing concentrations of ethidium suggest that the <b>cruciforms</b> undergo a transition under torsional stress. The product of this transition contains mispaired nucleotides, but interwound backbones. By comparing the electrophoretic mobilities of circles containing these structures {{with that of a}} completely complementary circle of the same length, we conclude that the twist in the mispairing region is similiar to that of completely paired species...|$|R

[...] Moreover, there is data supporting {{the involvement of}} helix-distorting intrinsically curved regions and long G-tetrads in eliciting instability events. In addition, higher breakpoint densities were consistently observed within GC-skewed regions and in the close vicinity of the degenerate sequence motif YMMYMNNMMHM.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cruciform</b> abbey {{is built}} of Bath stone, {{which gives the}} {{exterior}} its yellow colour. It is an atypical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture, with low aisles and nave arcades and a tall clerestory.

5|$|Annette Nicholls, aged 29, {{a mother}} of one from Ipswich, was {{initially}} thought to have gone missing on 4 December, but at the trial it was revealed she was last seen in Ipswich town centre on 8 December. Her family reported her missing after they grew concerned at {{the news of the}} other murders. Nicholls' body was found on 12 December near Levington, naked but not sexually assaulted, and also posed in the <b>cruciform</b> position; a definite cause of death could not be established, but her breathing had been hampered.|$|E
40|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{are formed}} {{as an intermediate}} during DNA recombination as the two strands come together. Recombination occurs during meiosis, and also during DNA double strand repair. Trapping this branched intermediate could prevent DNA repair from occurring in cells which would prove beneficial during cancer treatment. There are many enzymes that cleave Holliday junctions. One such enzyme, T 7 Endonuclease I, was specifically chosen to detect ligand binding {{at the core of}} the junction since its binding and cleavage of <b>cruciforms</b> is well documented. Specialized bifunctional ligands were studied in this project that were designed to bind DNA structures that are held in close proximity to one another. These compounds have two identical binding modules that are connected by a linker of various length and rigidity, with each module binding very weakly; however, when both modules bind the binding affinity is greatly enhanced. The interactions of these compounds with <b>cruciforms</b> are currently being studied...|$|R
25|$|In 2014, St Paul's {{commissioned}} Gerry Judah {{to create}} an artwork in the nave to commemorate the 100th anniversary {{of the beginning of}} the First World War. Two spectacular sculptures consisting of three-dimensional white <b>cruciforms</b> reflect the meticulously maintained war graves of northern France and further afield. Each sculpture is also embellished with miniaturised destroyed residential blocks depicting war zones in the Middle East—Syria, Baghdad, Afghanistan—thus connecting 100 years of warfare.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{possible}} involvement of DNA <b>cruciforms</b> in {{the initiation of}} DNA replication, we used two monoclonal antibodies, 2 D 3 and 4 B 4, with anti-cruciform DNA specificity. Synchronized CV- 1 cells were released into S phase for hourly intervals up to 6 h and permeabilized {{in the presence of}} monoclonal antibodies, under conditions that allow limited DNA replication. Exposure of the permeabilized cells to 2 D 3 or 4 B 4 resulted in a 2 - to 6 -fold enhancement of incorporation of labeled precursor nucleotide over the 6 h period. Approximately 50 % of the enhanced synthesis was sensitive to aphidicolin, and the enhancing effect of 2 D 3 was abolished by absorption with immunobead anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Dot-blot hybridization analyses of DNA isolated from anti-cruciform antibody treatment groups showed a similar 2 - to 11 -fold increase in the relative copy number of low copy probes. In contrast, exposure of the permeabilized cells to a monoclonal antibody directed against Z-DNA and B-DNA had no significant effect on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that <b>cruciforms</b> are present in replicating DNA and that they are recognized and stabilized by the monoclonal antibodies...|$|R
5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the <b>cruciform</b> terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Justinian also {{tore down}} the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The {{original}} building was a <b>cruciform</b> basilica {{with a central}} domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise <b>cruciform</b> but with a central dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over {{the arms of the}} cross had pendentives but no windows. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church.|$|E
5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, <b>cruciform</b> piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Structured {{forms of}} DNA with intrastrand pairing are {{generated}} in several cellular processes and {{are involved in}} biological functions. These structures may arise on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) produced during replication, bacterial conjugation, natural transformation, or viral infections. Furthermore, negatively supercoiled DNA can extrude inverted repeats as hairpins in structures called <b>cruciforms.</b> Whether they are on ssDNA or as <b>cruciforms,</b> hairpins can modify the access of proteins to DNA, and in some cases, they can be directly recognized by proteins. Folded DNAs {{have been found to}} play an important role in replication, transcription regulation, and recognition of the origins of transfer in conjugative elements. More recently, they were shown to be used as recombination sites. Many of these functions are found on mobile genetic elements likely to be single stranded, including viruses, plasmids, transposons, and integrons, thus giving some clues as to the manner in which they might have evolved. We review here, with special focus on prokaryotes, the functions in which DNA secondary structures play a role and the cellular processes giving rise to them. Finally, we attempt to shed light on the selective pressures leading to the acquisition of functions for DNA secondary structures...|$|R

5000|$|Extruded <b>cruciforms</b> {{can lead}} to {{frameshift}} mutations when a DNA sequence has inverted repeats {{in the form of}} a palindrome combined with regions of direct repeats on either side. During transcription, slippage and partial dissociation of the polymerase from the template strand {{can lead to}} both deletion and insertion mutations. [...] Deletion occurs when a portion of the unwound template strand forms a stem-loop that gets [...] "skipped" [...] by the transcription machinery. Insertion occurs when a stem-loop forms in a dissociated portion of the nascent (newly synthesized) strand causing a portion of the template strand to be transcribed twice.|$|R
5|$|Seibal {{was first}} settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It {{reached its peak}} {{population}} in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, {{at the end of}} the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A <b>cruciform</b> Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar to those found in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a <b>cruciform</b> arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as site-specific recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, <b>cruciform</b> structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E
40|$|In its {{original}} formulation the Peak Stress Method (PSM) was adopted {{to assess the}} fatigue strength when only mode I stresses are singular (for example at the toe of fillet-welds) or significant (for example {{at the root of}} load-carrying fillet welded <b>cruciforms).</b> Nevertheless in welded lap joints and cover plates both mode I and mode II stresses are singular at the weld root, where fatigue cracks are likely to initiate. In the present paper the PSM is extended to mode II loading conditions and then an equivalent peak stress is derived, which is used to assess either weld toe or weld root fatigue failures...|$|R

5000|$|The {{upper parts}} of the cathedral's two towers {{suffered}} from earthquakes, were badly damaged during the Ottoman bombardments of 1571, and were never repaired. With the Venetians defeated and Famagusta fallen by August 1571, Cyprus fell under Ottoman control and the cathedral was converted into a mosque, renamed the [...] "St. Sophia Mosque of Mağusa". Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of creatures or iconography; consequently, nearly all statuary, <b>cruciforms,</b> stained glass, frescos, and paintings were removed or plastered over, {{as well as most}} tombs and the altar.

50|$|Bioinformatics {{approaches}} {{support the}} idea that, by these properties, S/MARs not only separate a given transcriptional unit (chromatin domain) from its neighbors, but also provide platforms for the assembly of factors enabling transcriptional events within a given domain. An increased propensity to separate the DNA strands (the so-called 'stress induced duplex destabilization' potential, SIDD) can serve the formation of secondary structures such as <b>cruciforms</b> or slippage structures, which are recognizable features {{for a number of}} enzymes (DNAses, topoisomerases, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerases and enzymes of the histone-acetylation and DNA-methylation apparatus). S/MARs have been classified as either being constitutive (acting as permanent domain boundaries in all cell types) or facultative (cell type- and activity-related) depending on their dynamic properties.|$|R
50|$|Delahaye 175 was an {{automobile}} manufactured by Delahaye between 1947 and 1951. The {{last of the}} large Delahayes, the type 175 was essentially a brand new chassis and engine. The chassis bore {{little resemblance to the}} preceding Type 135, other than the cockpit area with its welded driveshaft tunnel and welded stamped-steel floor. The assembly formed a rigid stressed-steel semi-monocoque structure. This allowed the seat rails to be mounted on the plane of the bottom of the chassis, instead of on top of it, as competitors were doing, since their chassis had X-braced <b>cruciforms</b> instead of Delahaye's semi-monocoque cockpit. This made the completed Coachbuilt Delahaye body lower in profile than its competition. The rigid chassis structure also delighted the coachbuilders.|$|R
40|$|Extracts of calf thymus {{have been}} {{fractionated}} {{to reveal a}} nuclease activity that specifically cleaves model Holliday junctions in vitro. The products of cleavage are unbranched linear duplex DNA molecules. Using synthetic four-way junctions, we show that the major sites of cutting are diametrically opposed, at sites one nucleotide {{from the base of}} the junction. Other types of four-way junctions, including pseudo-cruciform structures and <b>cruciforms</b> extruded from supercoiled plasmids, are also cleaved by the nuclease. The Mr of the partially purified activity, determined by gel filtration, is approximately 75, 000. The calf thymus enzyme provides the first example of an endonuclease from a higher eukaryote that acts specifically on branch points in DNA, and indicates that junction-resolving proteins are normal constituents of somatic cells...|$|R
