40|$|Hydronamics of Explosion {{presents}} the research {{results for the}} problems of underwater explosions and contains {{a detailed analysis of}} the structure and the parameters of the wave fields generated by explosions of cord and spiral charges, a description of the formation mechanisms {{for a wide range of}} cumulative flows at underwater explosions near the free surface, and the relevant mathematical models. Shock-wave transformation in bubbly liquids, shock-wave amplification due to collision and focusing, and the formation of bubble detonation waves in reactive bubbly liquids are studied in detail. Particular emphasis is placed on the investigation of wave processes in cavitating liquids, which incorporates the concepts of the strength of real liquids containing natural microinhomogeneities, the relaxation of tensile stress, and the <b>cavitation</b> <b>fracture</b> of a liquid as the inversion of its two-phase state under impulsive (explosive) loading. The problems are classed among essentially nonlinear processes that occur under shock loading of liquids and may be of interest to researchers in physical acoustics, mechanics of multiphase media, shock-wave processes in condensed media, explosive hydroacoustics, and cumulation...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{measurements}} of high shear rate viscosity at near atmospheric but variable pressure suggest {{the importance of}} low normal stress and <b>cavitation</b> or fluid <b>fracture</b> {{in the type of}} stress field existing in elastohydrodynam ic inlets and classical hydrodynamic configurations. An experimental basis is given for three regimes of traction in concentrated contacts: a thin film regime characterized by high traction and determined by lambda ratio, a thick film regime characterized by low traction and determined by the speed parameter, and the elastohydrodynamic regime for which traction is controlled by limiting shear stress. Traction measurements were performed with various liquids, two solid lubricants, and a grease. Film thickness and traction {{measurements of}} polymer blends and base oils are compared...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of gels present qualitatively contradictory behavior; they are commonly soft but also notoriously brittle. We investigate the elasticity and fracture behavior of swollen polymer networks using a simple experimental method to induce cavitation within a gel and adapt scaling theories {{to capture the}} observed transition from reversible to irreversible deformations {{as a function of}} polymer volume fraction. It is shown quantitatively that the transition from reversible <b>cavitation</b> to irreversible <b>fracture</b> depends on the polymer volume fraction and an initial defect length scale. The use of cavitation experiments permits characterization of network properties across length scales ranging from µm to mm. We anticipate that these results may significantly enhance the understanding of {{mechanical properties}} of soft materials, both synthetic and biological...|$|R
5000|$|One {{exception}} to this is when a very powerful temporary cavity intersects with the spine. In this case, the resulting blunt trauma can slam the vertebrae together hard enough to either sever the spinal cord, or damage it enough to knock out, stun, or paralyze the target. For instance, in the shootout between eight FBI agents and two bank robbers on April 11, 1986 in Miami, Florida (see FBI Miami shootout, 1986), Special Agent Gordon McNeill was struck in the neck by a high-velocity [...]223 bullet fired by Michael Platt. While the bullet did not directly contact the spine, and the wound incurred was not ultimately fatal, the temporary cavitation was sufficient to render SA McNeill paralyzed for several hours. Temporary <b>cavitation</b> may similarly <b>fracture</b> the femur if it is narrowly missed by a bullet.|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] starting point is a variational model in nonlinear elasticity that allows for <b>cavitation</b> and <b>fracture</b> that was introduced by Henao and Mora-Corral (Arch Rational Mech Anal 197 : 619 – 655, 2010). The total energy to minimize {{is the sum of}} the elastic energy plus the energy produced by crack and surface formation. It is a free discontinuity problem, since the crack set and the set of new surface are unknowns of the problem. The expression of the functional involves a volume integral and two surface integrals, and this fact makes the problem numerically intractable. In this paper we propose an approximation (in the sense of Γ-convergence) by functionals involving only volume integrals, which makes a numerical approximation by finite elements feasible. This approximation has some similarities to the Modica–Mortola approximation of the perimeter and the Ambrosio–Tortorelli approximation of the Mumford–Shah functional, but with the added difficulties typical of nonlinear elasticity, in which the deformation is assumed to be one-to-one and orientation-preservingD.

40|$|Motivated by {{experiments}} on titanium alloys of Petrinic et al. (2006), which show {{the formation of}} cracks through the growth and coalescence of voids in ductile fracture, we consider the problem of formulating a variational model in nonlinear elasticity compatible both with cavitation {{and the appearance of}} discontinuities across two-dimensional surfaces. As in the model for cavitation of Müller and Spector (1995) we address this problem, which is connected to the sequential weak continuity of the determinant of the deformation gradient in spaces of functions having low regularity, by means of adding an appropriate surface energy term to the elastic energy. Based upon considerations of invertibility, we derive an expression for the surface energy that admits a physical and a geometrical interpretation, and that allows for the formulation of a model with better analytical properties. We obtain, in particular, important regularity results for the inverses of deformations, as well as the weak continuity of the determinants and the existence of minimizers. We show, further, that the creation of surface can be modeled by carefully analyzing the jump set of the inverses, and we point out some connections between the analysis of <b>cavitation</b> and <b>fracture,</b> the theory of SBV functions, and the theory of Cartesian currents of Giaquinta, Modica, and Soucek. In addition to the above, we extend previous work of Sivaloganathan, Spector and Tilakraj (2006) on the approximation of minimizers for the problem of cavitation with a constraint in the number of flaw points, and present some numerical results for this problem.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} modeling {{ductile fracture}} using a cohesive zone model (CZM) and finite element (FE) methods. A FE program system (FECGS), {{which includes a}} pre-processor and a post-processor, has been developed for that purpose. A simple CZM has been proposed. A FE CZM technique has been developed for implementation of the continuum cohesive zone model into FE code FECGS. The model {{has been applied to}} study fracture behaviour of homogeneous materials under mode I small scale yielding (SSY) condition with emphasis on the effect of material properties, cohesive zone parameters and T-stress on prediction, and large scale yielding (LSY) crack growth with focus on prediction of the geometry and size effects. The model has been extended to simulate three-dimensional crack growth. Approaches for determination of the CZM parameters have been suggested. Comparisons of experiments and numerical predictions have been made for a round notched tension bar, a three-dimensional side-grooved compact tension and a three-dimensional surface cracked tension specimen of an aluminum alloy 2024 FC with aim of verification of the model. Systematic parameter studies have been performed for a heterogeneous material system (a thin ductile layer bonded by two elastic substrates) under both SSY and LSY conditions, emphasizing the effect of geometry and mismatch in material properties on fracture behaviour and mechanisms such as plastic <b>cavitation</b> and <b>fracture</b> instability. The aim of this investigation is to develop a predictive tool for the engineering application such as prediction of mechanical performance of structure and for understanding the material failure, based on a simple material model.

40|$|The {{topology}} of surfaces {{formed by}} subcritical crack growth was {{investigated by the}} method of mapping using atomic force microscopy. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine how well the “upper ” and “lower ” surfaces matched after they have been formed by a crack moving at a slow velocity. Specifically, are features left in the fracture surfaces of silicate glasses that would indicate the formation of cavities during the fracture process? Studies were carried out on silica glass and soda-lime-silicate glass. Fracture surfaces were formed either in water or in moist environments at velocities that ranged from 10 - 7 m/s to 10 - 3 m/s. This procedure covered almost the entire range of velocities used in subcritical crack growth experiments in glass. Fracture surfaces formed during our studies were found to “match ” over the entire range of velocities and for all environments studied. Normal to the fracture surface, the surfaces matched to an accuracy of better than 1 nm; horizontal to the fracture plane, the match was better than 5 nm. Within these limits, no evidence for <b>cavitation</b> within the <b>fracture</b> surface was found. The data obtained in this study was compared with results from other atomic force microscopy studies and with the results of molecular dynamics simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} study of <b>cavitation</b> damage and <b>fracture</b> of a superplastic copper alloy, Coronze 638, has been made. Cavities {{are found to}} nucleate at large particles present {{in the form of}} stringers. The size and shape of cavities, as well as the level of damage up to fracture are essentially independent of strain rate over regions I and II of the σ-ε{lunate} curve, as are the true strain to fracture and the development of t instabilities. As the strain rate increases into region III, the level of damage to failure decreases, while the true failure strain increases and necks become sharper. Extensive cavity coalescence is observed up to strains of about 1. 5, producing a number of large (> 100 μm) cavities which exhibit a high stability, and little tendency to coalescence. This allows the sample to sustain a very high level of cavitation without failure. The mechanism of cavity growth for small isolated cavities (< 10 μm) is thought to be diffusive growth constrained by matrix creep at low strain rates, with a transition to plasticity controlled growth at large strain rates. For larger cavities growth appears to be entirely creep controlled. Final fracture occurs by the material exhaustion in the ligaments between voids once the reduction in the cross section exceeds about 30 %. No large instability either in flow or damage seems to be involved in this process...|$|R
