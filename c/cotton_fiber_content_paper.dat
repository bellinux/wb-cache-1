40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{mechanical}} properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), cotton fiber/PLA composites were prepared by melting compounding and injection molding. The effects of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> and coupling agent on mechanical properties, crystalline behavior and interface morphology of the composites were studied by universal testing machine, DSC and SEM, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} crystallinity of the composites increased gradually with the increase of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>content,</b> whereas the mechanical properties of the composites increased firstly and then decreased with further addition of cotter fiber. The composite with 20 wt % <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> had an optimal mechanical performance. In addition, with the incorporation of 1 wt % coupling agent, the interfacial adhesion between <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> and PLA improved obviously, and the mechanical properties of the composites increased accordingly. Compared with the neat PLA, the tensile strength, flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength of the resultant composites were increased by 66. 0 %, 27. 4 %, 45. 8 % and 60. 4 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of waste <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> from the textile {{industry}} to produce composites with unsaturated polyester and to evaluate the performance of glass (G) / <b>cotton</b> (C) <b>fiber</b> laminates, particularly their mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties. Distinct stacking sequences were studied but the overall <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> was kept constant. In general, hybrid laminates exhibited intermediate mechanical properties compared to those of the pure laminates, and optimum performance was obtained when the glass fiber mats were placed on the surfaces of the composite. Furthermore, some hybrid laminates exhibited superior dynamic mechanical performance, even compared to the pure glass laminate. Lower tan delta peak height (related to better fiber-matrix interaction) values and higher Tg were reported for the [C/G/ G ¯]s and [G/C/ C ¯]s samples which, together with the [G/C/ G ¯]s sample, exhibited the best results for reinforcement effectiveness and loss modulus peak height. Therefore, it is found possible to partially replace the glass <b>fiber</b> by waste <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> considering that the final product may be optimized for mechanical property, which requires glass fiber at the surface of the laminate, or for dynamic mechanical properties, that allows higher <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>content...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural fibers {{can be used}} as {{reinforcements}} in thermoplastic non-structural applications. Commingling {{them with}} matrix fibers lowers the melt flow distance of molten matrix during the processing.

The modification of the interface by chemical treatments of the matrix or reinforcement with reagents like potassium permanganate, benzoyl peroxide, and maleic anhydride modified PP enhances some mechanical properties like tear strength of cotton fiber-reinforced PP commingled composite systems. <b>Fiber</b> <b>content,</b> treatments, and moisture also varies dielectric constant and volume resistivity...|$|R

To {{convert the}} {{hydrophilic}} <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> into hydrophobic, grafting methyl methacrylate (MMA) on <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> surface using ARGET (activators regenerated by electron transfer) ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) was studied in this paper. Four parallel experiments with different reaction time (2 h/ 4 h/ 6 h/ 8 h) were designed.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of chitosan onto cellulose <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> introduces antimicrobial properties, mainly {{created by}} the amount and location of amino groups. Therefore, {{it is important to}} be able to analyze both parameters, especially in a heterogeneous system, namely <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> coated with chitosan. In this research, three different analytical techniques were applied to determine amino groups of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> coated with chitosan.

In addition, the chemical surface composition regarding non-modified, as well as modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> (coated with chitosan), was investigated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The results from a combination of these methods show that chitosan treatment introduces more than 14 mmol/kg of accessible amino groups onto the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b> The results were in good agreement with the results of XPS.

30|$|In the industry, {{decisions}} on apparel design and product development {{are made with}} close interactions with global sourcers. First, <b>fiber</b> <b>contents</b> (or raw material contents) not only affect {{the cost of the}} total production but also environmental impacts during the production. Let’s assume that a designer decided a <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> to be a natural <b>fiber,</b> such as <b>cotton,</b> rather than a synthetic fiber, such as polyester, for a men’s knit shirt for the upcoming season. This simple decision could make a huge impact on retail prices. For example, in 2011, cotton prices had quadrupled since 2002 (National Cotton Council of America 2012); the cost difference between polyester and cotton fabric was so significant that the change in <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> was not something that the design team could simply make without consulting global sourcers. Sourcers {{may not be able to}} produce products for which the company planned. Instead, the sourcer may suggest a cotton/polyester blend fabric for knit shirts. In addition, the change in <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> also affects the duty rates when the global sourcer imports the finished products from foreign countries. In the case of the United States, men’s knit shirts with a majority of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> are subject to 19.7  % of the import cost as duty. If the same shirts are made out of synthetic fibers, they will be subject to 32  % of duty rate (Idem). These are important factors that the design team must consider and work with the sourcing team to find the optimal point between fiber choice and cost to produce and import. Different countries have different duty assessment policies and duty rates. One strategy in <b>fiber</b> <b>content</b> may work for one country but may not work for another country with different duty rates. Therefore, sourcers and design team must assess the market of the finished goods comprehensively before making final {{decisions on}} fiber choices.|$|R

To gain insight into the evolutionary genomics of cotton domestication, we conducted comparative transcriptome profiling of developing <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> using RNA-Seq.

Among these, ~ 5, 000 genes are differentially expressed during primary and secondary cell wall synthesis between wild and domesticated cottons, with a biased distribution among chromosomes.
