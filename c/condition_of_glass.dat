40|$|The thermal {{properties}} and devitrification behaviour of new fluoride glasses {{were determined by}} means of thermoanalytical techniques. The glass-forming and stability parameters have been defined and evaluated from the measured characteristic temperatures. The kinetics of devitrification of bulk glass samples was investigated by combining data obtained from both isothermal and constant-heating-rate techniques. The kinetic data were also used to construct the time-temperature-transformation (T-T-T) curves and temperature-heating rate-transformation (T-HR-T) curves. These graphical illustrations emulate the thermal <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> preforms while awaiting fibre drawing.

In this paper, the influences of ambient gas or vacuum <b>condition,</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> confinement and of the grain size of spherical nitroguanidine on the product formation was investigated. Also the initiation behavior was analysed. It was found that composition of the detonation gases is strongly dependent on the grain size of spherical nitroguanidine.

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the defluidization region of a gas-solid fluidized bed system composed by Geldart group D particles using the Gaussian spectral pressure distribution technique, {{which is based on}} pressure fluctuation measurements in the plenum. In experiments, the defluidization <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> beads with apparent density of 2, 450 kg/m 3 was induced in a plexiglas column of 0. 11 m in inner diameter and 1. 0 m in height. The gas-solid behavior close to the incipient fluidization condition was assessed for two fixed bed heights (0. 10 and 0. 20 m) and two mean sizes of particles (1. 55 and 2. 18 mm in diameter). The bed was fluidized with air at environment temperature. The experimental equipment was instrumented with a pressure transmitter connected to a data acquisition system in order to record the pressure fluctuations of the gas-solid flow. The results showed that the defluidization region can be detected efficiently by using the Gaussian spectral pressure distribution technique, which contributes for a better control of fluidized bed processes...|$|E

40|$|The nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) phenomenon has been well known to physicists since the early fifties. Practical applications of this technique can nowadays be found in branches like medical imaging, protein analysis etc. However, conventional NMR measuring devices cannot be used for in-situ industrial applications. This disadvantage is mainly due {{to the need for}} sample extraction required by these enclosing systems, but also to their large size and their fragility. Thanks to its light-weighted and rugget design, the one-sided access ¹H-NMR device, which was recently developed at IZFP, offers the capability to be used in an industrial context. The aim of this presentation is to show the technical principles and the versatility of this new non-destructive and non-invasive technique for laboratory as well as for industrial applications. Examples such as dynamic monitoring of concrete hardening processes, measurement of moisture depth profiles in sandstone and characterization of the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> fiber-mat-reinforced polymer layers are briefly discussed.

40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) sensors {{have been}} developed quickly in {{the past twenty years}} in biosensing. However, the sensitivity of them restricts them from small molecular detection. This thesis focuses on the sensor chips of the SPR sensors and presents two potential methods to improve the sensitivity of currently used SPR sensor chips: the bimetallic layer sensor chip and surface roughness control of glass slide. The bimetallic layer sensor chip has been proved to produce better sensitivity performance than the currently used mono gold layer sensor chip by simulation because it takes the advantage of the good sensitivity performance that silver produces and protects silver from oxidizing by the outer gold layer. The surface of the glass slide, as a part of SPR sensor chip, is assumed to be planar in all the current research of SPR biosensors, which is not possible in real case. The surface roughness effect of the glass slide on the sensitivity of SPR sensor chip is investigated. Simulation has suggested that the improvement in the surface roughness of glass slide can enhance the sensitivity performance of SPR sensor chip. By controlling the surface roughness <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> slide through polishing, experiments shows that the sensitivity of SPR sensor chips is improved by making the surface of the glass slide smooth...|$|E

In particular, the substantial {{rate of the}} energy transfer in the third step from Yb 3 + to Tm 3 + under excitation at 975 nm, which determined the final blue UCPL intensity, was estimated {{as a function of}} the rare-earth concentration. With an aid of analytical methods of PL lifetime and Judd–Ofelt theory, it was revealed that the highest energy transfer rate was achieved to be 2. 07 × 10 − 17 cm 3 /s for x = 0. 2, and further increasing Tm 2 O 3 content x in the fixed Yb 2 O 3 resulted in the decrease in the energy transfer rate. One of the plausible causes was concentration quenching of Yb 3 + ions. The other was back-transfer from Tm 3 + to Yb 3 + ions.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{laser scanning}} methodology {{applied to the}} study of a gothic stained-glass window: the work can help understanding how glass objects are measured by laser scanner, conforming to more parameters. A glass window from King’s Chapel, Cambridge (UK) was modelled: a vertical ensemble, divided into more parts, made of glass, coloured during its realisation or coloured before being placed on the wall. Thus, a different sensitivity to laser beam is expected from glass. The acquisition was performed using Konica Minolta Vivid 910, with a 5 x 8 scan matrix. Registration via ICP algorithm was carried in 8 horizontal stripes. Scans seem to be quite homogeneous, except some lacunas, probably depending on a “brownout-effect ” induced by the presence of stain structure, partly obscuring glass surface. Otherwise they could be depending on local <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> causing loose of signal from the surface. Some details show a particular noise in the acquisition, probably caused by an outdoor metal scaffolding, especially in more transparent areas. A comparison with the acquisition of an object protected by a glass showcase is illustrated too, to study the response of glass material. It was argued that glass painted with non covering colours is more sensitive to such object while covering colours (or coloured glass) “stop ” laser beam and give no noise. Besides with painted sheets, a 3 D laser scanning model can give a sub-millimetrical mapping with the thickness of colour layers: thus, noise induced by the metal scaffolding can be evaluated too. 1...|$|E

After several passes of laser ablation, we observed two different kinds of damage morphologies on the cross-section of the cut channel. They are distinguished to be the damage region caused by high-density free-electrons and the heat-affected zone due to the heat accumulation, respectively. Furthermore, micro-cracks can be observed on the top surface of the workpiece near the cut edge. The nano-cracks could be generated by high energy free-electrons but opened and developed to be visible micro-cracks by thermal stress generated in the heat-affected zone. The crack length was proportional to the volume of heat-affected zone.

40|$|Abstract]: Microwave {{processing}} of adhesives {{is a relatively}} new technology alternative that provides new approaches for enhancing material properties as well as economic advantages through energy savings and accelerated product development. Alternative in the sense that most adhesives are normally cured in ambient conditions or in ovens. However, the most commonly used facilities for microwave {{processing of}} materials operate on fixed frequency microwaves (FFM), e. g., 2. 45 GHz. This paper presents a review of microwave technologies, processing methods and industrial applications, using variable frequency microwave (VFM) facilities. The technique offers rapid, uniform and selective heating over a large volume at a high energy coupling efficiency. This is accomplished using a preselected bandwidth sweeping around a central frequency by employing tunable frequency sources. Successful applications of these modern facilities include finding out the optimum cavity <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> or carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites, and of adhesives, e. g., two-part five-minute Araldite, and the joining of the above-mentioned composite materials with, or without, primers. Finding out the optimum cavity <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> a material has helped identify the best frequency range to process the material using microwave energy and by means of the VFM facility. Microwave energy has been used to rapidly cure several types of two-part epoxy based adhesives, e. g., Araldite. Bond strengths obtained using variable frequency microwave (VFM) techniques are compared with adhesive joints cured in fixed frequency microwave (FFM) conditions...|$|R

30|$|A {{new method}} for {{improving}} glass strength {{has been proposed}} and investigated based {{on the surface and}} subsurface <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> different <b>glass</b> substrates. For borosilicate glasses, 750 -nm-deep nanostructures enhanced the bending strength by 118  % (from 0.28 to 0.61  GPa), and 500 -nm-deep nanostructures enhanced the bending strength by 48  % (from 0.23 to 0.34  GPa) for aluminosilicate glasses. In addition, these nanostructures increased the Weibull modulus of the substrates, which confirmed the usefulness of this method. The nanostructured fused silica with artificial defects that were 4 -μm-deep exhibited nearly the same bending strength as plain fused silica but with a higher Weibull modulus. The number of fragments was higher during fracture, which is consistent with suppression of the artificial defect. Failure of scratch-resistant and toughened glass is very common in the presence of surface defects, and this newly developed method may improve the performance <b>of</b> all <b>glass</b> types despite different defect densities or the presence of dominant surface flaws.|$|R

Within this framework, the mechanical behavior of the French simulated nuclear waste glass SON 68 was studied by Vickers indentation and fracture experiments in air and in a corrosive solution. The glass was corroded at 90 °C in a solution enriched with Si, B, and Na. The {{results showed that the}} glass corrosion enhances the cracks propagation relative to experiments in air. The indentation fracture toughness ($K_{IC}$) obtained using a four-point bending test showed that the $K_{IC}$ <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> decreased with increasing corrosion time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The study {{investigated}} the crystallization and sintering behavior in Li 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (LAS) glass powder. The sintered sample was produced with a glass particle (Φ= 44 ㎛). The relative density and transmittance of the sintered samples showed the highest value at the temperature of 650 ℃. In the higher temperature than 650 ℃, the crystal growth occurred to decrease the densification of Li 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (LAS) glass powder. Main crystalline phase was β-spodumene in the glass powder. From the non-isothermal differential thermal analysis, the crystallization of the particles (Φ= 44 ㎛) was observed at 640 ~ 684 ℃ {{with respect to the}} heating rate. The activation energy of crystallization (EC) and Avrami constant (n) calculated by Kissinger and Ozawa equations indicated that the surface and the bulk crystallization occurred simultaneously in the glass. The optimum sintering <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> this <b>glass</b> powder was 650 ℃ without crystal growth of β-spodumene, although a nucleation or nano-crystal growth occurred...|$|R
