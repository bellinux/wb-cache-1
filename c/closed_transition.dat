This technique, therefore, cannot be extended to species-such as molecules-which, in general, do not have <b>closed</b> optical <b>transitions.</b> Finally, the lack of any requirement for having a <b>closed</b> optical <b>transition</b> implies that this method for cooling atoms may also be applicable to cooling molecules...|$|R

50|$|The {{electronic}} central switch {{has only}} to open its circuit forcing the motor current to transfer into the 80% winding in a no-break, <b>closed</b> <b>transition</b> action. It can provide frictionless, accurate and instant switching actions {{that are necessary to}} operate the changeover point at 30 degrees.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} {{required that the}} <b>closed</b> <b>transition,</b> or overlap time, be less than 100 milliseconds. If either source is not present or not acceptable (such as when normal power fails) the switch must operate in a break-before-make mode (standard open transition operation) to ensure no backfeeding occurs.|$|E
40|$|Single channel {{currents}} {{were recorded}} with microsecond time resolution from large-conductance calcium-activated K+ channels {{to examine the}} details of the opening and closings transitions. Analysis of averaged <b>closing</b> <b>transitions</b> indicated that the initial average conductance step for closing was to the 90 - 95 % closed channel current level. Averaged brief closings (approximately 50 microseconds) reopened from the initial 90 - 95 % level, whereas averaged longer closings (> 300 microseconds) closed completely from this level over the next 50 - 100 microseconds. The 90 - 95 % initial closed level in the averaged current records resulted typically from the average of both complete and partial closings. From 45 - 80 % of the initial closings were complete and 20 - 55 % were to brief lifetime (approximately 50 microseconds) subconductance levels at 65 - 90 % of the completely closed level. Averaged opening transitions were typically mirror images of averaged <b>closing</b> <b>transitions.</b> To extend the analysis to the very brief conductance changes that underlie the flickers of the single channel current toward the closed current level, flickers, brief closings, and longer closings were averaged separately and their slopes compared. The slopes were similar (within the 3 % resolution of the method), suggesting similar initial conductance steps. Similar initial closing properties for both the briefer and longer closings would be expected if the channel first passed through the kinetic and subconductance states associated with the briefer closings (including flickers) before entering the longer <b>closed</b> states. Such <b>transitions</b> would provide an explanation for the observation that openings and closings often occur in two steps...|$|R

It is shown that canting of spins is not allowed at x= 0. 3 though is at x= 0. 4. The observed magnetic reflections from the sample with x= 0. 3 may be described as arising from two spatially distributed phases with <b>close</b> <b>transition</b> temperatures but different easy axes and ranges of stability.

5000|$|The {{selectivity}} of some hydroxylations may be drastically {{improved in}} some cases {{with the addition of}} coordinating groups alpha to the oxaziridine ring as oxaziridines 3b and 3c in the table above.

5000|$|A <b>closed</b> <b>transition</b> usually {{uses the}} words [...] "consisting of". Use of this phrase limits the {{preamble}} to exactly what follows and nothing more. An {{example would be}} a patent claim for a pencil, which might say in the preamble [...] "a writing device", followed by the <b>closed</b> <b>transition</b> [...] "consisting of", and concluding with a description such as [...] "a cylindrical piece of lead, graphite, or another material similarly capable of leaving a mark when drawn against a surface, and a second surrounding material encasing the first". A third party who sold pencils including both a cylinder of writing material and a casing material, but added to his pencils an eraser fixed to one end, would therefore not be {{in violation of the}} patent. Use of such a transition makes it easy for a competitor to compete with the patented product without infringing it, because it allows the competitor to sell a similar device so long as the competitor makes an addition to what is claimed. However, it also may assist the patent owner in avoiding prior art, which might otherwise block the patent from issuing.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{transferring}} the load to the backup generator, an ATS may also command the backup generator to start, {{based on the}} voltage monitored on the primary supply. The transfer switch isolates the backup generator from the electric utility when the generator is on and providing temporary power. The control capability of a transfer switch may be manual only, {{or a combination of}} automatic and manual. The switch transition mode (see below) of a transfer switch may be Open Transition (OT) (the usual type), or <b>Closed</b> <b>Transition</b> (CT)).|$|E
40|$|Cooperativity {{among the}} four {{subunits}} helps give rise to the remarkable voltage sensitivity of Shaker potassium channels, whose open probability changes tenfold for a 5 -mV change in membrane potential. The cooperativity in these channels is thought to arise from a concerted structural transition as the final step in opening the channel. Recordings of single-channel ionic currents from certain other channel types, {{as well as our}} previous recordings from T 442 S mutant Shaker channels, however, display intermediate conductance levels in addition to the fully open and closed states. These sublevels might represent stepwise, rather than concerted, transitions in the final steps of channel activation. Here, we report a similar fine structure in the <b>closing</b> <b>transitions</b> of Shaker channels lacking the mutation. Describing the deactivation time course with hidden Markov models, we find that two subconductance levels are rapidly traversed during most <b>closing</b> <b>transitions</b> of chimeric, high conductance Shaker channels. The lifetimes of these levels are voltage-dependent, with maximal values of 52 and 22 μs at − 100 mV, and the voltage dependences of transitions among these states suggest that they arise from equivalent conformational changes occurring in individual subunits. At least one subconductance level is found to be traversed in normal conductance Shaker channels. We speculate that voltage-dependent conformational changes in the subunits give rise to changes in a “pore gate” associated with the selectivity filter region of the channel, producing the subconductance states. As a control for the hidden Markov analysis, we applied the same procedures to recordings of the recovery from N-type inactivation in Shaker channels. These transitions are found to be instantaneous in comparison...|$|R

50|$|Typical load {{switching}} applications for which <b>closed</b> <b>transition</b> transfer is desirable include data processing and electronic loads, certain motor and transformer loads, load curtailment systems, or anywhere load interruptions {{of even the}} shortest duration are objectionable. A CTTS is {{not a substitute for}} a UPS (uninterruptible power supply); a UPS has a built-in stored energy that provides power for a prescribed period of time {{in the event of a}} power failure. A CTTS by itself simply assures there will be no momentary loss of power when the load is transferred from one live power source to another.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} loads, however, that are {{affected}} by even the slightest loss of power. There are also operational conditions where it may be desirable to transfer loads with zero interruption of power when conditions permit. For these applications, <b>closed</b> <b>transition</b> transfer switches can be provided. The switch will operate in a make-before-break mode provided both sources are acceptable and synchronized. Typical parameters determining synchronization are: voltage difference less than 5%, frequency difference less than 0.2 Hz, and maximum phase angle between the sources of 5 electrical degrees. This means the engine driving the generator supplying one of the sources generally must be controlled by an isochronous governor.|$|E

40|$|Optical clocks {{based on}} {{ensembles}} of trapped ions promise record frequency accuracy with good short-term stability. Most suitable ion species lack <b>closed</b> <b>transitions,</b> so the clock signal must be read out indirectly by transferring the quantum {{state of the}} clock ions to cotrapped logic ions of a different species. Existing methods of quantum logic readout require a linear overhead in either time {{or the number of}} logic ions. Here we describe a quantum algorithmic readout whose overhead scales logarithmically with the number of clock ions in both of these respects. The scheme allows a quantum nondemolition readout of the number of excited clock ions using a single multispecies gate operation which can also be used in other areas of ion trap technology such as quantum information processing, quantum simulations, metrology, and precision spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Transition rules with {{negative}} premises {{are needed in}} the structural operational semantics of programming and specification con-structs such as priority and interrupt, {{as well as in}} timed extensions of specification languages. The well-known proof-theoretic semantics for transition system specifications involving such rules is based on well-supported proofs for <b>closed</b> <b>transitions.</b> Dealing with open formulae by considering all closed instances is inherently non-modular – proofs are not necessarily preserved by disjoint extensions of the transition system specification. Here, we conservatively extend the notion of well-supported proof to open transition rules. We prove that the resulting semantics is modular, consis-tent, and closed under instantiation. Our results provide the foundations for modular notions of bisimulation such that equivalence can be proved with reference only to the relevant rules, without appealing to all existing closed instantiations of terms. ...|$|R

We analytically describe a number of D 2 -line-shape effects that are of interest in spectroscopic studies of cold dusty white dwarfs: broadening by optical pumping, intensity redistribution within components of D 2 -line HF multiplet for partially <b>closed</b> <b>transitions</b> and asymmetry of absorption lines induced by AC Stark shifts for cyclic transitions...|$|R
