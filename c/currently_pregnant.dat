2500|$|Sarah Sutherland as Catherine Meyer: Selina's reserved, put-upon daughter. Catherine {{is often}} {{caught in the}} middle of Selina's issues, {{especially}} with her father. She tends to have highly liberal views concerning social justice. Although she tries to highlight the differences between herself and her mother, it is consistently shown that Catherine suppresses her own streak of foul-mouthed ambition. She attends film school, and attracts attention for dating a Middle Eastern man. Later, she causes issues for the Meyer campaign when she becomes engaged to a lobbyist. She ultimately breaks off her engagement to protect her mother's administration. She is seen in the fifth season to be filming a White House-based documentary, and becomes romantically involved with her mother's bodyguard and lookalike, Marjorie, alarming her mother. The two subsequently marry. She is <b>currently</b> <b>pregnant</b> with Richard's child through artificial insemination. (Season 1–present) ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} in July 2008 that Matsumoto was dating then 25-year-old tarento Ihara Rin. In {{the evening of}} May 17, 2009, {{it was announced that}} Matsumoto's official bachelorhood had ended with a secret marriage ceremony between himself and the aforementioned Ihara. Ihara, a former weather announcer for the Japanese news program [...] "ズームイン!! Super" [...] (Zoom In!! Super) is nineteen years Matsumoto's junior, and apparently became pregnant by Matsumoto, prompting the marriage. The announcement of the marriage came via fax by Matsumoto's managing organization to several media outlets, including a personal message by Matsumoto himself: [...] "My partner will become an average citizen [...] and is <b>currently</b> <b>pregnant.</b> As this is a delicate time, I would like this to be dealt with as gently as possible. It would be best to hold a press conference, however this situation is awkward and I will refrain from doing so." [...] The original faxed announcement did not contain details on Matsumoto's wife; however it has become widely known that his new partner is Ihara.|$|E

An altercation between Wyatt and Morton was widely {{reported}} in the urban news circuit in 2001, with Wyatt explaining that she had stabbed her husband out of self-defense and to protect her children. Wyatt filed for divorce from Morton in 2009 after an escalation of domestic violence, relocating her family from Kentucky to Atlanta, Georgia. (Wyatt was pregnant with her fourth child {{by the end of the}} marriage, but suffered a still birth.) She remarried in 2010 to Michael Jamar (born: Michael Ford) an ordained minister who went to appear with Wyatt in the reality TV show [...] As of 2013 the couple were raising six children together, three fathered by Wyatt's first husband, and two fathered by Ford.

40|$|The use of {{contraceptive}} method to avoid pregnancy is a multifaceted phenomenon. Worldwide, 20 percent of married women of reproductive age are currently using periodic abstinence. To assess {{the knowledge and}} practice of periodic abstinence among <b>currently</b> married <b>pregnant</b> women, {{data were collected from}} the pregnant women attending the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. One thousand three hundred and thirty one (1331) <b>currently</b> married <b>pregnant</b> women were interviewed face-to-face. App roximately 29. 3 percent of women were aware of the abstinence method, 11. 5 percent women had history of using it. In-depth finding shows that 84. 9 percent women did not have correct knowledge of fertile window of a menstrual cycle. Counseling about the correct fertile window of a menstrual cycle may increase the effectiveness of methods and hence reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background  -Pulmonary embolus (PE) {{remains a}} leading {{etiology}} of maternal mortality {{in the developed}} world. Increasing utilization of retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement <b>currently</b> includes <b>pregnant</b> patients. Case - A 22 -year-old woman at 27 weeks' gestation was diagnosed with Stage IV high-grade malignant B cell lymphoma following pathologic femur fracture. Significant risk factors for PE led to placement of primary prophylaxis IVC filter before cesarean delivery, open reduction and internal fixation of the fractured femur, and chemotherapy. Conclusion - This case supports that primary prophylaxis placement of IVC filters in highly selected pregnant patients may assist in decreasing PE-associated maternal mortality...|$|R

25|$|Excess {{preformed}} vitamin A {{during early}} pregnancy {{has also been}} associated with {{a significant increase in}} birth defects. These defects may be severe, even life-threatening. Even twice the daily recommended amount can cause severe birth defects. The FDA <b>currently</b> recommends that <b>pregnant</b> women get their vitamin A from foods containing β-carotene and that they should ensure that they consume no more than 5,000 IU of preformed vitamin A (if any) per day. Although vitamin A is necessary for fetal development, most women carry stores of vitamin A in their fat cells, so over-supplementation should be strictly avoided.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{reports of}} {{increased}} serum levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt- 1) and decreased levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) suggest the key role of angiogenic factors in development of pre-eclampsia. PlGF is excreted in urine, and reduced urinary level {{has been suggested}} as a marker of this condition as well as help in its prediction. We measured urinary PlGF and creatinine values in 69 pregnant women (35 with pre-eclampsia and 34 normotensive controls). Over 70 % patients had severe pre-eclampsia. Compared to controls, the urinary PlGF and PlGF/creatinine levels were significantly reduced in women with pre-eclampsia. The hospital stay was longer and fetal outcomes poorer in this group. Three normotensive women who showed very low levels developed pre-eclampsia 2 – 6 weeks later. Reduced urinary PlGF level in a pregnant woman is a marker of pre-eclampsia. The value of reduced urinary PlGF levels in predicting pre-eclampsia in <b>currently</b> normotensive <b>pregnant</b> women needs to be evaluated. A simple predictive test {{is likely to be}} of value in the developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Although {{pregnancy}} is purported to affect maternal asthma, the literature {{has not been}} reviewed systematically. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine, among pregnant women with asthma, whether pregnancy and stage of pregnancy influence maternal asthma severity. Six electronic databases were searched in January 2003 for prospective studies of <b>currently</b> asthmatic, <b>pregnant</b> women who were enrolled before the third trimester and assessed with objective meas-ures of asthma severity or validated severity scales. Three studies reported 54 pregnant women with asthma who met the inclusion criteria. The most valid study indicated that bronchial hyper-responsiveness to methacholine improved between preconception and pregnancy in 69 % of the women, although it deteriorated in 31 % of the women. Further, this improvement peaked in the second trimester, reverted after delivery, and was greatest among those women who were most hyperresponsive initially. Lung function also showed a trend towards improvement during preg-nancy that was not significant. Large, well-conducted population-based studies that explore dif-ferent aspects of asthma severity are needed to substantiate these preliminary results...|$|R
40|$|Heart valve {{replacement}} with a mechanical valve requires lifelong anticoagulation. Guidelines currently recommend using a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) such as warfarin. Given the teratogenic effects of VKAs, {{it is often}} favorable to switch to heparin-derived therapies in pregnant patients since they do not cross the placenta. However, these therapies {{are known to be}} less effective anticoagulants subjecting the pregnant patient to a higher chance of a thrombotic event. Guidelines <b>currently</b> recommend <b>pregnant</b> women requiring more than 5 [*]mg a day of warfarin be switched to alternative therapy during the first trimester. This case report highlights a patient who was switched to alternative therapy during her first pregnancy and suffered a devastating cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Further complicating her situation was during a subsequent pregnancy; this patient continued warfarin use during the first trimester and experienced multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). This case highlights the increased risk of thrombotic events in pregnant patients with mechanical valves. It also highlights the difficulty of providing appropriate anticoagulation for the pregnant patient who has experienced thrombotic events on multiple anticoagulants...|$|R

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} carrier testing (CFCT) {{is among}} {{the first of the}} DNA tests offered prenatally in primary care settings. This paper from a descriptive qualitative study describes the influence of pregnancy in CFCT decisions by women receiving community-based prenatal care. Twenty-seven women receiving prenatal care in Midwestern U. S. primary care clinics completed semistructured interviews. Audiotaped interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Participants described decision-making influences and strategies from the perspective of “being pregnant. ” Patterns of attitudes and beliefs include (1) dealing with emotions, (2) pregnancy is natural, and (3) thinking about the baby. Strategies in the decision-making process included (1) reducing stress, (2) choosing what is relevant, (3) doing everything right, (4) wanting to be prepared, (5) delaying information, and (6) trusting God. While other factors were mentioned by some women, major themes reflect the influence of <b>currently</b> being <b>pregnant</b> on the decision-making process. These findings suggest that pregnancy is a powerful influence on the decision-making process and may not be the optimal time to make fully informed decisions regarding genetic carrier testing. Further understanding of factors influencing the genetic testing decision-making process is needed. Offering CFCT prior to conception is advocated...|$|R
40|$|In Wimberly v. Labor 2 ̆ 6 Industrial Relations Commission, the Supreme Court {{interpreted}} section 3304 (a) (12) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), {{which requires}} that states not dent unemployment benefits 2 ̆ 2 {{solely on the}} basis of pregnancy, 2 ̆ 2 as an antidiscrimination statue, rather that one requiring preferential treatment for pregnant and formerly pregnant women. Professor Mary Radford argues that given the ambiguous legislative history and other Supreme Court precedent in the area of unemployment compensation, Wimberly could just as easily have held that FUTA 2 ̆ 7 s language requires preferential treatment to pregnant and formerly pregnant women. She further argues that given the current realities that women with children are a major component of the workforce and that women generally have no guarantee of job reinstatement when they try to return to work, women should not be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits, nor should they be presumed ineligible for benefits merely because they were or <b>currently</b> are <b>pregnant.</b> Disqualifying pregnant or formerly pregnant women from receiving unemployment benefits, or presuming them ineligible for such benefits, forces them to make the difficult decision between having income and having children. Professor Radford concludes that pregnant and formerly pregnant women should be granted special treatment in the context of unemployment benefit...|$|R

40|$|QUESTION: One of my {{patients}} is <b>currently</b> 14 weeks <b>pregnant.</b> She is a teacher in grade 1, {{and there is an}} epidemic of Fifth disease in the school where she teaches. Can this disease affect her pregnancy and how should I care for her? ANSWER: Erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease) is usually a benign disease for children and mothers, but might have serious consequences for a fetus due to hemolytic anemia, although the risk is very low. You should evaluate the mother's immune status. If she is already immune (IgG positive), the risks are nil. If she is not immune (although the risk of the fetus's being affected is very low), fetal surveillance by repeated ultrasonographic examination and immune status reevaluation has been recommended. If a fetus is found to be affected, intrauterine evaluation and treatment are available at tertiary care centres...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{perspectives}} of WIC clinic providers on offering smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women. Study Design and Methods: Four focus groups consisting of WIC nurses, dietitians, and social workers (N = 25) were conducted at WIC clinics in eastern Iowa. Researchers developed discussion guidelines to determine how WIC providers <b>currently</b> approached <b>pregnant</b> women who smoke cigarettes and what they considered barriers to providing effective smoking cessation interventions. Code mapping was used to analyze focus group discussions. Results: Factors influencing the ability of WIC staff to provide a smoking cessation intervention for pregnant women included available time, clinic priorities, staff approaches to clients, and staff training. In addition, providers expressed concerns about educational materials for clients as well as additional client issues that prevented smoking cessation. The absence of mechanisms to track clinic outcomes related to smoking cessation was also noted. Clinical Implications: WIC providers have time limitations that may necessitate minimal or low-intensity interventions for smoking cessation, but {{did not know that}} such approaches are actually effective. WIC providers require more education about the entire issue of smoking cessation in order to become more proactive in their attempts to help pregnant women quit. Training that enhances self-efficacy and understanding of the impact of smoking on mothers, infants, and children should be initiated to motivate staff to intervene. Another strategy to motivate WIC staff in this regard could be tracking clinic outcomes in helping women to quit smoking or prevent relapse...|$|R
40|$|Background: A Health Sub-centre is {{the most}} {{peripheral}} and first point of contact between the primary health care system and the community. It is imperative to get insight into their functioning which were established with the objectives of minimizing the hardships of the rural people. Objective: To study the coverages of maternal services at subcentres in district Jhansi. Material & Methods : A cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} sample of 20 subcentres in the district Jhansi from June 2012 to July 2013. Various records of the Health workers were examined for maternal health services coverages and noted down on a pre-designed questionnaire. Results: Present study showed that <b>currently</b> married <b>pregnant</b> women aged 15 - 49 years registered for ANC were 72. 1 %. Women who received antenatal check-up in first trimester in subcentres were around 50 %. Women who received 3 or more antenatal visits were only 29 % in study. Meager 3. 6 % women received IFA for 100 days or more. Similarly women with full antenatal check-up were only 3 %. In current study it was found that family planning coverages for female Sterilization was 60 % but male Sterilization was just 0. 5 %. Conclusion : Higher emphasis needs to be given for better coverage of all maternal services. There should be provision for improvement of competence, confidence and motivation of health workers to ensure full range of maternal care activities specified under NRHM program. </p...|$|R

40|$|Psoriasis is not {{uncommon}} in the reproductive years and therefore in pregnant patients. There are limited data {{about the impact of}} psoriasis on the course and prognosis of pregnancy and about the impact of pregnancy on the course of psoriasis. Usually the disease improves during pregnancy and patients experience worsening between 4 and 6 weeks after delivery. A safe option for patients with limited disease is topical therapy, including moisturizers and topical steroids as well as UVB phototherapy. In the case of active psoriasis or even psoriasis worsening during pregnancy, there might be a need for continuation or even introduction of systemic therapy. Methotrexate and acitretin are known teratogens and mutagens, and they must be avoided. Ciclosporin may be regarded as a possible rescue therapy for pregnant psoriasis patients in the case of severe disease. Post-marketing experience regarding the safety of biologics is accumulating, with largely reassuring results. All four biologics approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis%etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab%are not <b>currently</b> recommended in <b>pregnant</b> psoriasis patients.
