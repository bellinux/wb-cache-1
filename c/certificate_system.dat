2500|$|In a peer-reviewed {{paper on}} the Lancet survey, {{economist}} Michael Spagat examined the death certificate data. He noted that the very high reported rate of death certificates by the survey [...] "implies that the official death <b>certificate</b> <b>system</b> has issued, but failed to record the issuance of, about 500,000 death certificates", and notes {{that the rate of}} confirmations claimed by the second survey is substantially higher than the rate found in the first survey, despite covering a longer period, and calculates the odds against this to be very high. Spagat further notes several [...] "unlikely patterns in the confirmations of violent deaths through the viewing of death certificates and in the patterns of when death certificates were requested and when they were not requested." [...] His analysis concludes that [...] "there is likely fabrication in the death-certificate data" [...] and that [...] "these data do not give reliable support to [...] very high estimated death rate." ...|$|E

The second system provides cryptographic protection against the forgery and transfer of credentials. Both systems are based on a new paradigm, called self-blindable certificates.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{composed}} as a diptych. First, a general framework of criteria {{to evaluate the}} performance of renewable energy support systems is elaborated. It is built around the main criteria effectiveness, efficiency and equity. All three are multi-layered and specifying {{the contents of the}} various layers is case dependent. Second, the framework is applied on detailed data about the Flemish tradable <b>certificates</b> support <b>system.</b> Several salient conclusions confirm observations from research in other countries causing growing awareness. First, most crucial is a careful and detailed qualification of renewable energy sources and technologies. Without, even effectiveness is not reliably measurable. Second, nearby targets of renewable energy output must follow from a clearly designed transition trajectory towards a sustainable electricity sector. Such transition is intertwined with an industrial technological policy for bringing the necessary technologies to development and maturity. Third, if the above two prerequisites are overridden <b>certificates</b> <b>systems</b> abound of excess profits, predominantly reaped by incumbent power companies being not the best agents of real change to a sustainable energy future.
