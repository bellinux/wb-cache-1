2500|$|... {{also adds}} that, when an SE is incorporated, {{employees}} have the default right to retain all existing representation {{on the board}} of directors that they have, unless the negotiate by collective agreement a different or better plan than is provided for in existing member state law. Other than this, most important standards in a typical company law are left to member state law, so long as they comply with further minimum requirements in the company law directives. Duties owed by the board of directors to the company and its stakeholders, or the right to bring derivative claims to vindicate constitutional rights, are not generally regulated by EU law. Nor are rights of pre-emption to buy shares, nor rights of any party regarding claims by tort, contract or piercing the corporate veil to hold directors and shareholders accountable. However, Directives do require minimum rights on <b>company</b> <b>formation,</b> capital maintenance, accounting and audit, market regulation, board neutrality in a takeover bid, rules on mergers, and management of cross-border insolvency. The omission of minimum standards is important since the Court of Justice held in Centros that freedom of establishment requires companies operate in any member state they choose. This has been argued to risk a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in standards, although the Court of Justice soon affirmed in Inspire Art that companies must still comply with proportionate requirements that are in the [...] "public interest".|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{decision}} has been made about the type of <b>company,</b> <b>formation</b> occurs through a series of procedures with the registrar at Companies House. Before registration, anybody promoting the company to attract investment falls under strict fiduciary duties to disclose all material facts about the venture and its finances. Moreover, anybody purporting to contract in a company's name before its registration will generally be personally liable on those obligations. In the registration process, those who invest money in a company will sign a memorandum of association stating what shares they will initially take, and pledge their compliance with the Companies Act 2006. A standard company constitution, known as the Model Articles, is deemed to apply, or the corporators may register their own individualised articles of association. Directors must be appointed - one in a private company and at least two in a public company - and a public company must have a secretary, but there needs to be no more than a single member. The company will be refused registration if it is set up for an unlawful purpose, and a name must be chosen that is not inappropriate or already in use. This information is filled out in the [...] "IN01" [...] form available on the Companies House website, and a £18 fee is paid for online registration via Business Link in 8 to 10 days, or a £40 [...] fee if using the paper IN01 form (the fee is £100 for same day registration using the paper form). The registrar then issues a certificate of incorporation and a new legal personality enters the stage.|$|E
