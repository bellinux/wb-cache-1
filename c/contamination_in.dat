40|$|Background: Lead and cadmium are toxic {{heavy metals}} found as major {{contaminants}} in food products and edible oils. The aims {{of this study}} were to investigate the lead and cadmium <b>contaminations</b> <b>in</b> seeds and extracted oils from Brassica napus L and Carthamus tinctorius grown in the vicinity of industrial sites (Isfahan Zobe Ahan) near Isfahan province/Iran. Methods: In this study, the seeds of B. napus and C. tinctorius were randomly sampled from the farms. The oils of seeds were provided by factory and extracted as well in our laboratory. The two series of washed and unwashed seeds digested with nitric acid and the amount of elements in seeds and oils were measured using GF-AA spectrometer equipped with Zeeman Effect. Results: Cadmium was found in all samples below the Method Detection Limit (MDL, 0. 04 μg/L). Lead <b>contaminations</b> were found <b>in</b> all seeds and oils except washed B. napus seeds. The highest levels of lead <b>contaminations</b> were observed <b>in</b> oils of C. tinctorius and B. napus with the amount of 24. 74 μg/L and 11. 85 μg/L, respectively. The level of lead in unwashed seed oils were significantly higher than washed seed oils (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The contamination rate of cadmium compared with lead was very low. The higher lead <b>contaminations</b> <b>in</b> unwashed seeds oils compared with washed seeds oils indicated that the contaminant should have been be transferred through the air. Although these observations suggest that the levels of <b>contaminations</b> <b>in</b> edible oils are below the toxic level, long-term exposure may lead to potential health risks. ...|$|R

5|$|The trial {{opened on}} June 11, 2007 in Washington, DC. The Cedillos' six expert {{witnesses}} argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, {{which in turn}} {{made it possible for}} the weakened measles virus in the MMR vaccine to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal {{concentrations}} were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater <b>contamination.</b> <b>In</b> the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this <b>contamination.</b> <b>In</b> the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas.

However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E

5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of <b>contamination</b> <b>in</b> transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E
