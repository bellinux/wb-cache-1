5000|$|Early {{use of the}} {{powertrain}} {{control module}} {{dates back to the}} late 1970s - official phasing in of the PCM occurred during the early 1980s when used in conjunction with electronic controlled carburetors and <b>lockup</b> torque <b>converters</b> (at the time conventional 3-speed automatics received <b>lockup</b> <b>converters</b> at the same time overdrives were introduced).|$|R

50|$|The Mercedes-Benz 5G-Tronic (also called 722.6) is an {{electronically}} shifted 5-speed overdrive {{automatic transmission}} with torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup.</b> It replaced the older 722.3 / 722.4 4-speed 4G-Tronic transmission and its 722.5 5-speed derivative.|$|E
5000|$|The Ultramatic was a {{hydraulic}} torque converter automatic transmission with a two-speed plus reverse epicyclic geartrain and torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup,</b> called Direct Drive by Packard. The unit was hydraulically controlled with a [...] "valve body," [...] like most automatic transmissions {{before the advent of}} electronic control.|$|E
50|$|Gustav Bauer, {{director}} of the marine engine section, supervised the work of Hermann Föttinger on the Fottinger hydraulic transmitter known as Vulcan Coupling and Vulcan Drive or fluid coupling. In 1924, Vulcan's Hermann Rieseler invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque <b>converter,</b> and <b>lockup</b> clutch; it never entered production. (The less-sophisticated Hydra-Matic, which used a simple fluid coupling, would only become an available option on Oldsmobiles in 1940.) The original coupling further developed in collaboration with Harold Sinclair of Fluidrive Engineering of Isleworth for Daimler of Coventry and matched with a manually controlled epicyclic gearbox went into production in England in 1929.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Hondamatic, {{like all}} following Honda automatics, featured sliding gears on parallel axes rather than planetary gears {{like most other}} automatic transmissions. The design preserved engine braking by eliminating a sprag {{between the first and}} second gears. Shifting between 1st and 2nd gears was done by simply sliding the gear selector from 1 to 2. It did not automatically shift, but because of the torque converter, could be driven entirely in 2nd gear. The Honda torque <b>converter</b> had a <b>lockup,</b> leading the company to sell the original Hondamatic (which had just two forward gear ratios) as a three-speed. The true three-speed H3 was launched in 1979.|$|R
25|$|The vintage era {{lasted from}} the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to {{dominate}} with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque <b>converter,</b> and <b>lockup</b> clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just {{at the end of the}} vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).|$|R
50|$|The low {{ratio was}} {{available}} for climbing and descending hills. Using low ratio, the torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup</b> happened at a slightly lower speed {{as a result of}} reduction in the rate of the opposing throttle advancement, eliminating torque converter overheating that plagued early automatic transmissions in such conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Engine RPM {{seemed to}} be more a {{function}} of accelerator pedal position than of actual road speed. [...] "Flooring" [...] the accelerator pedal would cause the engine speed to flare (even though there is no automatic downshift and no torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup</b> to disengage). As the car would accelerate, RPM would further climb, but by a disproportionately smaller amount. Even more strangely, manually downshifting (see above) with the gas pedal already [...] "floored" [...] would not increase RPM in proportion to the 1.8:1 drop in gear ratio. The Dynaflow aural experience was similar to that of a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) (though modern electronically controlled CVT's address this throttle position dependent engine speed (and sound) characteristic by artificially inserting stepwise ratio changes instead of a truly continuous or constant rate change in order to simulate more driver-satisfying genuine shifts).|$|E
5000|$|The Ford 6R80 {{is based}} on on the ZF 6HP26 6 speed {{automatic}} transmission. Ford manufactures the transmission under license from ZF at the Livonia Transmission Plant in Livonia, Michigan. The 6R80 is featured in 2009 to present Ford F-150 pickups. It features torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup</b> capabilities in all 6 gears and an integrated [...] "Tow/Haul" [...] mode for enhanced engine braking and towing performance. For the 2011 model year, the transmission was revised to provide smoother shifts, improved fuel economy, and overall better shift performance. Most notable of the improvements was {{the addition of a}} 1 way clutch that provided smoother 1-2 up-shifts and 2-1 down-shifts. The transmission has a relatively low 1st gear and two overdrive gears, the highest of which is 0.69:1. This provides exceptional towing performance when needed, while maximizing fuel economy by offering low engine speeds while cruising.|$|E
5000|$|The Mercedes-Benz 4G-Tronic {{transmission}} {{was produced}} from 1981 to 1996 in 722.3 and 722.4 variants. It was a hydraulically operated non-lockup four speed automatic that replaced the similarly designed 722.2 four speed automatic transmisison in 1981. The Mercedes Benz 722-series automatic gearbox is calibrated {{to take off}} in second gear to reduce [...] "creeping" [...] and provide a smoother ride. The transmission will select 1st only if the selector is in [...] "2" [...] or in case of abrupt acceleration. Other attributes of this transmission include a 2-3 shift delay when the engine is cold in order to speed up catalyst warm-up. 4th gear is a 1:1 ratio. The 4G-Tronic was used until mid-1996 in some vehicles when it {{was replaced by the}} Mercedes-Benz 722.5 which is basically the same transmission with an additional electrically controlled 5th gear for overdrive. This was in turn replaced with the more modern 722.6 5G-Tronic transmission that features a torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup</b> and fully electronic control.|$|E
5000|$|This {{generation}} {{carried on}} the multitude of body styles that the B11 had, including a station wagon, two-door or four-door sedan, three-door hatchback and the hatchback-bodied Sport Coupé. The B12 chassis was first produced and marketed in 1985 {{in most parts of}} the world; however, it was not offered to the United States until 1986. For the 1987 model, all Sentras came standard with the E16 engine with [...] (excepting the Sport Coupé and four-wheel-drive wagon, which came with throttle-body-injected E16i engines) and a five-speed manual transmission. In 1988, all Sentras had the [...] E16i, which was offered for this year with throttle body injection (TBI). In many parts of the world the E-series soldiered on in the B12 chassis with some getting the multi-point fuel injection E16E engine. Diesel engines were also offered in some models, but were rare and only available in North American 1987 models and in certain other parts of the world. From 1989 to 1990, the only engine choice was the [...] GA16i, a 12-valve SOHC predecessor of the GA16DE. Transaxles offered were the 4- and 5-speed manuals (RN4F31A and RS5F31A, respectively) and a 3-speed automatic with torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup</b> (RL3F01A).|$|E
30|$|Bednarek et al. {{introduced}} GM’s new six-speed {{front wheel}} drive (FWD) family of automatic transmissions. They reported that the new transmission had a wide overall ratio spread of 6.1 : 1 which allowed for optimum adaptation of the drivetrain for various categories of vehicles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical and experimental inves-tigation of the transient dynamics of centrifugal pendulum vi-bration absorbers, {{which are used}} for reducing torsional vibra-tions in rotating machines. Recently these absorbers have been proposed for use in automotive engines, to aid with fuel saving technologies such as cylinder deactivation and torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup.</b> In {{order for them to}} operate effectively with minimal mass, they must be designed to allow for large amplitude, non-linear responses. In this paper we consider the transient dynam-ics of these absorbers, focusing on the response during startup. During these transient events the absorbers experience a beat-ing type motion, resulting in overshoot of the absorber response before reaching steady state conditions. Using a perturbation analysis of the system equations of motion, an approximate ana-lytical expression for nonlinear overshoot is derived, relating the overshoot to the system and excitation parameters. These pre-dictive results are derived for a general class of absorbers, and are verified by simulations of the full equations of motion and by experiments using a fully instrumented spin rig. It is found that the overshoot for absorbers with softening nonlinearity, such as circular path absorbers, can be well over the 100 % upper limit for a linear absorber, and can be as high as 173 %. For absorbers with tautochronic paths, the overshoot remains quite close to that of the linearized system, even for large amplitudes. These results provide a useful tool for the design of absorbers to meet transient ∗Address all correspondence to this author. response specifications...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} {{for internal}} combustion engines has several well published advantages. The biofuels, made from biological {{sources such as}} corn or sugar cane, are renewable resources that reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Fuels from agricultural sources can therefore reduce a countries energy dependency on other nations. Biofuels also {{have been shown to}} reduce CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere compared to traditional fossil based fuels. Because of these benefits several countries have set targets for the use of biofuels, especially ethanol, in their transportation fuels. Small percentages of ethanol are common place in gasoline but are typically limited to 5 to 8 % by volume. Greater benefits are possible from higher concentrations and some countries such as the US and Sweden have encouraged the production of vehicles capable of operating on E 85 (85 % denatured ethanol and 15 % gasoline). E 85 capable vehicles are normally equipped to run the higher levels of ethanol by employing modified fuel delivery systems that can withstand the highly corrosive nature of the alcohol. These vehicles are not however equipped {{to take full advantage of}} ethanol's properties during the combustion process. Ethanol has a much higher blend research octane number than gasoline. This allows the use of higher engine compression ratios and spark advance which result in more efficient engine operation. Ethanol's latent heat of vaporization is also much higher that gasoline. This higher heat of vaporization cools the engine intake charge which also allows the engine compression ratio to be increased even further. An engine that is optimized for operation on high concentrations of ethanol therefore will have compression ratios that are too high to avoid spark knock (pre-ignition) if run on gasoline or a gasoline/ethanol blend that has a low percentage alcohol. An engine was developed during this project to leverage the improved evaporative cooling and high octane of E 85 to improve fuel economy and offset E 85 's lower energy content. A 2. 0 L production Direct Injection gasoline, (DIg) engine employing Dual Independent Cam Phasing, (DICP) and turbo charging was used as the base engine. Modified pistons were used to increase the geometric compression ratio from 9. 2 : 1 to 11. 85 : 1 by modifying the pistons and adding advanced valvetrain to proved control of displacement and effective compression ratio through valve timing control. The advanced valvetrain utilized Delphi's two step valvetrain hardware and intake cam phaser with increased phasing authority of 80 crank angle degrees. Using this hardware the engine was capable of operating knock free on all fuels tested from E 0 -E 85 by controlling effective compression ratio using a Late Intake Valve Closing, (LIVC) strategy. The LIVC strategy results in changes in the trapped displacement such that knock limited torque for gasoline is significantly lower than E 85. The use of spark retard to control knock enables higher peak torque for knock limited fuels, however a loss in efficiency results. For gasoline and E 10 fuels, full effective displacement could not be reached before spark retard produced a net loss in torque. The use of an Early Intake Valve Closing, (EIVC) strategy resulted in an improvement of engine efficiency at low to mid loads for all fuels tested from E 0 - E 85. Further the use of valve deactivation, to a single intake valve, improved combustion stability and enabled throttle-less operation down to less than 2 bar BMEP. Slight throttling to trap internal residual provided additional reductions in fuel consumption. To fully leverage the benefits of E 85, or ethanol blends above E 10, would require a vehicle level approach that would take advantage of the improved low end torque that is possible with E 85. Operating the engine at reduced speeds and using advanced transmissions (6 speeds or higher) would provide a responsive efficient driving experience to the customer. The vehicle shift and torque <b>converter</b> <b>lockup</b> points for high ethanol blends could take advantage of the significant efficiency advantage of down-speeding and operating at higher loads to deliver the required power...|$|E
