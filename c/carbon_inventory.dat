Uncertainty in <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> was approximately 29 % (2000 million metric tons) {{of the estimated}} median in the year 2000, rising to 11 % (2800 million metric tons) in projection year 2040, with this range covering 95 % of the distribution. Relative uncertainties about net flux were higher and more variable than relative uncertainty estimates of <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory.</b> Results indicated that relatively high correlations among projected carbon budgets for the regional forest types led to greater total uncertainty than under assumptions of independence among types, indicating that an accurate portrayal of correlations is important. Uncertainty in soil carbon, closely followed by uncertainty in tree carbon, were most influential in estimating uncertainty in <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory,</b> but uncertainties in projections of volume growth and volume removals were most important in estimating uncertainty in carbon flux.

In the 1990 s the global carbon survey of theWorld Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) inspired the development of several approaches for estimating anthropogenic <b>carbon</b> <b>inventories</b> in the ocean interior. Most approaches agree that the total global ocean inventory of Cant was around 120 Pg C in the mid- 1990 s.

40|$|Atmospheric CO 2 {{concentrations}} declined markedly about 70, 000 years ago, {{when the}} Earth’s climate descended {{into the last}} glaciation. Much of the carbon removed from the atmosphere has been suspected to have entered the deep oceans, but evidence for increased carbon storage remains elusive. Here we use the B/Ca ratios of benthic foraminifera from several sites across the Atlantic Ocean to reconstruct changes in the carbonate ion concentration and hence the <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> of the deep Atlantic across this transition.

40|$|Forests in {{seasonally}} dry {{areas of}} eastern Amazonia near Paragominas, Pará, Brazil, maintain an evergreen forest canopy through an extended dry season by taking up soil water through deep (> 1 m) roots. Belowground allocation of C in these deep-rooting forests is very large (1900 g C m− 2  yr− 1) relative to litterfall (460 g C m− 2  yr− 1). The presence of live roots drives an active carbon cycle deeper than l m in the soil. Although bulk C concentrations and  14 C contents of {{soil organic matter}} at >l-m depths are low, estimates of turnover from fine-root inputs, CO 2  production, and the  14 C content of CO 2  produced at depth show that up to 15 % of the <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> in the deep soil has turnover times of decades or less. Thus the amount of fast-cycling soil carbon between 1 and 8 -m depths (2 – 3 kg C m− 2, out of 17 – 18 kg C m− 2) is significant compared to the amount present in the upper meter of soil (3 – 4 kg C m− 2  out of 10 – 11 kg C m− 2). A model of belowground carbon cycling derived from measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes, and constrained using carbon isotopes, is used to predict C fluxes associated with conversion of deep-rooting forests to pasture and subsequent pasture management. The relative proportions and turnover times of active (including detrital plant material; 1 – 3 year turnover), slow (decadal and shorter turnover), and passive (centennial to millennial turnover) soil organic matter pools are determined by depth for the forest soil, using constraints from measurements of C stocks, fluxes, and isotopic content. Reduced carbon inputs to the soil in degraded pastures, which are less productive than the forests they replace, lead {{to a reduction in}} soil <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> and Δ 14 C, in accord with observations. Managed pastures, which have been fertilized with phosphorous and planted with more productive grasses, show increases in C and  14 C over forest values. <b>Carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> increases in the upper meter of managed pasture soils are partially offset by predicted carbon losses due to death and decomposition of fine forest roots at depths > 1 m in the soil.

A positive correlation is obtained between the meridional overturning or residual circulation in the Southern Ocean and atmospheric CO 2 : stronger or northward-shifted westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere result in increased residual circulation, greater upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters and oceanic outgassing, which increases atmospheric pCO 2 by ? 20 ?atm; weaker or southward-shifted winds lead to the opposing result. The ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> in our model varies through contrasting changes in the saturated, disequilibrium and biogenic (soft-tissue and carbonate) reservoirs, each varying by O(10 – 100) PgC, all of which contribute to the net anomaly in atmospheric CO 2. Increased residual overturning deepens the global pycnocline, warming the upper ocean and decreasing the saturated carbon reservoir. Increased upwelling of carbon- and nutrient-rich deep waters and inefficient biological activity results in subduction of unutilized nutrients into the ocean interior, decreasing the biogenic carbon reservoir of intermediate and mode waters ventilating the Northern Hemisphere, and making the disequilibrium carbon reservoir more positive in the mode waters due to the reduced residence time at the surface. Wind-induced changes in the model <b>carbon</b> <b>inventory</b> are dominated by {{the response of the}} global pycnocline, although there is an additional abyssal response when the peak westerly winds change their latitude, altering their proximity to Drake Passage and changing the depth extent of the southward return flow of the overturning: a northward shift of the westerly winds isolates dense isopycnals, allowing biogenic carbon to accumulate in the deep ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, while a southward shift shoals dense isopycnals that outcrop in the Southern Ocean and reduces the biogenic carbon store in the deep ocean...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of managing land to optimise carbon sequestration for {{climate change mitigation}} is widely recognised, with grasslands being identified as having the potential to sequester additional carbon. However, most soil <b>carbon</b> <b>inventories</b> only consider surface soils, and most large scale surveys group ecosystems into broad habitats without considering management intensity. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the quantity of deep soil carbon and its sensitivity to management. From a nationwide survey of grassland soils to 1 m depth, we show that carbon in grasslands soils is vulnerable to management and that these management effects can be detected to considerable depth down the soil profile, albeit at decreasing significance with depth. Carbon concentrations in soil decreased as management intensity increased, but greatest soil carbon stocks (accounting for bulk density differences), were at intermediate levels of management. Our study also highlights the considerable amounts of carbon in sub-surface soil below 30 cm, which is missed by standard <b>carbon</b> <b>inventories.</b> We estimate grassland soil carbon in Great Britain to be 2097 Tg C to a depth of 1 m, with ~ 60 % of this carbon being below 30 cm. Total stocks of soil carbon (t ha− 1) to 1 m depth were 10. 7 % greater at intermediate relative to intensive management, which equates to 10. 1 t ha− 1 in surface soils (0 - 30 cm), and 13. 7 t ha− 1 in soils from 30 - 100 cm depth. Our findings highlight the existence of substantial carbon stocks at depth in grassland soils that are sensitive to management. This is of high relevance globally, given the extent of land cover and large stocks of carbon held in temperate managed grasslands.

Ultimately these data will be used to generate <b>carbon</b> <b>inventories</b> and maps of peatland condition which can be used to inform peatland wind farm developments and restoration projects...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{nutrient}} loading on {{the carbon}} balance of coastal wetland sediments Abstract—Results of a 12 -yr study in an oligotrophic South Carolina salt marsh demonstrate that soil respiration increased by 795 gCm � 2 yr � 1 and that <b>carbon</b> <b>inventories</b> decreased in sediments fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus. Fertilized plots became net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, and sediment respiration continues in these plots at an accelerated pace. After 12 yr of treatment, soil macroorganic {{matter in the}} top 5 cm of sediment was 475 gCm� 2 lower in fertilized plots than in controls, which is equivalent to a constant loss rate of 40 gCm � 2 yr � 1. It is not known whether soil carbon in fertilized plots has reached a new equilibrium or continues to decline. The increase in soil respiration in the fertilized plots was far greater than the loss of sediment organic matter, which indicates {{that the increase in}} soil respiration was largely du...|$|R
