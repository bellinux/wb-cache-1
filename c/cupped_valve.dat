50|$|Exogyra is an extinct genus {{of fossil}} marine oysters {{in the family}} Gryphaeidae, the foam oysters or {{honeycomb}} oysters. These bivalves grew cemented by the more <b>cupped</b> left <b>valve.</b> The right valve is flatter, and the beak is curved to one side. Exogyra lived on solid substrates in warm seas during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.|$|R

In two experiments of 13 and 25 weeks duration, some aspects of disk culture, such as spacing between disks, scallop orientation and the choice of valve by which the scallops were glued, were examined to determine their effects on shell growth, somatic tissue weight increase, predation and survival. As disk spacing was increased through 40, 60, 80 to 100 mm, predation increased at disk spacing greater than 60 mm and total soft tissue mass peaked at 60 mm and above. There {{were no significant differences in}} soft body weight or shell height between scallops glued by either valve in either normal (flat left valve uppermost) or inverted (<b>cupped</b> fight <b>valve</b> uppermost) orientation. However, scallops glued by the left valve had higher percentage survival and larger muscle weights regardless of orientation. By contrast, those glued by the right valve had heavier gonads. Orientation and the scallop culture technique employed significantly affected spionid polychaete infestation of the shell. Scallops glued by the left valve, with left or fight valve uppermost, and glued by the fight valve with this valve uppermost had significantly lower polychaete prevalence than scallops contained in cages, earhung or glued by the fight valve with left valve uppermost...|$|R

In this study, the species identification of an “adulterant ” oyster with small body size, which is often misidentified as a “young individual ” of other sympatric species, including C. sikamea and C. hongkongensis, was determined for the first time, based on molecular markers (partial mitochondrial cox 1 and rrnL genes), phylogenetic analysis, and mor-phometric approaches. This novel species, C. zhanjiangensis, commonly known as the “cat ear oyster ” in Guandu (a famous estuarine oyster farming region of Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, China), appears to potentially influence the efficiency of C. hongkongensis spat collection due to niche competition on spat collection devices. Phylogenetic analyses confirm its status as the most basal taxon of the Indo-Pacific Crassostrea. A comparative study of the shell characteristics of C. zhanjiangensis, and other Crassostrea species revealed several distinctive morphological traits, including a generally smaller body size, a deeply <b>cupped</b> left <b>valve,</b> and a right valve that is convex in adults but flat in young individuals. Other distinctive features of the new species include life cycle traits that are unique compared with the sympatric C. hongkongensis and C. sikamea species, such as a higher growth rate in the fast growth phase after settlement, followed by a significantly slower growth rate and mass mortality during subsequent life stages.
