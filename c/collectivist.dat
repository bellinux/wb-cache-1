5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used family symbols in advertising to varying extents of success. Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, <b>collectivist</b> societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering <b>collectivist</b> environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and <b>collectivist</b> environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E

40|$|Four studies, using chronic and {{situational}} self-construal, supported {{the proposition that}} individualists (<b>collectivists)</b> focus on within-category richness (between-category differentiation). <b>Collectivists</b> judged paired products as less similar than individualists did, but only at the higher level of a category hierarchy (studies 1 and 2). Further, <b>collectivists</b> were more context driven in product ratings in a categorization task (study 3). Study 4 focused on high-level pairs and found that under high involvement, chronic self-construal dominated judgments. Under low involvement, chronic {{and situational}} construals interacted: individualists (<b>collectivists)</b> were less (more) amenable to the situational construal.

The results regarding goal orientation showed that individualists were strongly oriented toward achieving justice, but <b>collectivists</b> were more motivated by a concern for relationships with others. The finding that attainment of a justice goal did not strongly satisfy the Americans suggests that justice is an instrumental value and not a terminal value in conflict situations...|$|R

25|$|<b>Collectivist</b> anarchism (also {{known as}} anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary form of anarchism, {{commonly}} associated with Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume. It is a specific tendency, {{not to be confused}} with the broad category sometimes called <b>collectivist</b> or communitarian anarchism. The tendency emerged from the most radical wing of mutualism during the late 1860s. Unlike mutualists, <b>collectivist</b> anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized, being made the joint property of the commune (municipality).|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} post-capitalist vision, anarcho-syndicalists most often {{subscribe}} to communist or <b>collectivist</b> anarchist economic systems {{on the issue}} of distributing goods. The aim is to use a radical trade union movement to achieve either a <b>collectivist</b> or communist (moneyless) mode of distribution; or first the former, then the latter, once a certain degree of technical-productive capacity has enabled production to outstrip consumption, making a moneyless economy more viable. However, anarcho-syndicalists differ from anarcho-communists on wanting federations of (trade-based) workers' syndicates as the locus of organising the economy, rather than confederations of (territory-based) free communes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – To {{examine the}} impact of culture on {{customer}} service expectations, specifically, how individualists and <b>collectivists</b> use internal and external sources of information to formulate their service expectations. Design/methodology/approach – The context was the airline industry and the subject pool consisted of experienced consumers. A survey was employed to measure individualism/collectivism, various internal/external information sources, and the functional and technical dimensions of “should” and “will” service expectations. Hypothesized relationships were tested using a structural equations modeling approach. Findings – Both individualists and <b>collectivists</b> relied more on external information sources in formulating their service expectations, gave variable weight to the functional and technical components, and used more realistic “will” expectations to judge service offerings. Internal (external) information sources were relatively more important in forming expectations for <b>collectivists</b> (individualists) than for individualists (<b>collectivists),</b> and “will” (“should”) expectations were more diagnostic for <b>collectivists</b> (individualists) than for individualists (<b>collectivists).</b> Research limitations/implications – Generalizability of the findings is limited due to the specific industry under study (airlines), the sample (two geographically-proximate sub-cultures), and the scope of the cultural variables considered (individualism/collectivism). Practical implications – Whether managers should leverage the functional and/or technical components of services depends in part on the cultural orientation of their customers. Managers should also recognize that customers’ usage of various information sources in forming service expectations is also, in part, culturally determined. Originality/value – In this era of globalization, researchers and managers alike need to consider the subtle influences of culture on marketing theories and the formulation of service expectations respectively...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{complaint}} amongst libertarians, classical liberals and conservatives (e. g.

30|$|Since <b>collectivists</b> value group harmony (Kim and Park 2015), direct {{inquiries}} can {{be considered}} potentially face-threatening acts (Forbes et al. 2011). Face-threatening acts are of particular concern to <b>collectivists</b> {{who tend to be}} more sensitive to saving face and potential conflict. Consequently, high-context <b>collectivists</b> prefer less talk and are more comfortable with silence (Allen et al. 2014). Such indirect communication tends to maintain social harmony (Rojjanaprapayon et al. 2004). In fact, not stating clearly what one has in mind {{is considered to be a}} sign of strength, maturity, and social competence in high-context collectivistic cultures (Rojjanaprapayon et al. 2004). In contrast, in the individualistic United States, where the prioritization of the self over aspects of community is the norm, directly affirming one’s views is considered more powerful (Hales 2006).|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{linkages}} between culture, emotions and behavioural tendencies in unsuccessful intercultural business negotiations. A set of novel research hypotheses are developed. They are tested using a negotiation scenario analysis involving 106 Finnish and 114 Indian study participants.

First, new empirical evidence suggesting that qualitatively different emotions (dejection vs. agitation) are experienced after a failed intercultural business negotiation by individualists and <b>collectivists</b> is provided. Second, {{the existence of the}} relationship between perspective-taking ability and emotional volatility in the context of failed intercultural business negotiation involving individualists and <b>collectivists</b> is revealed. Third, partial support is found for the idea that different types of negative emotions can lead to the same behavioural tendency (approach) among individualists and <b>collectivists</b> when intercultural business negotiation fails.

40|$|Three studies tested whether individualism–collectivism moderates {{the extent}} to which values are {{endorsed}} as ideal self-guides and ought self-guides, and the consequences for regulatory focus and emotion. Across Studies 1 and 2, individualists endorsed values that are relatively central to the self as stronger ideals than oughts, whereas <b>collectivists</b> endorsed them as ideals and oughts to a similar degree. Study 2 found that individualists justified central values using reasons that were more promotion focused than prevention focused, whereas <b>collectivists</b> used similar amount of prevention-focused and promotion-focused reasons. In Study 3, individualists felt more dejected after violating a central (vs. peripheral) value and more agitated after violating a peripheral (vs. central) value. <b>Collectivists</b> felt a similar amount of dejection regardless of values centrality and more agitation after violating central (vs. peripheral) values.

Three key findings have emerged from recent scientific research: 1) individualist cultures are happier than <b>collectivists,</b> 2) psychological attributes characterizing the self (e. g., self-esteem, self-consistency) are more relevant to the happiness of Western individualists than to the happiness of <b>collectivists,</b> and 3) the self-judgment of happiness is anchored on different types of cues and experiences across cultures.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that no unique physiological response, {{such as an}} increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. <b>Collectivist</b> cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively {{as a threat to}} group harmony; and because <b>collectivist</b> society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.|$|E
40|$|Feeling lonely {{is profoundly}} unhealthy, but poorly understood. We {{examined}} the cultural dimension of collectivism (vs. individualism) {{as a potential}} risk factor for loneliness. Generally, we expected loneliness to flow from perceived ideal-actual discrepancies regarding social relationship characteristics (H 1). However, we expected <b>collectivists</b> to feel lonelier than individualists (H 2), because although <b>collectivists</b> may be buffered from loneliness through higher social involvement (H 3), {{they may also be}} more susceptible to loneliness due to a higher sensitivity to ideal-actual discrepancies regarding relationships (H 4). To test our hypotheses, 239 Austrians participated in a cross-sectional survey study. We found that, in this moderately individualist country, perceived ideal-actual discrepancies indeed predicted loneliness (H 1), but that <b>collectivists</b> reported lower loneliness (H 2), which was explained by collectivists’ more favourable relationship characteristics (H 3). Notwithstanding, perceived collectivism amplified the perceived importance of actual-ideal comparisons regarding relationships for loneliness (H 4). These findings suggest that collectivism can act as both a psychological buffer against loneliness (when internalized) and a cultural risk factor (when perceived in one’s surroundings) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{distinction}} among <b>collectivists</b> to capture a fundamental difference in mental models of “collective ” that has important organizational implications but has not been specifically identified in prior conceptual and empirical research. Drawing on research in social psychology, comparative management and organization theory addressing Japanese, Chinese and East-West phenomena, we develop a distinction between network and organizational forms of collectivism. Organizational <b>collectivists</b> perceive an organization as an exchange partner that contextualizes any interpersonal relationships within its boundaries. In contrast, network <b>collectivists</b> perceive an organization as an arbitrary boundary around a collection of individuals with whom they have strong, weak or no particularistic relationships. We find this distinction to be a useful way to interpret the sources of tension and conflict reported by Japanese and Chinese in Japanese subsidiaries in China, with important managerial implications. While our qualitative and interpretive study does not allow us to test alternative hypotheses or draw society-level conclusions, it does suggest ways in which organization theory, especially that addressing individualism-collectivism phenomena, could be enriched...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate on}} the nature of {{collective}} agency has {{been at the center of}} the philosophy of the social sciences for the last century. In recent years, philosophy of language has been the dominant approach to a debate that has often been reduced to the question of the legitimacy of interpreting collective agency on the basis of folk-psychological categories like belief and desire. In this article, we argue that the debate between individualists and <b>collectivists</b> is currently stagnating, but can be revived by a more empirically sensitive approach to agency. Understanding agents, collective or individual, requires an understanding of the mechanisms that bring about and maintain agency. Collective agents, we suggest, are legitimate constructs in social ontology, but their agency is special. Although they implement control mechanisms similar to that of individual agents, they do not have a conscious first-person point of view. Therefore, like individualists, we recognize the ontological salience of individual agency, and like <b>collectivists,</b> we recognize the soundness of collective agents. However, we reject the folk-psychological account of agency (shared by individualists and <b>collectivists)</b> and favor a mechanistic one...|$|R
