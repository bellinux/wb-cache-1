Two approaches were compared for their effectiveness in isolating novel genes: random, vs differential, complementary DNA (<b>cDNA)</b> <b>cloning</b> methods. In the differential approach, only the <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> containing rare sequences (as determined by preliminary clone hybridization) are further analyzed; in the random approach, <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> are isolated at random from the cDNA library.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sequencing {{full-length}} <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> {{is important}} to determine gene structures including alternative splice forms, and provides valuable resources for experimental analyses to reveal the biological functions of coded proteins. However, previous approaches for sequencing <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> were expensive or time-consuming, and therefore, a fast and efficient sequencing approach was demanded. METHODOLOGY: We developed a program, MuSICA 2, that assembles millions of short (36 -nucleotide) reads collected from a single flow cell lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer to shotgun-sequence approximately 800 human full-length <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones.</b> MuSICA 2 performs a hybrid assembly in which an external de novo assembler is run first {{and the result is}} then improved by reference alignment of shotgun reads. We compared the MuSICA 2 assembly with 200 pooled full-length <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> finished independently by the conventional primer-walking using Sanger sequencers. The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95 % of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99. 99 %. We also applied MuSICA 2 to full-length <b>cDNA</b> <b>clones</b> from Toxoplasma gondii, to confirm that its ability was competent even for non-human species.
