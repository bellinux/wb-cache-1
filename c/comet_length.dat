40|$|International audienceWe {{previously}} {{showed that}} vinflunine, a microtubule-targeting drug of the Vinca-alkaloid family exerted its anti-angiogenic/ anti-migratory activities through {{an increase in}} microtubule dynamics and an inhibition of microtubule targeting to adhesion sites.

In this work we first showed that the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF suppressed microtubule dynamics in living Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs), increased EB 1 <b>comet</b> <b>length</b> by 40 %, and induced EB 1 to bind all along the microtubules, without modifying its expression level. Such microtubule (+) end stabilization occurred close to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of focal adhesion as shown by TIRF microscopy experiments. Vinflunine completely abolished the effect of VEGF on EB 1 comets. Interestingly, we found a correlation between the reduction of EB 1 <b>comet</b> <b>length</b> by vinflunine and the inhibition of cell migration. By using 2 D gel electrophoresis we demonstrated {{for the first time that}} EB 1 underwent several post-translational modifications in endothelial and tumor cells. Particularly, the C-terminal EEY sequence was poorly detectable in control and VEGF-treated HUVECs suggesting the existence of a non-tyrosinated form of EB 1. By using specific antibodies that specifically recognized and discriminated the native tyrosinated form of EB 1 and a putative C-terminal detyrosinated form, we showed that a detyrosinated form of EB 1 exists in HUVECs and tumor cells. Interestingly, vinflunine decreased the level of the detyrosinated form and increased the native tyrosinated form of EB 1. Using 3 -L-Nitrotyrosine incorporation experiments, we concluded that the EB 1 C-terminal modifications result from a detyrosination/retyrosination cycle as described for tubulin.

TMT is one of the organotin compounds which is widely used as polyvinyl chloride heat stabilizers and marine biocides. In this study, male Swiss mice were treated interapretoneally (i. p.) with three tested doses 0. 25, 0. 50 and 1. 0 mg TMT/kg b. wt. for 1, 2 and 3 days. Alkaline comet assay in nucleated bone-marrow cells and chromosome analysis in spermatocytes were performed 24 h after the last treatment. The amount of DNA damage in cells was estimated from <b>comet</b> tail <b>length</b> as the extent of migration of the genetic material. A significant increase in <b>comet</b> tail <b>length</b> indicating DNA damage was observed at all concentrations compared with control (p< 0. 05). The mean <b>comet</b> tail <b>length</b> showed a concentration- related and time-dependent increase. Also, the percentage of chromosome aberrations in spermatocytes was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) and showed dose and time dependent manner. Concurrent administration of vitamin C (VC) orally at 20 mg/kg b. wt. with the highest dose of TMT for 1, 2 and 3 days reduced DNA damage in somatic and germ cells to a significant extent. In conclusion, our results indicated that vitamin C ameliorated DNA damage and genotoxicity induced by trimethyltin in mice somatic and germ cells in vivo. [Researcher. 2010; 2 (1) : 21 - 27].

Therefore, in the current study the potential DNA damage associated with exposure to pesticides of Indian pesticide production workers was assessed using the single cell gel electrophoresis assay or Comet assay. Blood leukocytes of a group of 54 pesticide workers and an equal number of control subjects were examined for genotoxicity in this study. The two groups had similar mean ages and smoking prevalences.

Mice were sacrificed after cadmium exposure for different time, and lung cells were collected to investigate DNA damage by comet assay. The results showed that comet tailing ratio, tail length, <b>comet</b> <b>length,</b> tail moment, Olive tail moment and damaged grade of lung cells from immature mice increased along with increasing of cadmium exposure dose and time. In low dose group treated for 30 days, there was significance (P< 0. 05) in <b>comet</b> <b>length</b> or high significance (P< 0. 01) in other parameters compared with control group or low dose group treated for 10 days.

This technique has been used for a variety of applications with several organisms, but only a few studies have been reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

For the comet assay, this work deals with the effectiveness of tissue dissociation, storage of cells in lysing buffer and in liquid nitrogen, different electrophoretic conditions, neutralisation and fixation of slides, interindividual variation between samples, and responsiveness of four tissue types to ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS). The main conclusions are: (i) dissociation of solid tissues in a phosphate buffer supplemented with 200 mM N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone provides cells with an acceptable background DNA damage; (ii) freezing of cells or tissues in liquid nitrogen generally leads to an increase in DNA breakage, especially for liver, gill and kidney tissue; (iii) storage of slides in the lysing solution for up to one week gives minor changes in comet tails; (iv) differences in protocols for neutralisation and fixation may influence the results; (v) high intra- and interindividual variations in <b>comets</b> (<b>length</b> and DNA content) may obscure the interpretation of comet results; (vi) blood, gill, liver and kidney all showed a statistically significant increase of DNA damage after exposure to 50 mg EMS/l; (vii) electrophoresis at low voltage for longer periods is to be preferred to high voltage and short electrophoresis times.

50|$|During the April {{perihelion}} passage, {{the tail}} of the <b>comet</b> reached a <b>length</b> of 15° of arc. The appearance of the tail varied, with streamers on April 16 and May 5, and the tail splitting into three beams on the 29th. By April 22 the comet also displayed a prominent anomalous tail (or antitail) spanning 5°. This antitail stretched out to span 12° on April 25, reaching its maximum extent. The antitail had disappeared by April 29.|$|R
30|$|Prior to examination, {{the slides}} were stained with 50  μl of 1 × ethidium bromide. One hundred cells per slide were {{randomly}} scored using an {{image analysis system}} attached to an epifluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Axiostar Plus H-BO- 100) equipped with a 515 - to 560 -nm excitation filter and a 590 -nm barrier filter. All of the steps were conducted in dim light to prevent additional nonspecific DNA breakage. The comet images were captured, and the Comet IV software (Perceptive Instruments) was employed to measure various comet parameters. The parameter used to quantify the extent of DNA damage was the olive tail movement (OTM), which {{is the product of}} the distance between the center of gravity of the head and the center of gravity of the tail and the percentage of tail DNA (Liu et al. 2009). Additionally, the <b>comet</b> tail <b>length</b> (DNA migration) was recorded.|$|R
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} found in males {{and one of the most}} common causes of cancer death. The epidemiology implicates environmental and nutritional factors in the initiation and progression of the disease. Identification of these factors would allow chemoprevention strategies to be tested. Potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are produced in cooked meat, and following metabolic activation some of them are strongly associated with prostate carcinogenesis in rodents. Primary cell cultures of human prostate epithelial cells were obtained from patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. Metabolic activation of the cooked food carcinogens 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo- [4, 5 -b]pyridine (PhIP) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was examined and resultant DNA damage (single strand breaks) measured using the Comet assay. Increased concentrations of carcinogen were associated with increased DNA damage and <b>comet</b> tail <b>length</b> compared to controls...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} observed that a 6 -day exposure of human pancreatic islets {{to a combination}} of cytokines (interleukin- 1 beta 50 U/ml + tumour necrosis factor-alpha 1000 U/ml + interferon-gamma 1000 U/ml) severely impairs beta-cell functions. In the present study, we examined whether this condition affects DNA integrity and viability of human islet cells. Cells were studied after 3, 6, and 9 days of cytokine treatment by both single cell gel electrophoresis (the "comet assay," a sensitive method for detection of DNA strand breaks) and by a cytotoxicity assay using the DNA binding dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide as indices for the number of viable, necrotic, and apoptotic cells. Cytokine treatment for 6 and 9 days resulted in a 50 % increase in <b>comet</b> <b>length</b> (P < 0. 01 vs. controls), indicating DNA strand breaks, as well as in {{a significant increase in the}} number of apoptotic cells (P < 0. 02 vs. controls), but not in the number of necrotic cells. The arginine analogs N(G) -nitro-L-arginine and N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine prevented nitric oxide formation by the cytokines but did not interfere with cytokine-induced DNA strand breaks and apoptosis. The present data suggest that prolonged (6 - 9 days) exposure of human pancreatic islets to a mixture of cytokines induces DNA strand breaks and cell death by apoptosis. These deleterious effects of cytokines appear to be independent of nitric oxide generation. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Today most {{of herbal}} {{medicines}} are marketing without any standard safety profiles. Although common {{assumption is that}} these products are nontoxic but this assumption may be incorrect and dangerous, so toxicological studies should be done for herbal drugs. According to the frequent use of Echium amoenum as immunostimulant and useful in conditions including pain, cough, sore throat and arthritis, and Nardostachys jatamansi as tranquilizer and sleep inducer and evidences of some toxicities, we assessed the probable effect of their extracts on DNA of hepG 2 cells using the comet assay. Materials and Methods: Different concentrations of above extracts of the plants are incubated with hepG 2 cells for 24 h. A mixture of cell suspension and agarose gel were put on slides, then slides were embedded in a lysing solution and were put in electrophoresis buffer (pH = 13). Then the electrophoresis procedure took place in an alkaline solution and after neutralization stage, colorization was done by ethidium bromide and comets were observed using a fluorescence microscope. At least 100 cells of each sample were evaluated and three parameters including <b>comet</b> <b>length,</b> percent of DNA in tail, and tail moment were assessed. Results: Both Aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extract of E. amoenum were genotoxic in the concentrations of 25 mg/ml and aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extract of N. jatamansi were genotoxic in the concentrations 5 and 10 mg/ml, respectively. Conclusions: Although E. amoenum and N. jatamansi are highly used in medicine, these herbs have genotoxic effects in determined concentrations {{and they should be}} used cautiously...|$|E
40|$|An {{artificial}} soil method {{was applied to}} {{study the effects of}} perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on earthworms (Eisenia fetida). Survival, growth inhibition and damage to DNA of earthworms were detected after 14 d acute exposure. The 14 d-LC 50 of PFOS and PFOA was 478. 0 mg center dot kg(- 1) dw and 759. 6 mg center dot kg(- 1) dw, respectively, indicating that they were of low toxicity. Both PFOS and PFOA could significantly inhibit the growth of earthworms after 14 d exposure, and growth inhibition rates increased with the greater concentrations of PFOS or PFOA, showing a dose-response relationship (PFOS: r = 0. 951, P <. 01; PFOA: r = 0. 962, P <. 01). PFOS or PFOA were shown to damage earthworm coelomocytes DNA, the indicators of treatments exposed to PFOS or PFOA, tail length (TL), <b>comet</b> <b>length</b> (CL), head DNA content (HD) and olive tail moment (OTM) were significantly different (P <. 05) from the control treatments, and the indicators and concentration of PFOS or PFOA had a strong dose-response relationship. 14 d-LC 50 of PFOS was lower than that of PFOA, the growth inhibition rate of earthworm exposed to PFOS was higher than that exposed to PFOA at the same concentration level, and the median values of TL, CL and OTM in PFOS treatments were also higher than those in PFOA treatments. In conclusion, both these fluorine compounds were moderately toxic to earthworms, but the PFOS effect was greater than that of PFOA...|$|E

40|$|Comet assay in myelodysplastic syndromes The {{comet assay}} (single-cell gel electrophoresis) has been {{established}} as a simple, rapid, flexible and sensitive method of detecting DNA damage in single cells(1, 2). Cells embedded in agarose on a microscope slide are lysed with detergent. Electrophoresis at high pH results in structures resembling comets, observed by fluorescence microscopy; {{the intensity of the}} comet tail relative to the head reflects DNA damage(2). The lesion of each cell is quantified according to the <b>comet</b> tail <b>length</b> as class 0 (no tail) to 4 (almost all DNA in tail) (3). Due to genetic instability of myelodysplastic syndromes, the comet assay can be useful to detect DNA lesion intensity and correlate this with cytogenetic abnormalities. Figure 1 illustrates a cell from a healthy 46 -year-old control individual classified as comet class 0.
