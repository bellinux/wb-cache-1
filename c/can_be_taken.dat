5|$|Edmund {{cannot be}} placed within any ruling dynasty. Numismatic {{evidence}} suggests he succeeded Æthelweard. According to the historian Susan Ridyard, Abbo of Fleury's statement that Edmund was 'ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus' <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to mean that}} he was descended from a noble and ancient race.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E

5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the {{intracranial}} pressure, {{as well as}} indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, {{it was only in}} the eighteenth century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E

5|$|In South Asia, it is {{advisable}} {{to take the}} snake which has bitten a person, if it has been killed, and carry it along {{to the hospital for}} possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the}} risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> up into the food chain.|$|E

25|$|Players {{can also}} produce siege {{weaponry}} such as, {{depending on what}} campaign they are playing, battering rams, catapults, siege towers, ballistae and war animals, such as camels and elephants.

5|$|Several {{measures}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to control}} infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing {{the quantity of}} feed given to fish {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|The console {{can monitor}} its {{internal}} temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating; alongside increasing fan speed, additional measures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken,</b> including forcing the hardware {{to run in}} a lower power state—a feature that was not present on Xbox 360. Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance, but the setting would be intended {{as a last resort}} to prevent permanent hardware damage.|$|E
5|$|The town of Mammoth Lakes, {{located near}} the {{southern}} end of the chain and Mammoth Mountain, is the largest populated area nearby. Mammoth Mountain Ski Area is located nearby and gondola rides <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> year-round (weather permitting) to the mountain's summit. The summit of Mammoth Mountain provides panoramic views of the craters and domes of the Mono–Inyo volcanic chain, Mono Lake, the Sierra Nevada and Long Valley Caldera.|$|E

5|$|Visitors {{arrive and}} leave via a bus. The entry price can be set, and loans <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> out. The player {{starts with a}} limited number of shops, rides, and {{facilities}} available. Research must be carried out to purchase others. Research can also make rides more durable, staff more efficient, and buses larger with increased capacity. The topic of research and how much funding goes into it is determined by the player.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based map, with the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which affects their weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> on.|$|E

5|$|If, on {{nomination}} day, {{there are}} two or more candidates nominated for election, the returning officer must immediately adjourn the election so that a poll <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> He or she must assign each candidate an approved symbol to be printed on the candidate's ballot paper and announce by publishing a notice of contested election in the Government Gazette with information about the forthcoming poll, including the candidates' names and symbols, the date of polling day (which must be not earlier than the 10th day or later than the 56th day after {{the date of the}} notice) and the locations of polling stations.|$|E
5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{by sending}} {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly {{directly into the}} cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated {{a new way to}} probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
