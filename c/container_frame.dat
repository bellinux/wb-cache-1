In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested).

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of thesis I want to describe few primary characteristics of the South Bohemia Region. It is a region with unique characteristics, which is frequently visited by domestic and foreign tourists. It is popular for its clean environment, historic monuments and especially for sport and recreational activities near water areas, which South Bohemia region has plenty of. Tourists are also frequently seeking recreational boating activities as ferry services for their travel and recration. The development of this economic phenomenon means more employment opportunities for the region, but it also increases chances of accidents and emergencies due to an unforseen accidents which can threaten the lives and wellbeing of the crew and the environment. Fire protection units should be fitted for an emergencies such as: drowning, drowned person search, icy water search and rescue and rescue in stream waters. The thesis is divided into the theoretical and the practical parts. The theoretical part deals with the definition of basic terms describing the issue of fire of the vessels {{as well as the}} tasks and procedures during fire fighting operations. It also presents a possible danger to rescuers exposed during operations such as rescue from the vessel burning on the water. There is a listing of the basic terms related to the complex vessel shape and the aquatic characteristics of the vessel. The practical part deals with the study of publications and current legislation, analysis of the Fire protection Units equipment and their readines for rescue work in case of a vessel fire. The enclosed data map illustrates a water area with ferry service in the South Bohemia Region and selected boarding platforms for fire protection units. It describes the use of container technology; modern and economical way of transportation used by the Fire and Rescue Service of South Bohemia Region since 2004. The proposed fire vessel, mounted on a standardize <b>container</b> <b>frame</b> and equipped with special container with stored technical equipment will be transported to the location of event by container carrier from FRS of South Bohemia Region. My theosis also describes the fire protection, fire equipment, personal protective equipment, equipment for working with hazardous substances, rescue tools, communication and portable emergency equipment which is normally used by the fire units of FRS of South Bohemia Region. To achieve the objective of the thesis and to answer the research questions, I did rely on the reference material obtained via search of the professional literary sources relevant to the Fire Fighting equipment and carrying out rescue work. To process the diploma thesis I did use the following: controlled interview with the station sergeants of various fire stations of FRS of South Bohemia, a collection of internal acts of the Ministry of Interior - General Directorate of Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, a collection of internal acts - Regional Directorate of FRS of South Bohemia, Regulations of Mechanical services of FRS of CR and the methodological aids of the Ministry of Interior of CR.

25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling <b>containers,</b> picture <b>frames,</b> and architectural molding from recycled PS.

40|$|Substructuring is a {{technique}} in finite element analysis for solving mechanical engineering problems involving large structures which are too enormous for existing computer hardware and software to handle. This technique involves breaking the system into parts, analyzing the parts, and then re-assembling the total system using selected degrees of freedom from the parts. This thesis also provides a review of substructure theory as a background. The state-of-art involving different approaches of the method is presented. The ANSYS {{finite element analysis program}} is used for the case studies of analyzing a <b>container</b> refrigeration unit <b>frame</b> structure. The experimental vibration test results on the structure are used for comparison with the analytical results from the modal analysis of the various case studies. Results from case studies of both the simple models and the complicated <b>container</b> refrigeration unit <b>frame</b> structure all indicate that substructuring by ANSYS renders better solutions than the conventional modal analysis with appropriate numbers of mass master degrees of freedom specified for each substructure. Additional master degrees of freedom are required in substructure dynamic analysis to achieve reliable solutions. Computer time saving is not achievable by using substructuring in ANSYS for dynamic analysis due to the excessive calculations used by the wave front solver for generating each substructure analysis. Computer time saving is only achievable for the cases of analyzing a structure representing repetitive or symmetrical features in geometry...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} aimed to improve {{supporting}} {{structures of the}} platform car {{to increase the efficiency}} of container transportations. Methodology. In order to achieve the objective, the strength investigations of the universal platform car of the model 13 - 401 were conducted, strength reserves of the supporting elements were defined, and more optimal profiles of basic longitudinal beams of the frame in terms of the minimum material capacity were proposed. Decision correctness was confirmed by the strength calculation of the platform car supporting structure at basic loading operational modes and fatigue taking into account the research database of 107 cycles. It has been proposed to equip a platform car with swing fitting stops for fastening <b>containers</b> on the <b>frame,</b> which allows transportation of 20 ft and 40 ft containers. In order to improve container transportation efficiency along international transport corridors running through Ukraine, a platform car of articulated type has been designed on the base of the improved platform car structure. The mathematical simulation of dynamic loads of the platform car with containers (two 1 CC containers) at operational loading modes has been carried out, the maximum accelerations influencing the support structure have been defined, and their multiple values have been considered in computer simulation of the strength of the platform car of articulated type. Findings. The support structure of the platform car of articulated type {{on the basis of the}} standard platform car has been developed.

40|$|Time {{matters in}} the world of {{container}} shipping. Every shipping company focuses on maximizing the use of its ships. This means maximizing the sailing hours and thus reducing the hours spent in ports For this reason shipping companies demand a turnover time of less than twenty four hours from the transhipment company. During these twenty four hours containers are lifted off and later on the ship. To meet the imposed time requirements it is of importance that ship motions are reduced to a minimum since the tolerances for placing containers are quite narrow. When designing a new container terminal it is necessary to know how much ship movement is allowable under normal conditions. The allowable ship motion determines the amount of protection that is needed for the berth. This research project has been initiated to determine improved "criteria for (un) -loading containerships". Beside these criteria the focus has been on establishing a relation between the handling rates and the motions of the vessel that is un-loaded. First a literature study has been undertaken. In this literature study five related papers are discussed and compared to each other. By comparing the papers it was possible to find a new approach to the subject. The new approach has been found in research done by Slinn, in 1979. He placed a steel frame on a quay that could be given a sine shaped motion. The frame represents the cell guides and the motions represent ship motions. He then asked a number of crane operators to participate in the test. The crane drivers were asked to place a container in the moving cell guides. During these tests Slinn gave the frame a certain amplitude and period and noted the number of attempts a crane driver needed to place a <b>container</b> into the <b>frame.</b> Further more he observed the steps taken by the crane drivers to place a container in the cell guides. He found out that crane drivers have no interest in following the moving cell guide but that they simply waited for the cell guide to pass under the container. Based on these two results from Slinn a model has been developed that calculates the reduced handling rates in case of increased ship motion. Full details of the model can be found in chapter 4. Furthermore a questionnaire has been sent out to verify the opinions of harbourmasters. Unfortunately the response was so disappointing that the questionnaire could not be used for scientific purposes. From this research project the conclusion is drawn that the criteria as proposed by PIANC are not strict enough. For undisturbed handling rates the maximum surge motion needs to be limited to 0. 3 m (peak to peak) and for sway the criteria should be 0. 2 m (peak to peak). Furthermore the reduction of the handling rates depends on the period of motion. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
