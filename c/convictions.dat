40|$|This project {{examines}} the social problem of wrongful <b>conviction</b> {{as it is}} represented online and in the news. Wrongful <b>conviction</b> discourse is a rhetorical arena in which activists, officials, vested interests, and social institutions interact. Data include 260 news stories about wrongful <b>conviction,</b> and the websites of four wrongful <b>conviction</b> activist groups. Chapter Three depicts {{the natural history of}} wrongful <b>conviction</b> in the news, noting three functions served by key news events: they ratify wrongful <b>conviction</b> as a legitimate problem, refocus this and other discourses, and reconcile the state with the individuals it has wrongly convicted. Chapter Four details “contextual bricolage,” the process by which wrongful <b>conviction</b> activists use online raw materials to surround and contextualize their website claims, thereby developing their own voice as “experts” on wrongful <b>conviction.</b> Chapter Five considers of the rhetoric of “junk science,” which indicates problems in the state’s use of science without attacking the legitimacy of science itself. Wrongful <b>conviction</b> consists of multiple, interconnected discourses, which occur in multiple media channels and give voice to various groups, who in turn utilize existing power structures to develop their own voices and call for progressive change. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how moral attitudes influence behavior has been greatly expanded by recent research on moral <b>conviction,</b> but little {{has been done to}} identify factors that contribute to the formation of moral <b>conviction.</b> The primary purpose of the present research was therefore to identify antecedents to moral <b>conviction.</b> Across two studies, three potential antecedents were identified - reliance on the Harm moral foundation, personal relevance, and attitude intensity. In study 1 (N = 469), high individual reliance on the Harm moral foundation predicted stronger moral <b>conviction.</b> In study 2 (N = 460), high personal relevance and greater attitude intensity predicted stronger moral <b>conviction.</b> Study 2 also tested three separate hypotheses forwarded by the Integrated Theory of Moral <b>Conviction</b> (ITMC) – the universality, objectivity, and emotion hypotheses. While results offered support for the objectivity and emotion hypotheses, support for the universality hypothesis was equivocal. Future research is required to determine the mechanism by which personal relevance increases moral <b>conviction</b> and the directional links between emotion and moral <b>conviction.</b> ...|$|R
