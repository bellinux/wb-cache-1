40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model of the <b>Coordination</b> <b>Level</b> of Saridis's Intelligent Machine {{paradigm}} [?]. The role of the <b>Coordination</b> <b>Level</b> is to translate a high [...] level command into a schedule of low [...] level primitive activities. The model presented here is based on Hierarchical Petri Nets and stochastic learning algorithms. We also present an analytic cost measure of the scheduling structure of the <b>Coordination</b> <b>Level.</b> For each high [...] level command there are numerous ways to schedule the primitive activities that achieve that command. However, we desire the schedule that results in the minimum execution time of the Intelligent Machine. The cost measure derived in this paper, which we call structural complexity, predicts the expected execution time of an Intelligent Machine given a particular schedule of its primitives. 1 Introduction During the past decade Saridis and his students have been incrementally progressing towards a realizable theory of intelligent machines [?, ?, ?].

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, construction {{and use of}} a unique laboratory rig {{for the study of}} dynamic crowd-structure interaction in cantilever grandstands. The rig replicates a fifteen-seat section of raked grandstand, allowing laboratory tests to be performed under conditions which accurately represent those in a prototype structure. Built-in force plates enable full recording of the loads due to jumping or bobbing of each test participant, permitting detailed evaluation of group <b>coordination</b> <b>levels</b> and dynamic load factors. To investigate a wide range of dynamic structural responses, the grandstand is supported on air springs and driven using linear electric actuators. This represents a pioneering application of electric actuation technology, which is normally restricted to lower force levels and mechanical/aerospace applications. The rig also uses novel control techniques to enable the actuators to behave as spring-dashpots, allowing the rig to respond to loads imparted by the human test subjects as a dynamic system with user-defined natural frequency and damping. It is believed {{that this is the first}} time such techniques have been applied to experiments involving human participants. The rig is being used to study the factors influencing crowd coordination when jumping and bobbing on a compliant structure, and to assess acceptability limits for grandstand vibrations. Early findings suggest structural motion generated by the second harmonic of the group-jumping load does not adversely affect jumping <b>coordination</b> <b>levels.</b> This observation has significant implications for modern cantilever grandstands. © Society for Experimental Mechanics 2010...|$|R

40|$|A formal {{model for}} the <b>coordination</b> <b>level</b> of {{intelligent}} machines is established. The framework of the <b>coordination</b> <b>level</b> investigated consists of one dispatcher {{and a number of}} coordinators. The model called coordination structure has been used to describe analytically the information structure and information flow for the coordination activities in the <b>coordination</b> <b>level.</b> Specifically, the coordination structure offers a formalism to (1) describe the task translation of the dispatcher and coordinators; (2) represent the individual process within the dispatcher and coordinators; (3) specify the cooperation and connection among the dispatcher and coordinators; (4) perform the process analysis and evaluation; and (5) provide a control and communication mechanism for the real-time monitor or simulation of the coordination process. A simple procedure for the task scheduling in the coordination structure is presented. The task translation is achieved by a stochastic learning algorithm. The learning process is measured with entropy and its convergence is guaranteed. Finally, a case study of the coordination structure with three coordinators and one dispatcher for a simple intelligent manipulator system illustrates the proposed model and the simulation of the task processes performed on the model verifies the soundness of the theory...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Coordination</b> across <b>levels</b> of care is {{becoming}} increasingly important due to rapid advances in technology, high specialisation {{and changes in the}} organization of healthcare services; to date, however, the development of indicators to evaluate coordination has been limited. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop and test a set of indicators to comprehensively evaluate clinical <b>coordination</b> across <b>levels</b> of care. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify indicators of clinical <b>coordination</b> across <b>levels</b> of care. These indicators were analysed to identify attributes of coordination and classified accordingly. They were then discussed within an expert team and adapted or newly developed, and their relevance, scientific soundness and feasibility were examined. The indicators were tested in three healthcare areas of the Catalan health system. 52 indicators were identified addressing 11 attributes of clinical <b>coordination</b> across <b>levels</b> of care. The final set consisted of 21 output indicators. Clinical information transfer is evaluated based on information flow (4) and the adequacy of shared information (3). Clinical management coordination indicators evaluate care coherence through diagnostic testing (2) and medication (1), provision of care at the most appropriate level (2), completion of diagnostic process (1), follow-up after hospital discharge (4) and accessibility across levels of care (4). The application of indicators showed differences in the degree of clinical coordination depending on the attribute and area. CONCLUSION:/nA set of rigorous and scientifically sound measures of clinical <b>coordination</b> across <b>levels</b> of care were developed based on a literature review and discussion with experts. This set of indicators comprehensively address the different attributes of clinical coordination in main transitions across levels of care. It could be employed to identify areas in which health services can be improved, as well as to measure the effect of efforts to improve clinical coordination in healthcare organizations.

We will show that the selection of a simple auction strategy provides a linear computational cost increase with the number of robots that make up the team and allows the solving of highly complex assignment problems in dynamic conditions by means of a hierarchical sub-auction policy.

In this study, the suitability of the KorperkoordinationsTest fur Kinder (KTK) as an assessment instrument for the gross motor coordination was evaluated in 2470 children from 26 elementary schools for general education spread over the Flemish and Brussels-capital region. All children performed four subtests: walking backwards (WB), moving sideways (MS), hopping for height (HH) and jumping sideways (JS). Age and gender-specific values were established for the Flemish children anno 2008. Overall, the current sample scored significantly worse than their 1974 German counterparts (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Background Motor {{skills are}} the basis for any bodily movement. They allow {{children}} to read, write, walk, talk and play sports. These skills {{play a central role}} in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives and specifically allow them to be physically active and healthy. However there is currently a lack of knowledge in relation to the level of fine motor skills in children both in Ireland and internationally. Fine motor skills are an essential component of numerous activities of daily life such as dressing and feeding and in addition to academic practices such as handwriting. Methods This cross-sectional study used the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT- 2) to evaluate the fine motor skill proficiency of Irish primary school children (N= 139) between the age of 6 - 12 years. A second measure involving a handheld pendulum was also used to determine children 2 ̆ 7 s sensory motor <b>coordination</b> <b>levels</b> with visual stimuli, auditory stimuli and a combination of both (multisensory). Results In terms of fine motor skill proficiency, only 1 st class children were found to be meeting the expected levels, while 3 rd and 5 th class children were found to score below the normative values for age and gender. There was a significant effect for gender, with boys being found to demonstrate higher levels of motor skill proficiency compared to girls. In addition, the investigation into sensory motor <b>coordination</b> <b>levels</b> of children also demonstrated an effect for age. The oldest children were found to demonstrate the best <b>levels</b> of <b>coordination</b> across visual, auditory and multisensory conditions. Discussion These low levels of fine motor skill proficiency might impede performance of everyday life activities as well as children 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to participate in physical activity (Bouffard, 1996; Cairney et al 2005, 2006). This lower level of fine motor skill proficiency for older Irish children in addition to the observed gender differences could be as a result of different societal, cultural and environment influences...|$|R
