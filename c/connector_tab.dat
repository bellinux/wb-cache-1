The calculation is useful to determine specific heat generation of this cell chemistry and design. The E(TP) value includes heat generation by electrochemical cell reactions, competitive chemical reactions, and resistance heating at the <b>tabs,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and leads. Heat flow was measured while applying electrical loads to the cell in an isothermal calorimeter set at 0, 20, and 60 C...|$|R
40|$|A co-planar tab-slot type of {{interconnect}} demonstrator for connecting {{power switching}} devices and DC bus capacitors {{has been designed}} and constructed, aimed at low inductance switching. The demonstrator is composed of a double-sided <b>tab</b> <b>connector</b> and a dual polarity slot. This type of interconnect eliminates the use of screw terminal connection between a power module and the DC bus {{as well as between}} the DC bus and power capacitors, thus serves to maintain a coplanar current profile throughout the power distribution path. Parasitic analysis both in impedance testing and in Finite Element simulation suggests that the inductance in the bus loop of the demonstrator is approximately half of that achieved in an equally dimensioned busbar with conventional screw terminals...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks, {{which are often}} unbraced, may depend solely on the pallet beam to upright connector and on the stiffness of the base plate to floor connection. This paper presents experimental results from cyclic tests performed on portal beam to upright bolted moment connections intended for cold-formed steel drive-in and drive-through storage racks. In storage racks, portal beams are typically connected to uprights by "tab connectors", which are costly to manufacture and experience initial looseness. By simply bolting the portal beams to the uprights, bolted moment connections may represent a cost-effective alternative to "tab connectors". A literature review shows that bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel members are economical and feasible. However, experimental results show {{a significant amount of}} looseness in the connection after an initial high moment-rotational stiffness. Being slender structures, storage racks are sensitive to the second-order P-? effect, and international racking specifications require the initial looseness of the <b>tab</b> <b>connectors</b> to be considered when analysing the {{stability of}} the rack in the down-aisle direction (sway motion). The non-linear cyclic behaviour of bolted moment connections is presented and explained herein. Based on finite element results, it is shown that, for drive-in and drive-through racks, the looseness in bolted moment connections can be ignored in ultimate limit states design. Finally, the paper concludes with proposing two methods, with different degree of complexity, for the design of drive-in and drive-through racks with bolted portal beam to upright bolted moment connections.
