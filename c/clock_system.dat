25|$|The shrine is {{dedicated}} to Emperor Tenji (626-671), the 38th emperor of Japan. Emperor Tenji carried out the Taika Reforms and aimed to complete the reform in the capital city, which was located {{on the west bank}} of Lake Biwa. He moved the Japanese capital from Asuka to Ōtsu in 667. Emperor Tenji also presided over the establishment of the first rōkoku, or Japanese water <b>clock</b> <b>system,</b> which was installed in 671.|$|E

The structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release {{in the part of}} clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century, and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in Western-style clockwork. In particular, timing device of Song I-yŏng's Armillary Clock adopts the early 17th century pendulum <b>clock</b> <b>system</b> which could remarkably improve the accuracy of a clock.|$|E
25|$|The Main Roads Department {{building}} was purpose-designed, accommodating the Main Roads Department's diverse uses in repetitive and rationalised floor plates. Although offices and administration areas comprised the majority, the building also included: basement car parking; food facilities {{for the staff}} - a large cafeteria with kitchen, kiosk for snacks, and lunch room; staff training facilities - a large, double-height auditorium with the latest projection equipment; a technical and recreation library; a room for displaying models of major Main Roads projects, and; a large air-conditioning plant and a caretaker's flat. The {{building was}} designed to incorporate modern office technology. The department's technical and commercial electronic data processing divisions were accommodated in the basement, including their {{state of the art}} computer, the largest in Queensland at the time. The computer was serviced by a special, independent air-conditioning system, designed to keep the computer room at a constant temperature and humidity, with the heat generated by the computer absorbed by the ornamental ponds {{at the front of the}} building. A system of vacuum message tubes connected all sections of the building and there were telephones and a master <b>clock</b> <b>system,</b> CCTV, a teleprinter system, a Xerox machine, and a dumbwaiter for the movement of files between floors.|$|E

500|$|The MTA {{has also}} started some {{projects}} to improve passenger amenities. It added train arrival [...] "countdown clocks" [...] to most A Division stations and the BMT Canarsie Line (...) by late 2011, allowing passengers on these routes to see train arrival times using real-time data. A similar countdown-clock {{project for the}} B Division and the IRT Flushing Line was deferred until 2016, when a new Bluetooth-based <b>clock</b> <b>system</b> was tested successfully. Beginning in 2011, the MTA also started [...] "Help Point" [...] to aid with emergency calls or station agent assistance. The Help Point project was deemed successful, and the MTA subsequently installed Help Points in all stations. Interactive touchscreen [...] "On The Go! Travel Station" [...] kiosks, which give station advisories, itineraries, and timetables, were installed starting in 2011, with the program also being expanded after a successful pilot. Cellular phone and wireless data in stations, first installed in 2011 as part of yet another pilot program, was also expanded systemwide due to positive passenger feedback. Finally, credit-card trials at several subway stations in 2006 and 2010 led to proposals for contactless payment to replace the aging MetroCard fare payment system used in the subway.|$|E

2500|$|Handheld game consoles, however, {{particularly}} Nintendo handhelds {{such as the}} Nintendo DS, have {{featured a}} number of innovative RPGs during the late 2000s. Square Enix's The World Ends with You (2007) featured a unique dual-screen action combat system that involves controlling two characters at the same time. Level-5's Inazuma Eleven (2008) introduced unique soccer football RPG gameplay incorporating sports game elements. The Atlus title [...] (2009) blends together both traditional and tactical RPG gameplay along with non-linear adventure game elements {{as well as an}} innovative demon auction system and a death <b>clock</b> <b>system</b> where each character has a specified time of death and the player's actions has consequences on who lives and dies. On the PlayStation Portable (PSP), Half-Minute Hero (2009) is a role-playing shooter featuring self-referential humour and a 30-second time limit for each level and boss encounter. Infinite Space (2009) by PlatinumGames is a hybrid of tactical role-playing game, real-time strategy and space simulator elements, and features a non-linear branching narrative with numerous choices that can have dramatic consequences, and an epic scale spanning hundreds of planets.|$|E

2500|$|Internal pattern {{generation}} {{operates on}} a wide range of time scales, from milliseconds to hours or longer. [...] One of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicity—that is, rhythmicity with a period of approximately 24 hours. [...] All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity, which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. [...] Experimental studies dating from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a [...] "genetic clock" [...] consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day. [...] Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share a similar genetic <b>clock</b> <b>system.</b> [...] The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time-of-day cues are available. [...] The clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in mammals, all of these [...] "tissue clocks" [...] are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.|$|E
2500|$|In the NBA (since 1954), Women's National Basketball Association (since 2006), and FIBA play (since 2000; 30-second from 1956 to 2000), {{the shot}} clock counts down 24 seconds, thus often {{being called the}} [...] "24-second clock." [...] If a shot is {{attempted}} and hits or enters the rim, or if the defensive team gains possession via a rebound, steal, or out-of-bounds play, the shot clock resets. [...] Failure by the offense to attempt a shot that hits the rim within the prescribed time results in a [...] "shot clock violation" [...] {{and a loss of}} possession to the other team. Three signals indicate when the shot clock expires—a shot clock signal, illuminated lights on the shot clock (NBA, FIBA, Euroleague, and many venues using an NBA-style transparent shot clock), and in the NBA and Euroleague only, a yellow LED light strip on the backboard. In the 2011–12 NBA season and 2014–15 Euroleague, the last five seconds of the shot clock were modified to include tenths of a second, allowing offensive players to see precisely how much time they have to shoot and officials to determine any last-second shots easily. In the 2016-17 NBA season, a new 'official timekeeper' deal for the NBA with Swiss watch manufacturer Tissot introduced a new united official game clock/shot <b>clock</b> <b>system,</b> putting both timing systems under the same system for the first time. Tissot also became official timekeeper for the WNBA in the 2017 season.|$|E

40|$|Since {{lactation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} metabolically demanding states in adult female mammals, beautifully complex regulatory mechanisms are in place to time lactation to begin after birth and cease when the neonate is weaned. Lactation is regulated by numerous different homeorhetic factors, all of them tightly coordinated with the demands of milk production. Emerging evidence support that among these factors are the serotonergic and circadian <b>clock</b> <b>systems.</b> Here we review the serotoninergic and circadian <b>clock</b> <b>systems</b> and their roles in the regulation of mammary gland development and lactation physiology. We conclude by presenting our hypothesis that these two systems interact to accommodate the metabolic demands of lactation and thus adaptive changes in these systems occur to maintain mammary and systemic homeostasis through the reproductive cycles of female mammals...|$|R
