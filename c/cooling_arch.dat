Down the central descent, the visitor still walks under a <b>cooling</b> <b>arch</b> of fountain jets, without getting wet. Michel de Montaigne, one of the earliest visitors to leave a description of Pratolino, saw it in 1581, and considered it to have been built, he thought when visiting Villa d'Este, [...] "precisely in rivalry with this place". A long description was published by a Florentine, Francesco de' Vieri, in 1586. Giusto Utens included a view of the southern half of the villa complex among his series of lunettes containing bird's-eye views of the Medicean villas, painted in 1599. Six views were etched by Stefano Della Bella in the mid-17th century, and the picture is rounded out by further 18th century descriptions. Nevertheless, Pratolino has not survived, as other Medici villas have.|$|E

She clapped her hands--a little negro girl appeared, {{to whom she}} gave an order, and presently two more negroes came in, bringing magnificent oranges and pomegranates, and iced wine and water, on a silver tray, covered with a richly-embroidered napkin.

Again, the bodykit was not just there for looks but was developed at the Monash University (alongside the EL Falcon race car program) wind tunnel to improve aerodynamics. The rear wing was said to greatly reduce aerodynamic lift at speed, and unique bonnet vents were placed in a low pressure area to help engine <b>cooling.</b> Wheel <b>arch</b> extensions were used to cover the wider EL GT 6-spoke alloy wheels.|$|R
60|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Humble Home {{were supposed to be}} amiable and intelligent. Carol planned for them a simple set with warm color. She could see the beginning of the play: all dark save the high settles and the solid wooden table between them, which were to be illuminated by a ray from offstage. The high light was a polished copper pot filled with primroses. Less clearly she sketched the Grimm drawing-room as a series of <b>cool</b> high white <b>arches.</b>|$|R

60|$|A social, {{sensible}} time, {{and when}} sunset came all turned homeward to make {{ready for the}} evening festivities. It was vaguely rumored that the pretty rustic bridge was to be illuminated, for the older people had taken up the idea and had their surprises ready {{as well as the}} young folks. A band was stationed by the river-side, a pretty villa on the hill blazed out with lines of light, and elms and apple-trees bore red and golden lanterns, like glorified fruit. The clerk of the weather was evidently interested in this novel entertainment, for the evening was windless, dark, and <b>cool,</b> so the <b>arch</b> of light that spanned the shadowy river shone splendidly. Fireworks soared up from the hill-top beyond, fireflies lent their dancing sparks to illuminate the meadows, and the three bridges were laden with the crowds, who greeted each new surprise with cries of admiration.|$|R
40|$|The Galactic center harbors some of {{the most}} massive star {{clusters}} known in the Galaxy: the Arches and the Quintuplet. Based on the Chandra observations of these clusters (PI: Wang) which recently became public, I discuss the X-ray emission from the massive stars in these clusters. Confirming the general trend for Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars being X-ray dim, none of them is detected in the Quintuplet cluster. The most massive star known in the Galaxy, the Pistol star, is also not detected, invoking questions regarding the proposed binary nature of this object. X-ray emission in the Arches cluster is dominated by three stellar point sources. All three sources as well as the cluster’s diffuse radiation show strong emission at 6. 4 – 6. 7 keV, indicating the presence of fluorescenting <b>cool</b> material. The <b>Arches</b> point sources may be identified as colliding wind binaries, albeit other possibilities cannot be ruled out. The X-ray emission from young stellar clusters, such as the Arches and the Quintuplet, is tightly coupled with the massive stars evolution. When a massive star evolves from O type to WN type, and finally to WC type, it keeps its bolometric luminosity nearly constant while its X-ray luminosity is likely to decline (Oskinova 2005). This trend is confirmed by the study of WR stars in the Galaxy and the LMC (Guerrero et al. in prep., also these proceedings). In th...|$|R
40|$|Background—Although a staged {{elephant}} trunk procedure {{has been widely}} used, the early mortality of the first stage operation {{as well as the}} interval mortality between operations remains unsatisfactory. We developed an alternative {{elephant trunk}} procedure to reduce mortality and morbidity. Methods and Results—Ascending aorta and arch vessels were minimally dissected. During systemic <b>cooling,</b> a four-branched <b>arch</b> graft with a sewing “collar ” and a long “elephant trunk ” was prepared. The ascending aorta was opened under selective brain perfusion with moderate hypothermia (25 °C), and the elephant trunk was then pulled down into the descending aorta using the catching catheter introduced via a femoral artery. The elephant trunk anastomosis using the collar was made {{at the base of the}} innominate artery. The arch vessels were divided and closed at aortic stump, and grafted separately as a consequence of the very proximal site for the elephant trunk anastomosis. Between October 1998 and September 2001, 17 patients, ranging in age from 25 to 79 years (mean 67 years) with extensive aortic aneurysm underwent this operation. Preoperative cardiac complications included coronary artery disease in 5, aortic regurgitation in 3, and 3 of these 8 patients had poor left ventricular function with an ejection fraction less than 40 %. Nine patients underwent a second stage operation, in 1 of them the permanent elephant trunk procedure was initially attempted but the second stage procedure was done because of increasing endo-leakage. The mean interval between operations was 8 days (range 1 to 14 days) in the remaining 8 patients. In 5 of 6 patients who underwent the permanen...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: One-stage {{repair of}} {{transposition}} of great arteries (TGA) and aortic arch obstruction (AAO) is currently advocated, but carries formidable surgical challenges. This report presents our experience and re-interventions for residual lesions {{over the last}} 10 years. Methods: Twenty-two patients (19. 5 ± 42. 4 days; range 2 - 206; median 10 days, 3. 5 ± 0. 6 kg) diagnosed with TGA (nine patients) or double outlet right ventricle (DORV) (13 patients) and AAO underwent one-stage repair. Of the nine TGA patients (two with intact ventricular septum), AAO were: two patients hypoplastic arch, one patient discrete coarctation, four patients hypoplastic arch with coarctation and two patients interrupted aortic arch. The 13 DORV patients were all of Taussig-Bing type and one showed multiple ventricular septal defects (VSDs). The degree of AAO ranged from hypoplastic arch in five patients, coarctation two patients, combined four patients and interrupted aortic arch (IAA) two patients. Arterial switch with Lecomte±VSD repair was performed during <b>cooling,</b> and aortic <b>arch</b> repair was performed under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) (35 ± 14 min at 16. 9 ± 0. 7 °C). Our preference was to use homograft patch-plasty for arch and direct end-to-side anastomosis for coarctation repair. Aortic-cross-clamp time was 124 ± 24 min and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time 215 ± 84 min. Results: Early survival was 19 / 22 (86 %) up to 30 days without mortality {{in the second half}} of our series. Three patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support and renal support was needed in three and preferred permanent pace maker (PPM) implantation in two. Length of stay was 21. 9 ± 22. 1 days. There was one late death and overall survival was 18 / 22 (82 %) for the follow-up period of 4. 8 years (0. 2 - 9. 8 years). Eight patients (44 %) required re-intervention for re-coarctation. Four patients required right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) /pulmonary artery re-interventions. At follow-up, there was no requirement for aortic valve replacement, residual VSD closure and no evidence of ventricular dysfunction. Conclusions: One-stage repair of TGA/DORV and AAO can be performed safely with a good survival rate. Three important lessons that we have learnt are as follows: (1) the subpulmonary VSD may have a perimembraneous component, (2) late re-coarctation is not infrequent and (3) late residual right-sided cardiac lesions remain an issue in complex TGA repai...|$|R
40|$|Turn on {{captions}} for written commentary (CC in {{bottom right}} corner of screen). Charcoal is a valuable fuel that reaches a higher temperature than the very wood it’s made from. I’ve made some before, but with supplies running low due to furnace experiments, I decided to make another large batch of charcoal in a mound. I stacked the wood into a roughly conical shape (about 1 m wide and 75 cm high) and then built a thick wall of mud around the heap (this took 6 hours). Eight air entries {{were made in the}} base of the mound and one air exit hole was left {{at the top of the}} mound to allow the volatile components of the wood to escape while creating a natural draft to keep everything burning. The mound was lit and the flame burned backwards down the heap in the opposite direction to the draft. This protects the coal made above the level of the fire from burning as carbon dioxide rushes past instead of oxygen, preventing combustion of charcoal. Each air entry was sealed only when fire became visible through them. This is an easy way to tell when to close them up, i. e. when the fire had burned down all of the wood in the heap. When the last air entry was closed, the air exit at the top of the mound was sealed, 5 hours after starting. The next day when <b>cool,</b> a large <b>arched</b> opening was made in the side of the mound to extract the charcoal. Despite a few unburnt brands the yield and quality was good filling almost 2 baskets. To see if the kiln was reusable, I restacked it with timber cut from a fallen gum tree branch up the mountain. Due to the difficulty in reaching into the mound I stacked the wood in criss-crossed horizontal layers. The opening was sealed with mud and the mound lit as before. This time the mound burned quickly and I had to seal it early as the timber was burning at different rates, 3 hours after starting. Some large logs remained unburnt while charcoal that had already formed started to burn up being wasted as ash. When I opened it the next day it had still produced an ok amount of charcoal but was disappointingly low compared to the first batch. This may partly be due to some of the wood being still green though it’s probably more likely to be due to how it was stacked. The lesson here is that when making charcoal the wood needs to be tightly stacked with few air spaces between. If not, the mound admits too much oxygen that quickly burns the timber. Another thought I had was that wood may convert to charcoal better if laid vertically (or roughly so, like the cone in the first firing) so that the fire starts at the top of the wood and burns down. Stacking the wood in horizontal layers means that each layer has to set the one bellow alight leading to problems if the wood is green (use dry wood if stacking horizontally). By stacking wood vertically each piece is alight already and simply burns down towards the air entries. Stacking in this way also makes it easier to see fire in the air entries letting you know when to seal the mound. For the reasons above I may make another charcoal kiln in future in the shape of a cylinder with air entries around the base and an open top. The kiln would be re-usable and easily stacked. A conical pile of wood would protrude above the walls of the kiln and be plastered in a temporary cover of mud. The kiln would be fired as with a normal mound and when finished the temporary cover of mud would be removed to extract the charcoa...|$|R
