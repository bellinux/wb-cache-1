5|$|Flight Unlimited II is a 1997 flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. The player controls one of five planes in the airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the aerobatics focus of its predecessor, Flight Unlimited, in favor of general civilian aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimiteds <b>computational</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time <b>computational</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's <b>computational</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E

An accurate modeling of the flow and heat transfer characteristics is paramount in order to obtain a realistic representation of the process.

The CFD-based design is simple, time- and cost-effective; the method predicts accurately the hydraulic performance of these devices. However, the CFD-based hematologic design is in its infancy. This thesis presents a holistic design approach for centrifugal blood pumps. The flow through the pump is simulated with a novel finite element method that accounts efficiently for deformable domains and moving parts while retaining desirable scalability on distributed-memory computers. The method is validated successfully against literature results in a benchmark problem of flow past a stirrer in a square cavity. Blood is treated as a Newtonian fluid in these initial simulations.

The method was also able to capture the differences in performance between hover and propeller modes. Good agreement was also found for the TILTAERO loads. The overall agreement with the experimental data and theory for the considered cases demonstrates the capability of the present CFD method to accurately predict tiltrotor flows.
