5|$|The dam was {{completed}} in September 1940. When built it was the longest <b>concrete</b> <b>gravity</b> dam in Australia, and also the second highest after the Burrinjuck Dam in New South Wales. As of 1997 of the 90 large concrete and masonry gravity dams in Australia the Canning Dam is still the fifth highest and the sixth longest. It is the largest concrete dam in Western Australia in terms of length of crest and volume of concrete.|$|E
5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a <b>concrete</b> <b>gravity</b> dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. {{state of}} Washington, built to produce {{hydroelectric}} power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means less power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{irrigation}} {{water in the}} Sacramento area {{and other parts of}} the Central Valley were also growing. In 1854, a diversion dam was constructed on the North Fork American River at the site of Auburn Dam, to divert water into ditches that supplied downstream farms. Irrigation with dam and canal systems was favored because the seasonal nature of the American River caused floods in some years and droughts in others. A large dam at the Auburn site was thus considered for both flood control and water supply. In the 1950s, the Bureau of Reclamation created the first plans for a high dam at Auburn. Several designs, ranging from earth-fill to <b>concrete</b> <b>gravity</b> dams, were considered. Before the dam could be built, the Auburn-Foresthill Road – which crosses the river just upstream of the dam site – had to be relocated. Even before the project was authorized, contracts were let for the construction of a high bridge to carry the road over the proposed reservoir, as well as preliminary excavations at the dam site.|$|E

25|$|A {{critique}} of Rogers's historical {{analysis of the}} dam's collapse {{was published in the}} journal California History in 2004 by historians Norris Hundley Jr. (Professor Emeritus, UCLA) and Donald C. Jackson (Professor, Lafayette College). While accepting most of his geological analysis of the failure, the article makes clearer the differences and deficiencies of the structure built in San Francisquito Canyon and how it fell short of the standards for large-scale <b>concrete</b> <b>gravity</b> dams as practiced by other prominent dam engineers in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|The Fujinuma {{irrigation}} dam in Sukagawa ruptured, causing {{flooding and}} washing away five homes. Eight people were missing and four bodies were {{discovered by the}} morning.

25|$|The intercepting sewers, {{constructed}} between 1859 and 1865, {{were fed}} by 450 miles (720km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed {{the contents of}} some 13,000 miles (21,000km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, 2.7 million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of <b>concrete.</b> <b>Gravity</b> allowed the sewage to flow eastwards, but {{in places such as}} Chelsea, Deptford and Abbey Mills, pumping stations were built to raise the water and provide sufficient flow. Sewers north of the Thames feed into the Northern Outfall Sewer, which fed into a major treatment works at Beckton. South of the river, the Southern Outfall Sewer extended to a similar facility at Crossness. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.|$|E
25|$|In October, 2013, Husky Energy and Government of Newfoundland & Labrador {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} amend the White Rose Development.

The announcement included the news that this oil resource could be exploited by installing a gravity based 'wellhead platform' structure over the western section of the oil field on the ocean floor in approximately 120 metres of water. To support this billion dollar wellhead platform construction project, Husky announced that it would be establishing a graving dock facility on the Northside Peninsula at Argentia to support the construction of the concrete base of the wellhead platform. Construction of the graving dock began in late 2013 and was finished in early 2015.
