Some valid {{information about the}} system can be easily derived directly from this description, for example that some atomic propositions cannot be valid at the same time.

As a result, we get smaller automata with shorter edge labels that are easier to understand and, more impor-tantly, for which the explicit model checking process performs better. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{abstraction}} of the probabilistic semantics of Multiset Rewriting to formally express systems of reactions with uncertain kinetic rates. This allows biological systems modelling when the exact rates are not known, but {{are supposed to}} lie in some intervals. On these (abstract) models we perform probabilistic model checking obtaining lower and upper bounds for the probabilities of reaching states satisfying given properties. These bounds are under- and overapproximations, respectively, of the probabilities one would obtain by verifying the models with exact kinetic rates belonging to the intervals. Key words: probabilistic model <b>checking,</b> <b>systems</b> biology, uncertain kinetic rates, abstract interpretation, interval Markov chains. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bounded model {{checking}} (BMC) {{based on}} satisfiability test-ing (SAT) {{has been introduced}} as a complementary technique to BDD-based symbolic model checking of LTL properties {{in recent years and}} a lot of successful work has been done with this approach. The basic idea is to search for a counter example of a particular length and to generate a propositional formula that is satisfied iff such a counter example exists. An over approximation of the length that need to be checked in order to certify that the system is error free is usually too big, such that it is not practical to use this approach for <b>checking</b> <b>systems</b> that are error free with respect to given properties. Even if we know the exact threshold, for a reasonably large system, this threshold would possibly also be large enough to make the verification become intractable due to the complexity of solving the corresponding SAT instance. This study is on a different direction and the aim of this study is verification of valid properties. We propose an approach to (partly) avoid the use of the completeness threshold as the verification criteria when <b>checking</b> <b>systems</b> that are er-ror free with respect to LTL properties. The benefit of the use of this approach may be very large compared {{to the use of the}} completeness threshold. Though, Prasad, Biere and Gupta pointed out in a survey paper [18] that, currently, the strength of SAT-based verification tech-niques lies primarily in falsification, this study explores the strength of SAT-based techniques for verification and the case study shows that this is a promising approach. ...|$|E

In automaton-based model <b>checking,</b> <b>systems</b> are modelled as transition systems, and correctness properties stated as formulae of temporal logic are translated into corresponding automata. An LTL formula is represented by a (generalised) Büchi automaton that accepts precisely those behaviours allowed by the formula. The model checking problem is then reduced to checking language inclusion between the two automata. The automaton construction is thus {{an essential component of}} an LTL model checking algorithm. We implemented a standard translation algorithm due to Gerth et al.

Unfortunately, while model <b>checking</b> <b>systems</b> code would be wonderful, it is almost never done in practice: building models is just too hard.
