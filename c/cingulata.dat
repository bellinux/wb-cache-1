25|$|Hickory is one {{of several}} host species of the twig girdler (Oncideres <b>cingulata).</b> Infested trees and {{seedlings}} are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive. A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are Phylloxera caryaecaulis, Caryomyia holotricha, C. sanguinolenta, and C. tubicola.|$|E
2500|$|Brighamia {{is quite}} {{unlike the other}} genera, with a {{succulent}} stem and long, thin, tubular flowers. [...] It was long {{thought to have been}} the result of a separate introduction, and its unique combination of characters made it difficult to place. [...] These characters are the result of adaptation to growing on cliffs and pollination by the endemic Hawaiian hawkmoth, Manduca blackburni. [...] This moth is now itself listed as endangered, surviving mainly on the southern slopes of Maui, well away from where Brighamia live. [...] Some pollination may be done by closely related alien hawkmoths such as the Five-Spotted Hawkmoth (M. quinquemaculata) and Pink-spotted Hawkmoth (Agrius <b>cingulata).</b> [...] Despite their inaccessible habitat on cliffs, Brighamia are sometimes hand-pollinated by botanists to ensure seed set. [...] Both species are now extremely rare. The genus is named in honour of the first director of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, William Tufts Brigham.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{the cherry}} {{can be a}} {{difficult}} fruit tree to grow and keep alive. [...] In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid ("cherry blackfly", Myzus cerasi), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis <b>cingulata</b> and Rhagoletis cerasi) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), {{which in turn is}} the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.|$|E
60|$|On the {{syenitic}} ridge, {{which forms}} the southern boundary of Herradura Bay and Plain, I found the Concholepas and Turritella <b>cingulata</b> (mostly in fragments), {{at the height}} of 242 feet above the sea. I could not have told that these shells had not formerly been brought up by man, if I had not found one very small mass of them cemented together in a friable calcareous tuff. I mention this fact more particularly, because I carefully looked, in many apparently favourable spots, at lesser heights on the side of this ridge, and could not find even the smallest fragment of a shell. This is only one instance out of many, proving that the absence of sea-shells on the surface, though in many respects inexplicable, is an argument of very little weight in opposition to other evidence on the recent elevation of the land. The highest point in this neighbourhood at which I found upraised shells of existing species was on an inland calcareous plain, {{at the height of}} 252 feet above the sea.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{position}} in which the shells lie, I was repeatedly struck here, at Concepcion, and at other places, with the frequency of their occurrence on the summits and edges either of separate hills, or of little flat headlands often terminating precipitously over the sea. The several above-enumerated species of mollusca, which are found strewed {{on the surface of}} the land from a few feet above the level of the sea up to the height of 1,300 feet, all now live either on the beach, or at only a few fathoms' depth: Mr. Edmondston, in a letter to Professor E. Forbes, states that in dredging in the Bay of Valparaiso, he found the common species of Concholepas, Fissurella, Trochus, Monoceros, Chitons, etc., living in abundance from the beach to a depth of seven fathoms; and dead shells occurred only a few fathoms deeper. The common Turritella <b>cingulata</b> was dredged up living at even from ten to fifteen fathoms; but this is a species which I did not find here amongst the upraised shells. Considering this fact of the species being all littoral or sub-littoral, considering their occurrence at various heights, their vast numbers, and their generally comminuted state, there can be little doubt that they were left on successive beach-lines during a gradual elevation of the land. The presence, however, of so many whole and perfectly preserved shells appears at first a difficulty on this view, considering that the coast is exposed to the full force of an open ocean: but we may suppose, either that these shells were thrown during gales on flat ledges of rock just above the level of high-water mark, and that during the elevation of the land they are never again touched by the waves, or, that during earthquakes, such as those of 1822, 1835, and 1837, rocky reefs covered with marine-animals were it one blow uplifted above the future reach of the sea. This latter explanation is, perhaps, the most probable one with {{respect to the}} beds at Concepcion entirely composed of the Mytilus Chiloensis, a species which lives below the lowest tides; and likewise with respect to the great beds occurring both north and south of Valparaiso, of the Mesodesma donaciforme,--a shell which, as I am informed by Mr. Cuming, inhabits sandbanks at the level of the lowest tides. But even in the case of shells having the habits of this Mytilus and Mesodesma, beds of them, wherever the sea gently throws up sand or mud, and thus protects its own accumulations, might be upraised by the slowest movement, and yet remain undisturbed by the waves of each new beach-line.|$|E

50|$|A. <b>cingulata</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. Its specific epithet <b>cingulata</b> {{is from the}} Latin word cingulum ("belt") referring to the bee's bands. The genus Amegilla contains over 250 additional species, but several are virtually indistinguishable from A. <b>cingulata,</b> so are commonly confused with it.|$|E
50|$|T. brevifacies is {{frequently}} confused with T. <b>cingulata</b> in locations where both species co-occur. T. <b>cingulata</b> appears to {{much more common}} than T. brevifacies, particularly in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is believed T. <b>cingulata</b> is a parasitoid of chrysomelid beetle larvae in the genus Paropsis, which are abundant herbivores in many Australian environments. Only T. brevifacies {{is known to be}} present in New Zealand.|$|E
