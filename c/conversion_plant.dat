40|$|Solid {{biomass is a}} limited, locally {{available}} resource, {{which has}} in most cases to be transported from production areas to utilization areas. Due to low energy density of solid biomass, logistics become critical because transport costs can negatively affect the performance of bio-energy supply chains. For this reason, a number of optimization and simulation models have been proposed in literature to evaluate and possibly minimize costs of biomass logistics foe energy onversion plants. Existing models usually assume location and requirements by energy <b>conversion</b> <b>plants</b> as assigned parameters. However, both supply and demand issues {{should be taken into}} account in solving location problems, and decisions about location, capacities, and technologies of <b>conversion</b> <b>plants</b> and about supply areas should be taken at the same time.
