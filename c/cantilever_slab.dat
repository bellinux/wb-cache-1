Pressure measurements and derived force calculations on the simple vertical wall were used to evaluate the existing prediction formulas. A significant effect of the cantilevering part is observed on the total horizontal force and overturning moment of a simple vertical wall.

40|$|A {{vertical}} structure with an overhanging horizontal cantilevering slab is {{tested in a}} small-scale test set-up (with a scale factor of 1 : 20) under loading conditions of violent wave impacts. Tests are conducted using regular waves for different values of water depth and wave period. All the events are recorded by a high speed camera and pressures are measured with 10 Quartz pressure sensors using a 20 kHz sampling frequency. A single approaching wave creates two individual impacts which occur sequentially on the vertical and horizontal parts. Both impact pressures and forces are non-repeatable under nominally identical conditions. Beneath the horizontal part, the shock pressures occur even for non-breaking waves which {{are the result of}} accelerated water jets along the vertical part. Waves are classified into four breaker types based on Oumeraci et al. (1993). The largest peak pressures are recorded at the still-water level on the vertical part (109 kPa) and at the fixed corner of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>slab</b> (123 kPa). In addition to these locations, the local pressures measured at the upper corner of the vertical part are also high. Consequently, the presence of a horizontal structural part increases the vulnerability of the {{vertical structure}}s against violent wave impacts...|$|E

This article presents an experimental study on the strengthening of reinforced concrete <b>cantilever</b> <b>slabs</b> where the anchorage of the top steel reinforcing bars into the adjacent wall was insufficient. The experimental study involved the use of a fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening system and fibre Bragg grating sensors for strain monitoring. The fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening system consisted of glass fibre-reinforced polymer sheets and glass fibre- reinforced polymer spike anchors which connected the glass fibre-reinforced polymer sheets to the adjacent concrete wall. The test results showed that the fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening system was effective in improving the load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete <b>cantilever</b> <b>slabs</b> and the fibre Bragg grating sensors worked efficiently and reliably for strain monitoring. The debonding in glass fibre-reinforced polymer sheet/glass fibre-reinforced polymer anchor-to-concrete bonded joints was found to be a progressive process associated with an increasing load.

Skew coefficient for stress of skewly supported three-span continuous box girder is introduced {{to reflect the}} decrease degree of the normal stresses at the {{cross section of the}} middle span of the box girder. The finite element models of the skewly supported three-span continuous box girders with different skew angles are established by applying the SHELL 63 shell element in software ANSYS. The variation of the skew coefficient for stress at different calculation points of middle span cross section under concentrated load is analyzed and the corresponding influence law is revealed. Research results show that the skew coefficient for stress of top slab is different from that of bottom slab at the cross section of the skewly supported three-span continuous box girder. The skew coefficient for stress of top slab is smaller than that of bottom slab. Skew coefficient for stress decreases with the increasing of the skew angle. Because of the shear lag effect, the minimal skew coefficient for stress of flanges occurs at the free tip of <b>cantilever</b> <b>slab</b> while the maximal skew coefficient occurs at the intersection of web and flange slabs...|$|E
40|$|Anomalous {{results from}} a number of raft {{foundation}} and pile cap designs in Hong Kong employing the finite element analytical method have revealed the shortcomings of some popular plate elements. For simple cases with these problematic plate elements, this paper proposes to use simple interpolation functions to overcome the abnormalities. For more general cases, an improved pseudo-higher order rectangular plate element has been developed in this paper. The element possesses nine number of nodes which include the four corner nodes, four midside nodes and one centre node in the formulation of its shape functions. Such high order polynomials can simulate the structural behaviour much better than the classical plate element for both thin and thick plate configurations. In the formulation, the four mid-side nodes and the centre node are turned 'pseudo' by having their displacements incorporated into that of the four corner nodes. Such static condensation can reduce the required computer capacities as well as provide greater convenience for simulation of the structure and the boundary conditions. Comparisons with the former eight node plate element by the authors and the analytical solution by series have shown that this nine node element can perform well even when the mesh is coarse. The merits of the proposed nine node element over other popular plate elements are further illustrated by cross-comparison on a simple <b>cantilever</b> <b>slab</b> problem.

The relations between measured p max on the both vertical and horizontal parts and related rise times (t r) are analyzed and new non-dimensional functions are proposed. The boundary conditions for occurring of high dynamic pressures are determined both on the vertical and horizontal part. Three different pressure distribution cases are proposed as SBW, BW and BWSAT according to the breaker type. For each breaker type, the local pressure ratio's p h 3 /p h 1, p h 1 /p v 1, and p h 2 /p v 1 are analyzed, where p h 1, p h 2 and p h 3 are the local peak pressures at the SWL and top and bottom of the vertical part respectively, whereas, p v 1 is the local peak pressure on the horizontal part.

40|$|Strengthening of RC <b>cantilever</b> <b>slabs</b> using bonded glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) strips has {{recently}} been explored.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) {{beams and}} slabs can be strengthened by bonding fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites to their tension face. The performance of such flexurally strengthened members can be compromised by debonding of the FRP, with debonding initiating near an intermediate crack (IC) in the member {{away from the}} end of the FRP. Despite considerable research over the last decade, reliable IC debonding strength models still do not exist. The current paper attempts to correct this situation by presenting a local deformation model that can simulate IC debonding. The progressive formation of flexural cracks, and the associated crack spacings and crack widths are modelled from initial cracking to the onset of debonding. The bond characteristics between the longitudinal steel reinforcement and concrete, and the FRP and concrete, as well as the tension stiffening effect of the reinforcement and FRP to the concrete, are considered.

A lot of {{research has been done}} since 1940 s to develop design philosophies against blast forces. As a result, a number of methods have been introduced to estimate design parameters and procedures have been developed to carry out blast resistant designs. Conventional designs codes consider risks such as excessive wind, floods, water waves, earthquakes, crashing of vehicles or aircraft on to buildings, collapse of masses, explosions (gas pipes, gas containers, pressured water lines etc) and consequences of human error. However, designs for explosions using explosives (bombs) are not included in commonly used conventional design codes.

This paper first presents the results of IC debonding tests conducted on eighteen <b>cantilever</b> <b>slabs</b> in which IC debonding initiated at or near the fixed end, and four simply-supported slabs in three-point bending where IC debonding initiated at the load position. A number of factors are covered by these tests, including the type of FRP material, the width of FRP strip, the length of FRP strip, the slab width, the concrete strength, the longitudinal steel ratio, the concrete cover, and pre-cracking of concrete. The test results are next used to assess the accuracy of four available strength models {{that can be used to}} design against IC debonding. Of these four models, Teng et al's (2003) model is shown to provide safe predictions of the test results in most cases but can lead to overly conservative results; the scatter of the predictions is also large.

The {{research emerged from}} Pieters Bouwtechniek Delft and Hi-Con Denmark. They cooperatively designed very slender balconies in ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete. Other engineering firms tend to recreate these balconies in HSC and insecurities emerged around the cracking behaviour and crack width prediction for these slender HSC cantilevering balconies. In addition to this research an informative report, also functioning as a literature study, on the connection of prefabricated concrete balconies is produced. This report is separately attached. The research is step wisely conducted starting with a simple fully clamped <b>cantilevering</b> <b>slab.</b> For this slab the cross sectional height, reinforcement diameter and reinforcement spacing are varied to investigate their influence on analytical crack width predictions. First for all variants an analytical design and analysis process is executed, followed by a numerical analysis with DIANA FEA and {{a comparison of the}} results. The most important observation is that for a cross sectional height of 120 mm or smaller reinforcement bars are located outside the effective area, making the analytical method unsuitable. Furthermore, a big discrepancy between the predictions of the different analytical models is observed, indicating an unreliability of these methods. In two steps the fully clamped balcony is transformed into a Hi-con shaped balcony executed in HSC. It appeared that in light of detailing rules from Eurocode 2 an exact reproduction is impossible, but the concept could be reproduced in a less slender way. Furthermore, by comparing analytical and numerical design results for two different balcony designs it is found that the accuracy of the analytical crack width prediction depends on geometric disturbances. In case a geometric disturbance is present in a slender area loaded in tension peak stress concentrations occur, which negatively influence the reliability of the analytical crack width prediction. In case the area is less slender, the effect is less pronounced and the conservative characteristics of the analytical method outweigh the influence of the concentrated peak stresses. When summarizing, it appears that specific care should be taken when analytically predicting crack widths in slender balconies because it might appear that the reinforcement is not located in the effective area. Furthermore, the more slender the structures become, the bigger the influence of a geometric disturbance can be, increasing the risk of an underestimation of the occurring crack widths because peak stress concentrations are analytically not accounted for.

An optical waveguide is formed from a 2. 2 mm thick SiO 2 layer deposited on a single crystal silicon wafer and etched to yield a SiO 2 /Si composite <b>slab</b> <b>cantilever.</b> Using a novel capacitively coupled reactive ion etching (RIE) technique, a cavity is back-etched in the silicon to release the 30 [...] 40 mm thick and 0. 5 [...] 1. 5 mm long cantilevers from the wafer. An etch rate of 2. 0 [...] 2. 2 mm/min in Si, an anisotropy of 0. 5 and selectivity to thermal oxide (Si:SiO 2 8 : 6 : 1) are reported. Evaporated aluminum film {{is used as a}} passivation material. Optical and mechanical tests are performed on these microfabricated structures. The first mode resonances are found between 16 and 52 kHz with response amplitudes ranging from 62. 5 to 420 mm. Optical throughput was estimated at 10 nW, but this was greatly diminshed due to scattering losses, primarily {{at the edges of the}} waveguide. Since cantilever waveguides with resonant frequencies above 20 kHz are potentially suitable for video rate scanning, these devices maybe used for image acquisition and display...|$|R
