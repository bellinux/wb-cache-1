Establishment of the ZNG as a police force with {{military}} capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the JNA. The ZNG, formally established on 23 April, was tasked with protection of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>order,</b> maintenance of public order, anti-terrorist operations, protection of Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, as well as the protection of high-value structures and high-profile persons.|$|E

Its {{formation}} {{as a police}} force with military capability was considered necessary by Croatian authorities after March clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes {{and the possibility of}} further confrontation with the JNA. Since it was illegal to establish a separate military in a constituent republic of Yugoslavia, the ZNG was planned as part of the police force under the Ministry of the Interior. Parliament amended the Internal Affairs Act on 18 April, and the ZNG was formally established five days later. It was tasked with the protection of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>order,</b> the maintenance of public order, anti-terrorist operations, the protection of Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, valuable structures and high-profile individuals. Although the ZNG was formally subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior, its founding legislation stipulated that it would be commanded by the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon dissolved into chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of <b>constitutional</b> <b>order</b> allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after a quarrel with the Emperor.|$|E
40|$|Globalisation sparks {{aspirations}} {{for a new}} era of politics in which the world order would be constitutionalised. Whether this marks the coming of an age of global constitutionalism, as we currently understand constitutionalism, requires further investigation. This article aims to cast light on the issues surrounding global <b>constitutional</b> <b>ordering</b> by way of an examination of the relationship among the constitution, constitutionalism and political power in political modernity. It is argued that constitutionalism and political power are traditionally reconciled as <b>constitutional</b> <b>ordering</b> within the framework of a constitutional nomos. At the core of this constitutional nomos is a dual delimitation of boundaries, generational and jurisdictional. A close inspection, however, shows that the constitutional nomos collapses in the process of globalisation, unsettling the reconciliation of constitutionalism and political power in <b>constitutional</b> <b>ordering.</b> As a result, <b>constitutional</b> <b>ordering</b> in the global era fluctuates between selective constitutionalism and constitutional fragmentism, signalling the end of constitutionalism as we know it...|$|R

Indicating that political power grounded by a constitution is omnipotent, complementing and completing constitutionalism, this paper contends that an omnipotent <b>constitutional</b> <b>ordering</b> is anything but an unleashed Leviathan. It is argued that constitutional omnipotence is framed and thus constrained by a constitutional nomos, the matrix of which is a dual delimitation of boundaries, generational and jurisdictional...|$|R

Under this emergency law, all High court judges, including the Supreme Court justices, were asked to take oath under this Provisional <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Order.</b> Those who didn't were placed under effective house arrest. A seven-member bench issued a restraining order on the same day, barring the government from implementing emergency rule and urging other government officials to not help do so.|$|E

40|$|Legal {{scholars}} {{have been inspired}} by the dialogic approach and rallied around it as the solution to constitutional conflict in domestic <b>constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> and the transnational legal landscape. This paper aims to show that the gravitation towards judicial dialogue in contemporary constitutional theory misses the point, given the ambiguities surrounding it. My investigation reveals that the dialogic approach does not succeed in guiding the inter-departmental or inter-regime interactions in a way that no single power would exert unilateral domination. The emergence of judicial supremacy in both national and transnational <b>constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> further suggests that underlying those ostensible examples of judicial dialogue is a transfigured conception of sovereignty. As it is the rise of judicial sovereignty that drives the move towards judicial dialogue in contemporary constitutional developments, I suggest that legal scholars shift focus of attention from the idea of dialogue to the enhanced judicial role in the new constitutional era...|$|R

40|$|Riding {{the wave}} of globalisation, {{scholars}} and practitioners envision global governance as a legalised world order. This international rule of law movement is centred {{on the idea of}} global constitutionalism. However, the constitutional view of global governance raises fundamental questions pertaining to the nature of international law, the culture of <b>constitutional</b> <b>orders,</b> and the future of global governance: What is the added value for the international legal system to be viewed in constitutional terms? How would comprehensiveness characteristic of traditional <b>constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> figure in an increasingly fragmented world order? Does the new era of constitutionalism herald a paradigm shift in thinking constitutionalism? Ruling the World? Constitutionalism, International Law, and Global Governance, edited by Jeffrey L. Dunoff and Joel P. Trachtman, attempts to illuminate the idea of global constitutionalism. Engaging with the contributors to the collection, this article aims to achieve two goals. In addition to providing a typology of global constitutionalism to help discern the distinct locales where global constitutionalism emerges and dissect its plural meanings, this article argues that global constitutionalism sits at the crossroads of law and language.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess the Crown’s Constitutional duty of {{consultation}} and its application on the holders of Treaty rights. Indigenous legal and <b>Constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> are the underpinning of the consensual Treaties. They were negotiated by sovereign nations through mutual consent and established a distinct Constitutional authority establishing rights, responsibilities and rules of coexistence. Their implementation is a Crown Constitutional obligation. This thesis argues that the duty to consult jurisprudence reveals systemic colonial problems in the common law Treaty rights paradigm by colonial interpretation, unilateral abridgement and justified infringement of the consensual Treaty. Further, judicial and politically created doctrines of the honour of the Crown and reconciliation are rendered meaningless when used {{as part of the}} ongoing colonial paradigm and abridgement of Treaties. This thesis argues that Canada must enter a post-colonial era by giving content to Indigenous legal and <b>Constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> by implementing Treaty through Treaty Constitutionalism. This requires Canada to undertake a Constitutional paradigm shift to accord the sacred and inviolable Treaties their proper place as foundational instruments in the building of Canada. This means, as well, that the only forum for proper consultation on the numbered Treaties is through Constitutional conferences with full and equal participation of Treaty First Nations...|$|R

25|$|In July 2009, the then-Lahore High Court Chief Justice Khawaja Muhammad Sharif {{referred}} to the Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan {{a list of names}} of justices who took oath under the 2007 Provisional <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Order,</b> stating that doing so went against the restraining order issued on 3 November 2007. By taking this oath, the judges swore to abide by the 2007 Proclamation of Emergency, the 2007 Provisional <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Order</b> No. 1, and the Code of Conduct established by the Supreme Judicial Council. This referral caused the Supreme Court to first decide it could begin contempt of court charges against many of the higher court justices who took the oath. It also caused President Asif Ali Zardari to issue orders declaring that the 76 judges that had taken the oath would no longer hold office until the decision on 31 July 2009. These judges were spread throughout the Pakistan Supreme Court, Lahore High Court, Sindh High Court, Peshawar High Court, and the Islamabad High Court.|$|E

40|$|To mark 40 {{years of}} the Portuguese {{constitutional}} project and the 30 years of its interaction with the European (also constitutional) project, the text seeks, through the theme of good administration, to give practicality {{to the theory of}} inter-constitutionality – as it is a proposal construed by Portuguese doctrine, which seeks to explain the relationship between the EU legal <b>order</b> and the <b>constitutional</b> legal <b>orders</b> of the Member States. The hermeneutic exercise undertaken aims to extract from the Portuguese constitutional text, through the cross-interpretation of Article 268 CRP with Article 41 CFREU, elements {{for the construction of a}} concept of good administration relevant in the Portuguese <b>constitutional</b> legal <b>order</b> that, without prejudice to other dimensions/ projections, is also open to the subjective/protective dimension of good administration highlighted in the EU <b>constitutional</b> legal <b>order.</b> Assuming the European integration process is a dynamic factor of constitutional development, the present analysis regards the systemic differences in the feld of good administration as inviting discursive conciliation with an aim to articulate a unity of meaning in the matter of good administration. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} shed light on these questions, I first address why there is a European context of justice beyond the nation state; then I discuss the claim that {{supranationalism}} leads to competition over final decision-making authority. The solution to this problem is found in the fusion of <b>constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> and in a shared ‘Grundnorm’ in European normative orders. I take issue with Jürgen Habermas’ idea of a “Federation of European nation states” and claim there is and can only be one constituting subject even in a multilevel configuration like the EU. This finally paves the way for seeing the EU as a non-state government with a universalistic foundation and vocation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} {{the introduction of}} a distinction between legislative and non-legislative acts in the Constitutional Treaty. The drafting history and the possible implications are analyzed. Questions covered include: Was the introduction of the distinction necessary in terms of clarification or was it primarily a lever to strengthen support for more powers to the European Parliament and the Commission? Could the distinction nurture false expectations of what the EU is, or could it undermine efforts at improving transparency and enforcement of subsidiarity? The paper concludes that the distinction probably has little real significance and no serious counterproductive effects. The drafting history and analysis illustrate the pitfalls of analogies to national <b>constitutional</b> <b>orders</b> and the complexity of simplification. ...|$|R
