40|$|Being one of {{a series}} of {{technical}} support papers pertaining to the South African paediatric food-based dietary guidelines, this paper specifically deals with two of the guidelines proposed for the age group 6 – 12 months regarding the introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> in the infant's diet. Studies have shown that most of South African infants receive solid foods at the age of 4 months or earlier while only a small percentage are breastfed exclusively until 6 months. The untimely and inappropriate introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> have been shown to be risk factors for both under- and over-nutrition with resultant under- or overweight, stunting and micronutrient deficiencies. Optimal timing for the introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> will depend on the infant's physiological and developmental status. Small, frequent meals of easily digestable, smooth, semisolid nutrient- and energy-dense <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> should initially be offered while gradually increasing variety in both the type and texture of food. Protein and carbohydrate intake should increase with the infant's age while preference should be given to foods rich in micronutrients. It should be observed that certain foods, such as fresh cow's milk and egg white, because of their allergenic properties, as well as fat-free and high-fibre foods, excessive fruit juice and low nutrient value drinks such as tea are not recommended.

How parents make decisions regarding this is poorly studied. This study begins to address the dearth of research into the decision-making processes used by first-time mothers relating {{to the introduction of}} <b>complementary</b> <b>foods.</b> Methods: This qualitative explorative study was conducted using interviews (13) and focus groups (3). A semi-structured interview guide based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The TPB, a well-validated decision-making model, identifies the key determinants of a behaviour through behavioural beliefs, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control over the behaviour. It is purported that these beliefs predict behavioural intention to perform the behaviour, and performing the behaviour. A purposive, convenience, sample of 21 metropolitan parents recruited through advertising at local playgroups and childcare centres, and electronically through the University community email list self-selected to participate. Data were analysed thematically within the theoretical constructs: behavioural beliefs, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Data relating to sources of information about the introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> were also collected. Results: Overall, first-time mothers found that waiting until six months was challenging despite knowledge of the WHO recommendations and an initial desire to comply with this guideline. Beliefs that <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> would assist the infants’ weight gain, sleeping patterns and enjoyment at meal times were identified. Barriers preventing parents complying with the recommendations included subjective and group norms, peer influences, infant cues indicating early readiness and food labelling inconsistencies.

Finally, other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron, anemia, and vitamin A supplements and vitamin-fortified foods and ready-to-use products. Programs addressing micro-nutrient deficiencies, such as those aimed at anemia, have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women.

Participants were recruited in the Corniche Hospital, the main maternity hospital in the city of Abu Dhabi. Factors affecting the duration of breastfeeding and the introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> were investigated using univariate and multivariate statistics. Recommended infant feeding practices, such as exclusive breastfeeding {{for the first six months}} of life and timely introduction of appropriate <b>complementary</b> <b>foods,</b> were poorly adhered to. Factors implicated in early cessation of breastfeeding included: time to first breastfeed, mother’s education level, employment status and early introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{microbiological}} {{concentration of}} commonly used local <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> {{in three states}} of North Western Nigeria were carried out. Total aerobic count in <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> from Kaduna state was greater than the 10 4 permissible limits. Unacceptable levels of Salmonella and Shigella were detected {{in some of the}} samples. Results also indicated the predominance of Staphylococcus sp. and fungi and molds, which showed that the levels of contamination of some of the samples are very high when compared to International Standards. Attention needs to be paid to the specific behaviours surrounding feeding and any constraints to care as important interventions in order to improve feeding practices in Northern Western Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} impact of quality certification on the demand for locally-produced infant foods. To avoid stunting or wasting, most children aged 6 – 24 months need to complement breastmilk with processed foods having higher energy density than adult foods. Donors have subsidized the production and distribution of such <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> in Mali and elsewhere, but {{on the open market}} these products fail to attract consumers. Almost all <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> are either produced at home, or sold under heavily-advertised brand names. The dissertation posits that consumers may avoid “generic” <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> because they cannot observe their content, and tests the hypothesis that independent quality certification can partially substitute for brand advertising at much lower cost. ^ To test whether certification would be cost-effective, we introduce an innovative experimental-market survey to elicit consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to pay for quality certified products. Consumers 2 ̆ 7 mean willingness-to-pay for certification was 455 FCFA (approximately US 0. 70) per package of 400 g. of certified local product. The marginal cost of certification is estimated to be between 77 and 125 FCFA per package. The estimated total economic surplus gain from introducing certification could range between US 0. 95 to US 2. 5 million per year. Statistical analysis provides evidence that willingness to pay for quality assurance exceeds the estimated cost of certification for almost all households, and rises with consumers 2 ̆ 7 education and income level. ^ The data and results presented here suggest that there would be very large gains from introducing quality certification to the market for <b>complementary</b> <b>foods.</b> A legal and institutional analysis suggests how a self-financing quality certification system would work in Mali. Further research towards implementation is needed, so that private-sector provision of low-cost <b>complementary</b> <b>foods</b> can emerge and supplement other elements of national child-nutrition and anti-poverty policies such as maternal education, and the provision of primary health care. ...|$|R
