5000|$|Hanotea (Hebrew: הנוטע, [...] "the Planter") was a citrus {{planting}} {{company based}} in Netanya and established in 1929 by long-established Jewish settlers in Palestine involved in the Benei Binyamin movement. In a deal worked out with the Reich Economics Ministry, the blocked German bank accounts of prospective immigrants would be unblocked and funds from them used by Hanotea to buy agricultural German goods; these goods, along with the immigrants, would then be shipped to Palestine, and the immigrants would be granted a house or <b>citrus</b> <b>plantation</b> by the company to the same value. Hanotea's director, Sam Cohen, represented the company in direct negotiation with the Reich Economics Ministry beginning in March 1933.

40|$|The {{fruit fly}} Bactrocera dorsalis complex is {{important}} pest on <b>citrus</b> <b>plantation</b> at highland Karo district North Sumatera Province. The studies {{with the aim}} to find out its daily activity pattern and population dynamic on <b>citrus</b> <b>plantation</b> have been done. Fruit flies were collected by water bottle trap with methyl eugenol attractant. Sampling for daily activity pattern was done per two hours for two months (April to May 2011) from 06. 00 a. m until 18. 00 p. m. Meanwhile, population dynamic study was conducted on two citrus plantations per four days for nine months (March to November 2011) {{in the first and}} third week of each month. The research result showed that B. dorsalis complex was more active during morning at 10. 00 to 12. 00 a. m. The peak abundance of fruit fly occurred at the end of June until beginning of July. The peak population coincided with the ripening period of fruits, low number of rainy (d) and rainfall (mm) in June and July periods. There was a significant correlation between number of rainy day and rainfall with fruit flies caught per month (R = 0. 79; Y = 289. 34 + 14. 23 X 1 - 15. 93 X 2; R 2 = 0. 62; P < 0. 05).

40|$|This Trilogy {{explains}} What is Horticulture?. Volume one of Horticulture: Plants for People and Places {{describes in}} considerable depth the science, management and technology which underpins the continuous production of fresh and processed horticultural produce. Firstly, {{there is a}} consideration of technological innovation derived from basic scientific discoveries which {{has given rise to}} entirely new industries, markets, novel crops and changed social habits. Then follows accounts of the modern production of: Field Vegetables, Temperate Fruit, Tropical Fruit, <b>Citrus,</b> <b>Plantation</b> Crops, Berry Crops, Viticulture, Protected Crops, Flower Crops, New Crops, Post-harvest Handling, Supply Chain Management and the Environmental Impact of Production. Each chapter is written by acknowledged world experts. Never before has such an array of plentiful, high quality fresh fruit, vegetables and ornamentals been available year-round in the World s retail markets. Horticulture gives consumers this gift of nutritious, high quality, safe and diverse fresh foods. This is achieved by manipulating plant growth, reproduction and postharvest husbandry. The multi-billion dollar international industry achieving this is Production Horticulture the subject of this informative book...|$|E
5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in <b>citrus</b> <b>plantations</b> to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in <b>citrus</b> <b>plantations</b> in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|R
