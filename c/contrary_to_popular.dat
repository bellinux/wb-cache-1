5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, some Mycenaean {{representative}} buildings already featured roofs made of fired tiles, as in Gla and Midea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, pencil {{leads in}} wooden pencils {{have never been}} made from lead. When the pencil {{originated}} as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago (literally, act for lead or lead mockup).|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, it is {{not only}} males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> {{belief of}} many, a true Tequila {{does not contain}} a worm. It is only in Tequila's brother Mezcal.|$|R
25|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> myth perpetuated by the James Bond film Goldfinger, {{a person}} is not asphyxiated if their whole body is painted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> belief, NorduGrid {{members are}} not {{required}} to provide computing or storage resources; neither offering such resources grants an automatic membership.|$|R
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, {{only a few}} {{sharks are}} {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Seringapatam, the Christian captives {{were made to}} forcibly embrace Islam, were tortured, or sentenced to death.. The young men who refused to embrace Islam were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears. They were seated on asses, paraded through the city, and thrown into the dungeons of Seringapatam. Historian Praxy Fernandes, author of Storm over Seringapatam: The Incredible Story of Hyder Ali & Tippu Sultan, states that <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, 40,000 Christians were not kept manacled in the dungeons of Seringapatam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> {{belief that}} the lines and figures can only be seen from an aircraft, they are also visible from the {{surrounding}} foothills and other high places.|$|R
50|$|This album also {{includes}} the controversial track, City Bird, which, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> belief of many, is not, in fact, written by the band's front man, Kevin Barnes.|$|R
50|$|From McKinney to Coppell, State Highway 121 {{acts as a}} {{frontage}} road to Sam Rayburn Tollway, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> misconception that the Sam Rayburn Tollway was the new SH 121.|$|R
5|$|Considered {{by many to}} be {{the most}} {{important}} Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, Ima did {{not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, {{great white}} sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> a <b>popular</b> myth, D.C. {{building}} height {{laws have}} never {{referred to the}} height of the Capitol building, which rises to [...] Indeed, the Capitol is only the fifth-tallest structure in Washington.|$|R
25|$|A 2001 {{advertising}} campaign for Kit Kat chocolates showed celebrities doing things which were <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> their <b>popular</b> images (for example, football player Roy Keane doing needlepoint, and Motörhead lead singer Lemmy playing the violin).|$|R
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> a <b>popular</b> misconception, the kernel is not {{derived from}} Linux {{or any of}} the various BSDs. It was written entirely by Szeleney {{over the course of several}} years, and uses no outside code.|$|R
5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, {{fish are}} also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor {{part of the}} sea otter's diet. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.|$|E
5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} out somewhere in the shade. In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> some <b>popular</b> {{beliefs about}} [...] "man-hating butch dykes", lesbian feminist theory {{does not support}} the concept of female masculinity. Proponents like Sheila Jeffreys (2003:13) have argued that [...] "all forms of masculinity are problematic." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> a <b>popular</b> urban legend {{circulated}} by email, the Mustang Ranch {{was never}} {{operated by the}} US government. It was operated by the Bankruptcy Trustee appointed by the United States Bankruptcy Court {{on behalf of the}} United States Government.|$|R
2500|$|The {{different}} {{positions of the}} typical five person bass line each require different skills, though not necessarily different levels of skills. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> belief that [...] "higher is better," [...] each drum has its own critical role to play.|$|R
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> imagery, the {{asteroid}} belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume {{that it would be}} improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid}} belt has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 2013, TROS {{announced}} that they would publish {{the name of the}} Dutch entrant on 25 November. On the same day, various news media reported that DeLange, well known in the Netherlands for several pop and country hits and as a juror on The Voice of Holland, had been selected by the broadcaster. Also reported was that Waylon, runner-up in the first series of Holland's Got Talent in 2008, would represent the Netherlands with a song written by DeLange. Waylon had previously competed in the Dutch selection for Eurovision 2005, but had failed to qualify for the final. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> speculation, Van Buuren announced on 13 November {{that he would not be}} the Dutch entrant.|$|E

Kryachkov himself, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> opinion, {{never lived in}} the building.|$|R
5000|$|The {{different}} {{positions of the}} typical five person bass line each require different skills, though not necessarily different levels of skills. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> belief that [...] "higher is better," [...] each drum has its own critical role to play.|$|R
5|$|The Buckeye {{was first}} bred and {{developed}} in 1896, by a Warren, Ohio resident named Nettie Metcalf. They {{are the only}} American breed of chicken {{known to have been}} developed by a woman, despite the fact that women were customarily given charge of the household poultry flock throughout much of U.S. history. Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks, Buff Cochins, and some black breasted red games to produce the Buckeye. Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed and Metcalf actually sent birds to the RIR breeders for them to improve their breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{bobsleigh}} {{track was}} built for the 1952 Winter Olympics, where it hosted two bobsleigh events. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, this was not built at Korketrekkeren but as a separate run nearby also starting at Frognerseteren. It was built as a temporary, artificial track with the curves being constructed in snow and then frozen hard to ice. Trial runs were undertaken in 1951 and the bobsleigh course was not used after 1952. Both Olympic events were won by Germany, with Andreas Ostler and Lorenz Nieberl participating in both winning teams. The tobogganing hill hosted the inaugural FIL World Luge Championships 1955, with Norway's Anton Salvesen winning the men's single—the only time in history Norway has won a World Luge Championships medal.|$|E
5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled from young {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core tethering gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM image has since leaked on the Internet and can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> mis-conception that `it was Jaikishan {{who used}} to handle the public {{relations}} and business/financial aspects of the duo's career', {{the fact is that}} it was Shankar who had the final say on all financial/business aspects of the SJ-team.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{factor is}} the likely increased prevalence of chronic pain in people with autism, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> belief that autistic people are insensitive to pain. Autism {{has been found to}} be closely related to fibromyalgia, a common chronic pain disorder.|$|R
2500|$|Peter Forrest has {{a tattoo}} of his mother's name, Vanda, {{on his right}} arm, in memory of her, after she died of cancer when he was 18 years old. [...] <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> recent <b>popular</b> belief, {{he has never been}} a Bondi lifesaver.|$|R
