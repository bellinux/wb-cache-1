Maria had grown from a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> woman {{during the years of}} captivity, according to the Baroness Sophie Buxhoevden, a lady in waiting, and the Tsarina felt she could depend upon her third daughter to help her as she could not rely upon the deeply depressed Olga or Anastasia, who was still a child. Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother. They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later.|$|E

If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|E

25|$|Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR): The {{suckling}} of {{milk from}} a female's breast {{on a regular}} basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership. The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the queen}} consort {{had begun to}} {{secretly}} form a powerful faction against the Heungseon Daewongun once she reached adulthood; now, {{with the backing of}} high officials, scholars, and members of her clan, she sought to remove the Heungseon Daewongun from power. Min Seung-ho, one of the queen consort's relatives, along with court scholar Choe Ik-hyeon, devised a formal impeachment of the Heungseon Daewongun to be presented to the Royal Council of Administration, arguing that Gojong, now 22, should rule in his own right. In 1872, with the approval of Gojong and the Royal Council, the Heungseon Daewongun was forced to retire to Unhyeongung, his estate at Yangju. The queen consort then banished the royal concubine and her <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> village outside the capital, stripped of royal titles, and the child soon died afterwards.|$|E

Thompson reported the atrocities by radio several times while at Sơn Mỹ. Although these reports reached Task Force Barker operational headquarters, nothing was done to stop the massacre.

Immediately following Thompson's report, Lieutenant Colonel Frank A. Barker ordered all ground units in Sơn Mỹ to cease search and destroy operations in the village.|$|E
500|$|One {{focus of}} {{attachment}} {{research has been}} the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern {{with the effects of}} child care was intense during the so-called [...] "day care wars" [...] of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care. As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.|$|E

Tony Chen from Anime News Network said that [...] "The way Clamp executes the development of Chi's character, growing her from what is basically the mental equivalent of a five-year-old <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much more intelligent and complex being, is not only clever but also very cute." [...] On the website Screen Junkies, Chi is ranked number 3 of 10 of a [...] "Top 10 anime girls" [...] pick and number 6 of 10 for best anime couples (Chi and Hideki). In his book The Anime Machine: A Media Theory of Animation, Thomas LaMarre describes Chi as [...] "lighter than air" [...] and a [...] "slight slender undefined" [...] body and with not much potential for physical movement.

500|$|After {{more than}} 15 years of off-and-on development, and {{approximately}} $6 million spent in 18 unused scripts {{from more than}} a dozen screenwriters, New Line finally produced a Freddy and Jason crossover for 2003. One of the biggest hurdles for the film was developing a story that managed to bring the two horror icons together. Potential stories varied widely, from Freddy having molested and drowned Jason as a <b>child,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cult of Freddy worshipers called the [...] "Fred Heads". In January 2007, Platinum Dunes producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller outlined their intended goal to bring a Friday the 13th reboot to life. New Line approached Fuller and Form to create a reboot, but because Paramount still owned certain copyrights to the first film, the reboot {{would not be able to}} use anything from the original. Paramount, who wanted to be included in the development of a reboot, approached the producers and gave them license to use anything from the original films, including the title. With Paramount on board, Fuller and Form decided they wanted to use pieces from the early films. Fuller said, [...] "I think there are moments we want to address, like how does the hockey mask happen." [...] Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were brought on to pen the script for the new film, with Marcus Nispel, director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake of 2003, hired in November 2007 to direct.|$|E
500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He just knew that she was it", said Romanek.|$|E
