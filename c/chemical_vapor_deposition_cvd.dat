5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD).</b> The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding {{a mixture of}} gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD)</b> at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus {{acts as a}} donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{methods used to}} produce {{synthetic}} diamond. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of 5GPa at 1500°C. The second method, using <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD),</b> creates a carbon plasma over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming detonation nanodiamonds) and sonication of graphite solutions.|$|E
40|$|Processing {{methods are}} {{described}} {{for the development}} of magnesium diboride wire using the <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CV</b> D) to produce long lengths of suitably doped starting boron fiber. It is found that titanium can be codeposited with the boron to make long lengths of doped fiber that contain both TiB and TiB 2. When this fiber is reacted in Mg vapor to transform boron into MgB 2, the resulting conductor has a superconducting critical current density of about 5 × 10 6 A/cm 2 at 5 K and self field. The critical current density at 25 K and 1 Tesla is 10, 000 A/cm 2. Using optical methods to define grain boundaries and energy dispersive X-rays to determine Ti and Mg concentration, these samples show a fine dispersion of Ti through out the grains and no conspicuous precipitation of TiB 2 on the MgB 2 grain boundaries. This is to be contrasted with the precipitation of TiB 2 on MgB 2 grain boundaries observed for samples prepared by solid state reaction of Ti, Mg, and B powders. Introducing Ti impurities into the B during the <b>CV</b> D <b>deposition</b> of the B gives a distribution of TiB 2 in the resulting MgB 2 different 1 from solid state reaction of powders...|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD).</b> William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD)</b> techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E

25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD).</b> In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. Electron-beam physical vapor deposition, however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E

25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD),</b> sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E

Diamonds are brought close to the Earth's surface through deep volcanic eruptions by magma, which cools into igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites. Diamonds can also be produced synthetically in a HPHT method which approximately simulates the conditions in the Earth's mantle. An alternative, and completely different growth technique is <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD).</b> Several non-diamond materials, which include cubic zirconia and silicon carbide and are often called diamond simulants, resemble diamond in appearance and many properties.

This process yields high-quality single crystals, mostly of 6H-SiC phase (because of high growth temperature). A modified Lely process involving induction heating in graphite crucibles yields even larger single crystals of 4inches (10cm) in diameter, having a section 81 times larger compared to the conventional Lely process. Cubic SiC is usually grown by the more expensive process of <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> (<b>CVD).</b> Homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial SiC layers can be grown employing both gas and liquid phase approaches. Pure silicon carbide can also be prepared by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(methylsilyne), under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures.

Using particulate catalysts, large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods; But achieving the repeatability becomes a major problem with CVD growth. The HiPCO process advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable. [...] In India, the company called [...] is producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes by NoPo HiPCO Process. It is also commercially available at lower cost. HiPCO process helps in producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes in higher quantity. NoPo HiPCO reactor operates at higher temperature ~1000°C under high pressure ~20-100 bar.
