40|$|AbstractOverexcitation of the {{photosynthetic}} apparatus {{is potentially}} dangerous {{because it can}} cause oxidative damage. Photoprotection realized via the feedback de-excitation in the pigment–protein light-harvesting complex LHCII, embedded in the chloroplast lipid environment, was studied with use of the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Illumination of LHCII results in the pronounced singlet excitation quenching, demonstrated by decreased quantum yield of the <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> and shortening of the fluorescence lifetimes. Analysis of the 77 K <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> emission spectra reveals that the light-driven excitation quenching in LHCII {{is associated with the}} intensity increase of the spectral band in the region of 700 nm, relative to the principal band at 680 nm. The average <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime at 700 nm changes drastically upon temperature decrease: from 1. 04 ns at 300 K to 3. 63 ns at 77 K.

Contributions of lutein-epoxide and violaxanthin cycles operating in parallel on the ΔpH-dependent (transthylakoid H + concentration gradient) thermal energy dissipation (qE) and slowly reversible ΔpHindependent fluorescence quenching (qI) were studied. A polar plot analysis of the lifetime data revealed three major <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime pools for photosystem II. The longest lifetime pool (centered at 2 ns) was observed when linear electron transport and the resulting ΔpH build-up were inhibited in leaves. The other two lifetime pools (1. 5 and 0. 5 ns) were observed during ΔpH build-up under illumination. Interconversion between these two lifetime pools {{took place during the}} slow part of the <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> transient.

A detailed analysis of <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> kinetics and gas exchange measurements in response to generation of action potentials in irritated D. muscipula traps {{was used to determine}} the ‘site effect’ of the electrical signal-induced inhibition of photosynthesis. Irritation of trigger hairs and subsequent generation of action potentials resulted in a decrease in the effective photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII) and the rate of net photosynthesis (AN). During the first seconds of irritation, increased excitation pressure in photosystem II (PSII) was the major contributor to the decreased ΦPSII. Within ∼ 1 [*]min, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) released the excitation pressure at PSII. Measurements of the fast <b>chlorophyll</b> a <b>fluorescence</b> transient (O-J-I-P) revealed a direct impact of action potentials on the charge separation–recombination reactions in PSII, although the effect seems to be small rather than substantial.
