40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>cosourcing</b> – or {{the provision of}} standardised services {{to a group of}} organisations – appears to be on the increase. Based upon economies of scale, and resource based and resource dependency theories this paper presents a decision making framework to help organisations understand why, and for what, <b>cosourcing</b> is appropriate. A case study of the Australian financial services industry was conducted to test that framework. The case study suggested that there are more potential benefits to <b>cosourcing</b> than first envisaged and that these will vary across organisations. Furthermore it was discovered that multiple forms, or flavours, of <b>cosourcing</b> have emerged for the same activity in the same industry influenced by, and accommodating, the differing contexts and capabilities of organisations. Finally the case study highlighted that while the existence of multiple <b>cosourcing</b> arrangements helps mediate dependency on suppliers, dependencies and tensions may develop between the organisations involved in <b>cosourcing</b> themselves – particularly if there is a divide in the roles played with, for example, some, and only some, serving as shareholders in the venture as well as customers of it. In conclusion it would appear {{that it is necessary to}} move beyond a focus on universal motivators and shapers of the <b>cosourcing</b> decision to consider in more detail the specifics of the organisations involved and the <b>cosourcing</b> arrangement planned. The range of benefits and variety of <b>cosourcing</b> arrangements available however also suggest that the potential for <b>cosourcing</b> may be greater than first thought if the tensions can be minimised...|$|E
40|$|In a {{variation}} on outsourcing, organisations are increasingly seeking opportunities where services can be provided jointly. This paper outlines an approach that combines resource based and resource dependency theories to assist in assessing and structuring such <b>cosourcing</b> initiatives. Based on {{a case study of}} credit unions in Australia, it is concluded that the approach may provide organisations with an improved understanding of the <b>cosourcing</b> decision. The case study also suggests {{that one of the most}} difficult requirements is to balance the differing needs of participants and reveals the complexity of an outsourcing milieu which is both layered and modular...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cosourcing</b> {{describes}} {{a situation where}} organisations seek to outsource services jointly. From a strategic perspective, this paper seeks to assist organisations by providing an approach that combines consideration of economies of scale with resource based and resource dependency theories to identify the motivators and shapers of the decision. Empirically tested with {{a case study in}} the financial services sector, the approach suggests that a broader set of influences is at work than first thought. Furthermore it is suggested that <b>cosourcing</b> is not a homogenous concept and that a variety of choices are available – with differences in scope and the depth of cooperation required...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of 56 Co emission from SN 1991 T {{has been previously}} reported at a level near the COMPTEL sensitivity threshold. The spectral analysis method, fitting the count spectrum to a background model plus a 56 Co emission template, is subject to possible systematic effects which had not been thoroughly studied at that time. To better evaluate {{the significance of that}} ∼ 3. 3 σ detection, the same method has been applied to a grid of points with 5 ° spacing, out to 35 ° from the pointing direction, in each of 103 observing periods from phases 1 through 3. A dozen instances were found with a 56 Co signal as significant as that for either of the two observations of SN 1991 T alone (∼ 2 σ). Nothing was found as significant as the combined observations of SN 1991 T. The strongest instrumental background artifact {{in the vicinity of the}} two principal 56 Co lines, attributed to 27 Mg, falls between the 56 Co lines. It fills in the valley between those lines, and so will obscure real 56 Co emission rather than producing false 56 <b>Cosources.</b> Fortunately, this artifact was weak up to the time of the reboost during phase 3. Thus, it is very unlikely that the reported emission from SN 1991 T was a statistical fluctuation or instrumental artifact. But, since the flux was so near the detection threshold, little can be said about the gamma-ray light curve of the supernova, the relative strengths of the 56 Co lines, or the line widths...|$|R

It indicates the differences between internal audit, outsourcing and <b>cosourcing</b> of this service {{as well as their}} advantages and disadvantages. Drawing from the research on internal audit outsourcing the recent market trends were identified as well as motivations for choosing different forms of internal auditing...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore the effectiveness of contract negotiations between buyers and suppliers in small government organizations, which collectively outsource their IS/IT activities to a single outsourcing vendor, usually referred to as ‘co-sourcing’. A major finding of this study was that organizations could have a successful co-sourcing arrangement by determining and putting into practice certain critical success factors. This research was the first study of government <b>cosourcing</b> arrangements in Australia that aimed to identify the success of a contract and the critical factors that affected it. In this regard, it can contribute to the existing body of knowledge in co-sourcing activities that have been growing rapidly in government departments {{as well as in the}} private sector...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{call center}} <b>cosourcing</b> problems, we {{consider}} a service network operated under an overflow mechanism. Calls are first routed to an in-house (or dedicated) service station {{that has a}} finite waiting room. If the waiting room is full, the call is overflowed to an outside provider (an overflow station) that might also be serving overflows from other stations. We establish approximations for overflow networks with many servers under a resource-pooling assumption that stipulates, in our context, that the fraction of overflowed calls is nonnegligible. Our two main results are (i) an approximation for the overflow processes via limit theorems and (ii) asymptotic independence between each of the in-house stations and the overflow station. In particular, we show that, as the system becomes large, the dependency between each in-house station and the overflow station becomes negligible. Independence between stations in overflow networks is assumed {{in the literature on}} call centers, and we provide a rigorous support for those useful heuristics. Subject classifications: overflow networks; cosourcing; heavy-traffic approximations; separation of time scales...|$|E
40|$|As the {{business}} environment become more uncertain and competitive, many organizations are seeking ways to gain economic efficiency and share {{in business and}} technology risk. Despite wide differences in the reference disciplines applied to outsourcing research, {{the vast majority of}} it assumes a one-to-one relationship between the client and the outsourcing vendor. This paper examines the economic, strategic, and organizational issues involved in IT outsourcing when more complex arrangements are considered — such as multi-vendor alliances, <b>cosourcing,</b> and complex multi-vendor, multi-client relationships. In this paper, we identify a taxonomy of four classes of outsourcing relationships (based on how many clients and vendors are involved in the outsourcing relationship), and illustrate each with recent business examples. Grounded in this taxonomy, we develop a theoretical framework that identifies both enabling and constraining forces that may influence client firms in choosing among the four types of outsourcing relationships. This paper provides insights regarding how the variations in the nature of these outsourcing relationships may shape the benefits and risks be achieved from outsourcing, as well as the ongoing complexity of managing outsourcing relationships. 1...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal agencies rely on a multisector workforce composed of federal employees and contractor personnel to perform services as they carry out their missions. Determining whether to obtain services through insourcing with current or new federal employees, outsourcing with private sector contractors, or <b>cosourcing</b> {{with a combination of}} the two is an important economic and strategic decision critical to the federal government's effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars. The executive branch has encouraged federal agencies since the mid- 1950 s to obtain commercially available services from the private sector when outsourcing is cost-effective. In the last 5 fiscal years, civilian agencies have on average annually obligated about $ 100 billion to obtain a range of services from contractors. However, in March 2009, the President issued a memorandum on government contracting that, among other matters, expressed concern about the federal workforce as to whether agencies have become overreliant on contractors and have appropriately outsourced services. In particular, the President noted that the line between inherently governmental functions [...] those that must be performed by federal employees [...] and commercial activities that may be contracted for has been blurred. In the memorandum, the President directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to lead a series of contracting-related efforts, including clarifying when outsourcing for services is and is not appropriate. Congress, also concerned with the federal workforce, in March 2009 enacted section 736 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, which requires federal agencies, with the exception of the Department of Defense (DOD), to devise and implement guidelines for insourcing new and contracted-out functions by mid-July 2009. The statute further requires that we report on the implementation of section 736. In response, we identified (1) the actions taken by OMB to assist affected agencies as they develop insourcing guidelines and (2) the status of selected civilian agencies' efforts to develop and implement insourcing guidelines. ...|$|E
