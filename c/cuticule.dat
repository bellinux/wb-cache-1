TiO 2 used in sunscreens are nanocomposites where TiO 2 has been coated with magnesium, silica or alumina, as well as amphiphilic organics like polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS), and these coatings are modified by ageing. We assessed the ccotoxicity and propensity for bioaccumulation of an aged TiO 2 nanocomposite used in sunscreen cosmetics, and its potential effect on the frequency of apoptosis in different earthworm tissues. The earthworm Lumbricus terrestris was exposed to the TiO 2 nanocomposite for 7 days in water or 2 - 8 weeks in soil with the nanocomposite mixed either into food or soil at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mg kg(- 1). Apoptosis was then measured by immunohistochemistry and Ti localized by XRF microscopy. Results showed no mortality, but an enhanced apoptotic frequency which was higher in the <b>cuticule,</b> intestinal epithelium and chloragogenous tissue than in the longitudinal and circular musculature. TiO 2 nanoparticles did not seem to cross the intestinal cpithelium/chloragogenous matrix barrier to enter the coclomic liquid, or the <b>cuticule</b> barrier to reach the muscular layers.

Myrmica LATREILLE, 1804 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) species are reported to be the usual hosts of R. wasmannii (HERRAIZ & ESPADALER 2007). To the best of our knowledge, this fungus has not been reported previously from the Carpa-thian Basin. The occurrence of R. wasmannii was checked on 5788 Myrmica specimens from 580 colonies collected between 2001 and 2006 at 26 sites in Hungary and three sites in Transylvania, Romania (Fig. 1), and the density of the fungus on the different parts of the body of infected Myrmica specimens was estimated.

Then the head is cut free and placed into a dye-loaded and cooled ringer solution in a staining chamber for 1 h. Subsequently, the head is fixed in a recording chamber, covered with a cover-slip, and imaged under the microscope with a cooled CCD camera. The whole preparation leaves the antennae dry, free to move, and functional throughout the experiment, allowing for natural odour stimulation of the olfactory system.

30|$|There are {{two main}} {{features}} of C. elegans which basically influence the procedure of sample preparation for TEM. One {{of them is the}} rather small size of the body (the diameter and length values are 12 – 15 and 220 – 250  µm for freshly hatched larvae and 60 – 65 and 1000 – 1300  µm for adults on average, respectively). The other feature is that their <b>cuticule,</b> which covers the whole body, is practically impenetrable to the fixative, which has to diffuse into the cells to carry out its function of properly preserving intracellular structures. The easiest way to overcome the problem of penetration is to cut the worm into pieces in a drop of fixative under a dissection microscope. This action requires higher than average manual skills and makes it necessary, {{and at the same time}} possible, to treat the worms individually. Although cumbersome, the need for individual treatment during cutting offers the advantage of allowing observations in single worms which, thereby, can serve as the natural units for both qualitative and quantitative results, and makes it possible to reveal variations among the individuals as well as to carry out proper statistics for morphometry.|$|E
40|$|The winter {{depression}} of photosynthesis in leaves of Cryptomeria japonica was studied {{in relation to}} the diffusive resistance to CO_ 2 transfer, and the influence of soil temperature on the depression was examined. (1) The light intensity curves suggest the interference with both the photochemical process and the biochemical process of photosynthesis in winter. (2) The {{winter depression}} of photosynthesis is mainly due to the inhibition of stomatal openings and the low permeability of leaf <b>cuticule</b> to CO_ 2 (an increase of leaf resistance) as well as the depression of CO_ 2 transport in mesophyll (an increase of mesophyll resistance). (3) The low soil temperature in winter is fairly concerned with the increases of leaf resistance and mesophyll resistance and the changes in water relation of leaves. The winter depression of photosynthesis seems to have close contacts with the low soil temperature through its effect on some physiological processes such as water balance and translocation in trees. 冬季におけるスギ葉の光合成低下をGAASTRAやMILTHORPEの理論にしたがって, 葉の外囲からクロロプラストまでのCO_ 2 輸送過程に働くCO_ 2 拡散抵抗の面でしらべた。また, 冬季の光合成低下と生育地温とのかかわりあいについてしらべた。(1) 光合成-光強度曲線より, 冬季では, 光合成の生化学的過程と同時に光化学的過程の著しい阻害が推定される。(2) 冬季では, 気孔開度の減少や表皮細胞の解剖学的性質の変化(気孔抵抗, 表皮抵抗の増大) により, CO_ 2 が葉の外囲から葉内にはいりにくくなっていることが, 葉肉細胞におけるCO_ 2 輸送の低下(葉肉抵抗の増大) とならんで, 葉の光合成低下に大きく関与している。(3) 生育地温は, 気孔抵抗と葉肉抵抗の両方に影響し, 葉の光合成と深くかかわる。また, 葉の水分特性にも影響を与える。生育地温は, 樹体内水収支や葉からの転流などの樹木生理への影響を通して, 冬季の光合成低下に密接に関係すると考えた...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the growth-temperature relationship in plants using a quantitative {{perspective of a}} recently derived growth functional. We showed that auxin-induced growth is achieved by the diffusion rate, which is almost constant or slowly ascending in temperature while the diffusion rate of fusicoccin-induced growth increases monotonically with temperature for the entire temperature range, though for some concentrations of IAA "super-diffusion" takes place for unperturbed growth. Furthermore, three kind of experiments were compared: for abraded coleoptiles, coleoptile segments and intact growing seedlings. From cross-correlation analysis {{it was found that}} the timing of IAA and FC-induced proton secretion and growth matches well. Unambiguous results, concerning fundamental conditions of the acid growth hypothesis, were obtained by cross- and auto-correlation analysis: (1) For abraded coleoptiles, because of the lowering of the <b>cuticule</b> potential barrier, auxin-induced cell wall pH decreases simultaneously with the change in growth rate; no advancement or retardation of pH (proton efflux rate) or growth rate takes place (2) Exogenous protons are able to substitute for auxin causing wall loosening and growth (3) Although the underlying molecular mechanisms vastly differ, a potent stimulator of proton secretion, the fungal toxin FC, promotes growth similar to auxin, however of much elevated intensity; as for auxin - no advancement or retardation takes place.

These trichomes are very abundant, and the secretion material is released by <b>cuticule</b> rupture {{on the top of the}} head cells. Also noteworthy is the presence of peltate trichomes on the upper surface of the ovary.

40|$|Quantitative plant {{resistance}} {{is supposed to}} be more durable than qualitative resistance for the control of plant diseases. However, it has been experimentally shown that erosion of quantitative resistance can occur. Cumulation of quantitative resistance loci (QRLs) in the same cultivar is considered to improve the efficiency and durability of quantitative resistance, but the choice of QRLs to be combined is of crucial importance. This study investigated whether the combination of QRLs acting on different stages of pathogen development could improve the efficiency of resistance in the apple scab pathosystem. The efficiencies of three QRLs were evaluated against 10 isolates of Venturia inaequalis and the stages of pathogen development that were affected by the QRLs were defined microscopically. A gain in the efficiency of resistance was observed when QRLs were pyramided compared to when they acted alone. Thanks to the combined effects of the individual QRLs, the pyramiding of the three QRLs hindered fungal development at different stages: before the penetration of the plant <b>cuticule,</b> after the penetration with hypersensitivity reaction, and during the colonization and asexual reproduction. These effects were dependent on the V. inaequalis isolates. These results suggest that the gain in efficiency of resistance by pyramiding may derive from the combination of different and complementary molecular mechanisms underlying QRLs. Thus, the resistance achieved from pyramiding such a combination of QRLs should be durable...|$|E

We measured specific leaf area, <b>cuticule</b> thickness and density and length of leaf stomata and trichomes. We determined pigments and UV-absorbing compounds and measured leaf reflectance {{within the range of}} 280 to 890 nm. We aimed to find out how anatomical, morphological and biochemical parameters affected reflectivity and which parameter exerted greater impact. We also determined which of the studied species differed among the species. The results have shown that reflectivity affected both biochemical and anatomical and morphological parameters. The biochemical parameters had a greater impact on the reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum, while morphological and anatomical parameters have a greater impact on UV- and IR- part of the spectrum. Pattern of reflectance spectra is the same in all species as a result of similar morphology, anatomy and biochemistry of leaves. The most different spectral properties were found when comparing Carex elata, which had a high reflectivity, and Phalaris arundinacea, which had low reflectivity and high absorption.

40|$|The {{life span}} of non-renewing organisms is {{determined}} by the potential of their individual cells to maintain their functions while aging. Nematodes, like Caenorhabditis elegans with their 20 days of adult life, have proven to be excellent model systems to study organismal lifespan, its variability, and its regulation [1 – 3]. Early on, the life span could be linked to environmental conditions, like growth temperature and food intake [1, 4]. In general, in these experiments, organisms develop and age slower and live longer at lower growth temperatures. This is evident from a clear relation-ship between temperature and life span ranging from 35 days to 9 days upon temperature changes from 10 to 25. 5 degrees [1]. On the higher end of this temperature range, C. elegans can enter the dauer state, which is also found in response to starvation or the presence of dauer pheromone [5 – 7]. The formation of this stress-resistant state, which enables survival of the organism for longer than 3 months, requires morphological changes to the <b>cuticule</b> and inhibition of further develop-ment. Interestingly, it is entirely reversible without effects on the later adult life span [8]. This deci-sion has been analyzed genetically in detail, identifying genes that promote dauer entry (DAF-c) and those that prevent dauer entry (DAF-d). These studies unravel the pathways, which cooperate in the decision whether to enter the path to the dauer state instead of normal development. Th...|$|E

While the molting is the most crucial stage in their life cycle, it remains poorly investigated in term of pollutant biodistribution within the organisms. In this paper, we used optical, electronic, and X ray-based microscopies to study the uptake and release of CeO 2 nanoparticles by/from Daphnia pulex over a molting stage. We measured that D. pulex molts every 59 +/- 21 h (confidence interval) with growth rates about 1. 1 or 1. 8 gm per stage {{as a function of}} the pieces measured. Ingestion via food chain was the main route of CeO 2 nanoparticles uptake by D. pulex. The presence of algae during the exposure to nanoparticles (sub-lethal doses) enhanced by a factor of 3 the dry weight concentration of Ce on the whole D. pulex. Nanoparticles were localized in the gut content, in direct contact with the peritrophic membrane, and on the cuticle. Interestingly, the depuration (24 h with Chlorella pseudomonas) was not efficient to remove the nanoparticles from the organisms. From 40 % to 100 % (depending on the feeding regime during exposure) of the CeO 2 taken up by D. pulex is not release after the depuration process. However, we demonstrated for the first time that the shedding of the chitinous exoskeleton was the crucial mechanism governing the released of CeO 2 nanoparticles regardless of the feeding regime during exposure.

Each herbicidal solution (with and without vegetable oil) was exposed to simulated light at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 and 240 MAS (min after spray), for 30 min. The performance of sethoxydim {{in the presence of}} turnip, olive, soybean, corn, sunflower, canola, sesame, castor and cotton seed oils, compared to non-vegetable oil solution, increased up to 4. 02 -, 3. 44 -, 3. 22 -, 3. 08 -, 2. 86 -, 2. 09 -, 1. 96 -, 1. 77 - and 1. 25 - fold.

The effect of vegetable oils on the resistance to photodecomposition of sethoxydim was significant different at less than 60 MAS, while no significant differences were noted among vegetable oils when light treatment occurred at 120 and 240 MAS. Data from the light treatments have confirmed that when vegetable oils were added to sethoxydim, light adverse effect was lower, which is presumably due to disturbance of the <b>cuticule</b> and the rapid absorption of sethoxydim by wild oat leaves.

Sonication of spores for 5 - 30 mn disrupted the sporangial Wall and significantly increased the rate at which spores attached to nematodes. Spores attached equally well to living and dead nematodes. Some spores attached to nematodes after either spores or nematodes were heated at 100 ” for 30 mn, but spores heated at 100 ’ for 15, 30 or 60 mn attached in significantly fewer numbers than unheated spores. Spores also adheredto free living and parasitic second-stage juveniles but not to males and females, suggesting that recognition sites for spore adhesion were altered during moulting. The sites of spore adhesion were randomly distributed {{on the surface of the}} cuticle. Preliminary studies failed to implicate lectins in the adhesion process because a range of sugars, lectins and other compounds did not affect attachment. Sialic acid reduced the number of spores attached to nematodes in two experiments but other evidence suggested it was unlikely to be involved in the mechanism of attachment. Observation at high resolution under the TEM of sections cut through the spore on the surface of the cuticle showed that the glycocalyx broke down and the parasporal fibres from the lower half of the spore became inserted and entwined within the epicuticle.

In some cases, the virus is transmitted from plant to plant simply attached to the <b>cuticule</b> of the mouthparts or the forget. For other, circulative virus transmission based on virion internalization through the aphid gut followed by transfer to salivary glands and finally to next plant during aphid feeding is required. In both situations, presence of receptor components through the digestive tract of the aphids is needed for virus binding and further transmission to next plants even if not localized at the same place. In order to investigate the specific binding of virus on particular aphid receptors, two aphid-virus models were selected to be tested using several lectins showing differential sugar binding specificities. Virus transmission efficacy assays with Myzus persicae and potato virus but also Acyrthosiphon pisum and pea enation mosaic virus were performed using a range of lectins to assess the potential competition of lectins and virus. Some interesting lectins were found to reduce the virus transmission with a 2 fold factor showing potential use of lectin in virus spread control.

Currently, most studies {{are focused on}} plant defense responses to a single attack or infection {{and knowledge of the}} effects of multiple stresses is scarce. Plants defenses are constitutive or inducible. Constitutive defenses are composed of physical barriers such as trichomes or <b>cuticule</b> and of toxic secondary metabolites, such as the glucosinolates (GS). Inducible defenses are triggered specifically after infection or feeding to induce an efficient response. In response to single attacks in Arabidopsis thaliana, jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways are triggered after necrotroph and herbivorous challenge whereas the salicylic acid (SA) pathway is triggered after biotroph invasion. To create a flexible defense response, notably in case of combined stresses, these different pathways can have a synergistic or an antagonistic effect on each other, a phenomenon named crosstalk. Moreover, plants are known to emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) into the atmosphere for their own protection against herbivores by attracting parasitoids. The aim of my thesis was to characterize plant defense responses under multiple stresses. I performed whole-genome analyses of Brassica nigra plants challenged by Pieris brassicae egg extract, the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), Brevicoryne brassicae aphids or ozone followed by P. brassicae larval feeding. Surprisingly, results indicated that the primary stress has a weak effect on transcriptional responses to a secondary stress. In addition, expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of GS and BVOCs were not affected by any treatment. In the second part, I focused on the effects of P. brassicae egg application or Xcc infection on performance of the specialist P. brassicae and the generalist Spodoptera littoralis. Strikingly, insects performed differently depending on the stress applied, the site of feeding and their feeding specialization. Moreover, GS, SA and JA were induced specifically at the site of herbivory or infection. Furthermore, we showed that a SA antagonistic effect on the JA pathway, and inversely, occurred depending of the pretreatment and the insect applied. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that B. nigra defense response is localized to the treatment area and can differ from adjacent tissue. Importantly, the response to combined stresses is highly specific to the history of attacks...|$|E
40|$|Tesis Doctoral inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 20 - 04 - 2007 The dimorphic fungus Ustilago maydis is the causative {{agent of}} corn smut desease. The process of plant {{invasion}} involves regulated growth and highly organized morphological changes. Haploid cells (sporidia) of this fungus are unicellular, and grow saprophytically by budding. The pathogenic form, the filamentous dikaryon, is established after fusion of two sporidia {{that have to}} harbor different alleles of the a and b mating type loci of U. maydis. The a locus controls the cell fusion via a pheromone-receptor based system. Upon pheromone stimulation cells arrest budding growth and start the formation of conjugation tubes that are cell cycle arrested in the G 2 phase. These mating filaments are highly polaryzed structures that undergo directed tip growth towards the pheromone source, followed by cell fusion {{and the formation of}} dikaryotic hyphae. The subsequent steps in filament formation and pathogenic development are controlled by the multiallelic b-locus that encodes two distinct homeodomain transcription factors, bE and bW. A heterodimeric complex of the two proteins is formed when they are derived from different alleles. The dikaryon formed after the fusion of compatible sporidia is arrested in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. On the plant surface, filaments differentiate appressoria and penetrate the <b>cuticule.</b> Finally, spores are generated and dispersed by air. Spores will germinate and upon germination, meiosis takes place and pairs of compatible haploid cells are generated. In this work we have identified two new factors involved in pathogenic development. Pcl 7 is a cyclin of Cdk 5 implicated in morphogenesis during pathogenic development. Δpcl 7 cells have defects on polarization during the formation of the conjugative tube and the infective filament. Biz 1 (b-dependent zinc finger protein), is a transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role during the infection process. Δbiz 1 cells show a severe reduction in appressoria formation and plant penetration. In biz 1 mutants, when the hypha penetrates, its pathogenic development is arrested directly after plant penetration. pcl 7 is upregulated by the induction of the amating type locus and both biz 1 and pcl 7 are induced via the bmating type locus. High levels of biz 1 or pcl 7 expression induce highly polarized growth and a G 2 cell cycle arrest supporting roles in morphogenesis and cell cycle regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{modern society}} {{recently}} {{became aware of}} the need to reduce pollutant emission in the environment and to have a sustainable development i. e. which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The substitution of fossil origin molecules by molecules from vegetables (biodegradable and renewable) could help to solve this problem at least in part : this would also limit our energy and/or material dependence. The lubricants, currently used in automobile industry, are mainly obtained from oil and pollute soils and water. Also, their substitution by bio-lubricants seems of a particu- lar importance. Vegetable oils are the main products likely to find industrial applications as alternative to petroleum products. However, the physicochemical properties (oxida- tion, temperature stability) of these natural substances are not yet competitive compared to those of usual lubricants. Nevertheless the linseed oil, once modified, could present interesting technical properties associated to a biodegradable character. To produce the oil initially contained in the seed cells, the oil industry developed around various pretreatments (mechanic, thermic, enzymatic) aiming at enhancing oil extraction, and expression as a central operation. A solvent extraction is then applied on the produced presscake. The objective {{of this study is to}} propose a new process for efficient oil extraction. This process had to be deprived of organic solvent (ecological aspect) and excessive heat treatment in order to preserve the various components of seed (economic aspect). First, we studied the effect of the seed crushing on expression. An optimal crushing allows to recover 70 % of the initial oil, which is comparable to industrial yield obtai- ned after crushing, cooking and expression. The study of seed maturity on expression highlights the need to have mature and dry seeds. An enzymatic preprocessing allows to discover a technological bolt due to the presence of mucilage (polysaccharides mixture) in the <b>cuticule</b> of seed. In order to extract mucilage, we propose an original solution based on the application of high voltage electric discharges (HVED) in water. In the second time, we sought to understand the phenomena during the electric discharge and calculate the energy consumption. After modeling of damped oscillations, recorded once the electric arc is created, we calculated the useful energy for the creation of the shock waves : the totality of the energy contained in the condenser is released during the discharge. It’s noticebale that only 25 % of this energy are used to generate shock waves. This treatment was then applied to the presscake produced after optimal crushing and expression. The mixture of presscake powder and water is treated by HVED then the resulting suspension is submitted to centrifugation to produce an emulsion as well as a solid residue. We then studied the effect of the pulse repetition frequency on the suspension and the produced emulsion physicochemical properties and on the composi- tion of the final products. The oil extraction kinetics and dry matter kinetics could be established and models are proposed. This process of extraction was finally optimized using an experimental design. Two successive treatments are thus applied by adjusting pH, temperature and mass of water. The total sum of applied impulses for the two treatments remaining constant and equal to 280. The oil extraction is favoured when the suspension is concentrated and the pH close to the average isoelectric pH of proteins of flax. Residues rich in oil (20 % of initial oil) and low in oil (2 % of initial oil) can be produced by adjusting the conditions of treatment. In conclusion, our study allowed us to propose a process with the following stages : crushing, expression, crushing, two treatments per electric discharge followed by centri- fugation. We propose two processes according to the results obtained with a forthcoming study concerning the separation of the produced emulsions. ...|$|E
40|$|De 1947 à 1976, {{plusieurs}} dizaines de tonnes de mercure d'origine industrielle ont été déversées dans les eaux de la rivière Saguenay et une grande partie de ce métal toxique se retrouve aujourd'hui dans les sédiments du Fjord. Les sédiments de surface (0 - 2 cm) de 17 stations réparties sur tout le bassin intérieur du fjord ont été prélevés et analysés pour le mercure total. De plus, environ 150 crevettes (Pandalus borealis) ont été capturées à Sainte-Rose-du-Nord pour fins d'analyse du mercure et pour une expérience de bioaccumulation à partir d'une diète contaminée. L'analyse des données disponibles pour les sédiments de surface {{montre que}} les teneurs moyennes (0, 93 ± 0, 11 µg. g- 1 poids sec) en mercure n'ont pas varié de façon significative au cours des dix dernières années dans la région de Sainte-Rose-du-Nord, située dans la moitié amont du bassin intérieur. Les concentrations de mercure dans le muscle comestible des crevettes varient de 0, 13 à 0, 58 µg. g- 1 (poids humide) selon la taille avec une valeur moyenne de 0, 36 ± 0, 11 µg. g- 1. On trouve une concentration moyenne de 0, 26 ± 0, 09 µg. g- 1 dans le céphalothorax et la <b>cuticule.</b> Un accroissement rapide et important du mercure dans, l'appareil digestif a été observé chez tes crevettes adultes soumises à une diète de chair de moules préalablement contaminée (6, 0 ± 1, 0 µg. g- 1). Un taux de bioaccumulation de 0, 09 µg. g- 1 par jour dans le muscle comestible a été estimé pour les 14 premiers jours de diète contaminée. From 1947 to 1976, many tons of industrial mercury were tipped into the Saguenay River {{and a large}} amount of this toxic heavy metal is now in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord. Surface sediments (0 - 2 cm) were collected at seventeen stations along the inner basin of the Saguenay Fjord and analysed for total mercury content. About 150 shrimps (Pandalus borealis) fished in the Sainte-Rose-du-Nord area were also used for mercury analyses and the determination of mercury uptake rate from contaminated food. The mercury concentrations in surface sediments ranged from 0. 18 to 0. 20 µg. g- 1 (dry weight) with a mean value of 0. 63 µg. g- 1. This mean level is about one order of magnitude higher than the background level found in deep sediments. The examination of available data for surface sediments in the Sainte-Rose-du-Nord vicinity, located {{in the first half of}} the inner basin, shows the "steady state" of the mercury contamination over the last 10 years. Indeed, the mercury concentrations observed in surface sediments ranged from 0. 75 to 1. 20 µg. g- 1, with a mean value of 0. 93 µg. g- 1 since 1976. The steady state of mercury contamination can be explained by two hypothesis : (1) an unexpected highly active bioturbation mechanism contributes to the mercury remobilisation from lower sediment layers (10 - 20 cm) and its vertical transportation up to the surface, or (2) the anthropogenic upstream discharge of mercury was not really stopped in 1976 and one or many unidentified sources are still active along the Saguenay River. The mercury concentrations in the edible part of shrimps (fished in November 1985) ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 58 µg. g-l (wet weight) with an average value of 0. 36 ± 0. 11 µg. g- 1. A positive and significative linear relationship (r = 0. 786) is observed between the Hg concentration in the edible part and the total wet weight of the shrimp. The mean Hg in the edible part found in 1985 is not significantly different from the mean value reported in 1932. The mean concentration found in the cephalothorax and the cuticle (taken together) of shrimps was 0. 26 ± 0. 09 µg. g- 1. In order to estimate the mercury uptake rate by shrimps from contaminated food, a number of adult shrimps were fed with pre-contaminated mussel tissues (0. 6 ± 1. 0 µg. g- 1) for three weeks. A high and rapid increase of mercury concentration was observed in the digestive organs after only 24 hours. The uptake rate in the edible part was estimated at 0. 09 µg. g- 1 per day during the first fourteen days of the bioassay. These findings clearly indicate the fragility of the balance between the biota and the physical environment and how fast major changes can occur when the level of contamination of the diet is modified...|$|E
40|$|Earthworms are organisms of key {{importance}} worldwide. As ecosystem engineers, {{they constitute}} {{one of the}} main structuring agents of most soil ecosystems. Previous studies have concluded that earthworms appear to be among the most radiosensitive component of the soil fauna, and decreases in populations have been observed following accidents. Radiosensitivity varies with the developmental stage, with immatures being more radiosensitive than adults. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms of radiation impact on earthworms. At the ultrastructural scale and as organisms living in close contact with soil, earthworms developed efficient immune and apoptotic systems. This mainly caspase- and mitochondria-dependent system controls and regulates cell proliferation and elimination of damaged cells. Since apoptosis is known to be a central mechanism in the biological response to irradiation, better understanding of this cell process after radiation exposure is of first interest. The aim of this work is to shed a new light on potential impacts of low total doses of ionizing gamma radiations on the apoptotic activity in earthworms and on their physiological capacity to withstand a certain level of irradiation. The study design was based on irradiation of the earthworm species Eisenia fetida during 7 days at 0, 0. 14 and 10 mGy. h- 1, this level of exposure being known to reduce the cocoon hatchability, and at 10 °C and 20 °C to investigate any impact of temperature. Three different apoptosis methods (TUNEL, Apostain and caspase 3 staining) were tested on five different tissues: <b>cuticule,</b> circular and longitudinal musculatures, intestinal epithelium and chloragogenous matrix. Our results confirmed the applicability of apoptosis as a useful and reliable biomarker for radiation impacts on earthworms. The three different staining methods gave comparable results although some statistically significant differences seem to indicate that caspase 3 labeling could have a better detection limit. Three major results were obtained: 1) within a given tissue, an exposure to 10 mGy. h- 1 of external γ-radiation always led to an increase of the number of apoptotic cells comparing to the controls; 2) in all groups, the intestinal epithelium and chloragogenous matrix showed a higher level of apoptosis (up to six times higher) compared to the other tissue types; and 3) the temperature (10 °C and 20 °C) had probably low or no effects on the apoptotic signal. The result tends to show that, after only 7 days of exposure at a dose-rate known to reduce the cocoon hatchability (albeit at longer times and higher total doses), ionizing radiations trigger an apoptotic response in tissues constituting the major part of the animal body. This means that the biomarker may be a useful early indicator of potential negative effects, given that the dose rates are known to result in negative impacts at the organism level. In addition, such a level of programmed cell death in the intestinal and chloragog cells may have heavy consequences for the earthworms. The intestinal epithelium plays a central role in the absorption of nutrients, while the chloragogenous tissue, covering the external pared of the intestine, is a crucial organ in the ionic balance and the immune system. Potential damages or over-stimulation of the apoptosis after irradiation might dramatically affect crucial physiological processes controlled by these structures. Moreover, their localization at the interface between interior and exterior medium may explain their high reactivity comparing to the other tissues. In spite of comparable results between the three tested methods, differences are notable. Thus, a lower apoptotic activity was revealed by caspase 3 labeling, for almost all treatments, with only high levels being seen in the longitudinal musculature at 10 °C and 10 mGy. h- 1. In addition, the caspase 3 labeling method was the only one that showed a statistically significant increase at only 0. 14 mGy. h- 1. The more sensitive detection limit could reflect the relatively low level of background apoptosis in controls compared to the other treatments. Hence a combination of at least carpase 3 labelling and TUNEL or Apostain would be recommended for studies on this mechanism in earthworms. This study constitutes one of the very first report and description of the apoptotic process in earthworms and, after antibody labeling, represents a pioneer work in showing the conservation of caspase 3 proteins in earthworms. This latest result is of high interest considering the central role of caspase 3 in the control of the apoptotic cascade in particular as a molecule regulated by mitochondria through the release of cytochrome c. In addition, the results obtained in this work could be relevant in our understanding of potential links between apoptosis and radiosensitivity. M-RA...|$|E
