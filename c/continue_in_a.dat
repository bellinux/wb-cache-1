5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Patton's final {{assignment}} was {{to command the}} Fifteenth United States Army, based in Bad Nauheim. The Fifteenth Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff tasked to compile {{a history of the}} war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest in the duty. He began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun, as well as Stockholm, where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided he would leave his post at the Fifteenth Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for Christmas leave. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stateside post or retire.|$|E

Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won the battle {{for control of the}} Teamsters. In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, {{in the wake of the}} scandal.|$|E

25|$|Excavation at Delphi, {{which was}} a post-Mycenaean {{settlement}} of the late 9thcentury, has uncovered artifacts increasing steadily in volume beginning with {{the last quarter of}} the 8th centuryBC.

Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.|$|E

The transition of riding {{in a straight line}} to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first.|$|E

In the event, the Tories enjoyed the largest share of votes and seats, but came 20 seats short of a majority. On 11 May 2010, Gordon Brown tendered his resignation as prime minister to the Queen, and recommended that David Cameron should be invited to form the next government. Cameron duly did so, forming a government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and making their leader Nick Clegg deputy prime minister.|$|E

500|$|Pressure {{perturbations}} around thunderstorms are noteworthy. With buoyancy rapid {{within the}} lower and mid-levels of a mature thunderstorm, updraft and downdraft create distinct mesocenters of pressure. As thunderstorms organized in squall lines, {{the northern end}} of the squall line is commonly referred to as the cyclonic end, with the southern side rotating anticyclonically (in Northern hemisphere). Because of the coriolis force, the northern end may evolve further, creating a [...] "comma shaped" [...] wake low, or may <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> squall-like pattern. The updraft ahead of the line create a mesolow too while the downdraft just behind the line will produce a mesohigh.|$|E

The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division had continued the attack southwards, to pin down German forces and on 14 June, supported by its entire divisional artillery and the Royal Air Force, the division attacked with two brigades towards la Senaudière, la Belle Epine, Lingèvres and Verrières. If the attack succeeded, it would be exploited to capture Hottot-les-Bagues. A reconnaissance-in-force was conducted the evening before and the panzergrenadiers of the Panzer-Lehr Division, inflicted many casualties; German casualties are unknown, although one tank was destroyed.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Whitney was {{guaranteed}} {{to appear in}} seven of the first 13 episodes, and contracted for four days work on each. However, she was used for nine additional days, leading D'Agosta to suggest to Roddenberry that if guest stars instead played the similar role but with different characters then they [...] "would cost less and hold as much value". He added that they should instead look to using Whitney on a free-lance basis instead of under permanent contract. By September 8, 1966, Whitney's agent had been informed that her contract had been terminated, which was around a week prior to the shoot of her final episode, [...] "The Conscience of the King". Roddenberry told Whitney that he didn't want to lose Rand as he wanted her relationship with Kirk to <b>continue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> memo to Gene Coon on October 27, 1966, Roddenberry suggested bringing Whitney back as Rand, albeit with a different hairstyle {{similar to the way}} she wore it in Police Story as this [...] "made her look much younger and softer", but she was never invited back to the series.|$|E
