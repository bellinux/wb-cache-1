50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed <b>channel</b> <b>rail,</b> feed link, both feed slides and the feed tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|E
40|$|Washing {{and then}} drying of laundry are {{required}} in normal human life. The most laundry drying racks {{in the market}} nowadays are fitted with very good features, such as extra pole to hang clothes; less space consuming through mounting the rack to the ceiling {{or it can be}} repacked; movable by adding wheel or <b>channel</b> <b>rail,</b> more user friendly, compatible with most existing systems and low cost. In this paper, a new automatic outdoor laundry drying rack was designed and fabricated. It’s consists of most the features mention above. In additional, it has functions such as rain sensor to prevent clothes from rain. The rain sensor was designed and tested. The idea was incorporated by using temperature sensor, transistor and diode to choose the appropriate duration for drying clothes. The test shows that the rain sensor and the temperature sensor can be applied successfully if enables the system to check on the temperature and select the duration necessary to dry the clothes. As well the signal generated due to rain sensor will set the rack to be automatically rolled in. All of these make drying process to be more effective...|$|E
