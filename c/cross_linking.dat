The (o-PTF) was characterised by spectral (FTIR, UV, NMR) and physicochemical properties (specific gravity, viscosity, saponification value, iodine value). The molecular weight of o-PTF was estimated using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> biopolyesters were prepared by treating o-PTF of olive with N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate. The <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> biopolyesters were evaluated for spectral properties (FT IR), <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> density, thermal properties, mechanical properties and biodegradation. The potential antifungal and anti bacterial activities of the newly prepared biopolyesters were evaluated. The environment degradation was assessed by soil burial test.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to prepare, characterize and to evaluate a new modified starch namely <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea for its application in the formulation of sustained release floating tablets as rate controlling polymer. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was prepared and characterized by various physical properties and IR spectra. Sustained release floating tablets of three anti-hypertensive drugs namely Captopril, Losartan and Valsartan were formulated employing <b>cross</b> <b>Linked</b> starch Urea as rate controlling polymer and were evaluated. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea prepared by gelatinizing potato starch in the presence of urea and calcium chloride was insoluble in water and aqueous fluids of acidic and alkaline pHs. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea exhibited good swelling in water. The swelling index was 630. 2 %. As crosslinked starch urea is insoluble and has good swelling in water, it is considered suitable as release retarding and rate controlling matrix polymer for sustained release floating tablets. stained release tablets of (i) captopril, (ii) losartan and (iii) valsartan prepared using <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea as matrix polymer were non disintegrating in water, acidic (pH 1. 2) and alkaline (pH 7. 4) fluids and gave slow and controlled release over longer periods of time. In each case the release rate depended on the strength or concentration of <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea polymer in the tablets. A good linear relationship was observed between percent polymer in the matrix tablets and release rate (K 0) with all the three drugs indicating that the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea polymer is an efficient rate controlling polymer suitable for design of sustained release tablets. Drug release from these SR tablets was by diffusion mechanism, fickian diffusion in the case of tablets containing low percent of polymer and non fickian (anamalous) diffusion in the case of tablets containing high percent of polymer. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea alone and in combination with sodium bicarbonate (gas generating agent) was found not suitable for formulation of floating tablets though it has good rate controlling effect for formulation of sustained release tablets. When <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was used along with bees wax (lipohilic polymer) and starch acetate (good film forming polymer) it was found suitable for formulation of floating tablets. Floating tablets formulated with <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea (50 %) as matrix polymer, Bees wax (5 %) and starch acetate (5 %) as floating enhancers and sodium bicarbonate as gas generating agent exhibited good floating over 13 – 14 hrs with a floating lag time of 45 – 60 seconds. Drug release from these floating tablets was spread over 12 hrs with all the three drugs studied. The drug release from these tablets was by non fickian (anomalous) diffusion. Thus <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was found to be a good rate controlling polymer for sustained release tablets and along with bees wax and starch acetate it was also a good matrix polymer for floating tablets. Key words: <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea, Sustained release floating tablets, Rate controlling polymer, Captopril, Losartan, Valsartan...|$|R

25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E

40|$|Fibrinogen degradation, fibrin polymerisation, and the {{insertion}} of <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> into fibrin by fibrin stabilising factor lead to the appearance of new antigenic determinants. Antibodies against these antigenic sites may react specifically with the derivatives {{but not with the}} parent molecules. We have utilised a monoclonal antibody, which interacts with the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fragment D dimer and related high molecular weight fibrin derivatives, to develop an enzyme immunoassay which measures <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fibrin derivatives in plasma and serum using D dimer as standard. Mean concentration in plasma from normal subjects was 75 ng/ml with an upper limit of about 144 ng/ml. Concentrations in patients with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were raised in all cases. Confirmation of the specific increase of <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fibrin derivatives in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation was obtained by parallel monitoring of their fibrin degradation products in serum using affinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In many patients the plasma concentrations greatly exceeded the serum values of <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fibrin degradation products, suggesting that the procedure can measure fibrin derivatives in plasma which are absent from serum...|$|R

40|$|Cisplatin is an {{extremely}} effective chemotherapeutic agent used {{for the treatment of}} testicular and other solid tumours. It induces a variety of structural modifications in DNA, the most abundant being the GpG- and ApG- 1, 2 -intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> formed between adjacent purine bases. These <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> account for approximately 90 % of cisplatin-induced DNA damage and are thought to be responsible for the cytotoxic activity of the drug. In human cells, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process removes the intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from the genome, the efficiency of which is likely to be an important determinant of cisplatin cytotoxicity. We have investigated whether the p 53 tumour suppressor status affects global NER of cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in human cells. We have used a (32) P-postlabelling method to monitor the removal of GpG- and ApG-intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from two human cell models (the 041 TR system, in which p 53 is regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, together with WI 38 fibroblasts and the SV 40 -transformed derivative VA 13) that each differ in p 53 status. We demonstrate that the absence of functional p 53 leads to persistence of both cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in the genome, suggesting that p 53 regulates NER of these DNA lesions. This observation extends the role of p 53 in NER beyond enhancing the removal of environmentally induced DNA lesions to include those of clinical origin. Given the frequency of p 53 mutations in human tumours, these results may have implications for the use of cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
50|$|Andersen, in 1996, {{discovered}} that the tyrosine residues are involved in chemically covalent cross-links in many forms such as dityrosine, trityrosine, and tetratyrosine.
