50|$|Steger's Crazing Test is {{a method}} for the {{assessment}} of the glaze fit. It is undertaken by measuring any deformation on cooling of a thin bar that was glazed only on one side. A common method of testing glazed ceramic ware for <b>crazing</b> <b>resistance</b> is to expose pieces of ware to the steam in an autoclave at a minimum of 50 psi.|$|E

The effect of the porcelain brand used was the most significant determinant of porcelain crazing.

40|$|The {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion of core and veneer porcelains for all ceramic crowns must be compatible to prevent formation of stresses during the firing cycles. The {{purpose of this}} study was to use a thermal shock test to evaluate the <b>crazing</b> <b>resistance</b> of six all-ceramic crown systems. The systems tested were: Vita In-Ceream®, Vita Hi-Ceram®, Dicor™ veneered with Vitadur® N, magnesia core veneered with Ceramco® II, magnesia core veneered with Silhouette™, and magnesia core veneered with Vita VMK® 68. A maxillary central incisor was prepared with 1. 0 mm axial and 1. 5 mm incisal reduction. Refractory dies were prepared and crowns were fabricated using the manufactures recommendations. Six specimens of each system were placed inside a beaker in a furnace at 90 °C. After 15 min heat soak, ice water was poured into the beaker through a funnel. The samples were dried in air, reheated, and inspected for crazing using light microscopy. If crazing was observed, this would constitute a failure at a temperature difference (ΔT) of 90 °C. If no failure occurred, the test was repeated at increasing temperature increments of 10 °C until failure. The <b>crazing</b> <b>resistance</b> of each system, expressed as the mean ΔT, was: > 200 (Hi-Ceram®), 152 ± 19 (Dicor™ / Vitadur® N), 143 ± 5 (magnesia core/Vita VMK® 68), 122 ± 21 (magnesia core/Silhouette™), and 118 ± 10 (magnesia core/Ceramco® II) °C. All systems tested resisted crazing due to quenching in ice cold water from 100 °C. Systems with lower coefficients of expansion showed significantly greater resistance to thermal shock using ANOVA. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E

It is {{essential}} to establish the values of temperature coefficient of linear expansionof glaze and ceramic material containing beidellite clay and waste products of mineral cotton,and to examine the mechanism of glaze formation {{in the course of}} burning by means of infraredspectroscopy and electronic microscopy. Results. The formation of glaze of type ЩЛСО involves glass phase separation which precedescrystallization process. Conclusions. The study of thermoprocessed monoliths shows that liquation structure considerablydecreases at temperatures of 700 оС and 950 оС. Temperature interval of liquation is a function ofglaze thermal treatment conditions. It is shown that <b>crazing</b> <b>resistance</b> of glazed products is determinedby correlation of average temperature coefficients of linear expansion of mass and glaze,therefore, to obtain heat-resistant glazed ceramic brick with temperature coefficient of linear expansion 6. 53 · 10 - 4 оС, it is necessary to use glaze of type ЩЛСО with temperature coefficient oflinear expansion 6. 45 · 10 - 4 оС...|$|E

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: AuTi alloys with 1. 6 % to 1. 7 % (wt%) Ti provide {{sufficient}} bond strength to veneering ceramics, but {{the strength of}} entire metal-ceramic restorations fabricated from these alloys is not known. However, this information is important to assess the clinical performance of such materials. PURPOSE: This in vitro study evaluated the fracture strength and thermal shock resistance of metal-ceramic crowns with AuTi frameworks produced by milling or casting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Frameworks of the alloy Au- 1. 7 Ti- 0. 1 Ir (wt%) (Esteticor Vision) were produced by milling or casting (test groups). A high-gold alloy (Esteticor Special) {{was used as the}} control. The frameworks were veneered with ceramic (VMK 95). Specimens (n= 7) were loaded until fracture. Loads at failure (N) were recorded and the mean values statistically evaluated using 1 -way analysis of variance and a post hoc Dunnett test (alpha=. 05). To assess the <b>crazing</b> <b>resistance</b> of the veneering ceramic, 6 additional crowns of each group were subjected to a thermal shock test. Fractured surfaces were documented by scanning electron microscopy. Coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials used were measured (n= 2) to assess the thermal compatibility between alloys and ceramic. RESULTS: The mean fracture strength of the crowns with machined AuTi frameworks (1294 +/- 236 N) was significantly lower (P=. 012) than that of the cast AuTi frameworks (1680 +/- 150 N), but statistically not different than the high-gold alloy (1449 +/- 159 N). Bonding failure to the AuTi alloy predominantly occurred at the alloy-oxide interface. For the high-gold alloy, more ceramic residues were observed. In the thermal shock test, crowns with milled AuTi frameworks showed significantly higher thermal shock resistance compared to the other groups. The coefficients of thermal expansion (Esteticor Vision cast: 14. 5 microm/m. K; Esteticor Vision milled: 14. 3 microm/m. K; Esteticor Special cast: 13. 7 microm/m. K) did not correlate with the results of the thermal shock test. CONCLUSION: The in vitro fracture strength of crowns with milled AuTi frameworks is lower than that obtained with cast AuTi frameworks, but comparable to those crowns produced with a high-gold alloy...|$|E
