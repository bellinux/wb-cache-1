The decision to form a partnership with Varisys had the consequence of bringing XMOS chips to the AmigaOne X1000, {{as it is the}} connection between XMOS and the Varisys team, dating back to earlier work on the Inmos Transputer, that led to the suggestion of including an XMOS XCore <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> the X1000 motherboard.

Many LCD monitors do post-processing before displaying the image {{in an attempt to}} compensate for poor color fidelity, which adds an additional lag. Further, a video scaler must be used when displaying non-native resolutions, which adds yet more time lag. Scaling and post processing are usually done in a single <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> modern monitors, but each function that chip performs adds some delay. Some displays have a video gaming mode which disables all or most processing to reduce perceivable input lag.|$|E

25|$|The MSX3 was {{scheduled}} for market in 1990. Delays {{in the development of}} its VDP—then named V9978 on the pre-release spec sheets—caused Yamaha to miss its time to market deadline. In its place, an improved MSX2+ was released as the MSX TurboR; features of the new R800 processor such as DMA and 24-bit addressing were disabled. The VDP was eventually delivered two years after its planned deadline, by which time the market had moved on. In an attempt to reduce its financial loss, Yamaha stripped nearly all V9958 compatibility and marketed the resulting V9990 E-VDP III as a video-chipset for PC VGA graphic cards, with moderate success. Sony also employed the V7040 RGB encoder <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> many other products. MSX-FAN Magazine also mentions the then-impressive power of the V9990, being able to compete with much more expensive hardware such as the Sharp X68000.|$|E

Running to the bank, she avoids {{the woman with}} the baby carriage, who in a flash forward joins a church and devotes herself to God. Lola also {{narrowly}} misses the cyclist; the cyclist instead offers his bike to the homeless man in a restaurant, who uses Manni's money to buy it. Lola falls onto the bonnet of Mr. Meier's car, preventing his collision with the white BMW, allowing him to pick up Lola's dad on time. Since Lola can no longer speak to her dad, she continues running until she encounters a casino. Having only 99 marks, she convinces the cashier to give her a 100 mark chip. Betting the <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> a roulette table, she wins two consecutive bets, raising 126,000 marks. The people in the casino are shocked to see her win. Approaching the ambulance from behind, Lola climbs inside as it avoids the glass pane. Recognizing the patient inside as a security guard from the bank, Lola realizes he has suffered a heart attack. She holds his hand to calm him and, to the doctor's surprise, his heart rate immediately becomes normal.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{then set}} about recording the game's dialog, which {{proved to be}} challenging because of Vicious Cycle's location on the East Coast. [...] All of the recordings were done over the phone at a studio in Hollywood. [...] Despite this, {{and the fact that}} Fred alone had over 1000 lines of in-game dialog, the recording went smoothly, {{with the exception of one}} unidentified actor who walked out in the middle of a session. [...] The original script had only one instance of the word [...] "fuck", but several recording sessions with McGinley resulted in a great deal of colorful improvisation. [...] The design team liked the recordings and the script was modified to permit McGinley and other actors to curse more.

Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Lane's character and Slattery's direction during the fight sequence, singling out Don, Bert, and Roger's reactions as [...] "absolute comedy gold". She also compared the Pete character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon because: [...] "there's a sense with Pete that there's always a <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder and he'll eternally feel misunderstood and undervalued. He'll always inspire a mixture of pity and exasperation, because he's smart and insightful, but he can be a piece of work." ...|$|E
