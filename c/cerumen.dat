25|$|Although {{the acute}} {{external}} otitis generally resolves {{in a few}} days with topical washes and antibiotics, complete return of hearing and <b>cerumen</b> gland function may take a few more days. Once healed completely, the ear canal is again self-cleaning. Until it recovers fully, it may be more prone to repeat infection from further physical or chemical insult.|$|E
5000|$|While studies {{conducted}} {{up until the}} 1960s found little evidence supporting antibacterial activity for <b>cerumen,</b> more recent {{studies have found that}} <b>cerumen</b> has a bactericidal effect on some strains of bacteria. <b>Cerumen</b> has been found to reduce the viability {{of a wide range of}} bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and many variants of Escherichia coli, sometimes by as much as 99%. [...] The growth of two fungi commonly present in otomycosis was also significantly inhibited by human <b>cerumen.</b> These antimicrobial properties are due principally to the presence of saturated fatty acids, lysozyme and, especially, to the slight acidity of <b>cerumen</b> (pH typically around 6.1 in normal individuals). Conversely, other research has found that <b>cerumen</b> can support microbial growth and some <b>cerumen</b> samples were found to have bacterial counts as high as 107/g <b>cerumen.</b>|$|E
50|$|A/B otic drops is also {{indicated}} {{for the removal}} of excessive or impacted <b>cerumen.</b> To clear <b>cerumen,</b> it is used 3 times a day for 2-3 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{lubrication}} {{provided by}} <b>cerumen</b> prevents desiccation {{of the skin}} within the ear canal. The lubricative properties arise from the high lipid content of the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands. In wet-type <b>cerumen</b> at least, these lipids include cholesterol, squalene, and many long-chain fatty acids and alcohols.|$|E

50|$|Earwax, {{also known}} as <b>cerumen,</b> is a yellowish, waxy {{substance}} secreted in the ear canals. It {{plays an important role}} in the human ear canal, assisting in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection from bacteria, fungi, and insects. Excess or impacted <b>cerumen</b> can press against the eardrum and/or occlude the external auditory canal and impair hearing, causing conductive hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|A cerumenolytic {{should be}} used 2-3 times daily for 3-5 days prior to the <b>cerumen</b> extraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} may {{be missed}} in most early cases because {{the examination of}} the ear, with the exception of pain with manipulation, is nearly normal. In some early cases, the most striking visual finding is the lack of <b>cerumen.</b> As a moderate or severe case of external otitis resolves, weeks may be required before the ear canal again shows a normal amount of <b>cerumen.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{postal survey}} of British general {{practitioners}} {{found that only}} 19% always performed <b>cerumen</b> removal themselves. It is problematic as the removal of <b>cerumen</b> is not without risk, and physicians and nurses often have inadequate training for removal. Irrigation can be performed at home with proper equipment {{as long as the}} person is careful not to irrigate too hard. All other methods should be carried out only by individuals who have been sufficiently trained in the procedure.|$|E
50|$|Ear picks, {{also called}} ear scoops, or ear spoons, or earpicks, are {{a type of}} curette used to clean the ear canal of earwax (<b>cerumen).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The use {{of cotton}} swabs {{in the ear}} canal is {{associated}} with no medical benefits and poses definite medical risks. <b>Cerumen</b> (ear wax) is a naturally occurring, normally extruded product of {{the external auditory canal}} that protects the skin inside the ear, serves beneficial lubrication and cleaning functions, and provides some protection from bacteria, fungi, insects, and water. [...] A 2004 study found that the [...] "use of a cotton-tip applicator to clean the ear seems to be the leading cause of otitis externa in children and should be avoided." [...] Attempts to remove <b>cerumen</b> with cotton swabs may result in <b>cerumen</b> impaction, a buildup or blockage of <b>cerumen</b> in the ear canal, which can cause pain, hearing problems, ringing in the ear, or dizziness, and may require medical treatment to resolve. [...] The use of cotton swabs in the ear canal {{is one of the most}} common causes of perforated eardrum, a condition which sometimes requires surgery to correct. [...] For these reasons, the American Academy of Family Physicians, among many other professional medical associations, recommends never placing cotton swabs in the ear canal. [...] In the US between 1990 and 2010, an estimated 263â€‰338 children went to hospital emergency rooms for cotton swab injuries.|$|E
50|$|The gene is {{responsible}} for determination of human <b>cerumen</b> type (wet or dry ear wax) and presence of underarm osmidrosis (odor associated with sweat caused by excessive apocrine secretion).|$|E
5000|$|The {{entrance}} and surrounding areas of their nest are {{coated with a}} smooth, thick layer of black, red, or yellow <b>cerumen,</b> a material formed by mixing beeswax (a glandular secretion of worker bees) with propolis. [...] They lack external entrance tunnels. T. carbonaria builds brood cells arranged in combs or semicombs. The cells are a single layer of hexagonal combs that are built in a spiral. They are vertically elongated and in a regular vertical orientation. They are built out of brown <b>cerumen,</b> and house the eggs and larvae. New cells {{are added to the}} brood by the advancing front. The nest cavity may be sealed off from adjoining cavities by a hard batumen layer of <b>cerumen</b> or field-collected material. The brood chamber is centered in the hive, which makes T. carbonaria suitable for hive propagation. The brood chamber is also made up of multiple horizontal layers which allow for easy division of the brood comb.|$|E
50|$|Extended-wear {{hearing aids}} are built to {{withstand}} moisture and <b>cerumen</b> (ear wax) {{and can be}} worn whileexercising, showering, etc. The longevity of extended wear hearing aids is affected by usage patterns, environmental differences, and the lifestyle of each user.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{distinct}} genetically determined types of earwax: the wet type, which is dominant, and the dry type, which is recessive. While East Asians and Native Americans {{are more likely}} to have the dry type of <b>cerumen</b> (gray and flaky), African and European people {{are more likely to}} have the wet type (honey-brown to dark-brown and moist). <b>Cerumen</b> type has been used by anthropologists to track human migratory patterns, such as those of the Eskimos. In Japan, wet-type earwax is more prevalent among the Ainu, in contrast to that country's Yamato majority. The consistency of wet type earwax is due to the higher concentration of lipid and pigment s (50% lipid) in the substance than the dry type (30% lipid).|$|E
50|$|Ceruminous glands are {{specialized}} sudoriferous glands (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in {{the external}} auditory canal, in the outer 1/3. Ceruminous glands are simple, coiled, tubular glands made up of an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells. They are classed as apocrine glands. The glands drain into larger ducts, which then drain into the guard hairs that reside {{in the external}} auditory canal. Here they produce <b>cerumen,</b> or earwax, by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead epidermal cells. <b>Cerumen</b> keeps the eardrum pliable, lubricates and cleans the external auditory canal, waterproofs the canal, kills bacteria, {{and serves as a}} barrier to trap foreign particles (dust, fungal spores, etc.) by coating the guard hairs of the ear, making them sticky.|$|E
50|$|Earwax, {{also known}} as <b>cerumen,</b> is a brown, gray, or {{yellowish}} waxy substance secreted in the ear canal of humans and other mammals. It protects {{the skin of the}} human ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection against bacteria, fungi, insects, and water.|$|E
50|$|Ear disease (otitis) can be {{a source}} of odor that varies from yeasty to one {{resembling}} sewage as either <b>cerumen</b> or pus accumulates in the diseased ear canal. Anal sac disease or excessive anal sac production can cause a very musty pungent odor. Anal sacs can become abscessed and infecting micro-organisms produce odor.|$|E
50|$|Specialized sweat glands, {{including}} the ceruminous glands, mammary glands, ciliary glands of the eyelids, and sweat glands {{of the nasal}} vestibulum, are modified apocrine glands. Ceruminous glands are near the ear canals, and produce <b>cerumen</b> (earwax) that mixes with the oil secreted from sebaceous glands. Mammary glands use apocrine secretion to produce milk.|$|E
50|$|Colonies are {{founded by}} swarming; a young queen {{and a small}} {{fraction}} of workers leave the mother nest for a new nest site. Before swarming, scout bees explore suitable cavities in the area surrounding the mother nest. This scouting often lasts between two days and two weeks. The new nest sites are within a few hundred meters of the mother nest to allow continued contact with the mother nest, which can last from a week up to six months for T. angustula, which is longer than many other bee species. Resources are transferred from the mother nest to the new nest, including pollen, honey, and <b>cerumen,</b> but the new nest continues to have very small stores compared to the mother nest. <b>Cerumen,</b> which comes from the mother nest, is a wax used to seal cracks and holes in the new nest site.|$|E
50|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, {{the implications of}} <b>cerumen</b> type on fitness are unknown although odorless sweat in ancient Northern Eurasian populations have been postulated to have an adaptive advantage for cold weather. In some nonhuman mammals, mating signals via release of an odor enhanced by increased apocrine secretion may {{be a factor in}} sexual selection.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the acute}} {{external}} otitis generally resolves {{in a few}} days with topical washes and antibiotics, complete return of hearing and <b>cerumen</b> gland function may take a few more days. Once healed completely, the ear canal is again self-cleaning. Until it recovers fully, it may be more prone to repeat infection from further physical or chemical insult.|$|E
50|$|Once a nest site is found, the {{existing}} cavity must be cleaned. After the pre-existing container {{is ready to}} be inhabited, the workers build several horizontal brood combs {{in the center of the}} nest. This brood chamber is surrounded by layers of <b>cerumen,</b> called the involucrum, which helps maintain a constant climate in the brood chamber.|$|E
50|$|Earwax {{consists}} of shed skin cells, hair, and the secretions of the ceruminous and sebaceous glands {{of the outside}} ear canal. Major components of earwax are long chain fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, alcohols, squalene, and cholesterol. Excess or compacted <b>cerumen</b> can press against the eardrum or block the outside ear canal or hearing aids, potentially causing hearing loss.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cerumen</b> is {{produced}} in the outer third of the cartilaginous portion of the ear canal. It {{is a mixture of}} viscous secretions from sebaceous glands and less-viscous ones from modified apocrine sweat glands. [...] The primary components of earwax are shed layers of skin, with, on average, 60% of the earwax consisting of keratin, 12-20% saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, squalene and 6-9% cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{ear mite}} infections in {{dogs and cats}} may present as a disease that causes intense itching in one or both ears, which in turn triggers scratching at the affected ear. An unusually dark colored ear wax (<b>cerumen)</b> may also be produced. Cats, as well as dogs with erect ears that have control over ear direction, may be seen with one or both ear pinnas held at an odd or flattened angle.|$|E
50|$|Nest {{location}} helps regulate nest temperature. However, S. postica {{workers can}} help warm or cool the nest. At low temperatures, the bees mass incubate the brood chamber, increasing temperature. <b>Cerumen</b> coverings, produced by workers, insulate cold spots. During overheating, bees evacuate the nest {{and reduce the}} temperature by fanning. There is direct cooling via evaporation due to nest location. The temperature homeostasis is important because of the hot climate of the tropical Brazilian rain forests.|$|E
5000|$|Nannotrigona testaceicornis defend by biting their {{predators and}} gather in large colonies of 2000 to 3000 {{individuals}} {{due to the}} lack of a toxic stinger. The more individuals in a colony, the more guards the colony has to watch the nest. In the day time, these guards will take shifts to block the entrance of the nest from unrelated individuals. [...] At night, the guards will then seal the <b>cerumen</b> tube entrance.|$|E
50|$|However, {{sometimes}} even {{examination of the}} eardrum {{may not be able}} to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the canal is small. If wax in the ear canal obscures a clear view of the eardrum it should be removed using a blunt <b>cerumen</b> curette or a wire loop. Also, an upset young child's crying can cause the eardrum to look inflamed due to distension of the small blood vessels on it, mimicking the redness associated with otitis media.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{tumors are}} unencapsulated, but are usually well defined or circumscribed. The {{overlying}} surface epithelium is not involved. The tumor shows a dual or biphasic appearance, with glandular or cystic spaces showing inner luminal secretory cells with abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm subtended by basal, myoepithelial cells at the periphery, {{adjacent to the}} basement membrane. The luminal cells will often have decapitation (apocrine) secretions and will also have yellow-brown, ceroid, lipofuscin-like (<b>cerumen)</b> pigment granules. There is no pleomorphic, limited mitoses, and no necrosis.|$|E
50|$|The nest {{consists}} of inner brood cells {{and a short}} entrance tube. The brood cells are sometimes compacted into combs and large wax pots for storage of honey/pollen. The cells are composed of <b>cerumen,</b> are vertical in shape, and open {{at the top of}} the cell. The entrance to the nest has an average cross-sectional area of 143.5 mm2 and is guarded by about 8 guards. These bees stand at attention near the entrance, occasionally flying back and forth in front of the entrance.|$|E
50|$|East Asians {{who have}} nearly {{complete}} loss of typical body odor, {{when compared to}} people of African and European descent, have significantly less of the characteristic axillary odorants and variants in the ABCC11 gene, which is expressed and localized in apocrine sweat glands. Racial differences also exist in the <b>cerumen</b> glands, apocrine sweat glands which produce earwax. East Asians have predominantly dry earwax, as opposed to sticky; the gene encoding for this is strongly linked to reduced body odor, whereas those with wet, sticky earwax (Africans and Europeans) are prone to more body odor.|$|E
5000|$|A {{specific}} gene {{has been}} identified that determines whether people have wet or dry earwax. The difference in <b>cerumen</b> type has been tracked to a single base change (a single nucleotide polymorphism) in a gene known as [...] "ATP-binding cassette C11 gene". Dry-type individuals are homozygous for adenine whereas wet-type requires at least one guanine. Wet-type earwax is associated with armpit odor, which is increased by sweat production. The researchers conjecture that the reduction in sweat or body odor was beneficial to the ancestors of East Asians and Native Americans who {{are thought to have}} lived in cold climates.|$|E
5000|$|Cleaning of the {{ear canal}} {{occurs as a result}} of the [...] "conveyor belt" [...] process of {{epithelial}} migration, aided by jaw movement. [...] Cells formed in the centre of the tympanic membrane migrate outwards from the umbo (at a rate comparable to that of fingernail growth) to the walls {{of the ear}} canal, and move towards the entrance of the ear canal. The <b>cerumen</b> in the canal is also carried outwards, taking with it any particulate matter that may have gathered in the canal. Jaw movement assists this process by dislodging debris attached to the walls of the ear canal, increasing the likelihood of its expulsion.|$|E
5000|$|M. scutellaris nests in {{cavities}} of {{tree trunks}} in the Atlantic rainforest and is widely {{distributed in the}} Northeast of Brazil, where it is commonly kept by regional and traditional beekeepers for honey, pollen and wax. To construct their nests, M. scutellaris use <b>cerumen,</b> a mixture of wax and floral resins. Ceruman is used in different ratios in storage pots, brood cells, entrance openings and tubes, and pillars. The nests are surrounded and protected by a structure called batumen, a wall-like plate made of brittle ceruman, mud, and sometimes pieces of flowers and leaves. When excessive mud is added, the mixture is called [...] "geopropolis." ...|$|E
