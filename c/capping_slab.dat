50|$|A feature {{catching}} one's {{attention is}} a groove cut round its perimeter piercing the <b>capping</b> <b>slab</b> by a hole {{that may have}} served for religious rituals in the past.|$|E
50|$|These {{tanks are}} {{situated}} {{on the top of}} the Magħlaq plateau. Their name - il-Misqa has been attributed to the watering place.The eight tanks are bell-shaped and have openings through which the water can be accessed, but share no regular shape. Most openings were closed with an intrigue formation of heavy stone interlocking slabs, whilst one has a round hole in the <b>capping</b> <b>slab</b> allowing water to be drawn through.|$|E
40|$|A {{design of}} the {{load-bearing}} capacity and settlement of a pilot base is usually {{based on the assumption}} that all of the load from the top of the building is transferred only by pilots. The influence of the adjacent connecting structures, which are in contact with the ground (pile <b>cap,</b> <b>slab,</b> block, belt, etc.), is usually ignored. The necessary data from the experimental measurement of the impact of these structures, concerning the overall bearing capacity of the foundations, was obtained on the testload device (Stand), in the area of Faculty of Civil Engineering, VŠB-TU of Ostrava. The progress of the experiment and the results of the load tests are listed in this pape...|$|R
50|$|At this {{location}} the motorway route follows a horizontal curve of 2006 m radius. Transversal grade {{of the deck}} is constant and equal to 2.5%, while elevation grade of the bridge is constant at 0.835%, sloping down towards Oštrovica. The bridge is a box girder structure supporting the deck across 10 spans: 42.63 m + 8 x 50.16 m + 42.63 m. Since the elevation of the bridge lies 41 m above the average water level of Lake Bajer, incremental launching of the bridge was executed without use of any auxiliary piers. The main longitudinal girders comprise box cross-section and were divided in 19 sections each (2 x 27.94 m + 15 x 25.08 m + 2 x 27.94 m). Piers of the bridge comprise a 6.6 m by 3.1 m box cross-section with 30 cm thick walls. Bridge abutments and shore piers have shallow foundations, while those piers located within the lake have foundations executed on groups of six piles each. The piles are circular in cross section, 1.5 m in diameter, and are connected with beam <b>cap</b> <b>slabs</b> measuring 8.5 m x 9.5 m x 2.5 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the Cross is finished with chipped granolithic marble. The base until the 11 m level is <b>capped</b> with sculptural <b>slabs</b> and relief titled Nabiag Na Bato also by Abueva, depicting important historical figures and events like the execution of Jose Rizal, Lapu-Lapu and Antonio Luna.|$|R
50|$|Fogous {{consist of}} a buried, usually corbelled stone wall, {{tapering}} {{at the top and}} <b>capped</b> by stone <b>slabs.</b> They were mainly constructed by excavating a sloping trench about 5 ft wide and 6 ft deep, lining it with drystone walling as stated, which was battered inwards and roofed with flat slabs; soil from excavation was heaped on top as at Pendeen Vau or incorporated in the rampart of the enclosure as at Halliggye Fogou, Trelowarren.|$|R

Concerning {{the stress}} and {{displacement}} of the cap under lateral load with or without pile partner, reference on PCC lateral load test and numerical simulation, build finite element model of a pile under lateral load to study {{the stress and}} displacement of the cap, calculations show that the diffusion effect help partner to reduce stress concentration of the pile <b>cap,</b> and foundation <b>slab</b> can be designed thinner if there are pile partners...|$|R
50|$|The Red Brick School {{stands in}} a {{residential}} area northwest of Wiscasset's small commercial center, at {{the northeast corner of}} Warren and Hodge Streets. It is a two-story masonry structure, with brick walls, a hip roof topped by a cupola, and a foundation of fieldstone <b>capped</b> by granite <b>slabs.</b> The south-facing front wall is laid in Flemish bond, while the sides and rear are laid in common bond. The front is three bays wide, with windows set in segmented-arch openings topped by brick headers, and a center entrance set in a simple rectangular opening with a small square window to the left. The interior has retained some original finishes despite undergoing alterations for different uses in the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Pikestones is {{the remains}} of a Neolithic Burial Cairn, located on Anglezarke moor in Lancashire, England. The site is {{approximately}} 150 feet (45 metres) long and 60 feet (18 metres) across at its widest point. It consisted of one burial chamber constructed of large upright <b>slabs,</b> <b>capped</b> by two lintel slabs, forming a chamber of 15 feet (4.5 metres) long, 3 feet (0.9 metres) wide and 3 feet (0.9 metres) high, covered by a huge mound of stones and turves. The cairn was aligned almost exactly North-South, with the burial chamber under the wider northern end. At the northern edge of the cairn, a double wall could be made out, curving inwards to form an entrance to a forecourt.|$|R
60|$|The {{roads were}} a wonder, and well they might be. Here was an island {{with only a}} handful of people in it--25,000--and yet such fine roads do not exist in the United States outside of Central Park. Everywhere you go, in any direction, you find either a hard, smooth, level thoroughfare, just {{sprinkled}} with black lava sand, and bordered with little gutters neatly paved with small smooth pebbles, or compactly paved ones like Broadway. They talk much of the Russ pavement in New York, and call it a new invention--yet here they have been using it in this remote little isle of the sea for two hundred years! Every street in Horta is handsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks, and the surface is neat and true as a floor--not marred by holes like Broadway. And every road is fenced in by tall, solid lava walls, which will last a thousand years in this land where frost is unknown. They are very thick, and are often plastered and whitewashed and <b>capped</b> with projecting <b>slabs</b> of cut stone. Trees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down, and contrast their bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and make them beautiful. The trees and vines stretch across these narrow roadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be riding through a tunnel. The pavements, the roads, and the bridges are all government work.|$|R
5000|$|From 1963 to 1977 the Maxey Flat Low Level Radioactive Waste {{facility}} {{served as}} a dump for 832 corporations and government agencies. The site covered 252 acre and consisted {{of a series of}} 52 unlined trenches that are an average of 360 ft long, 70 ft wide and 20 ft deep. Approximately [...] of Low Level Radioactive Waste was deposited on-site. These trenches were capped with dirt when they reached their capacity. Because of the heavy rainfall, soil collapsed into the trenches and they filled with water. It has since been referred to as the [...] "bathtub effect." [...] The water became radioactive and had to be disposed of. Under the direction of President and Chief Executive Officer James N. Neel, Nuclear Engineering Company (referred to in operational documentation as 'NECO'), now known as 'American Ecology' (Nasdaq: ECOL), installed an evaporator and disposed of the accumulated radioactive water as steam from 1973 to April 1986, nearly 9 years after the site had stopped accepting waste materials. The evaporator generally operated 24 hours a day. Approximately six million gallons of liquid were processed by the evaporator. In addition to the trenches for Low Level Radioactive Waste there were [...] "Hot Wells" [...] that were used to store Special nuclear material (plutonium and enriched uranium). The Hot Wells were typically 10 to 15 ft deep, constructed of concrete, coated steel pipe or tile, and <b>capped</b> with a <b>slab</b> of concrete. Approximately 950 pounds of Special Nuclear Material is buried at Maxey Flat.|$|R
40|$|Archaeological {{monitoring}} of {{construction of the}} 2 ̆ 2 Millenium 2 ̆ 2 segment of the Tennessee Riverpark development was conducted between April 2002 and May 2005. A small number of closed-context features were exposed and documented during the monitoring. Three human interments and one small firepit were recorded. The {{great majority of the}} route of the Riverpark contained no significant archaeological features or deposits. Significant portions of the route of the walkway traversed severely modified terrain including capped landfills, roadway shoulders and redeposited fills. Previously-recorded historic and prehistoric sites near the Amnicola Marsh had been seriously disturbed during creation of the Centre South Industrial Riverport and no closed-context archaeological features were noted during Riverpark construction activities in that vicinity. The Roxbury Site, 40 HA 66, principally contained the badly disturbed remnants of a Late Woodland mound and village that had largely been destroyed during construction of a textile mill in the early 1970 s. Very small remnants of undisturbed midden may remain on the Northrup King parcel of the Riverpark. A lithic scatter is also adjacent to one segment of the Riverpark north of the Riverpoint spur trail. This site merits protection and further testing as the opportunity arises. Three human interments were exposed during the construction project; one was encountered within the work limits by project contractors and was recognized and protected by the monitoring archaeologist. The additional two burials were exposed out of the work limits by a contractor not affiliated with the Riverpark construction. All three burials were reported to the Hamilton County Medical Examiner 2 ̆ 7 s office and the Tennessee State Archaeologist. The interments were not excavated or recovered, but were <b>capped</b> by concrete <b>slabs</b> and left in situ as directed by the State Archaeologist. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Having formed Conway Stewart as a Limited Company in the UK the {{trademark}} was registered in Europe and Asia to ensure worldwide {{security for the}} brand. Having researched Conway Stewarts previous manufacturing history and techniques Don Yendle wanted to keep true to its core values from 1905. What followed were 3 years of research into Casein and plastics including vulcanite for barrels and feeders for nibs. The company even used a Birmingham-based company who still used a 1-metre pantograph to make the miniature molds for the pen clips {{in order to keep}} the detail in the clips. All of the new clips were exactly the same size as the originals so pen collectors would have spares for the vintage pens they wished to repair.After much experimentation with slabs of casein from uk and some very old stock from Japan Conway Stewart re-launched in 1997. At that first exhibition the Foreign Office chose Conwasy Stewart as a supplier of gifts for Number 10 Downing Street and gifts from the government to visiting Dignitaries. The first collections (58 series and Dinkies) were all made from casein with solid gold rings swaged on to each <b>cap.</b> Each <b>slab</b> of casein had to be cured for at least 3 months in drying room with just the right humidity. Returning the barrels to the drying room after each process in order to train the material to be 'round'. Each collection was limited to 500 pcs based on material and colour. Each pen code and number laser engraved on to each barrel.The company then introduced designs (Churchill series, 58, Dinkie)in acrylic, solid silver, and solid gold. The first solid gold pens were made for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and HRH Prince Philip on the celebration of their golden wedding anniversary 20 November 1997. Two pieces were made in 18ct solid gold. The queen wrote a letter of thanks for the gift stating they were 'useful to boot'.The pens were originally made in Horrabridge and the company moved to its Plymouth premises in 2001 having outgrown the original premises.The company continued to produce pens for the Prime Ministers Office, supplying birthday presents of a Conway Stewart Churchill to Bill Clinton, George Bush, Jacque Chirac, Vladimir Putin to name but a few. The pens were also selected by the Foreign Office as gifts to all world leaders at the G8 and G20 summits, along with pens for Prince Charles, Princess Diana and Barbara Cartland.Conway Stewart introduced a few prototype celluloid pens, mainly as overlays on solid silver Duro pens.The company supplied another set of gold pens for the celebration of Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee featuring a hard rubber Churchill with an 18ct Overlay. Only a few pieces were sold. Don Yendle sold the company to an investor in October 2003 having established worldwide distribution.|$|R
