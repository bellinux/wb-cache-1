25|$|In {{the human}} nervous system nicotinic {{cholinergic}} signals are extended throughout the system, where the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) {{plays a key}} role in activating ligand-gated ion channels. The <b>cholinergic</b> <b>system</b> is a vital nervous pathway, where cholinergic neurons synthesize, store and release the neurotransmitter ACh. The main receptors that convert the ACh messages are the cholinergic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, neuronal and muscular nAChRs. When looking back at evolutionary history, ACh is considered to be the oldest transmitter molecule and became present before the nervous cell. In the nervous system cholinergic stimulation mediated through nAChRs controls pathways such as release of transmitters and cell sensitivity, which can influence physiological activity including sleep, anxiety, processing of pain and cognitive functions.|$|E

40|$|PMID: 9184996 Because our {{knowledge}} of <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> in the brains of amphibians is limited, the present study aimed to {{provide detailed information on}} the distribution of cholinergic cell bodies and fibers as revealed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). To determine general and derived features of the <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> within the class of Amphibia, both anuran (Rana perezi, Xenopus laevis) and urodele (Pleurodeles waltl) amphibians were studied. Distinct groups of ChAT-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the basal telencephalon, hypothalamus, habenula, isthmic nucleus, isthmic reticular formation, cranial nerve motor nuclei, and spinal cord. Prominent plexuses of cholinergic fibers were found in the olfactory bulb, pallium, basal telencephalon, ventral thalamus, tectum, and nucleus interpeduncularis. Comparison of these results with those obtained in other vertebrates, including a segmental approach to correlate cell populations, reveals that the <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> in amphibians share many features with amniotes. Thus, cholinergic pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei could be identified in the amphibian brain. The finding of weakly immunoreactive cells in the striatum of Rana, which is in contrast with the condition found in Xenopus, Pleurodeles, and other anamniotes studied so far, has revived the notion that basal ganglia organization is more preserved during evolution than previously thought.

50|$|The <b>cholinergic</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of projection neurons from the pedunculopontine nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and basal forebrain and interneurons from the striatum and nucleus accumbens. It {{is not yet}} clear whether acetylcholine as a neuromodulator acts through volume transmission or classical synaptic transmission, as there is evidence to support both theories. Acetylcholine binds to both metabotropic muscarinic receptors (mAChR) and the ionotropic nicotinic receptors (nAChR). The <b>cholinergic</b> <b>system</b> {{has been found to be}} involved in responding to cues related to the reward pathway, enhancing signal detection and sensory attention, regulating homeostasis, mediating the stress response, and encoding the formation of memories.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{acetylcholine}} in {{the central}} and peripheral nervous systems is well established in adults. Cholinergic modulation of vascular functions and body fluid balance has been extensively studied. In the embryo-fetus, cholinergic receptors are widespread in the peripheral and central systems, including smooth muscle and the epithelial lining of the cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems, {{as well as in}} the brain. Fetal nicotine and muscarinic receptors develop in a pattern (e. g., amount and distribution) related to gestational periods. Cholinergic mechanisms have been found to be relatively intact and functional in the control of vascular homeostasis during fetal life in utero at least during the last third of gestation. This review focuses on the development of fetal nicotine and muscarinic receptors, and provides information indicating that central <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> are well developed in the control of fetal blood pressure and body fluid balance before birth. Therefore, the development of <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> in utero plays an important role in fetal vascular regulation, gastrointestinal motility, and urinary control...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} how <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> regulate {{aspects of the}} sleep disorder narcolepsy, we video-monitored mice lacking both orexin (hypocretin) receptors (double knockout; DKO mice) while pharmacologically altering cholinergic transmission. Spontaneous behavioral arrests in DKO mice were highly similar to those reported in orexin-deficient mice and were never observed in wild-type (WT) mice. A survival analysis revealed that arrest lifetimes were exponentially distributed indicating that random, Markovian processes determine arrest lifetime. Low doses (0. 01, 0. 03 mg/kg, i. p.), but not a high dose (0. 08 mg/kg, i. p.) of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine {{increased the number of}} arrests but did not alter arrest lifetimes. The muscarinic antagonist atropine (0. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) decreased the number of arrests, also without altering arrest lifetimes. To determine if muscarinic transmission in pontine areas linked to REM sleep control also influences behavioral arrests, we microinjected neostigmine (50 nl, 62. 5 µM) or neostigmine + atropine (62. 5 µM and 111 µM respectively) into the nucleus pontis oralis and caudalis. Neostigmine increased the number of arrests in DKO mice without altering arrest lifetimes but did not provoke arrests in WT mice. Co-injection of atropine abolished this effect. Collectively, our findings establish that behavioral arrests in DKO mice are similar to those in orexin deficient mice and that arrests have exponentially distributed lifetimes. We also show, {{for the first time in}} a rodent narcolepsy model, that <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> can regulate arrest dynamics. Since perturbations of muscarinic transmission altered arrest frequency but not lifetime, our findings suggest <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> influence arrest initiation without influencing circuits that determine arrest duration...|$|R

This study examined central mechanisms of persistent pain using an autoradiographic technique to localize phosphoinositide hydrolysis (PI) in the rat spinal cord dorsal horn. The lateral half of laminae I-II showed {{the highest levels of}} baseline PI turnover and carbachol-stimulated PI turnover in normal animals as well as after inflammation.

In 8 rats responding under a fixed ratio 5 schedule of food presentation, morphine (3. 2 - 10 mg/kg), scopolamine (0. 032 - 1. 0 mg/kg), and nicotine (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg) each dose dependently decreased responding. Acute injection of scopolamine shifted the morphine dose-response curved leftward and downward and acute injection of morphine shifted the scopolamine and nicotine dose-response curves leftward and downward. The interaction between morphine and nicotine was additive; however, the interaction between morphine and scopolamine was infra-additive or supra-additive, depending on whether scopolamine or morphine was administered first.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of cholinergic deficiency on prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle. Rats treated with a choline-free diet that contained the false cholinergic precursor Naminodeanol showed great deficit in PPI. This deficit {{does not appear to be}} secondary to an increase of stereotyped behaviors. Startle threshold was also greatly reduced, as these rats startled to the 70 -dB prepulse and the baseline startle amplitude was increased by 60 % over the control rats. Arecoline (4 mg/kg) partially reversed the deficit in PPI. This improvement persisted beyond the period of drug treatment. On the other hand, scopolamine (1 mg/kg) reduced PPI in the control rats. These results suggest that <b>cholinergic</b> <b>systems</b> play a major role in both the elicitation and prepulse inhibition of startle.
