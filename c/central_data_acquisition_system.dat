40|$|Wireless Smart Sensor Networks (WSSNs) {{facilitates}} a {{new paradigm}} to structural identification and monitoring for civil infrastructure. Conventionally, wired sensors and <b>central</b> <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been used to}} characterize the state of the structure, which is quite challenging due to difficulties in cabling, long setup time, and high equipment and maintenance costs. WSSNs offer a unique opportunity to overcome such difficulties. Recent advances in sensor technology have realized low-cost, smart sensors with on-board computation and wireless communication capabilities, making deployment of a dense array of sensors on large civil structures both feasible and economical. However, as opposed to wired sensor networks in which centralized <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> and processing are common practice, WSSNs require decentralized algorithms due to the limitation associated with wireless communication; to date such algorithms are limited. This research develops new decentralized algorithms for structural identification and monitoring of civil infrastructure. To increase performance, flexibility, and versatility of the WSSN, the following issues are considered specifically: (1) decentralized modal analysis, (2) efficient decentralized system identification in the WSSN, and (3) multimetric sensing. Numerical simulation and laboratory testing are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed approaches. The performance of the decentralized approaches and their software implementations are validated through full-scale applications at the Irwin Indoor Practice Field in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Jindo Bridge, a 484 meter-long cable-stayed bridge located in South Korea.

40|$|Abstract: Extensive air showers are {{associated}} with transient radio emission, which could provide a new mode of detection of UHECR with an important target volume and a high duty cycle. The Codalema experiment {{has been set up}} and is running in the Radio Observatory in Nancay, France, to investigate this possibility. The apparatus is composed of an antenna array overlapped by a ground particle array. A set of 16 wide band active dipoles are aligned on two 600 meter long baselines in the North-South and East-West directions. This radio array is triggered by a ground detector of 240 meters square containing 13 plastic scintillator stations. The antennas and scintillators are wired to a <b>central</b> <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>system</b> where all the signals are processed. Radio signals are recorded in a large 1 - 200 MHz bandwidth, while favorable signal to background ratio is looked for in a narrower band around 50 MHz.

40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is {{a helpful}} tool for {{engineers}} {{in order to}} control and verify the structural behaviour. SHM also guides the engineers and owners of structures in decision making concerning the maintenance, economy and safety of structures. Sweden has not a very sever tradition in monitoring, as countries with strong seismic and/or aerodynamic activities. Anyway, several large scale monitoring projects have taken place in recent years and SHM is slowly making entrance as an essential implement in managing structures by engineers as well as owners. This licentiate thesis presents a state-of-the art-review of health monitoring activities and over sensory technologies for monitoring infrastructure constructions like bridges, dams, off-shore platforms, historical monuments etc. related to civil engineering. The fibre optic equipment is presented with special consideration. The permanent monitoring system of the New Årsta Bridge consists of 40 fibre optic sensors, 20 strain transducers, 9 thermocouples, 6 accelerometers and one LVDT. The aims of the static study are: to control the maximal strains and stresses; to detect cracking in the structure; to report strain changes under construction, testing period and in the coming 10 years; and to compare conventional system with fibre optic system. The system installation started in January 2003 and was completed October 2003. The measurements took place from the very beginning and are suppose to continue for at least 10 years of operation. At the construction phase the measurements were performed manually and later on automatically through broad band connection between the office and <b>central</b> <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> located inside the bridge.

The ARGO-YBJ detector consists of a single layer of RPCs operated in streamer mode, housed in a large building of about 11000 m(2)). Signals from each RPC are picked up with 80 readout strips 61. 8 cm wide and 6. 75 cm long (23 strips/m(2)) that allow the shower front reconstruction with a high space-time resolution.

40|$|The CMS {{detector}} at LHC {{is equipped}} with a high precision electromagnetic crystal calorimeter (ECAL). The crystals experience a transparency change when exposed to radiation during LHC operation, which recovers in absents of irradiation on the time scale of hours. This change of the crystal response is monitored with a laser system which performs a transparency measurement of each crystal of the ECAL within twenty minutes. The monitoring data is analyzed on a PC farm attached to the <b>central</b> <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>system</b> of CMS. After analyzing the raw data, a reduced data set is stored in the Online Master Data Base (OMDS) which is connected to the online computing infrastructure of CMS. The data stored in OMDS, representing the largest data set stored in OMDS for ECAL, contains all necessary information to perform a detailed crystal response monitoring as well as an analysis of the dynamics of the transparency change. For the CMS physics event data reconstruction, only a reduced set of information from the transparency measurement is required. This data is stored in the offline Reconstruction Conditions data base (ORCOF). To transfer the data from the OMDS to ORCOF, the reduced data is transferred to Off-line Reconstruction Conditions DB On-line subset (ORCON) in a procedure known as Online to Offline transfer, which includes various checks for data consistency.

The DST includes nine canister-sized containers with thirty operating heaters each located within the heated drift (HD) and fifty wing heaters located in boreholes in both ribs with a total power output of nominally 210 kW.

The first 38 m of the 50 -m long Heated Drift (HD) is dedicated to collection of data that will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the complex coupled TMHC processes in the host rock of the proposed repository. The final 12 m is dedicated to evaluating the interactions between the heated rock mass and cast-in-place (CIP) concrete ground support systems at elevated temperatures.
