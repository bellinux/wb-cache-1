40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of future networks {{is becoming a}} significant and urgent issue, calling for greener network designs. At the same time, rapid development of wireless networks shows a trend of increasing complexity in network structure and resource space, leading to that optimizing the {{energy efficiency}} of such networks requires a joint solution over multi-dimensional resource space. However, the <b>coupled</b> <b>resource</b> dimensions and growing problem scales bring great challenges in obtaining the optimal solutions. In this paper, we develop a multi-dimensional network model {{on the basis of}} tuple-links associated with transmission patterns (TPs) and formulate the optimization problem as a TP based scheduling problem which jointly solves transmission scheduling, routing, power control, radio and channel assignment. In order to tackle the complexity issues raised from <b>coupled</b> <b>resource</b> dimensions, we propose a novel algorithm that decomposes the coupling scheduling and power control by exploiting the delay column generation technique to recursively solve a master problem for scheduling and a sub-problem for power allocation. Further, we theoretically prove that the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and the optimum is upper bounded by that for the sub-problem solution, where the latter is derived by solving a relaxed version of the sub-problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-dimensional framework and the benefit of the proposed joint optimization in improving network energy efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Modern mobile {{platforms}} are embracing {{not only}} heterogeneous but also loosely <b>coupled</b> computational <b>resources.</b> For instance, a smartphone usually incorporates multiple processor cores {{that have no}} hardware cache coherence. Loosely <b>coupled</b> <b>resources</b> allow {{a high degree of}} resource heterogeneity that can greatly improve system energy efficiency {{for a wide range of}} mobile workloads. However, loosely <b>coupled</b> <b>resources</b> create application programming difficulty: both resources and program state are distributed, which call for explicit communication for consistency. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the large numbers of mobile developers and mobile applications. In order to ease application programming over loosely <b>coupled</b> <b>resources,</b> in this thesis work we explore system support [...] at both user level and OS level [...] that bridges desirable programming abstractions with the underlying hardware. We study three loosely coupled architectures widely seen in mobile computing: i) a smartphone accompanied by wearable sensors, ii) a mobile device encompassing multiple processors that share no memory, and iii) a mobile System-on-Chip (SoC) with multiple cores sharing incoherent memory. In order to address the three architectures, this thesis contributes three closely related research projects. In project Dandelion, we propose a Remote Method Invocation scheme to hide communication details from application components that are synchronizing over wireless links. In project Reflex, we design an energy-efficient software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) to automatically keep user state consistent; the DSM always employs a low-power processor to host shared memory objects in order to maximize sleep periods of high-power processors. In project K 2, we identify and apply a shared-most OS model to construct a single OS image over loosely coupled processor cores. Following the shared-most model, high-level OS services (e. g., device drivers and file systems) are mostly unmodified with their state transparently kept consistent; low-level OS services (e. g., page allocator) are implemented as separate instances with independent state for the sake of minimum communication overhead. We report the research prototypes, our experiences in building them, and the experimental measurements. We discuss future directions, in particular how our principles in treating loosely <b>coupled</b> <b>resources</b> can be used for improving other key system aspects, such as scalability...|$|R

40|$|Beamforming with {{adaptive}} antenna arrays is {{the most}} promising means for increasing data rates of wireless systems, since it enables channel reuse by several users in a cell through space division multiple access (SDMA). In SDMA, multiple beams are formed towards different users, each beam by a dedicated transceiver. However, the use of adaptive antenna arrays at the physical layer mandates significant modifications for higher layers. Joint consideration of beamforming and higher layer issues is {{required in order to}} fully exploit the benefits of SDMA. Moreover, adoption of the popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique creates additional challenges when the number of beams that can be formed at the transmitter is bounded. This issue is attributed to transceiver resource limitations and gives rise to a <b>coupled</b> <b>resource</b> allocation problem, that of assigning transceiver hardware units and OFDM subcarriers for transmission to users. Different users can be served either with the same beam from a transceiver and different subcarriers or with different beams and the same subcarriers. We characterize the problem and propose meaningful heuristic algorithms for beamforming and assignment of subcarriers and transceivers to users. The objective is to increase achievable system rate and ensure QoS in the form of minimum rate guarantees. The criteria for resource assignment and beam formation are based on spatial separability properties of users, beam vector cross-correlations and induced interference. Numerical results quantify the performance benefits of these cross-layer techniques and provide useful insights and design guidelines for realistic systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

In the present dissertation, I sampled the food web of Cumberland Sound, Nunavut during summer (August) and winter (April) of 2007 - 2009 and used stable isotopes (SI: d 15 N, d 13 C) and fatty acids (FA) to identify whether this arctic food web exhibited the following structures: 1) spatial <b>resource</b> <b>coupling,</b> 2) individual diet specialization and 3) temporal <b>resource</b> <b>coupling.</b> I first identified that the FA profile of a key arctic herbivore (Calanus hyperboreus) consistently differed between summer and winter over two years (e. g. higher 18 : 1 n- 9 in winters vs. summers), which aided {{in the interpretation of}} FAs in upper trophic levels. I then tested for the presence of spatial <b>resource</b> <b>coupling</b> in the summer food web. Based on d 15 N-derived trophic positions and d 13 C-derived % reliance on phytoplankton (vs. macroalgae), lower trophic levels fed predominantly on one of two resources and upper trophic levels used multiple resources, supporting the existence of spatial <b>resource</b> <b>coupling.</b> Following a preliminary analysis comparing Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) and prey FAs, inter-tissue differences in Greenland shark 22 : 5 n- 3 among muscle, liver and plasma revealed that some individual sharks fed on consistent resources, but that the extent of individual diet specialization varied over time. Individual Greenland sharks were therefore concluded to feed as generalists, which is consistent with the finding that Cumberland Sound consumers acted as spatial resource couplers. Finally, SIs and FAs revealed that ~ 50 % of Cumberland Sound species switched their diet between summer and winter. A literature review confirmed this temporal <b>resource</b> <b>coupling</b> by consumers on a pan-arctic scale. Overall, structures of an arctic food web agreed with those predicted by recent food web theory, such that spatial and temporal variability in resource abundance and consumer feeding behaviour are likely important for arctic food web persistence. In this context, any result of climate warming that acts to synchronize resource dynamics or remove consumer <b>resource</b> <b>coupling</b> could decrease the persistence of arctic food webs...|$|R
