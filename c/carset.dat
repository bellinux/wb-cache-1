50|$|It {{was loaded}} on a truck/trailer flatbed {{and arrived at}} Harvey Shop at the Hillcrest Complex a few days later. Car 4400 {{was the first of}} three test {{vehicles}} delivered for testing and technology verification. The <b>carset</b> has the same number as the wooden mockup car. The new vehicle was unveiled to the public at the TTC's Hillcrest complex during a media conference on November 15, 2012.|$|E
50|$|Another {{breakthrough}} {{came with}} {{possibly the most}} used editor {{in the history of}} the game. Steven Young's GP2edit added an unrivaled easy-access <b>carset</b> maker. The simple UI and the range of the program meant that anyone could use it without prior knowledge or having to use multiple programs. As more versions were released, the programs power increased. Menu helmets, ingame helmets, sounds, pit-crew colours, track textures & adverts, team & driver performance, camera angles, tyres and even the number position on the car could be edited.|$|E
40|$|Carbody {{compression}} resistance {{is a major}} LRV safety feature in head-on collisions. Regrettably, one of the difficulties in writing LRV specifications has been establishing credible values for the design compression loads that the carbody shall demonstrate to resist. One reason for this difficulty is that setting compression loads involves judgment and therefore is to a great degree subjective. The other is that vehicle engineers have been setting design compression loads in relative isolation from each other, {{without the benefit of}} a broader discussion among them. This paper will attempt to reconcile the various positions and, based on statistical data, will recommend median values for compression loads as a function of <b>carset</b> kinetic energy. This paper concerns establishing LRV design compression (buffload) values, the work done for the ASME RT 1 (LRV Structural Safety Standard) Committee. The starting assumptions have been as follows: 1. Build the investigation on as broad a statistical database as possible. 2. Analyze the issue of buffloads using the Cartesian system of coordinates, with buffloads on the vertical (Y) axis, and the kinetic energies of vehicle carsets on the horizontal (X) axis. 3. Follow a self-evident premise that smaller and slower passenger carsets have lower energies and buffloads, while bigger and faster ones have higher energies and buffloads. 4. Advance the proposition that the energy-buffload diagram (Fig. 1) should be a continuous line, rather than a set of randomly scattered points. Items (3) and (4) above are crucial to accepting the premises of the argument that follows...|$|E
500|$|... 9900 and 9901-9903 were {{articulated}} trainsets, {{with common}} trucks (Jacobs bogies) between each car. This caused operating problems, as train lengths {{could not be}} changed for demand and any single failure affected the entire train. All following power units were separate from their train, although four more articulated and semi-articulated <b>carsets</b> were built.|$|R
50|$|As {{previously}} noted, {{the game}} contained many real-life drivers. This was {{in stark contrast}} to early releases, which usually featured a single real-life personality and a bevy of fictional drivers. The game was also the first stock car racing simulator to include real sponsors on their respective cars. Alcohol and tobacco sponsors were removed, but alternate <b>carsets</b> from fans restored many of these.|$|R
