5|$|The {{design was}} {{reviewed}} by the Commission of Fine Arts, and in an April 29, 1976, letter, <b>Commission</b> <b>member</b> J. Carter Brown praised the design: I believe {{this would be a}} superb design for United States Coinage, rooted as it is in a great tradition, being based on the 'Liberty Cap cent' of 1794, following Augustin Dupré's Libertas Americana medal commemorating Saratoga and Yorktown (1777–1781).|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales {{was invited to}} lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was laid by <b>commission</b> <b>member</b> Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to {{pedestrians}} in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton City Commission is {{composed}} of the mayor and four city commissioners. Each city <b>commission</b> <b>member</b> is elected at-large on a non-partisan basis for four-year, overlapping terms. All policy items are decided by the City Commission, which is empowered by the City Charter to pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations, and appoint the city manager. The city manager is responsible for budgeting and implementing policies and initiatives. Dayton was the first large American city to adopt the city manager form of municipal government, in 1913.|$|E

50|$|The Constitution prohibits {{judges and}} justices from serving on any Commission, and disqualifies <b>Commission</b> <b>members</b> from being {{appointed}} to judicial office {{until two years}} after they leave the Commission. It also sets the term of office of <b>Commission</b> <b>members</b> at four years.|$|R
50|$|Members of the Planning Commission are {{appointed}} by the City Council. <b>Commission</b> <b>members</b> are to represent {{the interests of the}} community and evaluate development applications based on established City Codes and State Statutes. Planning <b>Commission</b> <b>members</b> must be City residents, and they are unpaid volunteers.|$|R
5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with <b>Commission</b> <b>member</b> and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a <b>Commission</b> <b>Member</b> or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

25|$|Becky Lourey, State Senator from senate {{district}} 8 since 1997, former State Representative from legislative districts 8B (1993-97) and 14B (1991-93), businesswoman, activist, and homemaker. Lourey {{lost the}} DFL endorsement race to Mike Hatch, {{but continued to}} seek the DFL nomination in the primary election.

While the plan was created over 570 days, residents have only been provided a 24-day window, during the holiday season, for comments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commission</b> <b>member</b> Henry Snell {{signed the}} report but added a Note of Reservation. Although he was {{satisfied}} that the Mufti was not directly responsible for the violence or had connived at it, he believed the Mufti {{was aware of the}} nature of the anti-Zionist campaign and the danger of disturbances. He therefore attributed to the Mufti a greater share of the blame than the official report had. Snell also disagreed with the commission on matters of Jewish immigration, and did not support restrictions on Jewish land purchases. Regarding the immediate causes of the outbreak, Snell agreed with the main findings of the commission.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} protesters, Social Security Institute workers Roberto López Hernández and nurse and APPO safety <b>commission</b> <b>member</b> Jorge Alberto Beltrán, {{were killed when}} about 3,500 federal police and 3000 {{military}} police removed protesters in downtown Oaxaca's Zócalo, with a backup of 5,000 army troops waiting just outside the city. The police forces were met with resistance from protesters and Radio APPO reported police raids (which were denied by the federal government) on activists' homes, helicopters dropped chemical grenades (apparently tear gas) on protesters who had been pushed from the Zócalo. There were multiple unconfirmed reports of a young teenager, but rather a twelve-year old child, shot in the streets near Puente Tecnológico; the boy's body was reportedly taken by police. There have been some deaths according to local media, and while the APPO claims 'dozens' of deaths, the exact number is yet unknown. Protests continued, with sporadic clashes occurring around the Zócalo, which is held by Federal forces.|$|E

25|$|On October 15, 1976, Carlo Gambino {{died of a}} heart attack. With Gambino gone, Bruno {{lost his}} most {{important}} ally in the underworld. Many of Bruno's subordinates felt that they were missing out on money because of Bruno's old-fashioned and content ways. His consigliere Antonio Caponigro approached Genovese family boss Frank Tieri in order to seek the Commission's permission to kill Bruno and take over the crime family. Tieri, sensing an opportunity to take Caponigro's north New Jersey rackets, lied to Caponigro and told him he had the Commission's support. On March 21, 1980, Bruno was shot {{in the back of the}} head while in his car by a gunman working for Caponigro. That April, Caponigro visited New York City under the assumption that he was going to be confirmed as boss. Instead, he was tortured and murdered for killing a <b>Commission</b> <b>member</b> without permission. Caponigro's co-conspirators Frank Sindone and John Simone were also murdered in 1980.|$|E
25|$|King {{served as}} an elected county <b>commission</b> <b>member</b> in Fulton County, Georgia, the county {{encompassing}} most of Atlanta, from 1987 to 1993. He was defeated for reelection after revealing that he owed the federal government more than $200,000 in back taxes and fines. Also in 1993, King helped found the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., the company that manages the license of Martin Luther King Jr.'s image and intellectual property. King remains a commissioner in the company as of 2008. During his service as a commissioner in Fulton County, King expressed appreciation to an officer who potentially saved his mother from harm from a crazed man. In February 2009, King and his wife traveled to India, fifty years after {{his father and mother}} made the trip. During his stay in India, King led a delegation, which included John Lewis and Andrew Young. In New Delhi, King visited museums on Mahatma Gandhi's life and answered questions from students. King denounced the war in Iraq and the Mumbai attacks during a lecture at the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.|$|E

500|$|On July 14, 1931, Assistant Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly {{wrote to}} Moore, asking the Commission's advice on a design {{competition}} for the new quarter. [...] Moore replied, stating that as Fraser had won the {{competition for the}} medal, she should adapt her design for the quarter. [...] Secretary Mellon responded to Moore, stating that as the Treasury had been no party to the earlier design agreement, it was not bound by it, and would not follow it. [...] The Treasury proceeded to hold a design competition, and when the Fine Arts Commission met to consider the submitted designs in an advisory role, it selected those submitted by Fraser. [...] The designs were submitted to Mellon in November 1931; he selected Flanagan's design and notified Moore of the decision. [...] Moore and <b>commission</b> <b>member</b> Adolph Weinman (who had designed the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar) attempted to get Mellon to change his mind, but only got him to agree to allow the various sculptors more time to improve their entries—they had asked for more time just for Fraser. [...] On January 20, 1932, following resubmissions, the commission affirmed its support of the Fraser designs.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon's 1798 {{campaign}} in Egypt came at (and helped cause) {{the beginning of}} a burst of Egyptomania in Europe, and especially France. [...] A corps of 167 technical experts (savants), known as the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, accompanied the French expeditionary army to Egypt. On [...] 1799, French soldiers under the command of Colonel d'Hautpoul were strengthening the defences of Fort Julien, a couple of miles north-east of the Egyptian port city of Rosetta (modern-day Rashid). Lieutenant Pierre-François Bouchard spotted a slab with inscriptions on one side that the soldiers had uncovered. He and d'Hautpoul saw at once that it might be important and informed General Jacques-François Menou, who happened to be at Rosetta. The find was announced to Napoleon's newly founded scientific association in Cairo, the Institut d'Égypte, in a report by <b>Commission</b> <b>member</b> Michel Ange Lancret noting that it contained three inscriptions, the first in hieroglyphs and the third in Greek, and rightly suggesting that the three inscriptions were versions of the same text. Lancret's report, dated [...] 1799, was read to a meeting of the Institute soon after [...] Bouchard, meanwhile, transported the stone to Cairo for examination by scholars. Napoleon himself inspected what had already begun to be called la Pierre de Rosette, the Rosetta Stone, shortly before his return to France in August 1799.|$|E
