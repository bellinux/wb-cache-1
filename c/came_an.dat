5|$|The {{civil war}} {{did not end}} there; Matthew Cantacuzenus now {{obtained}} troops from Orhan and began a bid for taking Constantinople.

5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with them <b>came</b> <b>an</b> array of new features. One such item was called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. Sitting in a den surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up an unsuspecting viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true. The following week's Cloud 9 would then show how that person got on as the segment would be filmed in the week. Cloud 9 also used an edited version of Dreams (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
50|$|In a {{facsimile}} of {{the first}} part of the original manuscript, included in Singer of the Bush, a collection of Paterson's works published by Lansdowne Press in 1983, the first two verses appear as follows:Oh there once was a swagman camped in the billabong,Under the shade of a Coolibah tree,And he sang as he looked at the old billy boiling,Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me?Chorus:Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzin' Matilda my darling,Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzin' Matilda with me?Waltzing Matilda and leading <b>a</b> water bag,Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me?Down <b>came</b> <b>a</b> jumbuck to drink at the water hole,Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee,And he sang as he put him away in the tucker bag,You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzin' Matilda with me.Chorus:You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda my darling,You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me.Waltzing Matilda and leading <b>a</b> water bag,You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me.|$|R

5|$|The sixteenth {{stage was}} {{considered}} to be one of two queen stages, most difficult stages, of this Giro, as it contained many high mountain climbs and the Giro's most difficult summit stage finish. After the second rest day <b>came</b> <b>an</b> unusual stage, one that was very short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for the third step on the Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.|$|E
5|$|The {{stallion}} Dyoll Starlight {{was credited}} with being the foundation sire of the modern breed, and {{was a combination of}} Welsh and Arab breeding. From his line <b>came</b> <b>an</b> influential stallion of the Section B type: Tan-y-Bwlch Berwyn. This stallion was sired by a Barb and out of a mare from the Dyoll Starlight line. Influential stallions on the Section C and D bloodlines include: Trotting Comet, foaled in 1840 {{from a long line of}} trotting horses; True Briton, foaled in 1930, by a trotting sire and out of an Arab mare; Cymro Llwyd, foaled in 1850, by an Arab stallion and out of a trotting mare; and Alonzo the Brave, foaled in 1866, tracing his ancestry through the Hackney breed to the Darley Arabian.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, <b>came</b> <b>an</b> unusual string of {{reckless}} challenges from Toronto right back, Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was carded for a reckless challenge on Andy Najar, and a minute later was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute that United were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 thanks a goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E

5|$|PedroI's {{successor}} in Brazil was his five-year-old son, PedroII. As {{the latter}} was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from {{the absence of a}} ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, PedroII, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under PedroII's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development <b>came</b> <b>an</b> influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{moved from}} New York to California in November 1946, {{continuing}} to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances {{on the show}} to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested {{using some of the}} folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes <b>came</b> <b>an</b> interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.|$|E

60|$|Steadily, inevitably <b>came</b> <b>a</b> {{brilliant}} line, <b>came</b> <b>a</b> thin edge of intolerable effulgence {{that took}} a circular shape, became a bow, became a blazing sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us {{as though it was}} a spear.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> {{moment later}} <b>came</b> <b>a</b> {{gust of wind}} that almost lifted them from their feet. The trees of the forest were bent lower than ever, and amid the {{whistling}} of the tornado <b>came</b> <b>a</b> crack {{like that of a}} big pistol.|$|R

60|$|Forward {{went the}} Army of Red, {{throwing}} snowballs wildly. Then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> shower of balls in return, {{and several of}} the Reds were seen to fall, as if knocked down. Then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> pause, and several lads started to go back.|$|R

25|$|In 1987 the {{existing}} Ward 1 of Ealing Hospital, built as an infectious disease isolation unit was reopened {{as the first}} NHS hospice in the country, all earlier hospices being charities.

25|$|Mawson's {{ideas of}} global glaciation, however, {{were based on}} the mistaken {{assumption}} that the geographic position of Australia, and that of other continents where low-latitude glacial deposits are found, has remained constant through time. With the advancement of the continental drift hypothesis, and eventually plate tectonic theory, <b>came</b> <b>an</b> easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments — they were deposited at a point in time when the continents were at higher latitudes.|$|E
25|$|Lone racing {{against the}} clock was a British {{speciality}} and in 1932 Frank Southall came sixth in the Olympic Games cycling road race in Los Angeles when it was run that way. But then <b>came</b> <b>an</b> announcement that henceforth the Olympics would be run as a massed-start event, a form of racing which (see below) the British cycling authorities had banned since the 19th century and at which British riders therefore had no experience.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of the tempest there <b>came</b> <b>a</b> sudden lull. Wind and water alike seemed hushed. And out of the lull, as if in answer to the woman's question, there <b>came</b> <b>a</b> loud cry--the shriek of a man in deadly peril.|$|R

25|$|With this {{increase}} in population and availability of labor <b>came</b> <b>an</b> increase in labor specialization. What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as Uruk, and the first civilizations, such as Sumer, is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, {{and the need for}} collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation, are all thought to have played a role.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, Jones {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} play for the USA team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He played alongside teammate Brian McCann.

As reported by CBC News on March 13, 2009, Jones criticized Toronto and the play schedule of the World Baseball Classic.|$|E
25|$|Woodstock {{was founded}} in 1854 and has been on its current campus since 1856.

By 1928, a full American coeducational programme had been introduced at Woodstock. In 1959, Woodstock was the third high school outside North America and the first school in Asia to receive US accreditation through the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.|$|E
