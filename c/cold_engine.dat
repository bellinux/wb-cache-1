2500|$|High ethanol blends {{present a}} problem to achieve enough vapor {{pressure}} for the fuel to evaporate and spark the ignition during cold weather (since ethanol tends to increase fuel enthalpy of vaporization). When vapor pressure is below 45 kPa starting a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> becomes difficult. To avoid this problem at temperatures below , and to reduce ethanol higher emissions during cold weather, both the US and the European markets adopted E85 as the maximum blend {{to be used in}} their flexible fuel vehicles, and they are optimized to run at such a blend. At places with harsh cold weather, the ethanol blend in the US has a seasonal reduction to E70 for these very cold regions, though it is still sold as E85. At places where temperatures fall below [...] during the winter, it is recommended to install an engine heater system, both for gasoline and E85 vehicles. Sweden has a similar seasonal reduction, but the ethanol content in the blend is reduced to E75 during the winter months.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>engines</b> also {{typically}} {{require more}} fuel and a richer mixture when first started (see: cold start injector), because fuel does not vaporize as well when cold and therefore requires more fuel to properly [...] "saturate" [...] the air. Rich mixtures also burn slower and decrease {{the risk of}} spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) when the engine is under load. However, rich mixtures sharply increase carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.|$|R
50|$|Glow plugs {{are needed}} for a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> start on diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because {{in order to}} run smoothly, a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> requires different timing and fuel mixture than an engine at operating temperature.|$|E
50|$|The tumble flaps {{are also}} {{actuated}} to improve <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> idling. During scavenging the flaps are opened {{in order to}} draw much fresh air into the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the poor {{performance}} of <b>cold</b> car <b>engines</b> is that parts have inefficiently large spacings until the normal operating temperature is achieved.|$|R

50|$|Bernoulli's principle, {{which is}} a {{function}} of the velocity of the fluid, is a dominant effect for large openings and large flow rates, but since fluid flow at small scales and low speeds (low Reynolds number) is dominated by viscosity, Bernoulli's principle is ineffective at idle or slow running and in the very small carburetors of the smallest model engines. Small model engines have flow restrictions ahead of the jets to reduce the pressure enough to suck the fuel into the air flow. Similarly the idle and slow running jets of large carburetors are placed after the throttle valve where the pressure is reduced partly by viscous drag, rather than by Bernoulli's principle. The most common rich mixture device for starting <b>cold</b> <b>engines</b> was the choke, which works on the same principle.|$|R
50|$|Carburetor heat uses hot air {{drawn from}} the heat {{exchanger}} or heat stove (a metal plate around the exhaust manifold) to raise {{the temperature in the}} venturi section high enough to prevent or remove any ice buildup. Because hot air is less dense than <b>cold</b> air, <b>engine</b> power will drop when carburetor heat is used.|$|R
50|$|Fuel Primer Pump - A {{manual pump}} {{to add a}} small amount of fuel at the {{cylinder}} intakes to assist in starting a <b>cold</b> <b>engine.</b> Fuel injected engines do not have this control. For fuel injected engines, a fuel boost pump is used to prime the engine prior to start.|$|E
50|$|Emissions (in g/start) {{accounting}} for the elevated emission level when starting a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> (for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles only). Excess emissions are given as {{a difference between the}} total emissions after the engine start (at ambient conditions) and the emission at operating temperature. The factors are available for typical, country-specific temperature distributions and behavioural parameters (such as trip length distributions and parking time distributions).|$|E
50|$|In 1973 Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen had {{to remove}} ambient {{temperature}} switches which affected emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating {{and said that}} strategies like enriching fuel mixture during <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> warm-up periods could reduce overall pollution. The switches were ordered removed from production but cars already on the road {{did not have to}} be recalled, and fines were relatively modest.|$|E
60|$|The car {{was nearly}} empty: save {{here and there}} the wide-awake Western drummer, and a woman with four fretful children, the train was as deserted as it was frightfully <b>cold.</b> The <b>engine</b> shrieked warningly at intervals, the train rumbled hollowly over short bridges and across pikes, swung round the hills, and plunged with wild {{warnings}} past little towns hid in the snow, with only {{here and there a}} light shining dimly.|$|R
50|$|Diesel engines {{by their}} nature {{do not have}} {{concerns}} with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, {{they can be very}} hard to start when cold. Various techniques are used to start a <b>cold</b> Diesel <b>engine,</b> the most common being the use of a glow plug.|$|R
50|$|It was {{intended}} to have a mass of 400 kilograms when fully fueled, including two upper stages to propel it from low Earth orbit onto a trajectory towards the Moon. The lander itself had a monopropellant <b>cold</b> rocket <b>engine,</b> fuelled by hydrogen peroxide, which was to slow its descent towards {{the surface of the}} Moon. The target landing site was Montes Carpatus. The spacecraft was designed to travel 500 metres after landing, in order to explore its landing site.|$|R
5000|$|The cold-cranking {{simulator}} {{was designed}} as a method of determining the low temperature performance of lubricants, in the specific condition of [...] "cold cranking" [...] - i.e. starting a <b>cold</b> <b>engine.</b> In this condition, the only energy available to turn the engine comes from the starter motor and the battery, and it has been widely assumed that the system acts as a constant power viscometer.|$|E
5000|$|Rich {{air-fuel ratio}} {{requirement}} in cold engines: When a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> is started, the fuel does not vaporize completely, creating higher emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, which diminishes {{only as the}} engine reaches operating temperature. The duration of this start-up phase has been reduced by advances in materials and technology, including computer-controlled fuel injection, shorter intake lengths, and pre-heating of fuel and/or inducted air.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{separate}} {{fuel economy}} tests simulate city driving and highway driving: the [...] "city" [...] driving program or Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or (UDDS) or FTP-72 {{is defined in}} [...] and consists of starting with a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> and making 23 stops {{over a period of}} 31 minutes for an average speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) and with a top speed of 56 mph (90 km/h).|$|E

When he reduced power and began to descend, because of the extreme <b>cold,</b> the <b>engine</b> flamed out, and Boulet performed the highest ever, power off, full touch down autorotation, landing with absolutely no power. This high altitude autorotation also set a new world record.|$|R
40|$|Combustion engine {{friction}} {{and with this}} engine overall efficiency shows a strong temperature dependency. Generally, engines have lower frictional losses at their optimum operating temperature compared to <b>cold</b> <b>engines</b> in their heat up phase. Combustion engines, used in vehicle powertrains, often are not operated at their optimum temperature and thus offer a considerable fuel consumption potential by optimising the heterogeneous engine temperature distribution and with this by optimising engine internal heat flows. Interventions to control these heat flows by {{taking into account the}} entire powertrain are referred to as thermal management. In the scope of this work, two complex simulation models were developed with which various thermal management measures were evaluated for a compressor charged 1. 8 l gasoline engine placed in a middle class vehicle. These thermal management measures are applied on the engine cooling and lubrication system. Splitcooling, an additional coolant volume, a variable coolant and oil pump with switchable piston cooling jets and the effect of start/stop operation on the thermal system is investigated. For a number of different driving cycles, the energy distribution was gained and quantified in detail. All laws, needed to describe this energy distribution, are validated with test bench data and given for each internal and external engine heat interaction...|$|R
40|$|Objectives are to: (1) Investigate novel {{engine control}} {{strategies}} targeted at rapid engine/catalyst warming {{for the purpose}} of mitigating tailpipe emissions from plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) exposed to multiple <b>engine</b> <b>cold</b> start events; and (2) Validate and optimize hybrid supervisory control techniques developed during previous and on-going research projects by integrating them into the vehicle level control system and complementing them with the modified engine control strategies in order to further reduce emissions during both <b>cold</b> start and <b>engine</b> re-starts. Approach used are: (1) Perform a literature search of engine control strategies used in conventional powertrains to reduce cold start emissions; (2) Develop an open source engine controller providing full access to engine control strategies in order to implement new engine/catalyst warm-up behaviors; (3) Modify <b>engine</b> <b>cold</b> start control algorithms and characterize impact on cold start behavior; and (4) Develop an experimental Engine-In-the-Loop test stand in order to validate control methodologies and verify transient thermal behavior and emissions of the real engine when combined with a virtual hybrid powertrain. Some major accomplishments are: (1) Commissioned a prototype engine controller on a GM Ecotec 2. 4 l direct injected gasoline engine on an engine test cell at the University of Tennessee. (2) Obtained from Bosch (with GM's approval) an open calibration engine controller for a GM Ecotec LNF 2. 0 l Gasoline Turbocharged Direct Injection engine. Bosch will support the bypass of cold start strategies if calibration access proves insufficient. The LNF engine and its open controller were commissioned on an engine test cell at ORNL. (3) Completed a literature search to identify key <b>engine</b> <b>cold</b> start control parameters and characterized their impact on the real engine using the Bosch engine controller to calibrate them. (4) Ported virtual hybrid vehicle model from offline simulation environment to real-time Hardware-In-the-Loop platform...|$|R
50|$|In worst cases, {{the excess}} fuel can foul spark plugs, {{sometimes}} necessitating their cleaning or replacement before the engine will start. This {{is most likely}} to occur on a carbureted engine in cold weather, after a running engine has been shut off briefly before being restarted. Doing so can cause the choke to configure the mixture for a <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> start, despite higher actual temperatures, resulting in an overly rich mixture and flooded engine.|$|E
5000|$|The 1963 Impala {{featured}} rectilinear styling with an engine-turned aluminum rear taillight panel {{surrounded by}} a chrome border on SS models. Engine choice was similar to 1962, with the small-block 283 and 327 cuin L V8s most popular. The Sport Sedan featured a new, creased roof line. A new [...] "coved" [...] instrument panel with simple indicator lights for hot and <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> conditions. An optional factory tachometer was built into the dashboard, just above the steering wheel; it was rarely ordered.|$|E
50|$|To {{eliminate}} the need of NOx and particulate treatment in contemporary diesel engines, the cylinder compression ratio is reduced to 14.0:1. <b>Cold</b> <b>engine</b> start is achieved via multi-hole piezo injectors with 3 programmable injection patterns, and adoption of ceramic glow plugs. Engine misfiring is prevented via variable valve lift at exhaust, which opens exhaust valves during the intake stroke, which increases engine air temperature. The SKYACTIV-D also uses a two-stage turbocharger, in which one small and one large turbo are selectively operated, according to driving conditions.|$|E
