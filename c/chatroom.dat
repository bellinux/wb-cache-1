40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} adolescents’ motivations, habits and attitudes {{in the use}} of internet <b>chatrooms.</b> 128 São Paulo High School and University students answered a specially devised questionnaire. Results showed no significant gender differences concerning the reasons for using <b>chatrooms.</b> The most frequent motivations were “having fun” and “meeting people”. More female subjects admitted to relying on ficticious characters when interacting in <b>chatrooms,</b> while more male subjects considered it easier to disclose personal matters in <b>chatrooms</b> than in face-to-face interactions (they seem to feel more protected in the virtual space). Most participants tended not to use <b>chatrooms</b> in order to solve personal problems, although one fourth of the sample recognized that the chats contributed to learning about oneself. As a conclusion, <b>chatrooms</b> are mainly seen as an environment for having fun, unable to foster a significantly different type of communication from the one(s) established in face-to-face interactions.   Keywords: internet; communication; adolescence...|$|R

Results revealed a strong relationship between victimization in school and victimization in internet chatrooms; school victims are significantly more often chat victims. Furthermore, the predictors of chat and school victimization show both commonalities (gender, self-concept, child-parent relationship) and differences (social integration, popularity, and bullying behavior) ...|$|R

500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City <b>chatroom</b> that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I think they just never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E

The design and interface of gizmo was outsourced to two design companies, Good Dog Design and Naima Productions.

From there, users could create their own game channel that would be displayed to everyone. They could also join a created game. [...] The lobby would show a list of rooms, ordered from least to most latency. Green rooms indicate games that were fast enough to be playable, while red rooms were unplayable. The rocket icon indicated the game had been launched. This would bring them to a second private <b>chatroom</b> before entering the game. The channel creator acted as the moderator, who could launch the game and ban players in the lobby as well as change game settings, but could also make someone else a moderator. In some games like Quake, you could join the game after it was launched, but for most you could not.|$|E

2500|$|... was {{released}} in 2002 and its expansion pack, , {{was released}} in 2003. The release of these two games brought with them {{a number of new}} features to the online service. The most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of Anonymous Matchmaking. This feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press a button and automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill (based on ranking) and also wanted to play a game. This allowed for people to get into games quickly and easily. It also reduced win-trading, where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder. The matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called [...] "Arranged Teams". In an arranged team game, you could make a team with one or more friends, which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank. However, a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated 'fair' matchups, called 'Abusing', simply by someone losing the Arranged Team Games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally (who wants to gain wins easily) won't find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players. Automated tournaments were added in the expansion, where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day. In addition to the new game styles, a slew of other features were added including selectable <b>chatroom</b> icons unlocked based on the player's number of wins, a friends list, and clan support.|$|E
