25|$|Abrahams {{is badly}} beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last {{chance for a}} medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is {{overcome}} that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected {{for the sake of}} running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a fine}} {{balance that}} needs to be {{maintained}} between research and improvement in safety and quality in health care - when do we need more research and when <b>can</b> we just <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> it? The moral imperative to improve care may have been a distractor, preventing adequate attention to research. Three research areas are proposed as current priorities for patient safety: getting evidence into practice, measurement of safety, and the evaluation of complex interventions. A focus on these areas should ensure that research becomes more central to the process of making health care safer. 8 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|In 2008-2009, Nottinghamshire Police ran a {{successful}} pilot of Pegasus, a database containing {{the details of}} people with physical and learning disabilities or mental health problems, who have registered with the force because their disabilities {{make it difficult for}} them to give spoken details when calling the police. Those registered on the database are issued with a personal identification number (PIN) that can be used in two ways. By phone - either 999 or the force's non-emergency 101 number can be used - once a person is put through to the control room, they only need to say [...] "Pegasus" [...] and their PIN. Their details can then be retrieved from the database and the caller <b>can</b> quickly <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> explaining why they have called.

The young man remembers and grows sullen; his strength comes back to him, and with it a sense of despair. His mind broods incessantly on the hateful future. As for the consolations of religion, he won't listen to them. Sister Agatha perseveres--oh, with what anxious solicitude!--in the attempt to make him understand and believe and be comforted. It is all so tremendously important, and in this case, somehow, more important than in any other.

60|$|No one {{doubts that}} an {{ordinary}} man <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> this world: but we demand not strength enough {{to get on with}} it, but strength enough to get it on. Can he hate it enough to change it, and yet love it enough to think it worth changing? Can he look up at its colossal good without once feeling acquiescence? Can he look up at its colossal evil without once feeling despair? Can he, in short, be at once not only a pessimist and an optimist, but a fanatical pessimist and a fanatical optimist? Is he enough of a pagan to die for the world, and enough of a Christian to die to it? In this combination, I maintain, it is the rational optimist who fails, the irrational optimist who succeeds. He is ready to smash the whole universe for the sake of itself.|$|E

I am jealous {{of the men in the}} city--I was jealous of the sanitary inspector the other day--because he talks with interest to them. I know he stays in the city later than he need. It is a relief to me to go out in the evening, or to have a few people here once or twice a week; but I am angry because I know it is a relief to him too. I am jealous even of that organ. How I hale those Bach fugues! Listen to the maddening thing twisting and rolling and racing and then mixing itself up into one great boom. He <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Bach: he can't get on with me. I have even condescended to be jealous of other women--of such women as Mrs. Saunders. He despises her: he plays with her as dexterously as she thinks she plays with him; but he likes to chat with her; and they rattle away for a whole evening without the least constraint. She has no conscience: she talks absolute nonsense about art and literature: she flirts even more disgustingly than she used to when she was Belle Woodward; but she is quickwitted, like most Irish people; and she enjoys a broad style of jesting which Ned is a great deal too tolerant of, though he would as soon die as indulge in it before me. Then there is Mrs. Scott, who is just as shrewd as Belle, and much cleverer. I have heard him ask her opinion as to whether he had acted well or not in some stroke of business--something that I had never heard of, of course. I wish I were half as hard and strong and self-reliant as she is. Her husband would be nothing without her." ...|$|E
5000|$|...Ski {{boots that}} are too stiff: Skiing in a boot that is too stiff can {{effectively}} limit how forward you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> your skis. <b>With</b> today's more up right ski boot stances, failure to properly flex a boot can almost force a skier into the back seat. When choosing a ski boot flex, make sure you can effectively flex the boot at room temperature, as it will only get stiffer {{with the onset of}} colder temperatures. Ideal flex on a four buckle boot is achieved when the middle buckles come in close proximity to each other but do not touch. Note however that stronger, more aggressive skiers can benefit from a stiffer flex boot especially if they consistently ski in a forward athletic position.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the demise}} of Extra Day For Riots, thrashLife formed Troublemake, a band {{consisting}} of himself as songwriter/singer/bassist and whichever friends he could gather up to record his songs or play shows. In contrast to Extra Day For Riots, Troublemake was warmly received by critics. Of the group's second EP, Feral, Jersey Beat wrote, [...] "Sloppy lo-fi bedroom recordings never sounded so good before" [...] and further praised [...] "the socially fitting and heartfelt lyrics, sung with emotion and angst." [...] Razorcake's similarly enthusiastic review of the band's split EP with Turkish Techno described Troublemake as [...] "a solid anathematic band, hailing from D.C., but making sounds in the Dillinger Four universe. This feels more produced than earlier songs—but with the strong, eager oomph they've always had—driving the songs with a spirit you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> board <b>with.</b> This {{is the kind of}} stuff that makes house parties pop, getting everyone to sing and scream together." [...] Much more of a project than an active band, Troublemake's only activity was recording sporadically in the years 2005, 2006, and 2008, and several shows in support of Rational Anthem during that band's tour in the summer of 2008.|$|R
