50|$|The {{dryer section}} of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper {{by way of a}} series of {{internally}} steam-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160 psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (<b>cylinder</b> <b>cap)</b> through a steam joint and condensate exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe. From the centre pipe the condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head. Wide machines require multiple siphons. In fast machines centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.|$|E
50|$|A typical blinky is a {{small metal}} two piece {{cylinder}} wide enough to accept a button cell battery with a very small etched circuit board on the face and threads on the open end, paired with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>cap</b> which screws on to seal and secure as one. The flashing LED circuit board face can be round and enclosed by cylinder, or a variety larger colored shapes such as logos that are glued to the outside face of the cylinder end. Common designs utilize a rubber ring gasket as an on/off switch - when placed between the batteries and circuit board inside the front cover, tightening the screw base deforms and flattens the gasket forcing the battery tip to contact {{the back of the}} printed circuit board which completes the circuit.|$|E
5000|$|The stair {{rises in}} one long flight to a {{transverse}} landing and returns {{in a short}} flight to the upper floor. The rail, however, curves into the transverse section, rather than continuing perpendicular to the runs of the stair. The delicate foliated stair brackets are thereby forced to constrict and form a frieze-like pattern on the curved section. The brackets are similar to ones illustrated in Owen Biddle [...] "The Young Carpenter's Assistant" [...] (1810). The molded handrail is supported by plain balusters that are square in section. The newel post is delicately fashioned and includes a block surmounted by a round urn-shaped section from which a round tapering column rises to a simple band below a <b>cylinder</b> <b>cap.</b> It is a handsome example of joinery and is related to ones at several other local houses including Mount Fair.|$|E

An earing profiles are develops during deep drawing of cylindrical cup {{due to the}} planar anisotropic properties of sheet. Therefore, the analysis of earing is important to evaluate and control the development of earing. This paper describes a simulation of the cold ironing process in the forming <b>cylinder</b> <b>cap.</b> The ironing process {{in this study was}} focused on the prediction of height increasing, earing and thinning. Two different materials of aluminum AA 5042 and AKDQ steel were selected for comparison. The results show that the increasing of cup height was in the same trend...|$|E

40|$|The angular {{function}} for {{elements of the}} Mueller matrix for polarized light scattering from suspensions of microorganisms {{is known to be}} reproducible for different growths of a given bacterial strain in the log (or exponential) phase of growth. The reason for this, the stability of the size and shape distribution for cells, is briefly discussed. Experiments were performed using suspensions of two different strains of Escherichia coli cells in log phase and measuring the angular dependence of the Mueller matrix ratio S 34 /S 11. Calculations were then performed using the coupled dipole approximation to model electromagnetic scattering from particles where the shape of an individual cell was approximated by a <b>cylinder</b> <b>capped</b> with hemispheres of the same radius as the cylinder. Using previously measured values for the length distribution and index of refraction of the cells, the calculated scattering curve was found to fit the measured curve very well. The values obtained for the cell diameters were quite close to diameters previously measured by optical microscopy. Thus this method provides a rapid and convenient method for monitoring bacterial diameters in vivo even when there is an appreciable distribution of bacterial lengths in the population...|$|R

40|$|The {{locations}} of volcanic islands may {{be controlled by}} thin or extending parts of the lithosphere over a partially molten asthenosphere (1, 2), by edge effects near the boundaries of thick cratonic lithosphere (3), or by narrow jets of hot mantle rising from deep within the mantle (4 - 6). Many hotspots are found on or near ridges, at lithospheric discontinuities, or in extensional environments, so high resolution seismic images are required {{to determine whether it}} is lithospheric structure, stresses in the lithosphere, or the deep mantle that is the controlling factor for the location of active volcanoes. In this study, we perform a simple experiment in which we use basic geometrical arguments and idealized experimental parameters {{in order to understand the}} resolution of tomographic images of the upper 400 km of the mantle under Iceland. Our results indicate that a narrow, deep seated mantle plume is not required in order to explain the observed travel time delays. Results of tomographic inversions are often viewed as unique; however, recent seismic studies of the Icelandic Hotspot have illustrated the non-unique nature of these models. The geometry of plumes in laboratory and computer simulations is a narrow <b>cylinder</b> <b>capped</b> by a bulbous head that flattens beneath the lithosphere, giving an overall mushroom shape to the upwelling (7 - 9).

40|$|The {{absorption}} spectra for a gold nanocube {{and for a}} gold nanobar are calculated by using the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). The results show the excitation of a single albeit broad surface plasmon (SP) band of the gold nanocube. The extinction {{cross section of the}} gold nanocube is dominated by the absorption cross section that gains importance as the width increases. Further increasing the nanocube size beyond 80 [*]nm will result in an optical response mainly characterized by scattering properties. The absorption spectrum of the nanobar shows the excitation of both the longitudinal mode (LM) and the transverse mode (TM). The nanobar is also compared to a <b>cylinder,</b> a spherically <b>capped</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and a spheroid of the same aspect ratio.

40|$|We perform Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to determine}} the average excluded volume of randomly oriented rectangular prisms, randomly oriented ellipsoids and randomly oriented <b>capped</b> <b>cylinders</b> in 3 -D.

In particular, for cubes, the percentage difference is 3. 92, far exceeding the bounds of statistical error in our simulation. Added in Revision 2 : We recently found the cause of the discrepancy between the simulation result and the analytic value of the excluded volume to be the effect of an error in our simulation code. Upon rectification of the simulation code, the simulation yields 11. 00 ± 0. 002 as the excluded volume of a pair of randomly oriented cubes of unit volume. The simulation also yields results as predicted by the analytic formula for all other cases of rectangular prisms that we study. Comment: Revised version: Corrections adde...|$|R
