25|$|Rotational {{angiography}} is {{a technique}} to acquire CT-like 3D images intraoperatively with a fixed <b>C-Arm.</b> To do that, the <b>C-Arm</b> is rotated around the patient, acquiring a series of projections that will be reconstructed to a 3D data set.|$|E
25|$|Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation {{requires}} exact {{positioning of}} the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root {{is considered to be}} optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the <b>C-arm</b> automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with <b>C-arm</b> CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the <b>C-arm</b> and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on <b>C-arm</b> CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.|$|E
25|$|Cone beam {{computed}} tomography (or CBCT, {{also referred to}} as <b>C-arm</b> CT, cone beam volume CT, or flat panel CT) is a medical imaging technique consisting of X-ray {{computed tomography}} where the X-rays are divergent, forming a cone.|$|E
25|$|Though imaging {{has been}} a {{standard}} part of the OR {{for a long time}} in the form of mobile <b>C-Arms,</b> ultrasound and endoscopy, these new minimally-invasive procedures require imaging techniques that can visualize smaller body parts such as thin vessels in the heart muscle and can be facilitated through intraoperative 3D imaging.|$|R
25|$|A hybrid {{operating}} {{room is a}} surgical theatre that is equipped with advanced medical imaging devices such as fixed <b>C-Arms,</b> CT scanners or MRI scanners. These imaging devices enable minimally-invasive surgery. Minimally-invasive surgery {{is intended to be}} less traumatic for the patient and minimize incisions on the patient and perform surgery procedure through one or several small cuts.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the wider}} field of {{computer-assisted}} surgery, image-guided surgery can take place in hybrid operating rooms using intraoperative imaging. A hybrid operating room is a surgical theatre that is equipped with advanced medical imaging devices such as fixed <b>C-Arms,</b> CT scanners or MRI scanners. Most image-guided surgical procedures are minimally invasive. A field of medicine that pioneered and specializes in minimally invasive image-guided surgery is interventional radiology.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} commercially {{available}} systems of <b>C-arm</b> CBCT in the US: DynaCT (Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany), XperCT (Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, the Netherlands), and Innova CT (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin). The systems differ {{with regard to}} their rotation time, number of projections acquired, image quality, and time required for reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{radiation}} is ionizing radiation, thus exposure is potentially harmful. Compared to a mobile <b>C-Arm,</b> which is classically used in surgery, CT scanners and fixed C-Arms {{work on a}} much higher energy level, which induces higher dose. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to monitor radiation dose applied in a hybrid OR both for the patient and the medical staff.|$|E
25|$|Improvements of the <b>C-Arm</b> {{technology}} nowadays also enable perfusion {{imaging and}} can visualize parenchymal blood volume in the OR. To do that, rotational angiography (3D-DSA) {{is combined with}} a modified injection protocol and a special reconstruction algorithm. The blood flow can then be visualized {{in the course of}} time. This can be useful in the treatments of patients suffering from ischemic stroke.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tool for}} {{decreasing}} dose is collimation. It {{may be that}} {{from the field of}} view provided by the detector, only a small part is interesting for the intervention. The x-ray tube can be shielded at the parts that are not necessary to be visible by a collimator, thus only sending dose to the detector for the body parts in question. Modern <b>C-Arms</b> enable to navigate on acquired images without constant fluoroscopy.|$|R
25|$|Fluoroscopy is {{performed}} with continuous X-ray {{to guide the}} progression of a catheter or other devices within the body in live images. To depict even fine anatomic structures and devices, brilliant image quality is required. In particular, in cardiac interventions, imaging the moving heart requires a high frame rate (30f/s, 50Hz) and high power output (at least 80kW). Image quality needed for cardiac applications can only be achieved by high powered fixed angiography systems, not with mobile <b>C-Arms.</b>|$|R
25|$|Small lung nodules {{identified}} on a thorax CT {{need to be}} examined for malignancy, thus a small portion of sample tissue is taken out in a needle procedure. The needle is advanced through the bronchial tree, or trans-thoracically, towards the position of the nodule. To make sure tissue is captured from the nodule as opposed to accidentally taking healthy lung tissue, imaging modalities such as mobile <b>C-Arms,</b> ultrasound, or bronchoscopes are used. The yield rate of biopsies in small nodules is reported to be between 33–50% in tumors smaller than 3cm.|$|R
25|$|The 3D image {{itself can}} be {{overlaid}} colour-coded {{on top of the}} fluoroscopic image. Any change of the angulations of the <b>C-arm</b> will cause the workstation to re-calculate in real-time the view on the 3D image to match exactly the view of the live 2D fluoroscopy image. Without additional contrast agent injection the surgeon can observe device movements simultaneously with the 3D overlay of the vessel contours in the fluoroscopy image.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} imaging {{modality}} {{to be used}} in hybrid ORs is a <b>C-Arm.</b> Expert consensus rates the performance of mobile C-arms in hybrid ORs as insufficient, because the limited power of the tube impacts image quality, the field of view is smaller for image-intensifier systems than for flat-panel detector systems and the cooling system of mobile C-Arms can lead to overheating after just a few hours, which can be too short for lengthy surgical procedures or for multiple procedures in a row, that would be needed to recover the investment in such a room.|$|E
25|$|Some {{surgeons}} do {{not only}} verify {{the placement of}} complex endografts intraoperatively, they also use their angiography system and the applications it offers for planning the procedure. As anatomy changes between a preoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy because of patient positioning and the insertion of stiff material, a much more precise planning is possible if the surgeon performs an intraoperative rotational angiography, takes an automatic segmentation of the aorta, places markers for the renal arteries and other landmarks in 3D and then overlays the contours on 2D fluoroscopy. This guidance is updated with any change in <b>C-Arm</b> angulation/position or table position.|$|E
2500|$|Fixed <b>C-Arms</b> do {{not have}} these limitations, but require more space in the room. These systems can be mounted either on the floor, the ceiling, or both if a biplane system is chosen. The latter is the system of choice if {{pediatric}} cardiologists, electrophysiologists or neurointerventionalists are major users of the room. It is not recommended to implement a biplane system if not clearly required by these clinical disciplines, as ceiling-mounted components may raise hygienic issues: In fact, some hospitals do not allow operating parts directly above the surgical field, because dust may fall in the wound and cause infection. Since any ceiling-mounted system includes moving parts above the surgical field and impairs the laminar airflow, such systems are not the right option for hospitals enforcing highest hygienic standards. (see also and, both German only) ...|$|R
25|$|The CBCT scanner {{is mounted}} on a <b>C-arm</b> in the IR suite, which offers real time imaging with a {{stationary}} patient. This eliminates {{the time needed to}} transfer a patient from the angiography suite to a conventional computed tomography scanner and facilitates a broad spectrum of applications of CBCT during IR procedures. The clinical applications of CBCT in IR include treatment planning, device or implant positioning and assessment, intra-procedural localization, and assessment of procedure endpoints. CBCT is useful as a primary and supplemental form of imaging. It is an excellent adjunct to DSA and fluoroscopy for soft tissue and vascular visibility during complex procedures. The use of CBCT before fluoroscopy potentially reduces patient radiation exposure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} factors to {{consider}} when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the <b>C-arm</b> just turns in from the side and does {{not interfere with the}} anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the head end without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the head end. Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.|$|E
2500|$|... 3D {{images are}} {{calculated}} from {{a set of}} projections acquired during a rotation of the <b>C-Arm</b> around the patient. The volume reconstruction is performed on a separate workstation. The <b>C-Arm</b> and the workstation are connected a communicate continuously. For example, when the user virtually rotates the volume on the workstation to view the anatomy from a certain perspective, the parameter of this view can be transmitted to the angio system, which then drives the <b>C-arm</b> to exactly the same perspective for fluoroscopy. In the same way, if the <b>C-arm</b> angulation is changed, this angulation can be transmitted to the workstation which updates the volume to the same perspective as the fluoroscopic view. The software algorithm that stands behind this process is called registration and can also be done with other DICOM images, such as CT or MRT data acquired preoperatively.|$|E

50|$|Fluoroscopic X-ray is {{used for}} a variety of {{diagnostic}} imaging and minimally invasive surgical procedures. For surgery it is practical to use a mobile <b>C-arm</b> system where the x-ray generator and x-ray detector are placed on a C-shaped arm positioned directly opposite from and aligned centrally to each other. The <b>C-arm</b> can be moved horizontally, vertically and around the swivel axes, so that X-ray images of the patient can be produced from different angles. The disadvantage of the <b>C-arm</b> is that imaging is limited to only one plane at a time.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} acquire a 3D image with a fixed <b>C-Arm,</b> the <b>C-Arm</b> is {{positioned}} at the body part in question so that this body part is in the isocenter between the x-ray tube and the detector. The <b>C-Arm</b> then rotates around that isocenter, the rotation being between 200° and 360° (depending on the equipment manufacturer).Such a rotation takes between 5 and 20 seconds, during which a few hundred 2D images are acquired. A piece of software then performs a cone beam reconstruction. The resulting voxel data can then {{be viewed as a}} multiplanar reconstruction, i.e. by scrolling through the slices from three projection angles, or as a 3D volume, which can be rotated and zoomed.|$|E

5000|$|For {{precision}} surgery procedures, {{for example}} in orthopedics, {{it is necessary to}} generate a view of the surgical site from two perpendicular viewing positions, usually a frontal and a lateral view. With a <b>C-arm</b> system this can only be achieved by manually repositioning the <b>C-arm</b> for the second view. This can be challenging due to the presence of sterile drapes and other surgical devices. Bringing the x-ray generator from a non-sterile area, underneath the operating table to a horizontal position close do the patient can compromise the sterility of the surgical area and increase the risks of infections.Shifting the <b>C-arm</b> must normally be done many times during the surgical procedure, taking additional time and increasing the radiation exposure to patient and staff. With the G-arm the stand can stay in a fixed position during the entire surgical procedure as both imaging planes can be viewed simultaneously. Benefits are shorter procedures, higher accuracy, and lower radiation exposure. [...] The fixed position of the stand also ensures a better sterility.|$|E
