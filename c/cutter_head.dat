25|$|Construction {{commenced}} on March 8, 2005. Three major {{construction sites}} had been established, at Malmö C, Triangeln and Holma/Hyllie. By {{the end of}} 2006, another construction site had been opened in Lockarp, where connecting tracks to Ystad and Trelleborg were being built. The underground station at Malmö C was built in a 0.8km long open trench which was then covered. To minimize traffic disruption, the extensive and time-consuming work was done in stages. In order to build Triangeln station, two 25 m deep vertical shafts were dug at {{the northern and southern}} part of the site, and the station was then milled out of the rock by a roadheader — a machine equipped with a rotating <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> on a telescopic arm. The rock was then lined with concrete elements to finish the structure. Hyllie Station was built in an approximately 7 m deep shaft; the vault that covers the station is a distinct landmark in the Hyllie development area. The tunnel was mostly bored by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Underground drilling commenced in November 2006 and February 2007, respectively. On 25 March 2008, one of the TBMs achieved breakthrough at Malmö C, followed by the second TBM on April 21. Work was completed in December 2010, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|The TBM faced many {{challenges}} during the tunneling. Much of the tunneling {{took place in}} water-bearing strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before tunneling could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the tunneling work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While tunneling in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, weak rock. Concrete and steel foundation pads were constructed in front of the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone. The tunnel was completed in August 2008, with installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would at}} least do no harm," [...] Eau-douce mildly replied. [...] "By {{bringing}} the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to sea we should lessen her drift; {{and even if we}} dragged through the breakers, it would be with the least possible danger. I hope, Master Cap, you will allow the pilot and myself to prepare for anchoring, since the precaution may do good, and can do no harm." ...|$|E
50|$|A wood moulder has {{one or more}} {{horizontal}} <b>cutter</b> <b>heads,</b> and {{may also}} have side <b>cutter</b> <b>heads.</b> Because it has horizontal <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> a wood moulder differs from a spindle shaper, which has one or sometimes more vertical spindles and no horizontal heads.|$|R

60|$|One of {{the barrels}} {{served as a}} table, the iron plate that {{had been taken from}} the floor of the ship’s galley had been placed forward of the mast on a layer of sand three inches thick, and a {{forecastle}} hatch had been placed above it to serve as an exit for the smoke. A store of wood, the result of their ship-building operations, was piled in the bow. Stephen did not trouble to cook, but boiled some water over some chips of wood, made himself a cup of coffee, or rather the half of a small gourd of coffee, ate a melon and a biscuit, and presently went up on deck again. At three o’clock a light breeze sprung up, and this, an hour later, strengthened to a heavy blow. Stephen sailed on until midnight, then reefed the mainsail and fastened the boom amidships, lowered the foresail and hauled the jib to weather, and having thus laid the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to wind lay down on the deck and slept soundly until daybreak. The next day he passed two or three islands, but all at a considerable distance. Beyond these no land was visible, and he hoped that he was fairly beyond the Archipelago with its hostile natives.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> {{contains}} {{two or more}} knives which are honed to a very sharp edge. The knives are arranged radially in the cylindrical <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> such that their cutting edges protrude from the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> {{so that they will}} come into contact with the board being cut as the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> spins. The cutter head's axis of rotation is parallel to the table surfaces and perpendicular to the feed direction. The knives cut into the board in the direction opposite to the feed.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: View of {{retrieval}} {{site for}} repairs of Bertha's <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> The red gantry crane, center, {{was used to}} lift the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> from a shaft dug {{in front of the}} stuck boring machine. The white shed, right, was built to house the head during repairs and upgrades, and then the head was lowered back down the shaft and reinstalled.|$|E
6000|$|Cap hurried forward; and there, sure enough, {{the land}} was visible through the drizzle, at the {{distance}} of about half a mile, the <b>cutter</b> <b>heading</b> directly towards it. The first impulse of the old seaman was to give an order to [...] "stand by, to ware off shore;" [...] but the cool-headed soldier restrained him.|$|R
25|$|A related tool, {{called a}} spindle moulder (UK) or shaper (North America), {{is used to}} hold larger <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> {{and can be used}} for deeper or larger-diameter cuts. Another related machine is the pin router, a larger static version of the hand {{electric}} router but normally with a much more powerful motor and other features such as automatic template copying.|$|R
50|$|A wood shaper, {{usually just}} shaper in North America or spindle moulder in the UK, is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine {{in which a}} vertically oriented spindle drives <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> to mill profiles on wood stock. The spindle may be raised and lowered relative to the shaper's table, and rotates between 3,000 and 10,000 rpm, with stock running along a vertical fence.|$|R
50|$|A {{thickness}} planer {{consists of}} three elements: a <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> which contains the cutting knives; a set of rollers which draw the board through the machine; and a table which is adjustable relative to the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to control the resultant thickness of the board. Some portable thickness planers differ slightly in that the table is fixed and the cutter head/feed roller assembly is adjusted.|$|E
50|$|Angle cut has the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> angled {{for easier}} insertion. Typical angling is 25 to 35 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The infeed and outfeed tables can {{be raised}} or lowered {{independently}} {{of each other and}} in relation to the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> although the outfeed table is normally set so that it is level with the knives when at the top dead centre of the rotation of the <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> The infeed table is adjusted so that it is lower than the outfeed table and this gives the depth of cut.|$|E
5000|$|Wood shaper <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> {{typically}} have three blades, and turn at 1/2 to 1/8th {{the speed of}} smaller, much less expensive two-bladed bits used on a hand-held wood router. [...] Adapters are sold allowing a shaper to drive router bits, a compromise on several levels. As are router tables, cost-saving adaptations of hand-held routers mounted to comparatively light-duty dedicated work tables.|$|R
50|$|Some, more expensive, jointer models {{contain a}} spiral, or helical, cutting head. This {{configuration}} has many individually mounted, self-indexing knives {{that can be}} rotated to a new edge when necessary. Other, older, models have <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> that are not cylindrical but instead square. This leaves a significantly larger open region {{below the level of}} the blade edges and creates a larger hazard as hands, etc., can be pulled in further and cut more deeply.|$|R
40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter,</b> the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The tilt of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. A worm to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm <b>head</b> <b>cutters</b> would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutters</b> is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R
50|$|In hard rock, either {{shielded}} or open-type TBMs can be used. Hard rock TBMs excavate {{rock with}} disc cutters {{mounted in the}} <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> The disc cutters create compressive stress fractures in the rock, causing it to chip away from the tunnel face. The excavated rock (muck) is transferred through openings in the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to a belt conveyor, where it runs through the machine {{to a system of}} conveyors or muck cars for removal from the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Fundamentally, a jointer's table {{arrangement}} is designed with two levels like a narrower thickness planer {{so that it}} consists of two long, narrow parallel tables in a row with a <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> recessed between them, but with a side guide. This <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> is typically driven by an electric induction motor. (Older machines were driven by belts from line shafts.) A moveable fence is normally set perpendicular to the tables, though some models may allow settings (adjustments) to various angles.|$|E
50|$|In operation, {{the board}} to be jointed is held with its face against the fence and the edge to be jointed resting on the infeed table. The board is fed across the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> and onto the outfeed table. The knives in the {{revolving}} <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> remove an amount of material {{and the relationship of}} the two tables and the fence keeps the board oriented {{in such a way that}} the result is an edge which is flat along its length and perpendicular to the board's face.|$|E
50|$|Ground {{engaging}} {{tools are}} the expendable replacement parts of costly mining, construction, dredging, crushing, conveying, recycling {{equipment such as}} excavators, scrapers, drag lines, shovels, dippers, graders, dozers, loaders, haulers, dredging <b>cutter</b> <b>heads,</b> backhoes and skid steers. GET protects expensive equipment from {{the wear and tear}} common in high-impact or high-abrasion environments (from hard rock mining to dredging and oil sands extraction). GET includes such wear parts as tooth systems, buckets, blades, end bits, couplers, thumbs, ripper systems, lip systems, dozer packages, liner packages, shrouds, chain, chain sprockets, traction wheels, and shredder hammer components.|$|R
50|$|Each groove needed its own {{monophonic}} {{needle and}} cartridge {{on its own}} branch of tonearm, and each needle was connected to a separate amplifier and speaker. This setup was intended to give a demonstration at a New York audio fair of Cook's <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> rather than to sell the record; but soon afterward, the demand for such recordings and the equipment to play it grew, and Cook Records began to produce such records commercially. Cook recorded {{a vast array of}} sounds, ranging from railroad sounds to thunderstorms. By 1953, Cook had a catalog of about 25 stereo records for sale to audiophiles.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had {{the boats}} been got on board, and the <b>cutter’s</b> <b>head</b> turned offshore, when the {{schooner}} was seen issuing from the inlet. Will ordered every sail to be crowded on, {{and had the}} satisfaction of seeing the schooner following his example. He then set {{the whole of the}} crew to shift the long-tom from the bow to the stern. Its muzzle was just high enough to project above the taffrail, and in order to hide it better he had hammocks and other material piled on each side of it so as to form a breastwork three feet high.|$|R

40|$|Kinematics of Gleason {{mechanisms}} of hypoid and spiral bevel cutting machines are considered. These mechanisms are designated {{to install the}} position and tilt of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter.</b> The tilt of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> with standard blades provides the required pressure angle. The authors have developed the matrix presentation of kinematics of these meachanisms and basic equations for the required settings.

50|$|The {{majority}} of fused filament printers {{follow the same}} basic design. A flat bed is used {{as the starting point}} for the print workpiece. A gantry above this carries the moving print head. The gantry design is optimised for movement mostly in the horizontal X & Y directions, with a slow climb in the Z direction as the piece is printed. Stepper motors drive the movement through either leadscrews or toothed belt drives. It is common, owing to the differences in movement speed, to use toothed belts for the X,Y drives and a leadscrew for Z. Some machines also have X axis movement on the gantry, but move the bed (and print job) for Y. As, unlike laser <b>cutters,</b> <b>head</b> movement speeds are low, stepper motors are universally used and {{there is no need to}} use servomotors instead.|$|R

50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. <b>Cutter</b> <b>heads</b> (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent methane and coal dust explosions worldwide, {{the need for the}} {{improvements}} in the existing environment control technology continue to exist. Considerable progress in environment (dust and methane) control in South African mines has indeed been made but they remain a matter of great concern. The introduction of the 1997 Directive on dust exposure levels and face ventilation was a milestone for the South African coal mining industry in improving health and safety standards. These stricter guidelines and the latest dust control technologies are beneficial not only in the long-term health perspective, but also to in terms of controlling methane and coal dust explosions (high-risk) in the short term. The paper discusses the results of the recent tests on the newly developed and improved wet head system. Water transfer to the <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> is now by a single cartridge giving obvious advantages over the original three-cartridge system...|$|R
