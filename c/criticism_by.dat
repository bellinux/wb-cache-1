5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs {{and principles of}} Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E

5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

Our Films, Their Films is an anthology of film <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book {{is presented in two}} sections: Ray first discusses Indian film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and movements such as Italian neorealism. His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as Speaking of Films. It contains a compact description of his philosophy of different aspects of the cinemas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E

5|$|Kenshin's {{character}} was well-received by fans, with his holding {{the top spot}} in all reader popularity polls for the series. Critics of the series praised his strong personality and backstory which most critics found appealing. However, though some complained about his development during the OVA series; while {{his role in the}} prequel OVAs were praised, his role in the ones that created a new story arc resulted in <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> various critics including Watsuki himself. Satoh's acting in the live-action film received positive comments due to how he fits the character as well as his fight choreography. A variety of collectibles based on Kenshin have been created, including figurines, key chains, plushies, and replicas of his sakabatō sword.|$|E
5|$|McCann was {{an active}} member of the Big Brother Movement in South Australia, which was {{involved}} in supporting boys that had migrated to Australia from the United Kingdom under the Child Migrant scheme. He commanded the 43rd Battalion until July 1930 when he transferred to the Unattached List, and continued as president of the RSSILA until 1931, leading the RSSILA delegation to the biennial conference of the British Empire Service League in London in 1929. Upon his return from the conference and a tour of the former battlefields and war cemeteries, he offered his personal opinion that World War I had not been worthwhile, as the tremendous loss had resulted in little gain. This resulted in some public <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> potential political opponents.|$|E
5|$|Producer David De Silva {{conceived}} the premise in 1976, partially {{inspired by the}} musical A Chorus Line. He commissioned Gore to write the script, originally titled Hot Lunch, before selling it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). After he was hired to direct the film, Parker rewrote the script with Gore, aiming for a darker and dramatic tone. The script's subject matter received <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> the New York Board of Education, which prevented the production from filming in the actual High School of Performing Arts. The film was shot on location in New York City, with principal photography beginning in July 1979 and concluding after 91 days. Parker encountered a difficult filming process, which included conflicts with U.S. labor unions over {{various aspects of the}} film's production.|$|E

5|$|Raymond {{received}} the commission for the Reader's Digest Building from Mrs DeWitt Wallace {{on his return}} from Japan in 1949. She wanted a design that would show the best that America could offer. The site acquired for the building was opposite the Hirakawa Gate of the Imperial Palace. Its choice was treated with great resentment by the Japanese who felt that favouritism was shown by the Occupation authorities in allowing an American company to utilise a prominent site that would have served better as a park. Taking influence from Le Corbusier, Raymond responded to this <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> masterplanning the site by using a Ville Radieuse inspired layout with the building set in gardens with sculptures by the Japanese American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi.|$|E
5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} <b>criticism</b> <b>by</b> the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E

Morrell's account of the next few months of the voyage, in Antarctic and subantarctic waters, is controversial.
