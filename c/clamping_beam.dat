40|$|Mismatch is an {{important}} quality evaluation standard in Tailor Welded Blanks. The control of mismatch, especially for multi-group blanks, is a difficult technique in Tailored Blank Laser Welding process. In this paper, the production and control of mismatch for multi-group blanks is studied based on a Tailored Blank Laser Welding system. The origins of the mismatch are obtained after numbers of experiments: the deformation of the blanks before welding, {{the intensity of the}} clamping force, the uniformity of the clamping force, the deformation of the <b>clamping</b> <b>beam,</b> the flatness error of the based platform and the welding process. A mathematical model is established according to the analysis of the origins producing mismatch. Experimental results indicate that the model provides an effective theory in increasing welding quality.

40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{established}} {{to determine the}} microscale uniaxial stress-strain curve from the load and deflection data for a doubly <b>clamped</b> <b>beam.</b> The method {{is based on the}} fact that, for beam deflection much larger than the beam thickness, the axial stretching dominates the deformation in the doubly <b>clamped</b> <b>beam</b> and the doubly <b>clamped</b> <b>beam</b> behaves like a simple plastic hinge. The microscale uniaxial stress-strain curve, together with the cantilever beam experiments, is used to determine the strain gradient effect in An thin beams.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the free vibration behaviour of slightly curved simply supported <b>beams</b> and <b>clamped</b> <b>beams</b> connected to axially sliding end masses. For the simply supported beam, two formulas for the natural frequencies are derived from the theoretical analysis. One is obtained by neglecting the effect of axial inertial force of the beam and the other formula is derived by considering this effect, approximately, using Galerkin's method. For the <b>clamped</b> <b>beam,</b> an approximate formula is derived using Galerkin's method. The results of the theoretical analysis of simply supported and <b>clamped</b> <b>beams</b> are described in chapter 2 and show that there are two different natural frequencies having the same fundamental transverse mode for each case and the ratio of the longitudinal motion to transverse motion are different for modes In order to verify the theoretical results of simply supported and <b>clamped</b> <b>beams</b> some experiments were conducted. Beams of various curvatures under different end masses are tested in this experimental work.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} pull-in instability (EPI), {{within the}} framework of the nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) has been shown as a robust and versatile method for characterizing mechanical properties of nanocantilevers. This paper aims to investigate the surface effects, specifically residual surface stress and surface elasticity, on the EPI of micro and nano-scale cantilevers as well as double <b>clamped</b> <b>beams.</b> Since the cantilever has one end free, it has no residual stress, thus the strain-independent component of the surface stress or intrinsic surface stress has no influence on the EPI, as long as it has small deformation. The strain- dependent component of the surface stress or surface elasticity changes the bending stiffness of the cantilever and, consequently, induces shifts in the EPI. For double <b>clamped</b> <b>beams,</b> the effective residual surface stress comes into play and modifies the effective residual stress of the beam. The nonlinear electromechanical coupled equations, which take into account the surface effects are solved numerically. The theoretical results presented in this paper indicate that the EPI is very sensitive to the surface effects, especially when a double <b>clamped</b> <b>beam</b> is employed. The results show that the influence of surface effects on the EPI of cantilevers become more profound when the thickness is below 50 nm, while the influence on double <b>clamped</b> <b>beams</b> is significant even at sub-micron scale. The present study can provide helpful insights for the design and characterization of NEMS switches. Moreover, the results can be used to provide the proof of concepts of a new surface stress sensing method using EPI in nanomechanical sensor systems...|$|R
