40|$|The {{illustration}} on {{the cover}} and the header of each chapter depicts a relatively early attempt at classifying ‘documents ’ in different classes based on their content: the IBM Type 82 punched card sorter (mid-Sixties). “The Type 82 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine groups all cards of similar classification {{and at the same}} time arranges such classifications in numerical sequence. “The operator places the cards in the feed hopper, sets the sorting brush on the column to be sorted, and presses the starting key. The sorting operation is accomplished at a speed of 650 cards per minute, per column sorted. The card feeding mechanism allows refilling of the <b>card</b> <b>hopper</b> while the sorter is in operation, eliminating stopping of the machine. “The pockets into which the cards are sorted have a capacity of 800 cards and the machine stops when the limit is reached in any pocket. By means of a selecting feature, all cards punched with any hole or holes in a single column may be sorted out while the remaining cards are passed into the reject pocket without disturbing their sequence. “After the <b>card</b> <b>hopper</b> is empty, the sorter continues to run long enough to allow all cards to be sorted into the correct pockets without the necessity for pressing the start key. “Alphabetical sequence sorting can be accomplished with this model by an extra sort, in which case the machine is equipped with alphabetical switch and pocket designations. “The Type 82 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine can be specified for operation either from alternating or direct current. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Patients with Wilson's disease (WD) present {{cognitive}} impairment, {{especially in}} executive functions. Which other factors might {{be associated with}} global cognitive decline in these patients remains unclear. Objective: To assess which factors are associated with worse performance on a global cognitive test in patients with WD. Methods: Twenty patients with WD underwent cognitive assessment with the following tests: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), verbal fluency test, brief cognitive battery, clock drawing test, Frontal Assessment Battery, Stroop test, Wisconsin <b>card</b> sorting test, <b>Hopper</b> test, cubes (WAIS) and the Pfeffer questionnaire. MRI changes were quantified. Patients with poor performance on the DRS were {{compared to patients with}} normal performance. Results: Nine patients had a poor performance on the DRS. This group had lower educational level (9. 11 ± 3. 58 × 12. 82 ± 3. 06) and a greater number of changes on MRI (9. 44 ± 2. 74 × 6. 27 ± 2. 45). The presence of hyperintensity in the globus pallidus on MRI was more frequent in this group (66. 6 % vs 9. 0 %), with OR= 5. 38 (95 % CI 0. 85 - 33. 86). Conclusion: Global cognitive impairment was prevalent in this sample of patients with WD and was associated with low educational level, number of changes on MRI and MRI hyperintensity in the globus pallidus...|$|R
5000|$|Banks, {{insurance}} companies, hospitals etc., supplied IBM IRD with [...] "raw plastic cards" [...] preprinted {{with their}} logos, contact information etc. They also supplied the data information {{which was to}} be encoded and embossed on the cards. This data was supplied to IRD on large 0.5 inch wide, 10.5 inch diameter IBM Magnetic Tape Reels which was the standard for computers at that time.The manufacturing process started by first applying the magnetic stripe to the preprinted plastic cards via the hot stamping process developed by the IBM IRD engineers. This operation of applying the magnetic stripe to the plastic cards was done off line in another area of IBM IRD and not in the secured area. The cards were then brought into the secured area and placed in [...] "hoppers" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} production line.The tape reels containing the data were then installed on the modified IBM 360 computer prior to beginning the encoding, embossing and verification of the cards. After the 360 performed a check to verify that all systems and stations were loaded and ready to go, the computer began feeding the Magnetic Striped Plastic <b>Cards</b> from the <b>hoppers</b> at the front end of the production line down a motorized track. The entire operation was fully automated and controlled by the modified IBM 360 business computer. The line consisted of the following stations and operations: ...|$|R
