His <b>checked</b> bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint.

5|$|Since {{they were}} not given {{boarding}} passes for Flight11 in Portland, Atta and Omari <b>checked</b> in and went through security in Boston. In the rushed check-in after the flight from Portland, airline officials did not load Atta's bags on Flight11. Suqami, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri also <b>checked</b> in for the flight in Boston. Wail al-Shehri and Suqami each <b>checked</b> one bag; Waleed al-Shehri did not check any bags. CAPPS selected all three for a detailed luggage check. As the CAPPS' screening was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.|$|E

5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} than five years of {{addiction}} to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante <b>checked</b> into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin a full recovery. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante <b>checked</b> out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher.

Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be <b>checked</b> for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport. At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed <b>checked</b> in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18. Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand. The Hazmi brothers <b>checked</b> in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. Hani Hanjour <b>checked</b> in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items. The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security, under contract with United Airlines.|$|E

40|$|Runtime {{property}} <b>checking</b> (as {{implemented in}} tools like Purify or Valgrind) <b>checks</b> whether a program execution satisfies a property. Active property <b>checking</b> extends runtime <b>checking</b> by <b>checking</b> whether {{the property is}} satisfied by all program executions that follow the same program path. This <b>check</b> is performed on a symbolic execution of the given program path using a constraint solver. If the <b>check</b> fails, the constraint solver generates an alternative program input triggering a new program execution that follows the same program path but exhibits a property violation. Combined with systematic dynamic test generation, which attempts to exercise all feasible paths in a program, active property <b>checking</b> defines {{a new form of}} dynamic software model <b>checking</b> (program verification). In this paper, we formalize and study active property <b>checking.</b> We show how static and dynamic type <b>checking</b> can be extended with active type <b>checking.</b> Then, we discuss how to implement active property <b>checking</b> efficiently.

40|$|New {{websites}} and smartphone applications provide easy-click <b>checking</b> {{opportunities that}} can help consumers in many domains. However, this technology is not always used effectively. For example, many consumers skip <b>checking</b> Terms and Conditions links even when a quick evaluation of the terms can save them money, but they <b>check</b> their smartphone while driving even though this behavior is illegal and dangerous. Four laboratory experiments clarify the significance of one contributor to such contradictory deviations from effective <b>checking.</b> Studies 1, 2, and 3 show that, like basic decisions from experience, <b>checking</b> decisions reflect underweighting of rare events, {{which in turn is}} a sufficient condition for the coexistence of insufficient and too much <b>checking.</b> Insufficient <b>checking</b> emerges when most <b>checking</b> efforts impair performance even if <b>checking</b> is effective on average. Too much <b>checking</b> emerges when most <b>checking</b> clicks are rewarding even if <b>checking</b> is counterproductive on average. This pattern can be captured with a model that assumes reliance on small samples of past <b>checking</b> decision experiences.
