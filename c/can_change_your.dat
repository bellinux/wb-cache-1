500|$|The {{producers}} {{were strongly}} interested in [...] "world building," [...] and the alternate universe {{allowed them to}} create a very similar world with {{a large amount of}} detail to fill in the texture of the world. An alternate universe also allowed them to show [...] "how small choices that you make define you as a person and <b>can</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> life in large ways down the line," [...] according to co-director Jeff Pinkner. However, the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers. To avoid this, elements of the world were introduced in small pieces {{over the course of the}} first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second-season finale and the third season. J. H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense, and would rework the script if his father found it confusing. Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the alternate universe with nearly no ties to the main characters; as stated by Wyman, they would be able to [...] "make two shows about one show," [...] a concept that the network executives embraced.|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} the many {{differences between the}} prime and parallel universes in an interview, Pinkner explained that [...] "one of the big themes {{of the show is}} how small choices that you make define you as a person and <b>can</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> life in large ways down the line". Pinkner {{and the rest of the}} Fringe production team loved the opportunity to build an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. Pinkner elaborated in another interview that when the [...] "perfectionist" [...] crew were writing and constructing the parallel universe, they spent a lot of time on a high [...] "level of attention and detail" [...] that had all of the different departments and actors weighing in. Pinkner thought that because the parallel universe is effectively breaking down with [...] "World War II"-like conditions, these [...] "sort of tough times forge more noble, stronger people". To better differentiate the two universes, the producers changed the color of the opening credit sequences by making the parallel universe red and the prime universe blue. As with the opening credits in [...] "Peter", the episodes featuring the parallel universe displayed certain fringe science words in that world, including wormholes, speciation, pandemics, and telepathy.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and <b>can</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E

[...] In part, the album was inspired by E's facial hair and written as a sequel to the Souljacker song [...] "Dog Faced Boy." [...] The character of [...] "Dog Faced Boy" [...] has grown up into a werewolf and is the protagonist who experiences various types of desire throughout the songs. In an interview with NPR on June 6, 2009, Eels frontman Mark Oliver Everett stated [...] "That Look You Give That Guy" [...] is his favorite song from the album.|$|E

2500|$|Reed {{was born}} on March 2, 1942 at Beth El Hospital (now Brookdale) in Brooklyn {{and grew up in}} Freeport, Long Island. Contrary to some sources, his birth name was Lewis Allan Reed, not Louis Firbanks, a name that was coined as a joke by Lester Bangs in Creem magazine. Reed was the son of Toby (née Futterman) (1920–2013) and Sidney Joseph Reed (1913–2005), an accountant. His family was Jewish, and {{although}} {{he said that he was}} Jewish, he added, [...] "My God is rock'n'roll. It's an obscure power that <b>can</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> life. The most important part of my religion is to play guitar." [...] Reed attended Atkinson Elementary School in Freeport and went on to Freeport Junior High School, notorious for its gangs.
