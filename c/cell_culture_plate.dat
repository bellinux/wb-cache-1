5000|$|HeLa cells, {{like other}} cell lines, are termed [...] "immortal" [...] {{in that they}} can divide an {{unlimited}} number of times in a laboratory <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> as long as fundamental cell survival conditions are met (i.e., being maintained and sustained in a suitable environment). There are many strains of HeLa cells {{as they continue to}} mutate in cell cultures, but all HeLa cells are descended from the same tumor cells removed from Lacks. The total number of HeLa cells that have been propagated in cell culture far exceeds the total number of cells that were in Henrietta Lacks' body.|$|E
50|$|The {{captured}} CTCs on {{the filter}} membrane of a ScreenCell isolation device, are {{transferred to a}} 24-well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> for enumeration/characterization using ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay. A target-specific probe set containing 20 oligonucleotide pairs hybridizes to the target RNA. An oligo pair hybridization event is essential for support of the signal amplification structure, which is assembled {{by a series of}} sequential hybridization steps. Each fully assembled amplification structure is contained within 40−50 bp of target RNA with the capacity for 400-fold signal amplification. Therefore, a typical target-specific probe set (containing 20 oligo pairs) can generate 8,000-fold signal amplification at the location of the target RNA.|$|E
50|$|To make a {{reliable}} diagnosis, multiple samples of stems {{should be examined}} (young and old) and isolation should be made from the diseased tissues. Microscopic observation of stem sections may show new growth around infected vessels, plugging of vessels, hardening of their walls, and necrosis. Since latent infections on cuttings cannot be readily detected, cuttings should be kept at a relatively high temperature to ensure maximum symptom expression. The bacterium can be detected by immunofluorescence staining (IFAS) and direct isolation on 96 microwell <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> even in material with latent infection. B. caryophylli has also been detected from inoculated carnation by PCR and LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification).|$|E

After attachment of the cells and ensuring their health, the culture medium was removed completely and 90  µl of prepared extraction of samples, along with 10  µl of FBS were added to each cell.|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the proliferation of}} different concentrations of DEWJ, 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl)- 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma, USA) assay was performed in a 96 -well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate.</b> We chose the overnight extract for this assay. Next, hEnSCs were seeded at the density of 5 [*]×[*] 103 cell per well. About 200  µL of a serum-free culture medium (DMEM-F 12) supplemented with different percentages of DEWJ (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %) was added to different wells to determine its influence on the proliferation of hEn-SCs (n[*]=[*] 3). Then, the plates {{were placed in the}} incubator with 37  °C and 5 % CO 2. After the definite time points (1, 3, and 7  days), the culture medium was removed and 100  µL new serum-free culture medium and 10  µL MTT solution (0.5  mg mL− 1) were added to each well. After 3  h of incubation at 37  °C, MTT solution was removed and 100  µL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck, Germany) was added. Then, 100  µL of the supernatant obtained from each well was transported to the well of a new 96 -well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> and the absorbance of the formazan product was measured at 570  nm using a multiplate reader (H 4, BIO-TEK Instruments Inc., USA).|$|E
30|$|Annexin V-FITC/PI dual {{staining}} for apoptosis {{was performed}} to measure the apoptosis. Briefly, 1 [*]×[*] 105 cells/well of MCF- 7 cells were seeded in a six-well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> and incubated for 24  h. Subsequently, cells were exposed to free RES + CUR, RUB/CUR + RES micelles, or RUB/RES micelles + RUB/CUR micelles. Cells were harvested post-incubation by trypsinization and washed twice with PBS.

Stained cells were analyzed by a FACS Aria II flow cytometer.|$|E
30|$|Twenty-one {{chickens}} {{for which}} cloacal cotton swabs were {{positive for the}} p 27 antigen were numbered from 01 # to 21 #. An aseptic anticoagulated blood sample was collected from each chicken, and then the samples were centrifuged at 1500  rpm for 5  min to isolate the leukocytes. The leukocytes were then suspended in 200  ul and used to inoculate two sets of <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plates</b> containing DF 1 cells.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of modern culture techniques still take a colony-forming unit-fibroblasts (CFU-F) approach, where raw unpurified bone marrow or ficoll-purified bone marrow Mononuclear cell are <b>plated</b> directly into <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plates</b> or flasks. Mesenchymal stem cells, but not {{red blood cells}} or haematopoetic progenitors, are adherent to tissue culture plastic within 24 to 48 hours. However, at least one publication has identified a population of non-adherent MSCs that are not obtained by the direct-plating technique.|$|R
30|$|For the {{evaluation}} of apoptosis induction, <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> eluates were produced by incubating 0.1  mL of bone substitutes or soft materials in 1 -mL standard medium at 37 °C for 24  h. This incubation step with the implant material was repeated twice with fresh <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> media. Three eluates were pooled for <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> experiments. DFCs were seeded onto <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plates</b> and cultivated in standard <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> media. After <b>cell</b> seeding (12 to 24  h), <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> media were changed, and cells were cultivated in <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> media with material eluates.

30|$|SMMC- 7721 {{cells and}} Plc cells at the {{logarithmic}} phase were selected and treated with trypsin digestion; the cell concentration was adjusted to l[*]×[*]l 06 cells/mL. Next, the cultured cells were added into a 6 -well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> for adherence, {{and the culture}} medium was removed followed {{by the addition of}} rhodamine B-labeled BSA NPs. The nucleus was stained with Hoechst (blue) for 15  min at 37  °C, and the mitochondria was stained by Mitotracker Green FM. The location of BSA NPs in cells was tracked within the cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (FluoView FV 10 i; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).|$|E
30|$|Human {{osteosarcoma}} {{cell line}} MG- 63 {{cells were cultured in}} medium containing 10 % of {{fetal calf serum}} in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 at 37  °C, and the medium also contained 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 100 ug/ml penicillin. Then MG- 63 cells were seeded in a 96 -well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> with a density of 5 [*]×[*] 103 per well. The next day, cells were treated with samples at the concentration of 0, 20, 40, 60 μg/ml. After 3 days, the cell viability was evaluated by MTT. The MG- 63 cells were cultured with samples for 5 days for alkaline phosphate activity assay.|$|E
30|$|The {{intracellular}} uptake of APTS-coated Fe 3 O 4 NPs in the C 6 glioma cells was quantified using a Prodigy ICP-AES system (Teledyne Leeman Labs, Hudson, NH, USA). For ICP-AES analysis, 1 [*]×[*] 106 {{cells were}} seeded onto a six-well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plate</b> for 24  h. The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of acetylated APTS-coated Fe 3 O 4 NPs (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100  μg/mL) for 24  h.

30|$|The normal mouse {{fibroblast}} {{cell lines}} 3 T 3 and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell lines HepG 2 {{were obtained from}} American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, VA, USA), and these {{cells were cultured in}} DMEM and RPMI medium (Nacalai, Japan) supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 % antibiotic solution, respectively. To determine the cell viability, healthy viable cells were seeded to <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plates</b> (1 [*]×[*] 104) once reach the 80 % of confluency in a <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> flask and seeded cells were allowed to adhere overnight earlier to the nanocompound treatment with different doses (0.781 – 50  μg/mL). The cells without any treatment were served as a negative control, and another set of cells were treated with vehicle control (0.1 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). Treated cells were incubated for 72  h; after the incubation period, cell counting reagent (CCK- 8 solution; Dojindo Lab, Japan) was then added to each <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> well and placed in an incubator for 3  h at 37  °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2. After the incubation period with cell counting reagent, the 96 -well <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plates</b> were measured at 450  nm by a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., VT, USA).

40|$|Cryopreserved cells {{stored in}} dry ice or liquid {{nitrogen}} is the classical method for transporting cells between research laboratories in different {{cities around the}} world in order to maintain cell viability. An alternative method is to ship the live cells in flasks filled with <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> medium. Both methods have limitations of either a requirement on special shipping container or short times for the cells to survive on the shipping process.

40|$|SummaryDuring an {{image-based}} phenotype {{screening of}} our chemical library, we noted a small molecule that boosts the adhesion {{and growth of}} human cells. Chemical and cell biological experiments suggest that the diaryldispirotripiperazine derivative (adhesamine) targets selective cell-surface glycosaminoglycans, especially heparan sulfate, for increasing cell adhesion and growth. The addition of adhesamine to the culture medium enables the adhesion of even floating lymphocytes to <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> <b>plates</b> and the microinjection into them. Unlike poly-L-lysine, adhesamine induces apparently normal cell adhesion accompanied by organized actin structures and activation of focal adhesion kinase and ERK 1 / 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Adhesamine may be useful as a cell-attaching reagent for cell engineering and basic cell biology...|$|R
