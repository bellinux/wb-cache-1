Reflecting on his time in France, he said [...] "I never hid my desire to return to Portugal, but now I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> anything more." [...] He made his debut on 11 August 2001 in a 0–0 draw at Braga. Mendes played regularly under the management of José Mourinho prior to his departure to Porto, but fell out of favour under his replacement, Vítor Pontes. He made 16 league appearances for Leiria, helping the club finish 7th in the Primeira Liga, before returning to Strasbourg. Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club. [...] "The Union of Leiria is a complicated club at senior management level, especially the president, who sees things where they do not exist and it creates instability in the squad," [...] said Mendes who [...] "leaves great friends in Leiria".|$|E
500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Orwell, {{author of}} Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, wrote in 1946 that [...] "the Russian regime will either democratize itself {{or it will}} perish".

According to a Conquest article published in 1969, [...] "In time, the Communist world is faced with a fundamental crisis. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> for certain that it will democratize itself.

2500|$|Afterwards, the {{incident}} has caused some debates {{because it is}} rare that a Christian black metal band gets signed to a secular label. Previously only Horde's release of Hellig Usvart in 1994 on Nuclear Blast is a similar known case. In December 1998, the drummer Armoth {{said in an interview}} with the Art for the Ears webzine that they sent the CD and a short biography for Cacophonous Records and that Cacophonous Records just wanted to sign Antestor because of the music, which was exactly what the band wanted to do.

5000|$|In other words, {{learning}} is a process by which a person gains specific knowledge, understanding of this knowledge, or a specific skill (ability). Often learning involves gaining all three to varying degrees.

40|$|Higher {{education}} in the United States went through a real revolution in the 1960 s.

Indeed, at that time, the American higher educational system was really called into question by {{a growing number of}} students. What is Kerr’s own definition of the “multiversity”?

Indeed, though possibly I might have been mistaken, I thought it had rather an astringent, acrid taste; probably induced by the tar, with which the flavor of all ropes is more or less vitiated.

60|$|Samoa's {{operation}} was very summary. A fire was kindled {{in the little}} caboose, or cook-house, and so made as to produce much smoke.

60|$|It is {{necessary}} to distinguish general from collective names.
