5000|$|Another of the Moonbase crew, Ralph, has {{disappeared}} in the food stores, and the Moonbase radio transmissions are being monitored from somewhere else on the moon. Jamie has been placed in the sickbay where, feverish and delirious, he begins mumbling about a [...] "Phantom Piper", a figure which Jamie believes appears to a McCrimmon before he dies. While attending to Jamie, Polly sees a large figure leave through the door. When Hobson, the Doctor, Ben, John and Nils arrive to collect Evans' body, it {{has disappeared}}. They then leave to investigate where this 'piper' is. Polly goes to get water, and Jamie wakes {{up to see the}} 'piper' advancing on him.The 'piper' ignores Jamie, as he doesn't have the disease, so he steals another patient and leaves. Polly <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> as the figure is leaving and recognises it as a Cyberman, and the Doctor realises their old enemies are stalking the Moonbase and taking the patients' bodies. Hobson brushes away the cyber-story, believing they died out years ago. He gives the Doctor 24 hours to discover the cause of the virus, or else he and his companions must leave the moon.|$|R

Godefroy equally <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to stop himself from {{shooting}} Frénégonde's father, and the deflected crossbow bolt kills the witch who caused the whole misadventure by drugging Godefroy's flask. The bewildered Jacquard finds himself stranded in the past in the role of Godefroy's servant as Godefroy leaves on horseback with Frénégonde.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 June 2012, Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv {{confirmed}} {{the signing of}} Niko Kranjčar on a four-year contract. The transfer fee {{was estimated to be}} about £5.5 million. After his move to Dynamo Kyiv, Niko Kranjčar says he is [...] "happy" [...] and satisfied" [...] of joining Dynamo Kyiv and does admits his time at Tottenham was ‘disappointing’. Kranjčar revealed that Dynamo Kyiv first took interest in signing him in 2003 during his time at Dinamo Zagreb. He scored twice on Matchday 5 against Volyn Lutsk. He scored another two goals against Karpaty Lviv on 14 September 2012. After having a good beginning of the season, in November Kranjčar felt an old ankle injury, which left him out of the game {{until the end of the}} year. He <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time for the second half of the season, after the winter break, but managed to make only two appearances before he got injured again while performing for the Croatian national team in March 2013. This time he was left out of the pitch until the end of the season.|$|R

50|$|Madhumathi scores low in {{a subject}} {{and gets a}} {{negative}} feedback from her professor. To focus on her studies, she scorns Bunny and drives {{him out of the}} house. Madhumathi then focuses on her studies and achieves her MBBS degree with honors. On the day of her graduation she admits to her friend that she is indeed in love with Bunny. Her friend reveals that Bunny risked his life to pay her college tuition by doing dangerous stunts. He told her not to tell Madhumathi, and he is going back to Vizag that day. With regret, Madhumati tries to reconcile with Bunny and goes to meet him at the train station. On the way there she gets caught by a road block set up by a policeman who is her father's nemesis. As she was giving a lift to a sex worker (she didn't know at the time), she is jailed under prostitution charge. Soon her father is arrested as he storms the station and slaps the police who arrested her in a rage of fury. She manages to contact Bunny with a cell phone provided by one of the prostitutes, and Bunny comes to the station. Bunny also had an incident with the policeman who arrested Madhumati as he once berated him in public for smoking by a gas station. Bunny becomes enraged and begins to fight with the police. As he is about to deliver a finishing blow, the DCP who was transferred by Madhumati's father in contempt of him refusing Madhumati's hand <b>in</b> marriage <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time and stops Bunny. He says he'll take care of everything and Bunny and Madhumati leave.|$|R
60|$|No sooner did I hear a {{step on the}} {{pavement}} of the gateway than I discharged my rifle in the air. This was done as an alarm-signal. Clubbing the piece, I sprang forward, and felled the foremost of the two with a sharp blow on his hat. The fellow came down on {{the pavement}} like an ox under the axe of the slaughter-house. Dropping the rifle, I bounded over his body, and grappled with his companion. All this was done so rapidly as to take the rascals completely by surprise. So sudden, indeed, was my assault on the fellow who stood erect, that he was under the necessity of dropping his rifle, and at it we went, clinched like bears in the death-hug. I was young and active, but my antagonist was the stronger man of the two. He had also {{the advantage of being}} practised in wrestling, and I soon went down, my enemy falling on top of me. Luckily, I fell on the body of the other incendiary, who was just beginning to discover signs of consciousness after the crushing blow he had received. My chance would now have been small but for assistance. The incendiary had caught my neck-handkerchief, and was twisting it to choke me, when I felt a sudden relief. The light of the fire shone through the kitchen doors, rendering everything distinct beneath the arch. Mary <b>came</b> flying <b>back</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to rescue me. With a resolution that did her honor, she caught up the rifle I had dropped, and passed its small end between the bent arms of my antagonist and his own back, raising {{it at the same time}} like a lever. In the brief interval of breathing this ready expedient gave me, I rallied my force, caught my enemy by the throat, made a desperate effort, threw him off, and over on his side, and was on my feet in an instant. Drawing the pistol, I ordered the rascal to yield, or to take the consequences. The sight of this weapon secured the victory, the black-faced villain shrinking back into a corner, begging piteously not to be shot. At the next moment, the interpreter appeared under the arch, followed by a stream of redskins, which had been turned in this direction by the alarm given by my rifle.|$|R
