5|$|Between 1932 and 1936, the Cipher Bureau took on {{additional}} responsibilities, including radio <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> military-intelligence {{posts in}} Poland and abroad, {{as well as}} radio counterintelligence — mobile direction-finding and intercept stations for the locating and traffic-analysis of spy and fifth-column transmitters operating in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{association}} of these vocalizations with the reproductive {{season for the}} species and that only males make the sounds point to these vocalizations as possible reproductive displays. Over the past 100 years, the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed {{the recovery of the}} fin whale population, by impeding <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> males and receptive females.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> the Earth and {{spacecraft}} are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay {{from the}} source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E

5|$|For 1968, Austrian Jochen Rindt {{replaced}} Hulme, who {{had left}} to join McLaren. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new Cosworth DFV, but it proved very unreliable. Slow <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast—Rindt set pole position twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ismael {{produced}} 30foot (9m) waves {{over the}} Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico. The hurricane, which was forecast {{to move more}} slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared due to deficient <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> the boats and harbor authorities. As a result, 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore, with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded. About 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands, sandbars, or disabled fishing boats. Navy rescue teams and other fishermen searched for days off the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> the United States and Australia.|$|E

5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the company's {{developers}} are given much creative freedom. Uninvolved staff members can {{comment on the}} games' designs. Price considered game design a kind of social design, in which the team solve problems together. Price said trust {{is an essential part}} of a game's development, and that honest <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> staff members can ensure the correct direction of games. Price also said admitting mistakes can help maximize creativity, and that the company's leaders should be approachable by staff members.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1914, the Royal Engineers {{consisted}} of 25,000 officers {{and men in}} the regular army and reserves; by the same date in 1917, it had grown {{to a total of}} 250,000. In 1914, when the BEF arrived in France, there were two Engineer field companies attached to each infantry division, which was increased to three companies by September 1914. Each division also had a Signals company, which was responsible for <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> Corps, Division and Brigade headquarters.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1971, Lon Nol (now president) {{launched}} Operation Chenla II in {{an effort}} to open <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> Phnom Penh and the nation's second largest city, Kompong Thom. The two cities had been isolated from another {{for more than a year}} by the Khmer Rouge. FANK was initially successful, but the insurgents (backed by PAVN regulars) launched a counteroffensive and annihilated the government forces. By the end of the year the government was facing approximately 40,000 insurgents, who had taken on most of the ground fighting against the government.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian {{artillery}} battery, while <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting that the attack was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to.|$|E
5|$|Python {{can serve}} as a {{scripting}} language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{conducted an}} intensive search for I-174 {{in the days}} after the attack in the mistaken belief that she had been significantly damaged. This search was not successful and highlighted the unsatisfactory <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). However, another Japanese submarine passing through the area may have been sunk by RAAF aircraft. Because of Japan's deteriorating strategic situation, I-174 was the last Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) submarine to operate off the Australian east coast.|$|E
5|$|The <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> Flight 370 and the {{satellite}} communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues {{to the location of}} Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E
5|$|The first attested {{instance}} of strong resistance to Alboin's migration {{took place at}} the town of Ticinum (Pavia), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years.

5|$|The {{speed of}} light has become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave <b>communications</b> <b>between</b> trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the {{speed of light}} in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower at {{the speed of light}} through glass.|$|E
