5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude {{before or after}} diving <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E
5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} move around each other in stable orbits. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant impact on their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs. These <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.|$|E

5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained {{only a small}} part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E

Since termini are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E

In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
