5|$|Paul Tremo (1733/34–1810) was {{the head}} <b>chef</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> court of King Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski of Poland. He was born in Berlin, {{in a family of}} French Huguenots.

He followed the king to Saint Petersburg after the latter's abdication in 1795, but returned to Warsaw after his death in 1798.

Richard Stevenson, <b>chef</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
