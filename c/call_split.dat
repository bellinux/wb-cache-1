The delineation to municipal boundaries forms {{the bulk of the}} improvements to this algorithm. It is performed as a two step process, which we <b>call</b> <b>split</b> and merge. The quadtree rasterization algorithm remains unchanged from the original work by Moeckel and Donnelly, only translated to the programming language Python.|$|E
40|$|In this work, a new {{variant of}} the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is {{presented}} where the vehicles cannot perform any route leg longer than a given length L (although the routes can be longer). Thus, once a route leg length is close to L, the vehicle must go to a stop node to end the leg or return to the depot. We introduce this condition in {{a variation of the}} CVRP, the Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem, where multiple visits to a customer by different vehicles are allowed. We present two formulations for this problem which we <b>call</b> <b>Split</b> Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Stop Nodes: a vehicle flow formulation and a commodity flow formulation. Because of the complexity of this problem, a heuristic approach is developed. We compare its performance with and without the stop node...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{methodology}} that we <b>call</b> <b>split</b> sampling methods to estimate high dimensional expectations and rare event probabilities. Split sampling uses an auxiliary variable MCMC simulation and expresses {{the expectation of}} interest as an integrated set of rare event probabilities. We derive our estimator from a Rao-Blackwellised estimate of a marginal auxiliary variable distribution. We illustrate our method with two applications. First, we compute a shortest network path rare event probability and compare our method to estimation to a cross entropy approach. Then, we compute a normalisation constant of a high dimensional mixture of Gaussians and compare our estimate to one based on nested sampling. We discuss the relationship between our method and other alternatives such {{as the product of}} conditional probability estimator and importance sampling. The methods developed here are available in the R package: SplitSampling...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{hardware}} for cache {{management that}} we <b>call</b> <b>split</b> cache is presented. With {{some help from}} the compiler, a program can dynamically split the cache in several caches of any size that is power of two, and choose in which cache each data element is mapped. When properly used, this scheme can reduce the conflict misses near to zero. Moreover, as the total capacity of the original cache is used in a more optimal way, also the capacity misses can be reduced. 1 Introduction The increasing gap between processor speed and main memory speed has made the cache misses to become the performance bottleneck in program execution. Thus, {{it is very important}} to reduce the cache misses as much as possible. Three types of cache misses can be distinguished [2], compulsory, capacity and conflict. The first two depend on the size of the working set of the code and on the size of the cache memory. The third type depends on the cache organization and, given a certain cache capacity, varies dependi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Instrumental Variables (IV) {{estimates}} tend to {{be biased}} {{in the same direction}} as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in finite samples if the instruments are weak. To address this problem we propose a new IV estimator which we <b>call</b> <b>Split</b> Sample Instrumental Variables (SSIV). SSIV works as follows: we randomly split the sample in half, and use one half of the sample to estimate parameters of the first-stage equation. We then use these estimated first-stage parameters to construct fitted values and second-stage parameter estimates using data from the other half sample. SSIV is biased toward zero, rather than toward the plim of the OLS estimate. However, an unbiased estimate of the attenuation bias of SSIV can be calculated. We us this estimate of the attenutation bias to derive an estimator that is asymptotically unbiased as the number of instruments tends to infinity, holding the number of observations per instrument fixed. We label this new estimator Unbiased Split Sample Instrumental Variables (USSIV). We apply SSIV and USSIV to the data used by Angrist and Krueger (1991) to estimate the payoff to education. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{separability}} problem in the field of Quantum information theory. We deal mainly with the bipartite finite dimensional case and with two types of matrices, one of them being the PPT matrices. We proved that many results holds for both types. If these matrices have specific Hermitian Schmidt decompositions then the matrices are separable in a very strong sense. We proved that both types have what we <b>call</b> <b>split</b> decompositions. We defined the notion of weak irreducible matrix, based on the concept of irreducible state defined recently. These split decomposition theorems together with the notion of weak irreducible matrix, imply that these matrices are weak irreducible or a sum of weak irreducible matrices of the same type. The separability problem for these types of matrices can be reduced to the set of weak irreducible matrices of the same type. We also provided a complete description of weak irreducible matrices of both types. Using the fact that every positive semidefinite Hermitian matrix with tensor rank 2 is separable, we found sharp inequalites providing separability for both types...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn many {{real life}} {{situations}} (such as department stores, or passport control booths in airports) parallel queues are formed {{in front of}} control stations. Typically, some of the stations are manned while others are not. Classical queuing theory considers the configuration constant, and concentrates on the arrival process. This work explores {{a new line of}} research—the case in which the configuration is dynamic, and the customers can plan to cope with anticipated changes. Specifically, as the queues build up, management assigns additional officers to the unmanned stations. When this happens—some people move to the newly manned queues from nearby busy queues. In anticipation, people may prefer to line up in busy queues next to unmanned ones. Mathematically we discuss the problem of dynamic arrangement of the queues in a service system where at any time each server can be in either an active or an inactive mode. A balancing strategy determines how customers will be reallocated when a station becomes active. Given a balancing strategy, we seek a partition of customers to queues that minimizes the maximum wait time of a customer in each of the active stations, thereby keeping the system balanced at all times. We study two balancing strategies that we <b>call</b> <b>Split</b> and Trim. For the Split strategy we discuss a special case (the stations are ordered on a line and a single unmanned station is at one end). We show how an optimal partition can be calculated recursively. We then give partitions that approximate the minimal expected wait time within a factor of 1 +O(1 /N), under each of these strategies, where N is the number of stations. We obtain similar bounds (to within factor 2) for the case, where the number of active servers can be any 1 ⩽n⩽N− 1, and the balancing strategy is Trim...|$|E
