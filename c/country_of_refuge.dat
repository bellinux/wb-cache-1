500|$|A {{major problem}} impeding Nansen's {{work on behalf}} of {{refugees}} was that most of them lacked documentary proof of identity or nationality. Without legal status in their <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge,</b> their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the [...] "Nansen passport", a form of identity for stateless persons that was in time recognised by more than 50 governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Among the more distinguished holders of Nansen passports were the artist Marc Chagall, the composer Igor Stravinsky, and the dancer Anna Pavlova. Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups. After the Greco-Turkish wars of 1919–1922 Nansen travelled to Istanbul to negotiate the resettlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} refugees, mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army. The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in, and so Nansen devised a scheme for a population exchange whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland. Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange, the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years. In November 1922, while attending the Conference of Lausanne, Nansen learned that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1922. The citation referred to [...] "his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine, and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace". Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.|$|E

NO ABSTRACTINTRODUCTION: All {{over the}} world there are {{millions}} of desperate people who seek refuge in other countries and so these countries are all affected by the situations of refugees. These people we call “refugees” are human beings who leave their countries and cross borders {{to find a place to}} secure their lives. The realities of the refugees are at the same time global, regional or local. They are in fact treated differently depending on the policies <b>of</b> the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> though they might, to some extent, be treated in the same ways according to the UNHCR charter. Whilst they run for their lives, they face all other challenges of life that affect the globe and the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge...</b>|$|R

Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.From 1925 onwards he spent much time trying to help Armenian refugees, victims of Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War and further ill-treatment thereafter. His goal was the establishment of a national home for these refugees, within the borders of Soviet Armenia. His main assistant in this endeavour was Vidkun Quisling, the future Nazi collaborator and head of a Norwegian puppet government during the Second World War. After visiting the region, Nansen presented the Assembly with a modest plan for the irrigation of 36,000 hectares (360 km2 or 139 square miles) on which 15,000 refugees could be settled. The plan ultimately failed, because even with Nansen's unremitting advocacy the money to finance the scheme was not forthcoming. Despite this failure, his reputation among the Armenian people remains high. Nansen wrote the book, Armenia and the Near East in 1923 which describes his sympathies to the plight of the Armenians in the wake of losing its independence to the Soviet Union. The book was translated in many languages including Norwegian, English, French, German, Russian and Armenian. After his visit to Armenia, Nansen wrote two additional books called [...] "Gjennem Armenia" [...] ("Across Armenia"), published in 1927 and [...] "Gjennem Kaukasus til Volga" [...] ("Through Caucasus to Volga").|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper investigated the engagement of students who arrived in Australian secondary schools as refugees from Africa. Enrolment of large cohorts of refugees from Africa {{is a relatively new}} phenomenon in the English-speaking West. The literature provides evidence that emotional engagement with the promises of schooling is strong for many of the young African refugees. Students envision successful professional careers as doctors, engineers, lawyers, and IT experts; they envision returning to their country as professionals able to help the people. The question investigated in this paper is: How does schooling in Australia impact on young African refugees’ education and career aspirations? Engagement is understood in Bourdieuian terms as dispositions to be and to become an educated person. This is a disposition which entails fundamental belief {{in the value of the}} stakes of schooling. The data analysed in the paper were produced in a study undertaken in the state of Queensland where 5000 of the 39 000 African refugees who have arrived in Australia since 2000 have settled. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with students and their parents and teachers after arrival in an intensive language school, and then after transition to a regular secondary school. The findings show both the durability and malleability of educational dispositions in conditions of dramatic social change occasioned by refugee experience. Engagement in the stakes of schooling is both built and eroded as students flee their homelands for <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> Previously unimaginable educational dreams are possible for some; but for others, long-held dreams become unattainable.

40|$|UNHCR {{is charged}} with the pursuit of durable {{solutions}} for the problem of refugees. Those solutions are voluntary repatriation and assimilation within new national communities which means either local integration in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> - tangentially touched upon in this paper - or resettlement in a third state. ‘Voluntary repatriation’ is the generally preferred solution whilst ‘resettlement’ {{is considered to be}} the solution of last resort. This chapter will focus on the limitations of both solutions. Voluntary repatriation is an inherently complex and demanding solution. Beyond that, it hinges on the formal link of nationality - alternatively, in the absence of that particular link and even more tenuous: mere residence in the country of origin - of the refugees concerned even though that link may, owing to the passage of time, have turned into a rather artificial one and the same applies to former habitual residence of one’s forebears. Resettlement is a solution for relatively few refugees, tainted by scarcity and the leeway that apparently is considered, right or wrong, to inhere in the discretion of states to offer resettlement places. Both solutions date from a specific historic time and context, whereby resettlement, rather than local integration, developed as the solution for those who had valid objections to returning to their respective countries of origin. Nonetheless, {{on the basis of the}} 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, those with valid objections to return - that is, refugees in the sense of the Convention - are in essence entitled to local integration in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge</b> rather than resettlement.

Which are the most important of pre- or post-displacement factors for Syrian domestic security? Critically applying Lischer’s theory on refugee-related political violence, this field-based study of predominantly Christian Iraqi refugees in a Damascene suburb presents data on and analyzes such factors, respectively the ‘context’ (causes of flight in country of origin) and ‘characteristics’ (socioeconomic situation in <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge)</b> of the refugee situation. Offering a possible theoretical critique of Lischer’s analytical framework, I argue that the question of domestic security in Syria seems to be largely a matter of socioeconomic characteristics, i. e. of policy effectiveness in meeting the socioeconomic needs of urban refugees and locals. Consequently, relief and development should be linked and Syria must start capitalizing on Iraqi human capital by allowing refugees to lead more productive lives...|$|E

In 2004, the Immigration Act Commission (IAC) published a proposal for possible reforms, initiating political discussions that culminated in new rules for family migration introduced in 2007 and 2010 – all under the long Social Democratic government led by Jens Stoltenberg (2005 – 13). The commission raised the problem of forced marriages between young people in Norway of immigrant descent and new foreign spouses, and proposed a requirement that both spouses be at least 21, to ensure they were mature enough to resist family and cultural pressure (Immigration Act Commission, 2004, p. 243). While the commission noted that liberal family reunification policies worked to attract asylum seekers to the country, it did not deem using family migration rules to deter asylum seekers appropriate because they “risk serious abuses in their home country, {{and there is no}} other way to ensure family unity than through family reunification in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuge.</b> Respect for family unity in cases where one of the family members are entitled to stay in Norway in accordance with our international obligations, must be an obvious precondition for Norwegian family immigration” (Immigration Act Commission, 2004, p. 214).|$|E
