5|$|After Palko, the Court {{examined}} Bill of Rights protections one by one. Despite this incremental approach, the <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> eventually apply most {{rights to}} the states.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} reverse criminal convictions due to {{the exclusion}} of women from the jury pool in Taylor v. Louisiana (1975) and Duren v. Missouri (1979). The fair cross-section requirement was extended to civil cases in Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co. (1946), where wage earners had been excluded from the jury pool.|$|E

5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, it was {{announced}} that actress Jennifer Aniston would guest star on 30 Rock. The following month it was confirmed by NBC that she would play a woman obsessed with Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. She filmed her scenes on August 29 and September 4, 2008. In November 2008, it {{was announced}} that actors Markie Post, Harry Anderson and Charlie Robinson, the cast of the situation comedy show Night <b>Court,</b> <b>would</b> make a cameo on the show.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} {{the case would}} be heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge. His court at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, was {{converted}} to accommodate the case by raising {{the height of the}} bench and witness box and installing new seating. In May it was announced that the case would start on 1 June, and that entry to the <b>court</b> <b>would</b> be by ticket only.|$|E
50|$|Regular {{criminal}} <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> remain {{essentially the}} same, though {{there might be}} more juries.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Appeals <b>Courts</b> <b>would</b> {{not find}} the fraud-on-the-market {{presumption}} rebutted again until April 12, 2016.|$|R

5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which <b>court</b> <b>would</b> hear cases such as Hamdan's. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed notice with several federal judges, and given notice to {{hundreds}} of detainees, that the habeas petitions of alien unlawful enemy combatants (or those whose status is to be determined) are not within the jurisdiction of those courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship. The {{followers}} of Zoroaster {{would have found}} the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, {{there is evidence that}} Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta. The Sassanid <b>court</b> <b>would</b> later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights. In {{the event that the}} <b>court</b> <b>would</b> decide that the hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E

5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which <b>court</b> <b>would</b> deal with the common law and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal <b>court</b> <b>would</b> have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the <b>court</b> <b>would</b> be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, the Ninth Circuit's {{ruling in}} UMG [...] {{seems to suggest}} that, in future, the <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> side with the service providers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, New York City <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> {{publicly}} burn the counterfeit bills they gathered, {{to show that}} they were both dangerous and worthless.|$|R
50|$|The {{repeal of}} the Judiciary Act also ended the brief period of {{comprehensive}} Federal-question jurisdiction. The federal <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> not receive such jurisdiction again until 1875.|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the <b>court</b> <b>would</b> have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, {{in order to save}} £15m in annual running costs and £22m in necessary maintenance. The courts threatened with closure in Wales were Aberdare, Llangefni, Pontypool and Rhyl. In addition, it was proposed that Newport County <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> no longer hold hearings at Chepstow every fortnight (as had been done since the county court there closed in 2002). After consultation, it was decided to keep Llangefni County Court open, but the other closures were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no <b>court</b> <b>would</b> enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
50|$|Is the Supreme Court the {{appropriate}} forum for this case? Would the FISC or the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) {{be a better}} place for this to be heard? EPIC argues that those <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> not have the authority to provide the relief it seeks. However, at least one academic is of the belief that this is an erroneous argument and that starting in one of those two lower <b>courts</b> <b>would,</b> even if denied, provide a better path to the Supreme Court.|$|R
5000|$|Judicial Power would {{reside in}} the Federal Supreme <b>Court,</b> which <b>would</b> be {{composed}} [...] "of three magistrates for each state of the federation" [...] (Article 73) that would never be elected by the Executive Power or the Legislative Power. It also would establish that all <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> be profession and the judicial institution for all classes of representatives.|$|R
50|$|Looking at {{the issue}} from the non-American perspective, courts in some {{countries}} exercise jurisdiction based upon principles that American <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> consider unfair and repugnant to American law.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} hostility of Bede has {{obscured}} Penda's importance as ruler who wielded an imperium {{similar to that of}} other prominent 7th century 'overkings'. Penda's hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would have been based on personal as well as political ties, and they would often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda's <b>court</b> <b>would</b> have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III {{federal judges}} during his presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice {{to serve on the}} Supreme Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the <b>court</b> <b>would</b> shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that the <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> be unable to rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E
50|$|The Princess Who Loved Insects {{was about}} a clever and {{beautiful}} princess who rather than beautifying herself and <b>courting,</b> <b>would</b> spend her time outdoors playing with bugs and caterpillars.|$|R
50|$|Even if Mdani {{stands as}} law, it is {{possible}} that the <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> allow such evidence in the future on the basis of their power to admit hearsay evidence in certain circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The kommandant {{issued an}} order in Guernsey on 2 July 1940 and in Jersey on 8 July 1940 instructing that laws {{passed by the}} legislatures {{would have to be}} given assent by the kommandant and that German orders were to be {{registered}} as legislation. The civil <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> continue in operation, but German military <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> try breaches of German law. At first the bailiffs submitted legislation for the assent of the kommandant signed in their capacities as lieutenant governors. At the end of 1941, the kommandant objected to this style and subsequent legislation was submitted simply signed as bailiff.|$|R
