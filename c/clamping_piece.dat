40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an extensive {{investigation of the}} real testing conditions of plane shear tests under quasi-static as well as impact loading. In particular, it aims at analyzing {{the role played by}} the empirical corrective coefficients commonly used in this kind of tests. For this purpose, a complete numerical model including not only specimen but also clamping device is built. Compared with usual simulations of only a shear specimen used to establish these corrective coefficients, the proposed complete numerical model permits to evaluate the influence of clamping device on the distribution of stress and strain fields. It shows that there are only limited effects under static loading, except for the early stage of loading (elastic part) where the stiffness of clamping device has to be taken into account. Under dynamic loading, a similar conclusion as the static case has been made. However, the transient effect due to the wave propagation within <b>clamping</b> <b>pieces</b> is rather important before an equilibrium state is reached. Numerical results indicate also that the shear loading on the specimen is mainly guided by the compressive wave in the massive <b>clamping</b> <b>pieces,</b> and the shear wave propagation inside the shear area is negligible. Besides, the way to calculate the equivalent strain from experimentally measured displacement is discussed. Eulerian cumulated strain, which is the default large strain definition in most commercial codes, should be used instead of the idealized small strain shear assumption. Finally, this work indicates that when the average value of equivalent stress in the whole shear area and cumulated Eulerian strain are used, commonly used corrective coefficients are no longer needed...|$|R

It causes pain by the {{pinching}} of the nipple, by the restriction of blood flow, and by the reintroduction of blood flow. Nipple clamps are used in some BDSM activities, such as breast torture. The main types of nipple clamps are the clover <b>clamp,</b> tweezer <b>clamp,</b> <b>piecing</b> <b>clamp,</b> and clothes-pin style, though any device that applies direct pressure can be used. Clamps are typically used in pairs and connected by a chain. Weights may be hung from the clamps to amplify the pain by increasing the pressure and pinching. The chain may be wrapped behind a fixed piece of erotic furniture such as a post, so that, when the wearer is prodded to jump or otherwise move suddenly, pain is increased by pulling of the nipples. Another variation involves attaching another chain to the chain, the end of which is connected to a clamp attached to either the clitoris for a female or a cock ring for a male. This variation is known as the [...] "Y clamps" [...] for the shape of the chain linking all 3 connection points when attached to the body.|$|R

The conducted experiments analyze the forcedependent contact resistance between three different conductors and metal strip lines of different widths.

The channel activity was increased up to 150 -fold by photoreleasing caged ATP inside the patch pipette in the presence of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. The sharp increase in open probability could be accounted for by a decrease of the slow component of the closed time distribution from 23 s to 170 ms with little change in the distribution of open times (1 - 2 ms) and no change in the single channel current amplitude.

Diffusion bonding must be done in a vacuum or inert gas environment when using metals that have strong oxide layers (i.e. copper).

In the aim to define the regions of interest (ROI) in real image within ROI given by 3 D CAD model, we project a 3 D CAD model in the real image, e. g. augmented reality. To automatically check the accordance between every region defined, we propose to compute three parametres, such as skeleton to represente the form, edges to represent a geometry and Area to represent dimension. We compute a score of accordance between three parameters that will be analyzed in fuzzy system to get a decision of conformity of the clamping element within it definition given in the CAD model.

If the machining setup has not been assembled correctly by the operator and is not conform to the 3 D CAD model sent to the machining unit, such collisions can occur. We have developed a vision system, that utilizes a single camera, to automatically check the conformity of the actual machining setup within the desired 3 D CAD model, before launching the machining operation. First, we propose a configuration of the camera within the machining setup to ensure a best acquisition of the scene. In the aim to segmente the image in regions of interest, e. g. regions of the <b>clamping</b> elements and <b>piece,</b> based-on 3 D CAD model, we realise a matching between graphes, theorical and real graphe computed from theorical image of 3 D-CAD model and real image given by real camera. The graphs are constructed from a simple feature, such as circles and lines, that are manely present in the machining setup. In the aim to define the regions of interest (ROI) in real image within ROI given by 3 D CAD model, we project a 3 D CAD model in the real image, e. g. augmented reality. To automatically check the accordance between every region defined, we propose to compute three parametres, such as skeleton to represente the form, edges to represent a geometry and Area to represent dimension. We compute a score of accordance between three parameters that will be analyzed in fuzzy system to get a decision of conformity of the clamping element within it definition given in the CAD model. Some cases of machining setup configurations require 3 D information to test the trajectory of the machine tool. To get out this situation, we have proposed a new depth from defocus based-method to compute a depth map of the scene. Finally, we present the result of our solution and we show the feasibility and robustness of the proposed solution in differents case of machining setup.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and preliminary engineering calculations {{have been completed}} for a two cassette cryostat. This report summarizes the design. A cryocooler is permanently mounted {{in the center of}} a stainless steel, 0. 75 inch thick top lid. The cryocooler sits upon a spacer which raises the cooling stage elevations to favorably match the cassette heat intercept elevations. The top lid (32. 0 -inch outside diameter) mates to a 24 -inch pipe size flange with o-ring. The 24 -inch pipe size vacuum vessel with end plate has a minimum internal depth of 16 -inch to give adequate clearance for the depth of the cryocooler and multilayer insulation blankets. Support stand legs elevate the container to a convenient height and allow for placement of the AFE power supply underneath. Two cassette slots are located on either side of the cryocooler. The slots are positioned parallel to each other, 10. 5 -inch center to center (6 standard cassette slot widths) so that the standard 8 slot AFE backplane can be used. The slot opening through the lid is approximately 1. 422 -inch x 16. 782 -inch. A 0. 016 -inch thick titanium (Ti- 6 AI- 4 V) envelope with sealing lip is inserted through lid and defines the gas helium boundary that the VLPC cassette resides. The internal dimensions of the titanium envelope are 1. 390 -inch x 16. 75 -inch x 10. 531 -inch deep. When the cassette is inserted the clearances will be 0. 015 -inch on the long side, 0. 063 -inch on the short side, and 0. 032 -inch at the bottom. The cassette gasket seals against the top lip of the titanium envelope. A soft gasket or thin vacuum sealant tape seals the underside of the titanium envelope to the top surface of the lid. A clamping hold down bar may be necessary to make this vacuum seal. Gas helium for the cassette space is supplied through a fitting and port that is added to the cassette bulkhead assembly. This is the only modification necessary the standard D-Zero cassette. Evacuation and backfilling and then stagnant positive pressure are achieved through this one port. After the titanium envelope/pocket and cassette are mounted to the top lid, the lid is raised so that assembly work can be accomplished below. Three pneumatic cylinders mounted to the lid are pressurized (with air or the gas helium source) to raise the lid. Safety linkages are installed to prevent accidental lowering of the lid while work is being performed. Honeycomb sandwich panels are attached to the titanium envelope to support the thin envelope against the pressure differential. A thin thermoplastic mesh placed between the honeycomb panel and titanium envelope helps to insulate the panel so it is not a significant parallel heat path down the wall. There are two panel sets for each cassette. One for the area above the upper intercept and one set for the area below. It is reasonable that a 0. 40 -inch thick panel will suffice. A high conductance thermal link is made between the first stage of the cryocooler and the uppermost intercept location. This is solid OFHC copper part with a short section of flexible copper braid that connects to bars that clamp solidly to the long sides of the cassette envelope. Apiezon 'N' grease is used at assembly to enhance heat transfer at the clamp bar to titanium envelope interface. A second high conductance thermal connection is made between the second stage of the cryocooler and the bottom of the cassette envelope. The link is mostly solid OFHC copper along with a short flexible braid section in between. The two <b>piece</b> <b>clamping</b> bar encases the bottom 1. 75 -inch of the cassette. Thermal grease is used at the interface...|$|R
