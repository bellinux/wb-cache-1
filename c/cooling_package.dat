40|$|Testing {{cooling air}} flow on scaled vehicle models has become {{increasingly}} popular amongst car manufactures. To be able to predict the drag and lift changes at low cost early in the development the model has to be equipped with detailed engine compartments, including the radiator. Scaling a full size <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> is not possible due to the geometry and the changes of the flow. Thus is it common to simplify the <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> and fine tune it to match {{the properties of the}} full size radiator. The aim of this diploma work was to develop {{and with the help of}} numerics verify a simplified radiator package for a scaled wind tunnel car model. The main property of interest was the pressure drop. It was also important to design a radiator model that has a flow which was similar to the original <b>cooling</b> <b>package.</b> To determine the pressure drop of the full size radiator the commercial CFD code Fluent was used. The results from the simulations were used as reference when the radiator simulator was designed due to the limited amount of data available concerning the original <b>cooling</b> <b>package.</b> The core of the radiator model consists of honeycomb with flow guiding properties and mesh that creates the pressure drop. A number of different meshes were used to calibrate the radiator model in a test rig. Then was the total pressure measured in front of and behind the model to determine the pressure drop.

40|$|The {{extensive}} environmental {{debate of}} today forces vehicle manufacturers {{to develop new}} concepts with lower fuel consumption and emission levels than ever before. One way of reducing the fuel consumption {{is to improve the}} aerodynamic features of the vehicle. One source of drag is ascribed to the so-called cooling drag, which is defined as the resistance produced by the air passing through the underhood cooling system. A decreased amount of cooling air drag can result in substantial fuel consumption and emission reductions for heavy trucks. The objectives in this research is to quantify the possible reduction in drag as a consequence of a restricted cooling air intake area for a Volvo FH 16. Two approaches are used; the first method is to cover the grill area of the truck and the second method is to cover the <b>cooling</b> <b>package.</b> Two degrees of coverage exist in the study; the grill or the cooling system is either 100 % covered or covered up to the Air Condition (AC) condenser. Another study that is carried out is to investigate the influence of a closed splitline. The results are achieved by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the two commercial softwares ANSA and StarCCM+ are the tools used in this research. The results from the simulations show that it is preferable to cover the grill compared to cover at the <b>cooling</b> <b>package.</b> Covering the grill and splitline of the Volvo FH 16 results in a fuel consumption reduction of 2. 3 % compared to the original truck configuration. A trend that is clearly seen is that a closed splitline always decreases drag for all the tested truck configurations. Even though a closed grill is preferred compared to a closed <b>cooling</b> <b>package,</b> it can still be worth to develop a technical solution for covering the <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> if no suitable technical solution can be found for covering the grill. The reduction in drag for a covered <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> is still quite substantial. The case with fully covered <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> shows a fuel consumption reduction of 1. 2 %. As a conclusion {{it can be said that}} restricting the cooling air intake area for the Volvo FH 16 can result in a substantial fuel consumption reduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A key {{challenge}} in chip multiprocessor (CMP) design is {{to optimize the}} performance within a power budget limited by the CMP’s <b>cooling,</b> <b>packaging,</b> and power supply capacities. Most existing solutions rely solely on DVFS to adapt the power consumption of CPU cores, without coordinating with the last-level on-chip (e. g., L 2) cache. This paper proposes DPPC, a chip-level power partitioning and capping strategy that can dynamically and explicitly partition the chip-level power budget among different CPU cores and the shared last-level cache in a CMP based on the workload characteristics measured online. DPPC features a novel performance-power model and an online model estimator to quantitatively estimate the performance contributed by each core and the cache with their respective local power budgets. DPPC then re-partitions the chip-level power budget among them for optimized CMP performance. The partitioned local power budgets for the CPU cores and cache are precisely enforced by power capping algorithms designed rigorously based on feedback control theory. Our experimental results demonstrate that DPPC achieves better CMP performance, within a given power budget, than several state-of-the-art power capping solutions. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is a continuing}} analysis of cooling performance and aerodynamic properties of a rear mounted cooling module on a semi generic commercial vehicle, which {{was carried out by}} Larsson, Löfdahl and Wiklund [1]. In the previous study two designs of the <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> installation were positioned behind the rear wheelhouse and the results were compared to a front mounted cooling module. The investigation was mainly focused on a critical cooling situation occurring at lower vehicle speeds for a distribution vehicle. The conclusion from the study was that the cooling performance for one of the rear mounted installation was favorable compared to the front mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>package.</b> This was mainly due to the low vehicle speed, the high fan speed and to fewer obstacles around the cooling module resulting in a lower system restriction within the installation. The main purpose with the present investigation was to determine the power needed to overcome the aerodynamic drag together with the power needed by the fan to obtain a specific cooling performance at a higher vehicle speed. One front and three rear mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> installations with a vehicle operating at 90 km/h were included in the analysis. The study the vehicle geometry was modified to be able to implement the changes for the rear cooling module installations. The design of the air inlet, air outlet and the duct in front of and after the <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> were changed for the rear mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> installation to improve the airflow and as a result the cooling performance. The investigation was performed by the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics. It was found that the total power required due to aerodynamic drag and fan operation to obtain a specific cooling performance was reduced for two of the rear mounted compared to the front mounted cooling module. Even though the fan for these installations required more power, the total power needed by the vehicle was decreased due to a lower aerodynamic resistance. The total power demand was decreased by 1. 9 kW for one of the rear mounted installations compared to the front mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>package.</b> Furthermore it was established that the design of the air inlet for a rear mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> was important to obtain a low total power demand, a high mass flow of air through the cooling module and to obtain an uniform flow over the heat exchangers. For a critical driving situation due to cooling performance, occurring at lower vehicle speeds, the rear mounted cooling packages were also favorable due to cooling performance compared to the front mounted cooling module installation. This was mainly due to the lower system resistance and higher static fan efficiency received for these installations. To increase the cooling performance and decrease the required power even more the air inlet, the fan choice and the duct geometry can be further developed...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade the drag {{coefficient}} of most passenger cars has dropped significantly to values around 0. 3 and for certain models even below.

40|$|The {{current work}} investigates a method in 1 D {{modeling}} of cooling systems including discretized <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> with non-uniform boundary conditions. In a stacked <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> the heat transfer through each heat exchanger {{depends on the}} mass flows and temperature fields. These {{are a result of}} complex three-dimensional phenomena, which take place in the under-hood and are highly non-uniform. A typical approach in 1 D simulations is to assume these to be uniform, which reduces the authenticity of the simulation and calls for additional calibrations, normally done with input from test measurements. The presented work employs 3 D CFD simulations of complete vehicle in STAR-CCM+ to perform a comprehensive study of mass-flow and thermal distribution over the inlet of the <b>cooling</b> <b>package</b> of a Volvo FM commercial vehicle in several steady-state operating points. The results from these are correlated with test readings and are imposed on a 1 D model of the cooling stack with inlet discretization, which features non-uniform boundary conditions. The 1 D model is tested in steady state and transient conditions. Results are correlated with readings from dynamometer tests. No major indications were present to support that the non-uniform approach improves accuracy of simulation.

The contribution of deforestation to the crop-production stage was significant, particularly for climate change, equaling 19 % of total emissions of CO(2) eq per tonne of <b>cooled</b> and <b>packaged</b> chicken, in the system of the Center-West of Brazil. The French systems were also affected, since they import crops from Brazil. The system of southern Brazil had less climate change impact because there is no longer deforestation in southern Brazil for crop production...|$|R
