60|$|A {{place so}} much given to gossip as Venice did {{not fail to}} produce many memorable {{incidents}} of the cold; but the most singular adventure {{was that of the}} old man employed at the Armenian Convent to bring milk from the island of San Lazzaro to the city. One night, shortly after the coldest weather set in, he lost his oar as he was returning to the island. The wind, which is particularly furious {{in that part of the}} lagoon, blew his boat away into the night, and the good brothers at the convent naturally gave up their milkman for lost. The winds and waters drifted him eight miles from the city into the northern lagoon, and there lodged his boat in the marshes, where it froze fast in the stiffening mud. The luckless occupant had nothing to eat or drink in his boat, where he remained five days and nights, exposed to the inclemency of cold many degrees below friendship in severity. He made continual signs of distress, but no boat came near enough to discover him. At last, when the whole marsh was frozen solid, he was taken off by some fishermen, and carried to the convent, where he remains in perfectly recovered health, and where no doubt he will be preserved alive many years in an atmosphere which renders dying a San Lazzaro a matter of no small difficulty. During the whole time of his imprisonment, he sustained life against hunger and <b>cold</b> by <b>smoking.</b> I suppose no one will be surprised to learn that he was rescued by the fishermen through the miraculous interposition of the Madonna--as any one might have seen by the votive picture hung up at her shrine on a bridge of the Riva degli Schiavoni, wherein the Virgin was represented breaking through the clouds in one corner of the sky, and unmistakably directing the operations of the fishermen.|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of mild hypertension {{and the treatment}} of hypertension require accurate measurement of blood pressure. Blood pressure readings are altered by various factors that influence the patient, the techniques used and {{the accuracy of the}} sphygmomanometer. The variability of readings can be reduced if informed patients prepare in advance by emptying their bladder and bowel, by avoiding over-the-counter vasoactive drugs the day of measurement and by avoiding exposure to <b>cold,</b> caffeine consumption, <b>smoking</b> and physical exertion within half an hour before measurement. The use of standardized techniques to measure blood pressure will help to avoid large systematic errors. Poor technique can account for differences in readings of more than 15 mm Hg and ultimately misdiagnosis. Most of the recommended procedures are simple and, when routinely incorporated into clinical practice, require little additional time. The equipment must be appropriate and in good condition. Physicians should have a suitable selection of cuff sizes readily available; the use of the correct cuff size is essential to minimize systematic errors in blood pressure measurement. Semiannual calibration of aneroid sphygmomanometers and annual inspection of mercury sphygmomanometers and blood pressure cuffs are recommended.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{people spend}} {{considerable}} amount of time each day in equine stable environments either as employees in the care and training of horses or in leisure activity. However, there are few studies available on how the stable environment affects human airways. This study examined in one horse stable qualitative differences in indoor air during winter and late summer conditions and assessed whether air quality was associated with clinically detectable respiratory signs or alterations to selected biomarkers of inflammation and lung function in stable personnel. Methods The horse stable environment and stable-workers (n = 13) in one stable were investigated three times; first in the winter, second in the interjacent late summer and {{the third time in}} the following winter stabling period. The stable measurements included levels of ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, total and respirable dust, airborne horse allergen, microorganisms, endotoxin and glucan. The stable-workers completed a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, underwent nasal lavage with subsequent analysis of inflammation markers, and performed repeated measurements of pulmonary function. Results Measurements in the horse stable showed low organic dust levels and high horse allergen levels. Increased viable level of fungi in the air indicated a growing source in the stable. Air particle load as well as 1, 3 -β-glucan was higher at the two winter time-points, whereas endotoxin levels were higher at the summer time-point. Two stable-workers showed signs of bronchial obstruction with increased PEF-variability, increased inflammation biomarkers relating to reported allergy, <b>cold</b> or <b>smoking</b> and reported partly work-related symptoms. Furthermore, two other stable-workers reported work-related airway symptoms, of which one had doctor's diagnosed asthma which was well treated. Conclusion Biomarkers involved in the development of airway diseases have been studied in relation to environmental exposure levels in equine stables. Respirable dust and 1, 3 -β-glucan levels were increased at winter stabling conditions. Some employees (3 / 13) had signs of bronchial obstruction, which may be aggravated by working in the stable environment. This study contributes to the identification of suitable biomarkers to monitor the indoor horse stable environment and the personnel. An improved management of the stable climate will be beneficial for the health of both stable workers and horses. </p...|$|R

In winter the sawdust needs less or no oxygen removed and more 'fire' is needed to start the sawdust smoldering. The fillets are left overnight for a minimum of 8 hours. Regular monitoring of the smoking process by skilled smokers is carried out to ensure the fish is smoked evenly, moving and removing fish when necessary. There is no heat involved, this is because the fish would start to cook during the smoking process and would start to flake and fall from the speats.The fish are then removed from the smokehouses and allowed to cool.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different cooking and smoking methods (boiling, frying, frying + boiling, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>smoking)</b> on oxidation and fatty acid composition of catfish (Arius maculatus) commercialized on the Wouri river coast was evalu- ated including commonly used analytical indexes (peroxide and acid values) and physical analysis by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The mean moisture, protein, ash and fat contents of raw fish were 75. 88 ± 0. 55; 64. 24 ± 0. 14; 10. 98 ± 0. 31 and 23. 02 ± 0. 88 respectively. All these treatments provoke the {{modification of the}} quality indexes. Lipid deterioration, thermolysis and lipid oxidation occurred throughout the treatment. Peroxide value decreased for all cooked and smoked catfish, while free fatty acids of smoked sample increased. The FTIR applied to evaluate lipid oxi- dation in extracted lipid clearly provided a better picture of the oxidation progress {{and led to a}} similar conclusion with chemical analysis. Boiled, bleaching hot and bleaching <b>cold</b> <b>smoking</b> were found to be the suitable treatment methods for catfish because they gave it a high nutritive value compared to other smoking methods.
