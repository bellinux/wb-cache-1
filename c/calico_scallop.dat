In the Indian River Lagoon in Florida, two other scallops occur: the bay scallop, (Argopecten irradians), which generally has a uniform gray to gray-brown coloration with distinct convexity {{of the right}} (lower) valve. The other is the rough scallop, (Aequipecten muscosus), which has unequal 'ears' and has sharp scales on the lower surface of the ribs.

50|$|The {{imperial}} venus clam, Chione latilirata, is a bivalve mollusc in {{the family}} Veneridae. It grows to about 4.5 cm (1.5 inches), and lives off the eastern shores of North and South America, south of Cape Hatteras, in 20 to 40 m (60 to 120 ft) depths. Occasionally it is found washed up on ocean shores. It ranges from North Carolina to Brazil. This species has been frequently found among catches of the Atlantic <b>calico</b> <b>scallop.</b>|$|E

40|$|A common {{property}} resource {{with open}} access, {{such as a}} fishery, {{will be used to}} excess when faced with sufficient demand. This will lead to an excessive amount of {{effort on the part of}} the fishery, resulting in a depletion of the stock. This paper discusses the development of a property rights regime for the Atlantic <b>calico</b> <b>scallop,</b> Argopecten gibbus, fishery of Florida. The management solution of the <b>Calico</b> <b>Scallop</b> Conservation Association (CSCA) provides an example of the assignment of property rights to a common property resource without resorting to governmental intervention. In this particular fishery, self-regulation limited early harvesting which would be uneconomic; there may be other fisheries in which self-regulation could be economically efficient and biologically appropriate. While this solution may not be applicable to all common property resources, for those cases which may be similar; the example of the CSCA provides valuable information that may be helpful in establishing a more efficient use of the resource. Some types of government facilitation may also be useful...|$|E

40|$|The Pacific <b>Calico</b> <b>scallop,</b> Argopecten ventricosus (Sowerby), is {{the most}} {{important}} commercial species in Bahia Concepcion. Catches declined steadily from 1991 to 1993 as a result of overexploitation, forcing the adoption of management measures. The Government has now established regulations for exploitation and scallop culture development. In 1994, Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR) and the Fisheries Department of the Mexican Government initiated research on the feasibility of increasing scallop biomass through a reseeding programme to protect artisanal fishing. The use of onion bags to collect spat in Bahia Concepcion (1988 - 1994) demonstrated that settlement was cumulative from January to March. At Punta Coloradito, there were two peaks, in January and early March. Commercial collectors were deployed in February at El Indio and in April at El Remate. In June, about one million juvenile scallops were placed in an enclosure, held until mid-August and then released. Mass mortality (> 80 %) of the scallops was observed in September, increasing to 99 % in October. The high water temperature and predators may be responsible for the mortalities...|$|E

Accumulation and possible biotransformation of toxins were measured by HPLC analysis. Feeding activity in treated scallops showed that scallops produced pseudofeces, ingestion rates decreased at 8 h; approximately 60 % of the scallops were paralyzed and melanin production and hemocyte aggregation were observed in several tissues at 15 h. HPLC analysis showed that the only toxins present in the dinoflagellates and scallops were the N-sulfo-carbamoyl toxins (C 1, C 2); after hydrolysis, the carbamate toxins (epimers GTX 2 / 3) were present. C 1 and C 2 toxins were most common in the mantle, followed by the digestive gland and stomach-complex, adductor muscle, kidney and rectum group, and finally, gills. Toxin profiles in scallop tissue were similar to the dinoflagellate; biotransformations were not present in the scallops in this short-term feeding experiment...|$|E
