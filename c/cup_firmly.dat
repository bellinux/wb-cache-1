This they filled with water, and then Twinkle, who was a trifle larger than the boy-lark, {{clutched}} the <b>cup</b> <b>firmly</b> with her toes and flew back to the orphans without spilling more than a few drops. They managed to pour some of the water into each open mouth, and then Twinkle said: ...|$|E

[...] Detroit Free Press gave the X360 version three stars out of four and stated: [...] "Thankfully for the folks at Electronic Arts, the only soccer competition available on the Xbox 360 is the previous FIFA game, and this World Cup edition is a step up from that incarnation, albeit a small one." [...] However, The Sydney Morning Herald gave the game three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "a fun football simulation for newcomers and the best FIFA of recent years.

50|$|Smith {{played in}} the 1978 All-Star Game, where he was named MVP. For {{the rest of the}} decade, he shared time in the Islanders net with Glenn Resch, where they {{combined}} to form perhaps the top goaltending duo in the NHL at the time. This changed in the 1980 playoffs, when the Isles rode Smith's goaltending to their first of four consecutive Stanley <b>Cups,</b> <b>firmly</b> establishing Smith as the team's starting goaltender. Resch was dealt to the Colorado Rockies the following season. Smith {{went on to become a}} First Team All-Star and Vezina Trophy winner in 1982. In 1983, he won the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed (shared with Roland Melanson). He was chosen to play for Canada in the 1981 Canada Cup, but was unable to play due to an injury sustained in a pre-tournament game.|$|R

Despite winning their first match of the season against the , they lost their remaining thirteen matches to finish bottom of the log, once again being required {{to play in a}} relegation play-off series. Adriaanse started both legs of the relegation series; despite Boland Cavaliers winning the first leg 36-35 in Wellington, they lost the second leg 3-40 in Witbank to be relegated to the First Division for 2010.|$|R

Some volume-based recipes, therefore, attempt to improve the reproducibility by including additional instructions for measuring the correct amount of an ingredient.

5000|$|From 2012, Odendaal played {{mainly as}} a centre. After scoring two tries in six {{appearances}} during the 2012 Vodacom <b>Cup</b> competition, he <b>firmly</b> {{established himself as}} a first choice for the , starting in thirteen of their matches during the 2012 Currie Cup First Division season. He scored three tries, but could not help the Falcons finish higher than second-last in the competition. After a further seven appearances in the 2013 Vodacom Cup, he had his most prolific Currie Cup season for the Falcons, scoring seven tries in eleven appearances. He topped the try-scoring charts for the Falcons and finished ninth overall. His try-scoring form included scoring a first half hat-trick against the [...] in Kempton Park, but could not prevent the Falcons losing the match as the visitors rallied back to win the match 38-37.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Mory's Song, the member places the trophy cup, upside down, on top of a cloth (or, for greater challenge due to the latter's higher absorbency, a paper) napkin, whereupon three friends place their respective hands atop the base of the <b>cup</b> and tap <b>firmly.</b> The <b>cup</b> is then whisked away, and the napkin is inspected for any signs of moisture. In decades past, and to date for some more conservative organizations, if the napkin were wet, then the finishing member would be forced to pay for the cup; if the napkin were dry, the member to the finishing member's left—who himself chose to forgo finishing the cup—would have to pay. (Organizations still following these rules often vary them as to the specifics: Some organizations requiring that the cost of the cup be divided among the two or three previous drinkers rather than only the immediately previous one. Some organizations exempt women preceding the [...] "draining" [...] drinker from having to pay, instead assessing only the man or men to that drinker's left for the cup's cost, on the grounds that a woman should not be expected to drain the cup and therefore did not forgo a clear opportunity to do so.) In more modern times, most toasting parties split the bill evenly amongst members, regardless of who fails to drain or declines the opportunity to drain a cup.|$|R
5000|$|The 1983 Americas Cup saw Lexcens Australia II, with John Bertrand at the helm, {{take on the}} NYYC skipper Dennis Conner and {{the defender}} yacht, Liberty. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had {{dominated}} the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused Australia II to fall behind, losing the first two races. Australia II stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This {{was the first time}} in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the <b>Cup</b> was now <b>firmly</b> on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin. At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable. Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark. Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked [...] "dummy" [...] tacks trying to break the Australians cover. Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race. Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his contributions to the winning design.|$|R
