40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeAmong DNA-based techniques, {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) is the most widely accepted molecular tool {{for the detection of}} pathogens. However, the technique involves several reagents and multiple pipetting steps that often lead to error-prone results. Additionally, the reagents entail a cold-chain facility to maintain their stability during storage and transportation. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to simplify the utility of a pre-optimized multiplex PCR format that was developed to detect toxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus by providing stable, pre-mixed, and ready-to-use <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> in a lyophilized formulation. MethodsMaster mix containing all reagents except the template was lyophilized in the presence of an excipient lyoprotectant to achieve long-term stability without altering the sensitivity, specificity and PCR performance. Bromophenol blue was also included in the <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> to reduce the risk of external contamination during gel loading. The stability <b>of</b> lyophilized <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> was analyzed at different temperatures. The PCR performance was also examined after exposure <b>of</b> <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> to notable temperature fluctuations during transportation. ResultsThe shelf-life <b>of</b> lyophilized <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> was estimated to be 1. 5  months at ambient temperature and 6  months at 4 °C. Stability was unaffected by temperature fluctuations during transportation even in cold-chain-free conditions, thus reducing the cost required for cold storage. ConclusionThe sensitive, cost-effective, ready-to-use, and ambient temperature stable formulation could be implemented as a detection tool in food analysis and diagnostic laboratories and hospitals and for on-field application outside the laboratories, as well as for detection of toxigenic strains of S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for affordable, thermostable PCR reagents {{that can be used}} for diagnostic testing in resource limited settings. The development of point-of-care devices in such settings is highly dependent on the availability and efficacy of thermostable reagents. Here, we assess the thermostability of commercial, intercalating dye-based real-time PCR <b>master</b> <b>mixes.</b> We show that several <b>of</b> these <b>master</b> <b>mixes</b> have thermostability and robust performance at 20 °C, 40 °C, and 45 °C for 6, 4 and 2 weeks, respectively. However, none <b>of</b> the <b>master</b> <b>mixes</b> that we evaluated was able to withstand more than 1 month at 45 °C incubation.

40|$|Real-time {{detection}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) {{in cases of}} clinical bacteremia may promote appropriate antimicrobial therapy and infection control. Expense inherent to molecular diagnostics may prevent laboratories from utilizing real-time PCR for this purpose. BD GeneOhm StaphSR assay <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> was reconstituted and aliquoted into SmartCycler tubes in 25 -l volumes (freshly reconstituted <b>master</b> <b>mix),</b> with a portion being frozen at 70 °C (frozen <b>master</b> <b>mix).</b> Incubation <b>of</b> 40 previously analyzed lysates from positive BacT/Alert SA and SN blood culture bottles (identified as 10 MRSA strains, 10 MSSA strains, 12 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains, and 8 Micro-coccus strains) in freshly reconstituted <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> and <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> frozen between 1 week and 6 months generated the expected results in all PCRs. Similarly, positive- and negative-control reagents stored frozen at 70 °C for up to 18 weeks yielded the expected reactions. Prospective analysis of 244 positive blood culture samples utilizing 1 -week-frozen <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> and freshly reconstituted <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> yielded a 1. 2 % discordant rate upon initial testing due to three unresolved results (two unresolved results for freshly reconstituted <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> and one unresolved result for frozen <b>master</b> <b>mix).</b> Repeat testing produced a final 100 % concordance rate between the two <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> preparations. Use <b>of</b> <b>master</b> <b>mix</b> that was frozen up to 6 months did not compromise performance of the BD GeneOhm StaphSR assay. This modification, resulting in less reagen...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{detection}} of bacterial pathogens based on LAMP methods is a faster and simpler approach than conventional culture methods. Although different LAMP-based methods for pathogenic bacterial detection are available, a systematic comparison {{of these different}} LAMP assays has not been performed. In this paper, we compared 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays with a commercialized kit (Isothermal <b>Master</b> <b>Mix)</b> for the {{detection of}} Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O 157, E. coli O 26, E. coli O 45, E. coli O 103, E. coli O 111, E. coli O 121, E. coli O 145 and Streptococcus agalactiae. False-positive results were observed in all 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays, while all the negative controls <b>of</b> Isothermal <b>Master</b> <b>Mix</b> remained negative after amplification. The detection limit <b>of</b> Isothermal <b>Master</b> <b>Mix</b> for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O 157, E. coli O 26, E. coli O 45, E. coli O 103, E. coli O 111, E. coli O 121 and Streptococcus agalactiae was 1 pg, whereas the sensitivity of the commercialized kit for E. coli O 145 was 100 pg. In conclusion, the 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays were impractical to use, while the commercialized kit Isothermal <b>Master</b> <b>Mix</b> was useful {{for the detection of}} most bacterial pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: to {{find the}} place <b>of</b> {{physical}} exercises’ <b>mastering</b> level in structure of 11 - 13 yrs age boys’ motor fitness. Material: in the research 11 yrs age boys (n= 58), 12 (n= 76) and 13 years age (n= 93) participated. Testing program included well-known tests: “Forward roll”, “Backward roll”, “Vault”, ”Climbing rope (three attempts) ”, “Bridge”, “Stance on shoulder blades”. Results: By indicators of physical condition 11 - 13 yrs age boys statistically confidently differ one from another (р< 0, 001).
