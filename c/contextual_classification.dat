Understanding the factors determining error propagation to land-cover change maps helps to select appropriate classification models and characterize the associated uncertainties. In this paper, we presented a simulation analysis on the rates of error propagation for both non-contextual and <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> models. The simulation approach was based on simulated annealing with careful experimental designs to control two related factors including the spatial and temporal patterns on the errors in spectral probability estimation. The {{results showed that the}} two factors had different influences on the error propagation for non-contextual and <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> models. For non-contextual models, increasing temporal dependence of errors could reduce the rate of error propagation while spatial dependence of errors did not {{have an impact on the}} error propagation. For <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> models, the use of spatialtemporal information significantly reduced the rate of error propagation. However, the utilities of the spatialtemporal information in mitigating error propagation were dependent on the spatial dependence of errors.

In {{the context}} of Landsat TM images forest stands are a cluster of {{homogeneous}} pixels. <b>Contextual</b> <b>classification</b> of forest cover types exploits relationships between neighbouring pixels {{in the pursuit of}} an increase in classification accuracy. Results with six contextual classifiers from two sites in Canada were compared to results with a maximum likelihood (ML) classifier. The comparisons were done at three levels of spectral class separation. Training and validation data were obtained from single-stage cluster sampling of 2 km 62 km primary sampling units (PSU) located on a 20 km 620 km grid. A strong relationship between contextual and ML classification accuracy was explored with logistic regression analysis. Effects of <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> were predicted for given levels of ML accuracy. Estimates of the spatial autocorrelation of reflectance values within a PSU were deemed consistent with a first-order autoregressive process. Iterative Conditional Modes (ICM) was the best contextual method; it improved the overall accuracy by four to six percentage points (statistically significant) when ML accuracy was between 50 % and 80 %.

This report investigates classification using spatial and/or temporal contextual information. Although contextual information has been an important and powerful data analysis clue for the human-analyst, the lack of a good <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> scheme especially which can both use spatial and temporal context has not allowed its usefulness to be put to full use. Two different approaches to spatial-temporal <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> are investigated. One is based on statistical spatial-temporal <b>contextual</b> <b>classification,</b> and the other is based on decision fusion of temporal data sets which are classified individually with spatial contexts. In the first approach, a general form of maximum a posterior spatialtemporal contextual classifier is derived after spatial and temporal neighbors are defined. Joint prior probabilities of the classes of each pixel and its spatial neighbors are modeled by the Gibbs random field. The classification is performed in a recursive manner to allow a computationally efficient <b>contextual</b> <b>classification.</b> In the second approach based on,the decision fusion, each temporal data set is separately fed into the local classifier and a final classification is performed by summarizing the local class decisions with an optimum decision fusion rule which is derived based on the minimum expected cost. The new decision fusion rule is designed to handle not only data set reliabilities but also classwise reliabilities of each data set. Experimental results with three temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper data show significant improvement of classification accuracy over non-contextual pixelwise classifier.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method to}} assess the accuracy of vegetation maps for which contextual information has {{been included in the}} classification process. It is well known that land use classification may benefit from combining spatial and spectral information. Consequently, many classification techniques incorporating spatial information have been implemented. To compare various <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> techniques, the shape of vegetation patches, in the spatially enhanced maps, are statistically linked to their counterparts in the spectral classification result, on which these spatial enhancements are applied. To this end, measures for the change in shape of patches are introduced. The shape of any patch is characterized by the edges between the patch and its neighbors. Therefore, patch shape can be represented by an edge map in which each pixel gets the value of the number of classes that are different from the class label of the central pixel in a four-adjacency neighborhood. Rather than defining a single metric for the edge map difference, an error matrix is used to depict not only how many edges have changed with respect to the reference, but also by how much they have changed. The method is tested on <b>contextual</b> <b>classification</b> results of heathland vegetation. ...|$|E
