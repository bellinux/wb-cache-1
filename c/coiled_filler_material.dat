More stringent surface quality requirements and the more demanding test environment encountered by cryogenic wind tunnels eliminate <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> such as polyester resins, plaster, and waxes used on conventional wind tunnel models. To provide a material data base for cryogenic models, various <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> are investigated. Surface quality requirements and test temperature extremes require matching of coefficients of thermal expansion or interfacing materials. Microstrain versus temperature curves are generated for several candidate <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> for comparison with cryogenically acceptable materials.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to develop new PMC using commercially available Epoxy and Polyurethane resin systems. These resin systems would be reinforced with glass fibers, <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> and aluminium foils. Laminates are prepared by using the hand lay-up techniques of eight layers and mechanical test such as tensile test and compression test have been conducted. This work {{has been carried}} out to identify the appropriate resin systems, <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> and glass fiber reinforcement to estimate the strength of the composite. Two types of glass fiber (chopped mat & woven mat) with reinforcement of <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> and aluminium foil used to estimate the strength of composite. As per the results from the present experimental study, reinforcing aluminium foil and graphite filler in the chopped mat with Epoxy resin has high tensile strength compared to woven mat reinforcement. By reinforcing <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> has high tensile and compressive strength, the properties of the laminate is increased due to the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> reinforcement in Epoxy resin as well as in Polyurethane resin. The properties of the laminate are increased due to the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> reinforcement in both resin systems. From this investigation we conclude that <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> plays very important role in composite system. In both epoxy and polyurethane resin system by reinforcing <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> the mechanical properties and strength of the laminate under tensile and compression are increased.

Because of the rarity of these reactions, it was difficult to make statistically significant statements for these reactions and possible risk factors. Now the berlin register offers sufficiently large sample sizes to investigate statistical significance. 238 patients in the IFS case register were statistically analyzed for significant differences in risk factors and adverse reaction in four different <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> groups (hyaluronic acid products, Dermalive (HEMA / EMA), poly-L-lactic acid and Polyacrylamid products). Therefore univariate data analysis and statistical inference investigations were performed using the Chi-square test and ANOVA. The adverse reaction 'pain' and 'discoloration' vary significantly between the different <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> groups. ‚Pain’ occurs most frequently as adverse reaction caused by Polyacrylamid products, on the contrary Dermalive causes the least ‚pain’. In addition, Polyacrylamid products show significantly less ‚discoloration’ than other groups. Significant associations exist between the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> groups and the adverse reactions ‚swelling’, ‚nodulation’/’induration’ and ‚itching’. The highest occurrences for the adverse reaction: ‚swelling’ and ‚nodulation’/’induration’ is in poly-L-Lactic acid products. For ‚itching’ the number of cases is not sufficient for a significant statement. The collected data are not yet sufficient to determine significancies regarding the possible risk factors for adverse reaction on injectable <b>filler</b> <b>materials.</b> However, the data analysis revealed a trend of correlation between individual <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> groups and risk factors.

40|$|Selective {{corrosion}} of type 316 L {{austenitic stainless}} steel welds during the production of organic acids resulted in losses in production due to unscheduled downtimes to perform repairs. Estimated corrosion rates of type 316 L <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> welds were {{an order of magnitude}} higher than that of the base material. Alternative higher alloyed commercial <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> were evaluated under actual production conditions. The evaluated <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> were types 316 L, 317 L, 309 L, 309 MoL, 2205, 2507, 625, 825 and 904 L. The effect of nitrogen on the corrosion properties of type 309 L <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> was evaluated by manipulating the nitrogen concentration of the shielding gas during MIG welding. These changes in nitrogen concentration did not influence the corrosion resistance of the type 309 L <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> No correlation could be established between the corrosion rates, analysed chemical composition of the product and operating temperature during production. In almost all the cases where the chemical composition of the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> was comparable with that of the base material the corrosion rates of the <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> were higher than that base material. It might be expected that the ferrite phase with higher molybdenum and chromium should be more corrosion resistant while the austenite should be less resistant. This was, however, not the case with the corrosion of type 309 L <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> It would thus appear that in this case nickel enrichment of the austenite phase had a larger influence on the corrosion resistance of the austenite phase than the chromium and molybdenum had on the corrosion resistance of the ferrite phase. It appears that nickel and molybdenum had the largest contribution to the corrosion resistance of stainless steels welds under these operating conditions. It is, however, believed that a certain minimum concentration of chromium is also required to provide corrosion resistance to these alloys in hot organic acid environments. In contrast with the fact that a substantial alloying content is required to improve corrosion resistance of the <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> the small difference in composition between ferrite and austenite phases, due to micro segregation, appeared to affect the corrosion resistance on micro scale. This is illustrated by the micrographs, which show corrosion to etch out the dendrite structure. Since the morphology of the austenite and ferrite phases is so similar, it could not always be conclusively established which one of the two phases corroded selectively. Analyses performed on the austenite and ferrite phases did not indicate a concentration difference within the phases itself. However, there were significant differences in the concentration of elements between the phases, with the austenite stabilising elements reporting to the austenite phase and the ferrite stabilizing elements reporting to the ferrite phase, in line with thermodynamic predictions. In the case of the <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> following the austenite mode of solidification, no significant concentration differences were detected within the matrix. Although all highly alloyed high nickel alloyed <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> (types 904 L, 825 and 625) corroded at a lower rate than the type 316 L base <b>material,</b> type 625 <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> was the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> of choice {{due to the lack of}} any pitting of the weld. Pitting was detected in both the 825 and 904 L <b>filler</b> <b>materials.</b> Galvanic corrosion was not noted at any of the weld/HAZ interfaces and in no case did the type 316 L parent metal adjacent to the weld corrode preferentially to the material further away from the weld.

The sputtered closeout layer structure was evaluated with respect to <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> contamination, predeposition machining and finishing operations, and deposition parameters.
