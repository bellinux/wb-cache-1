40|$|Abstract Microbial plugging, a {{microbial}} {{enhancement of}} oil recovery (MEOR) technique, {{has been applied}} in a candidate oil reservoir of Daqing Oil Field (China). The goal {{of this study is}} to monitor the survival of injected bacteria and reveal the response of microbial <b>communities</b> in <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> of microbial plugging through injection of selected microbial culture broth and nutrients. Culture-dependent enrichment and culture-independent 16 S rDNA clone library methods were used. The results show that it was easy to activate targeted biopolymer-producing bacteria in a laboratory environment, and it was difficult for injected exogenous bacteria to survive. In addition, microbial communities in the oil reservoir also changed before and after the <b>field</b> <b>trial.</b> However, microbial <b>communities,</b> activated by fermentative medium for biopolymer-producing bacteria, appeared to show greater differences in the laboratory than in the natural reservoir. It was concluded that microbial populations monitoring was important to MEOR; results of response of microbial communities could provide a guide for the future <b>field</b> <b>trials.</b> Keywords Microbial plugging.

25|$|Observational {{studies have}} two components, {{descriptive}} and analytical. Descriptive observations {{pertain to the}} “who, what, where and when of health-related state occurrence”. However, analytical observations deal more with the ‘how’ of a health-related event. Experimental epidemiology contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for new medicine or drug testing), <b>field</b> <b>trials</b> (conducted on those at {{a high risk of}} conducting a disease), and <b>community</b> <b>trials</b> (research on social originating diseases).|$|R
40|$|With many <b>community</b> <b>field</b> <b>trials</b> or {{education}} interventions, the cost-effectiveness analyses {{are not given}} a high priority. However, this type of evaluation is important for purposes of future adoption of the intervention. The accurate measurement of costs can best be served by prospec-tive collection of data This article describes a methodology for collection of cost data that coincides with the intervention implementation. This cost analysis strategy has seven discrete steps. The Minimal Contact Education for Cholesterol Change study is used {{as an example of}} the use of this strategy. This intervention provides cholesterol education at six different levels of intensity at four different sectors. The intensity levels vary along a continuum from very little education input to a maximum level of intervention that might be practical in a screening setting. The cost-effectiveness analysis component of the study will identify the incremental cost-effectiveness of each intervention along the continuum. Over the past several years, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) has become a requisite component of social policy research. Health services research studies now include this type of analysis without exception as the pressure continues to contain health care costs and adequately justify health polic...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) in San Juan, Puerto Rico are {{characterized}} by high rates of daily injecting, injection of shared drugs, re-use of injection syringes, and use of shooting galleries. They lack adequate access to new injection syringes and drug preparation equipment, and experience elevated rates of HIV and HCV infection. Between April and August, 2006, researchers and active IDUs collaborated {{in the development of}} an experimental HIV/HCV intervention aimed at identifying drug preparation items and practices that will enable IDUs to make drug solutions without potentially contaminated injection syringes contacting materials used to prepare drugs. The collaboration involved discussing and testing a variety of drug preparation items and practices in office and community settings. The process was repeated until concerns that had been raised were resolved, and a tentative set of intervention items and practices to be evaluated in a <b>community</b> <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> was identified. Throughout, a strong emphasis was placed on the capacity of an item or practice to address common problems confronted by IDUs (blunted needles, clogged syringes, injected particles) in addition to the core aim of reducing contamination of preparation materials by blood in injection syringes...|$|R

40|$|Background HIV is devastating {{southern}} Africa {{and alcohol}} use {{is closely related to}} HIV transmission risks. Purpose The current study tested the efficacy of a brief single-session HIV–alcohol risk-reduction intervention for men and women who drink at informal alcohol serving establishments (i. e., shebeens) in South Africa. Methods A randomized <b>community</b> <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> recruited men (N= 117) and women (N= 236) through outreach and chain referrals. Participants received either: (a) 3 -h theory-based behavioral HIV–alcohol risk-reduction intervention that focused on skills training for sexual negotiation and condom use or (b) 1 -h HIV–alcohol information/education control group. Participants were followed up for 3 and 6 months post-intervention with 89 % retention. Results The risk-reduction intervention demonstrated sig-nificantly less unprotected intercourse, alcohol use before sex, numbers of sex partners, partners met at drinking establishments and greater condom use relative to the control group. However, intervention effects were moderated by alcohol use; lighter drinkers demonstrated significantly more intervention gains than heavier drinkers in the risk-reduction condition. Intervention effects occurred at 3 months follow-up and dissipated by 6 months. Conclusions A brief HIV risk-reduction intervention reduced sexual-risk behaviors among drinkers in South Africa. However, intervention effects were weakest for those who drink heaviest. Our results provide a basis for establishing HIV prevention in alcohol serving establishments in South Africa. Research is needed to identify multi-level intervention models that can reduce risks among heavier drinkers and sustain behavior changes over time...|$|R

No information is available on the levels of resistance of to A. soccata sorghum varieties and breeding material released in the countries of the Southern African Development <b>Community.</b> Three <b>field</b> <b>trials</b> were conducted during the 1998 / 99 to 2001 / 2002 growing seasons to determine the level of resistance of sorghum varieties to shoot fly. Twenty-five varieties were evaluated in two of the seasons and 24 in the other. High shoot fly densities in the trials were achieved by planting late and using fishmeal to attract flies to the fields. The incidence of dead-heart symptoms in each variety was determined 4 weeks after seedling emergence. Significant differences in resistance to shoot fly damage were observed in two of the three seasons. The incidence of dead-heart symptoms ranged from 32 to 71 % during the 1998 / 99 season, from 27 to 54 % during the 1999 / 2000 season and from 58 to 88 % in the 2001 / 02 seasons. Varieties Pirira- 1 and Pirira- 2 were the most resistant across seasons.

40|$|The role {{of social}} {{identity}} in shaping citizen views of police {{is central to}} the groupvalue model (GVM).

Our paper employs a randomised <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> of procedural justice dialogue - the Queensland <b>Community</b> Engagement <b>Trial</b> - to test the role of social identity in the GVM. Under randomised <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> conditions we find that social identity is connected to perceptions of procedural justice and legitimacy, but that it does not moderate the effect of procedural justice on legitimacy. We discuss the implications of this finding, concluding that when police use procedurally just dialogue in encounters with the public, they can enhance perceptions of police, regardless of social identification.
