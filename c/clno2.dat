H 577 P CEE 2017 Thamxx, 186 pages :color illustrationsNitryl {{chloride}} (<b>ClNO₂)</b> is {{an important}} source of highly reactive chlorine radical that may affect the atmospheric oxidative chemistry in the daytime. However, the abundance of <b>ClNO₂</b> and its roles are not fully understood under different environmental conditions. This thesis presents the first detailed investigation of <b>ClNO₂</b> and its impact in polluted China environments based upon field measurements of <b>ClNO₂</b> and its precursor, N₂O₅, using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). Preliminary studies of <b>ClNO₂</b> were conducted in Tung Chung and Hok Tsui (both in Hong Kong) with a thermal decomposition (TD) CIMS between 2011 and 2012. <b>ClNO₂</b> shows a clear diurnal pattern with significant concentrations being observed during the night-time. Formation of <b>ClNO₂</b> was persistent throughout the year with the highest level of <b>ClNO₂</b> observed during the autumn season followed by spring, winter, and summer, which is consistent with the seasonal variation of NOx, O₃, and particle chloride. The variations of the <b>ClNO₂</b> were found to be influenced by the air masses origin with elevated <b>ClNO₂</b> mixing ratios observed in plumes from Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region and lower concentrations in marine air. Calculations suggest that photolysis of <b>ClNO₂</b> contributed up to 0. 02 pptv/s of Cl atom production rate in the early morning and exceeded the OH production rate via O 3 photolysis by a factor of 3. These results provide an initial understanding of <b>ClNO₂</b> and its potential importance in Asian coastal regions. To improve the quality of measurement, we then reconfigured and optimized the TD-CIMS to an unheated version of CIMS. A series of testing were performed, including calibrations, background zeroing and inlet transmission efficiency. The optimized CIMS demonstrates high sensitivity (~ 1 Hz/pptv) with a low detection limit of 5 pptv for both N₂O₅ and <b>ClNO₂</b> measurement. The sampling line was also optimized and was suggested to be replaced and washed daily to reduce the artifacts from aerosol deposition on the inlet surface. Field verification of the in-situ CIMS N₂O₅, measurements with observations by a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) showed excellent agreement (slope = 0. 99; R 2 = 0. 93). These testing results indicate that the optimized CIMS is capable of accurately detecting both N₂O₅ and <b>ClNO₂</b> under polluted China environment. In keeping the works above, the optimized CIMS was deployed to the peak of Tai Mo Shan (957 m above sea level) in late autumn of 2013. The measurement found significant levels of <b>ClNO₂</b> (> 400 pptv) and its precursor, N₂O₅ (> 1000 pptv) on 6 out of the 12 consecutive nights with full CIMS data. The highest ever reported levels of <b>ClNO₂</b> (4. 7 ppbv, 1 min average) and N₂O₅ (7. 7 ppbv, 1 min average) were observed in one night. High-resolution meteorological simulations revealed that this ClNO 2 and N₂O₅-laden air originated from the surface of urban/industrial areas north of the site with enriched anthropogenic chloride as well as NOx and aerosol. We demonstrated that the fast production of NO 3 and moderate N₂O₅ uptake and <b>ClNO₂</b> yield initiated the very high concentration of <b>ClNO₂,</b> which led to a large production rate of Cl atom (up to 0. 59 pptv/s) in the next morning. Daytime <b>ClNO₂</b> and N₂O₅ were also observed in this measurement. The heterogeneous uptake of daytime N₂O₅ on fog/cloud droplets was shown to be a potentially important production mechanism for soluble nitrate and additional source of VOC oxidants during the daytime. Elevated <b>ClNO₂</b> mixing ratios (> 350 pptv) were measured in an inland site of northern China during the summer CAREBEIJING 2014 campaign. The <b>ClNO₂</b> mixing ratio of up to 2070 pptv (1 -min average) was observed on 20 - 21 June 2014 and was characterized with a larger N₂O₅ heterogeneous loss rate and <b>ClNO₂</b> production rate compared to the campaign average condition. A salient feature of this observation is that the abundant <b>ClNO₂</b> concentration kept increasing even after sunrise and reached a peak 4 hours later. Such highly sustained <b>ClNO₂</b> peaks in the morning are discrepant from the typical diurnal pattern previously observed in other places. As evidenced by the meteorological and chemical analysis, the sustained <b>ClNO₂</b> morning peaks were caused by the significant <b>ClNO₂</b> production in the residual layer at night followed by downward mixing after the break-up of the nocturnal boundary layer at sunrise. Calculations showed that ~ 1. 7 - 4. 0 ppbv of <b>ClNO₂</b> would exist in the residual layer in order to sustain the observed morning <b>ClNO₂</b> peaks at the surface site. Photolysis of the <b>ClNO₂</b> was shown to be a dominant radical source and contributed up to 46 %, 37 %, 10 %, 7 % and 13 % of the integrated oxidation of alkane, alkyne, alkene, aromatic and OVOC, respectively, throughout the morning. Overall, the findings of this thesis reveal that <b>ClNO₂</b> is ubiquitous over the polluted regions of China and is a crucial pollutant to be considered when assessing photochemical and haze pollutions in China.

40|$|Dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅), {{a primary}} nocturnal {{reservoir}} for NOx (NOx [equivalence] NO + NO₂), readily undergoes heterogeneous reaction on aqueous interfaces. These reactions potentially alter the chemical, physical, and hygroscopic properties of ambient particles, and ultimately their climate impact. Upon reacting with aqueous chloride-containing surfaces, such as sea spray, nitryl chloride (<b>ClNO₂)</b> is produced. <b>ClNO₂</b> {{is capable of}} extending the lifetime of NOx and inducing ozone production in high NOx environments via chlorine radical creation. The extent to which N₂O₅ reactivity impacts atmospheric oxidant loadings depends on the heterogeneous reaction rate of N₂O₅ with a given surface. This, in turn, is directly influenced by interfacial chemical composition, morphology, and phase state. In this dissertation, I describe advances {{in the understanding of}} how organic and inorganic constituents at atmospheric interfaces regulate N₂O₅ reactivity. First, I developed an observation-based framework for assessing the aerosol particle mixing state role on N₂O₅ heterogeneous reaction kinetics using simultaneous measurements of the N₂O₅ reactive uptake coefficient to ambient aerosol with direct measurements of aerosol mixing state before and after reaction. Second, as part of the NSF Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment, I extended the use of a novel Marine Aerosol Reference Tank (MART) capable of generating nascent sea-spray aerosol, to determine heterogeneous reaction kinetics. Here, the MART was doped with ocean organic mimics to assess how organics present in the sea surface microlayer (SSML), and subsequently ejected into sea-spray, impact N₂O₅ reaction kinetics. Third, I conducted laboratory studies to investigate suppressed <b>ClNO₂</b> production rates at the ocean surface, using ambient seawater from various locations and under varied biological conditions, along with model sea salt solutions with proxy organics. This study was designed to determine the role of unsaturated organics and surface-enhanced inorganic ions in the SSML in altering <b>ClNO₂</b> production rate...|$|E

Oxides of nitrogen (NO(y)) are also globally distributed, because NO formed in combustion processes is oxidized to NO(2), HNO(3), N(2) O(5) and a variety of other nitrogen oxides during transport. Deposition of HCl and NO(y) onto surfaces is commonly regarded as providing permanent removal mechanisms. However, we show here a new surface-mediated coupling of nitrogen oxide and halogen activation cycles in which uptake of gaseous NO(2) or N(2) O(5) on solid substrates generates adsorbed intermediates that react with HCl to generate gaseous nitrosyl chloride (ClNO) and nitryl chloride (<b>ClNO(2)),</b> respectively. These are potentially harmful gases that photolyze to form highly reactive chlorine atoms. The reactions are shown both experimentally and theoretically to be enhanced by water, a surprising result given the availability of competing hydrolysis reaction pathways. Airshed modeling incorporating HCl {{generated from}} sea salt shows that in coastal urban regions, this heterogeneous chemistry increases surface-level ozone, a criteria air pollutant, greenhouse gas and source of atmospheric oxidants. In addition, it may contribute to recently measured high levels of <b>ClNO(2)</b> in the polluted coastal marine boundary layer. This work also suggests the potential for chlorine atom chemistry to occur indoors where significant concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and HCl coexist...|$|E
40|$|The marine {{boundary}} layer (MBL) serves as host to great exchanges of mass and energy across the air-sea interface that drive multi-scale dynamics, biogeochemical cycles and global climate change. Reactive trace {{gases in the}} MBL can set the atmosphere's oxidative capacity, aerosol production rates and greenhouse gas warming potential. The ocean surface is a broad source and sink for important reactive trace gases, but direct observations of trace gas air-sea exchange have been limited {{to a handful of}} species, to date. This doctoral dissertation addresses this deficit by developing methods for the measurement of reactive trace gas air-sea exchange, as well as novel observations of air-sea exchange rates of ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors. Terrestrial biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) determine global SOA production rates, but estimates of their marine source span several orders of magnitude. A chemical-ionization method for the sensitive detection of BVOC was developed and deployed to the remote MBL aboard a research vessel during the High Wind Gas Exchange Study. Direct observations of BVOC (dimethyl sulfide, isoprene and monoterpene) mixing ratios and air-sea exchange were taken via eddy covariance. Dimethyl sulfide and monoterpene air-sea exchange rates were positive (i. e. emitted) in both remote and coastal waters. In coastal areas, monoterpene air-sea exchange rates rivaled dimethyl sulfide. Reactive nitrogen species (NOy) including alkyl nitrates (RONO₂), dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅) and nitryl chloride (<b>ClNO₂)</b> are the main source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the remote MBL and set ozone production rates. During a realistic mesocosm study and detailed laboratory monoculture experiments, alkyl nitrates were found to be driven by heterotrophic bacteria abundance suggesting a dark production mechanism for short -chained RONO₂. In an ambient coastal polluted atmosphere, simultaneous eddy covariance measurements of N₂O₅ and <b>ClNO₂</b> air-sea exchange were taken from a pier. Contrary to what was predicted by heterogeneous chemistry, measurements demonstrated that the air-sea interface is a sink for both species, thus a terminal sink for NOx. Depending on aerosol surface area, this demonstrates the air-sea interface can play a controlling role in NOx processing in polluted coastal environment...|$|E

H 577 P CEE 2015 Guo 153 pages :color illustrations; 30 cmHigh {{concentrations}} of particulate matters and associated heavy haze {{have become a}} serious environmental issue in many urban areas in China. Interactions of gases, particles and cloud/fog play important roles in the fate of trace gases and the physical-chemical character of aerosols, and consequently contribute to haze formation and climate change. Yet, compared with gas-phase reactions, the heterogeneous or multiphase chemistry has been investigated to a much smaller extent because of the huge complexity. In the present work, a multiphase model with detailed microphysical and aqueous chemistry mechanisms was utilized to study the multiphase chemistry in cloud droplets and deliquescent particles. Based on the intensive field observations of gas, aerosol, cloud waters at a mountain site (Mt. Tai, China) in 2007 - 2008 and a suburban site (Tung Chung, Hong Kong) in 2011 - 2012, model simulations were performed to investigate several poorly understood heterogeneous processes, including the aqueous phase HxOy-TMI reaction and nitrogen chemistry {{as well as the}} sulfate production in aqueous phase under some unique conditions of China. The comprehensive cloud composition data at Mount Tai were analyzed in terms of seasonal variation, impact of different sources regions and sulfate formation using a tracer method. This is the most recent characterization study of cloud composition in heavily polluted North China. Both gas and aqueous phase budgets of HxOy species (OH, HO₂ and H₂O₂) have been quantitatively evaluated. The simulations suggest differences in aqueous HxOy budget between cloud droplet and deliquescent aerosol scenarios. The cloud droplets are found to efficiently uptake nearly all HxOy species from gas to aqueous phase after cloud formation. In comparison, while the deliquescent aerosols (at Tung Chung) are important sinks of HO₂ radical and H₂O₂ but act as a net source of OH radical. These results suggest significant contribution from heterogeneous processes to the loss of H₂O₂ in gas phase and that models without considering the chemical processes in aqueous particles or misrepresenting the metal concentrations may result in large uncertainty in determining the chemical budget of H₂O₂. For atmospheric nitrogen chemistry, the heterogeneous processes of HONO, N₂O₅ and NO 3 radical are of particular importance. Motivated by the challenge that existing mechanisms tend to underestimate the ambient HONO concentrations, HONO formation is investigated using a multiphase model. Two aqueous nitrogen reactions, which are rarely mentioned but potentially play important roles in HONO formation, are emphatically studied. Model simulations show significant N₂O₅ uptake and <b>ClNO₂</b> production rate on deliquescent aerosols at night time. Br-ion in aerosols is found to strongly suppress the heterogeneous production of <b>ClNO₂.</b> This implies that current models that only consider Cl in studying N₂O₅ hydrolysis may be inadequate. To summarize, this study adds to the increasing body of literature demonstrating the importance of multiphase processes in atmospheric chemistry, and provide a quantitative description of aqueous-phase reactions affecting gas-phase species concentrations and aerosol compositions. The approach introduced herein can be applicable to other atmospheric systems and facilitate further understanding of physical-chemical interactions among gas-phase species, aerosols, fog and clouds.
