40|$|Roadside {{chipping}} is {{a common}} harvesting system to produce chips in Australian plantations. This study investigated the productivity and cost of road-side chipping operation (chipping logs extracted by forwarder to the road side) using a Morbark chipper with <b>flail</b> <b>delimber</b> in a first thinning of Pinus radiata stands. An elemental time study method was used to collect the time working cycles. The regression approach was used to develop the productivity predicting model based on the log size in different wood piles. The statistical analysis yielded an average productivity of 59. 4 GMt/PMH 0 with the corresponding costs of 5. 2 AU$/GMt for the Morbark chipper. The details on work time analysis, relocation time and fuel consumption of the machine are documented in this paper. The results provide basic information for planning roadside chipping operations in pine plantations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>flail</b> {{delimbing}} and debarking {{may improve}} value recovery from small tree harvests, without renouncing {{the benefits of}} multi-tree processing. The technology is mature and capable of excellent performance, which has been documented in many benchmark studies. This paper offers {{new insights into the}} relationship between the performance of <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> delimbing and debarking and such factors as tree volume, load volume, tree form and bark-wood bond strength (BWBS). The study was conducted in Chile, during the commercial harvesting of a Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantation. In an observational study, researchers collected production data from over 780 work cycles, and work quality data from over 1000 individual trees. The analysis of these data shows that productivity is affected primarily by load volume. Work quality is affected by BWBS and by the number of trees in a load. Work quality degrades with increasing BWBS and tree number, since more trees tend to shield each other. Tree form has no effect on either productivity or work quality. Regression and probability functions are provided, and can be used for predictive purposes when trying to optimize current operations or to prospect the introduction of <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> technology to new work environments.

40|$|The {{flail mower}} {{is a piece}} of {{agricultural}} equipment that uses bladed attachments rotating around a drum to cut down bushes and grassy terrain. One major drawback to the flail mower is the rapid wear that happens almost immediately when any sort of rocks, gravel, or rough terrain are encountered. The goal of this project was to design and manufacture a prototype of a machine that could level rough terrain through repeating impacts as opposed to cutting with blades. The final design was a <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> mower, a piece of equipment designed to level rough terrain that uses chains to repeatedly bludgeon rocks, gravel, and debris. The designed <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> mower was assembled into an existing commercially available snow blower for testing. by Aaron Flores. Thesis: S.

50|$|Each Assault Squadron was {{equipped}} {{with a number of}} Armoured Vehicles Royal Engineers (AVREs) - which were Churchill tanks, modified in various ways to suit the needs of Assault Engineers. In addition, the assault teams included a number of Sherman 'Crabs' from 30th Armoured Brigade - these were Sherman tanks, with a full-width, heavy duty, rotary <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> mounted in front, which destroyed any mines in its path, thus clearing the lanes up the beach.The AVREs then turned their attention to the first line of land defences, using their spigot mortars, and with self-propelled guns providing artillery support. More Sappers landed to continue the clearance of the beaches. All the time, infantry were moving through into the growing bridgehead.|$|R

Individual members of the club are trusted to build {{his or her own}} weapons {{in a manner consistent with}} the Club rules. The large selection of legal weapons available to players are one-handed swords, Two-handed swords, hand axes, battle axes, hammers, clubs, maces, spears, daggers, <b>chained</b> <b>flails,</b> quarterstaves, glaives, and halberds. Bows, crossbows, and specially-built javelins also may be used. At the simplest level, Darkon melee weapons are composed of a firm core with several layers of hard- and soft-cell foam taped or glued to it. Cloth must also cover the blade and pommel of every weapon. As of 2012, the Club has decided to include weapons covered in a soft rubberized coat as an alternative to cloth.|$|R
40|$|To {{regularly}} remove {{woody vegetation}} along the roadside of forest roads {{is an important}} part of the road maintenance, since the vegetation binds moisture in the road side and, thus, the removal makes the road drying faster with results in improved bearing capacity. Vegetation removal also makes it easier to upgrade the road by material recycling from the ditch and, moreover, the visibility along the road is maintained. The aim of the study was to evaluate what type of <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> is the best and most cost-effective for removal of different kind of woody vegetation along forest roadsides. Time studies were made on two <b>chain</b> <b>flails</b> when removing woody vegetation in three different classes; easy-, middle- and heavy shrub removal. The studied flails were one light and rather simple flail named Optimal M 160 and a heavier and more advanced flail named Slagkraft H 210. The removal was made according to Holmen Skogs’ specification and the quality of the cleaning was measured by objective belt inventory. The productivity was higher with the heavy flail within all cleaning classes. The productivity of the heavy flail in the cleaning classes was; easy 16820 m 2 /h, middle 10498 m 2 /h and heavy 3669 m 2 /h and the corresponding numbers of the light flail was; easy 9439 m 2 /h, middle 6596 m 2 /h and heavy 2382 m 2 /h. According to the cost calculations the heavy flail had the lowest costs for all cleaning classes. However, calculated with the hourly wage that the entrepreneurs was paid during the time study the light flail were cheaper per m 2 and per km cleaned road. The heavy flail gave better quality of the performed work, since the stump height was lower and no residual trees remained after cleaning. The light flail was not adapted for heavy cleaning and left high stumps and residual trees at the heavier cleaning classes, even though some of the study units were recleaned to meet the specification...|$|R
40|$|The moose is a {{keystone}} {{species in the}} boreal forest ecosystem, but the dense Swedish population do cause some serious problems. From a forestry perspective, their browsing on young Scot pine (Pinus sylvestris) causes extensive losses of revenue. Adjusting the cleaning along roadsides of low trafficked forest roads can favour the production of plant species preferred by the moose. This is thought to redirect the moose´s browsing to the roadsides and thereby decrease the damages on commercial forest. The {{aim of this study}} has been to present a first evaluation of the vegetation in roadsides, one year after wildlife-adapted roadside clearing has been undertaken. In the wildlifeadapted clearing operation, the roadside was widened by removal of some trees in the forest edge whereupon a complementary clearing with a conventional <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> was conducted. The wildlife-adapted roads were compared to control roads where clearing with a <b>chain</b> <b>flail,</b> but no cutting of larger trees had taken place. The amount of vegetation, species composition and utilization rates one year after clearance was compared between the two treatments. The results showed that plant species composition was similar for wildlife-adapted and conventional cleared roadsides. The width of the cleared zone was wider in wildlifeadapted roadsides, but even so no more moose forage could be found there compared with the control roadsides. One possible explanation could be an initial difference in width of the roadside before the clearing took place. Another explanation might be that differences in for example site index, soil structure and hydrology was more important for forage production than the clearing treatment. This highlights the importance to select suitable roads for wildlife-adapted clearing. No difference in browsing frequency was found between the treatments, but there was a difference between the cleared zone closest to the road and the extra zone where trees had been removed in the wildlife-adapted roadsides. The frequency of browsing, as well as the amount of forage, were highest in the zone closest to the road which indicates that the extra zone that were created in wildlife-adapted roadsides had minor importance for the moose. Despite absence of documented positive effects of wildlife-adapted roadside clearing in this study, there is definitely a need to further monitor the impact of this treatment. One year after the clearing is not long enough to draw any conclusions on whether this is a useful method, and considerably more research is needed...|$|R
50|$|Won Hwa Do is {{considered}} to be a diverse and versatile martial art. For example, it employs grappling techniques for throwing and locking submissions but also has striking with punches and kicks. However all of these diverse techniques still revolve around the fundamental principles of circular motion. Won Hwa Do has a term for its techniques known as 'Gongbang'(공방). The Hangul (Korean characters) for Gong(공) means offense whilst the Hangul for Bang(방) means defense. Won Hwa Do teaches to practice offense and defense simultaneously in one movement through the use of circular motion.Although seemingly peaceful, meditative and harmless in appearance the force from the circular Hadan (forward circular) strike carries a formidable impact on the target. The force comes from the theory of infusing pushing and pulling into one circular strike as if striking with a ball and <b>chain</b> <b>flail</b> weapon swinging at the end of a handle. Cho Ik Hun teaches that force and technique in the Hadan strike comes not from observation and talent but pure and patient practice of the basic Hadan circular movement for many years. He also emphasizes the importance of breathing and core hip strength in mastering the technique.|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{how much}} wood was potentially available from short rotation hybrid poplar, {{and how much}} was actually recovered when trees were delimbed and debarked with <b>chain</b> <b>flails</b> and chipped. 31 groups of five trees each were measured and then processed. For trees larger than 50 kg total dry weight, potentially recoverable wood averaged 75 % of total weight. Over 95 % of this wood was converted into chips. Losses due to breakage by the flails, which {{show up in the}} bark dis-charge, amounted to 0. 8 dry kg per tree and were relatively independent of tree size. Chipper reject wood losses aver-aged 2. 3 dry kg per tree, but increased in almost direct proportion to tree size, from 1. 2 kg for 50 kg trees, to 3. 2 kg for 120 kg trees. For trees less than 50 kg total dry weight, potentially recoverable wood fraction was highly variable – from 50 to 75 % of total weight. Because of breakage of small stems by the flail, wood recovery was also relatively low, ranging from 40 to 95 %. Most of the wood loss for smaller trees showed up in the bark discharge rather than as chip-per rejects. For larger trees, the chipper rejects represent the big-gest opportunity for improving the recovery of wood fiber. Sharp chipper knives appear to be important for minimiz-ing losses. Beyond that, {{it is not clear whether}} wood in the chipper rejects is the result of bole damage by the flail or chipper design characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Antipersonnel (AP) landmines {{are cheap}} and simple weapons used in warfare and other armed conflicts. The most {{effective}} and accepted form of landmine clearance is by manual demining, but this method is slow, laborious, costly and hazardous. The use of mechanical devices such as <b>chain</b> <b>flails</b> for landmine neutralization and/or area reduction {{has the potential of}} greatly aiding landmine clearance. However, mechanical clearance methods have not been fully accepted in the landmine clearance community {{due to a lack of}} knowledge and scientific data the actual soil-tool interaction and the landmine clearance effectiveness. The research objective was to develop a mechanical device for the neutralization of AP landmines. The device was to deliver sufficient force to produce adequate ground deflection for detonation of typical antipersonnel landmines at depths up to 200 mm. Other design parameters included design simplicity, high durability with low and ease of maintenance and flexible operation. A design matrix was employed to select an appropriate design for further analysis, resulting in preliminary testing and evaluation of off the shelf mechanisms, namely a Tamper and a Jackhammer. Key parameters included interaction pressure, sensor deflection and duty cycle. It was concluded that a tamper design resulted in superior demining capabilities. A final testing phase was designed and conducted to further research the effectiveness of the device and to determine optimal operational parameters between two shoe sizes and the number of pass applications. A test rig was designed and fabricated to attach the tamper system onto the Terra Mechanics Rig for test automation. Test results revealed that the small tamper shoe configuration performed better than a larger shoe, but only marginally so. Test results also indicated a two pass operation was optimal and that the proper shoe configuration is dependent on the demining environment. Furthermore, the large magnitudes of interaction pressure, deflection sensor displacement and total impulse indicate that the tamper system is capable of detonating AP landmines at depths of up to 200 mm...|$|R
50|$|In combat, {{the usual}} tactic {{was to use}} Crabs in groups of five. Three would go forward in echelon formation, {{clearing}} a broad path through the minefield. The other two would hang back on the flanks and give fire support, but were ready to move forward to replace one of the flailing tanks if it was disabled.The Crab had disadvantages; flailing did not remove all mines. A Teller mine buried up to 5 in deep would be set off, but the resulting explosion would destroy a single <b>flail</b> <b>chain,</b> which {{would have to be}} replaced at some point.|$|R
