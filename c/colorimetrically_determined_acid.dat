40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the nutritional composition of five varieties of pap (cereal product) commonly consumed in Maroua, city of the Far-North Region of Cameroon. The proximate composition (moisture, ash, protein, lipid, and crude fibre) was determined by standard AOAC methods. Minerals (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, zinc, copper and manganese) were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and phosphorus was <b>determined</b> <b>colorimetrically.</b> Amino <b>acid</b> composition was <b>determined</b> by ion-exchange chromatography. All the pap varieties had a very high carbohydrate content (79. 47 - 85. 29 g/ 100 g dry matter). Appreciable levels of phosphorus and potassium were recorded in all the pap varieties (137. 5 - 231. 0 mg/ 100 g dry matter and 198. 20 - 322. 22 mg/ 100 g dry matter, respectively). Consumption of each pap (100 g) by children 1 - 2 year old would meet 9. 86 - 17. 46 % and 0. 08 - 19. 51 % of their daily recommended intake respectively for protein and minerals. Leucine and glutamic acid were the most abundant essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids respectively in the pap.

Five fish from each aquarium were anesthetized with buffered tricaine methanesulfonate (20 [*]mg/L), and blood was collected from the caudal vasculature. The collected blood was divided into two sets of Eppendorf tubes. One set contained 500 U of sodium heparinate/mL, used as an anticoagulant, for hematology (hemoglobin (Hb) (in grams per liter), hematocrit (Ht) (in percent), and red blood cell (RBC) (× 106 per microliter) counting).

Each method is affected by external interferences and by inherent biases. Because numerous and often unde-fined substances are present in biologic fluids, ana-lytical conditions are not always well controlled. Re-sults obtained depend on the method rather than the actual protein concentration. Albumin is a simple protein comprised essentially of only amino acids. Many other protein species contain various amounts of carbohydrates, lipids, and other constituents, and these nonpeptide constituents often contribute non-specifically and erroneously to protein analysis. Some reactions have been considered specific for protein because of the high concentration of protein and the minimum concentrations of interferences present in serum. For example, the biuret reaction is highly susceptible to interference by nonprotein sub-stances (2 - 5). Besides pigments, any substance con-taining nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur that is able t...|$|R
40|$|Convincing direct {{evidence}} that in dogs the se-cretion of BSP into bile {{is limited by}} a maximal rate, similar to the transport maximum (Tm) for certain substances secreted by the renal tubules, has been provided by Wheeler and co-workers (1, 2). They also showed that the Tm for BSP may be estimated from observations on peripheral plasma concentrations during different rates of constant infusion without resort to bile collections, hepatic venous sampling, or measurement of he-patic blood flow. The <b>colorimetrically</b> <b>determined</b> maximal output of BSP in dog bile was equal, on the average, to 87. 57 o % of the estimated Tm. The existence of a rate-limited BSP transport mecha-nism in man was inferred from the achievement of a state in which the hepatic removal rate was independent of the absolute plasma concentration and related only to {{the rate of change}} of plasma concentration. Utilizing the constant-infusion technic, estimations of Tm in man, analogous to those in the dog, have been reported by Wheeler and his group and by workers in other laborator-ies as well (3, 4).

Thus, nitrite determination at low concentrations is a major challenge in electroanalytical chemistry, which can be achieved by fast, cheap, and safe electrochemical sensors. In this work, the working electrode (Au) was functionalized with p-aminothiophenol (p-ATP) and modified with gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) to manufacture the final (Au/p-ATP-Aunano) electrode in a two-step procedure. In the first step, p-ATP was electropolymerized on the electrode surface to obtain a polyaminothiophenol (PATP) coating. In the second step, Au/p-ATP-Aunano working electrode was prepared by coating the surface with the use of HAuCl 4 solution and cyclic voltammetry. Determination of aqueous nitrite samples was performed with the proposed electrode (Au/p-ATP-Aunano) using square wave voltammetry (SWV) in pH 4 buffer medium. Characteristic peak potential of nitrite samples was 0. 76 V, and linear calibration curves of current intensity versus concentration was linear in the range of 0. 5 – 50 mg·L− 1 nitrite with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 12 mg·L− 1.

The animals were revived by mechanical ventilation external cardiac massage, and the intratracheal injection of adrenaline (epinephrine, Moscow Endocrinology Plant) at a dose of 0. 1 mg/kg. Animals were divided into 9 groups and sevorane (sevoflurane, Abbott Laboratories), dalargin (Microgen Research-and-Production Association), or lithium chloride (Sigma Chemical Co.) were separately given with and without CA. Brain tissue homogenate specimens were obtained from euthanized animals.

The content of phosphorylated GSK- 3 / 3 (pGSK- 3 ^) in brain homogenate was estimated by Western blotting. Results. The total level of GSK- 3 ^ in each group was similar (80 — 90 relative units) and remained unchanged throughout each experiment. Twenty-minute ischemia maximally activated GSK- 30 through dephosphorylation. Ten-minute ischemia elevated pGSK- 3 ^ levels by more than 5 times {{as compared to the}} baseline value revealing the «training» effect.
