40|$|Cellulosic {{derivatives}} (cellulose acetate, {{cellulose propionate}} and <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate-butyrate)</b> as membranes, were prepared in different ways. These were then characterised by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle evaluation. Subsequently, catalase (H 2 O 2 : H 2 O 2 oxireductase; EC 1. 11. 1. 6), alcohol oxidase (Alcohol: oxygen oxireductase; EC 1. 1. 3. 13) and glucose oxidase (â-D-Glucose: oxygen 1 -oxireductase; EC 1. 1. 3. 4) were covalently linked to these membranes. The catalytic activity and stability of these enzymes, when immobilised, were examined. The results obtained showed that the immobilisation ef®ciency and {{the stability of the}} coupled enzymes could be correlated with the studied properties of the supports. The cellulose acetate membrane which was prepared by evaporation gave the more active conjugate support-enzyme. Membranes prepared by the immersion technique were more crystalline and therefore less suitable for enzyme immobilisation. The highly hydrophobic membranes, obtained from the propionate and the butyrate esters of cellulose reduced the activities but gave better storage stability...|$|E
