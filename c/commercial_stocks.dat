Particularly, among 134 tentatively identified VOCs, some masses (16 for roasted coffee, 12 for ground coffee and 12 for brewed coffee) were found to significantly discriminate the two species.

40|$|Purpose. To {{provide the}} {{biological}} {{assessment of the}} silver Prussian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio (Bloch, 1782)) <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> of the Dnieper-Bug estuary in {{the conditions of the}} transformed Dnieper river flow. Methodology. During the analysis of the biological state of the Prussian carp <b>commercial</b> <b>stock,</b> the main attention was given to the dynamics of age and sexual structure, length-weight growth rate, absolute fecundity and condition factor. The basic data were collected during the work of control-observation stations of the Institute of Fisheries in the Dnieper-Bug estuary during the current century. The collection and processing of ichthyological materials were performed in accordance with the generally accepted methodologies. Findings. The analysis showed that during the current century, the age structure of the Prussian carp of the Dnieper-Bug estuary was the most labile among other commercial cyprinids. It was found {{that as a result of}} an increase in the right wing of the age series, there was a gradual increase of the mean weighted age of its <b>commercial</b> <b>stock.</b> At the beginning of studies (2001 - 2002), the core of the stock was formed by age- 3 - 6 fish (up); however in subsequent years, a displacement of dominant groups toward the dominance of age- 4 - 7 fish (more than 80...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{preferences}} of a captive herd of goats with feral ancestry were evaluated for 11 artificial pest control baits and <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> feed pellets. A <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> food pellet (based on barley, bran, and oats) {{was the most}} preferred basic bait. A mixture of 2 % diced Griselinia littoralis (broadleaf) leaves (a preferred natural food plant) and 2 % molasses (per weight of basic bait) increased palatability of this basic bait. The best lured bait was aerially sown at 1 kg ha- 1 in a 380 ha area with about 50 feral goats. Only 25 % of the goats were shown by the biological tracer iophenoxic acid to have eaten baits after 8 days. We conclude that one-hit aerial poisoning of goats {{is unlikely to be}} effective as a control method because most goats are unlikely to eat food from off the ground. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

40|$|DNA barcoding {{was used}} to {{investigate}} laboratory and <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> of Eisenia species from four provinces of South Africa. The COI gene was partially amplified and sequenced in selected earthworms from eight local populations (focal groups) and two European laboratory stocks (non-focal groups). Only nine COI haplotypes were identified from the 224 sequences generated. One of these haplotypes was found {{to belong to the}} megascolecid Perionyx excavatus. The remaining eight haplotypes belonged to the genus Eisenia, although only a single E. fetida haplotype, represented by six specimens, was found in one of the European populations. The other seven haplotypes, all occurring in South Africa, were E. andrei. One of the <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> from South Africa and a laboratory culture from Europe were mixtures of E. andrei – P. excavatus and E. andrei – E. fetida, respectively. Previous allozyme studies have helped to suggest that some of the populations included in this study may be suffering from inbreeding depression, which could result in adverse consequences for both the vermiculture industry and ecotoxicological research in South Africa.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the precautionary demand for commodity stocks. It suggests that commodity stocks are held for precautionary purposes by producers, consumers, and intermediate processors, while speculators hold stocks on the expectation of capital gains from a subsequent price rise. Producer and consumer stocks usually account for the largest share of <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> held {{at any point in}} time. For example, at the end of 1990, stocks held by producers and consumers of copper were 72 percent of all <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> of the market economy countries. Yet, the theory explaining the behavior of this class of stocks has not progressed much beyond the concept of convenience yield, first introduced by Kaldor (1939). This paper proposes an alternative theory. Holding of stocks by producers and consumers is viewed as precautionary behavior towards output and price risks. As a theory of behavior towards risks, the precautionary stock demand model encompasses speculative demand by both producers and consumers. Furthermore, both stocks and futures are treated as precautionary instruments, in contrast to the dichotomy that only stocks provide convenience yield while futures are hedging instruments.

40|$|Gilthead {{seabream}} (Sparus aurata) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important species among intensively reared fish in the Mediterranean region. Although there is a considerable interest in the genetic improvement of this species, many of the genetic parameters of <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> have yet to be investigated. The effective population size (Ne) of a commercial gilthead seabream broodstock was determined using microsatellite analysis. Eight microsatellite loci were used to ensure a high confidence to the parental assignment of offspring from several mass-spawning events. The Ne was consistently low, ranging from 14 to 18, between photoperiod-controlled broodstock groups. This equated to an inbreeding rate of 2. 7 - 3. 5 % per generation. The primary constraint on Ne was the high variance in family size and fewer males than females contributing to each spawning. The contribution of male parents to spawning was also more variable than females. Log-linear modelling of offspring counts revealed a significant quadratic relationship, with intermediate parental weights being optimum. The relationship between parental weight and contribution may be evidence of an optimum age structure to the broodstock, or stabilising selection. Low Ne in <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> of gilthead seabream could lead to an increased risk of inbreeding through the practice of broodstock replacement from within same-farm populations...|$|E
