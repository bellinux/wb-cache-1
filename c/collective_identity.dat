5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had {{less to do with}} the game itself and more with being a part of the club's <b>collective</b> <b>identity.</b> On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians hold widely varying {{opinions}} of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied moral authority of the papacy, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often pillaged as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the People's Crusade, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the Rhineland massacres. Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade. However, the Crusades {{had a profound impact on}} Western civilisation: they reopened the Mediterranean to commerce and travel (enabling Genoa and Venice to flourish); they consolidated the <b>collective</b> <b>identity</b> of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, chivalry, and piety that galvanised medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. The Crusades also reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{identities are}} {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} issue in a globalized world. This study examines the interference of Jewish <b>identity</b> with other <b>collective</b> <b>identities,</b> national and transnational, {{as well as the}} influence of religion and values on Jewish and other <b>collective</b> <b>identities</b> in Jewish late adolescents in Belgium. We compared data with those of a previous study on native Belgians and Muslim immigrants (Saroglou & Galand, 2004) and found similarities between Jews and the other two groups in the hierarchies of <b>collective</b> <b>identities</b> and values; however, Jews differed in their weak European identity and the considerable importance to them of autonomy and self-enhancement values (power and achievement). Jewish cultural identity was unrelated to other <b>collective</b> <b>identities,</b> but a shift from a Jewish identity to a new, Belgian identity or to a broad, transnational identity (or both) was occasionally related to low levels of attachment to religion, tradition, power, security, and hedonism and to high levels of universalism, autonomy, and conformity...|$|R
40|$|From a {{narrative}} perspective, organizations' identities are discursive (linguistic) constructs constituted by the multiple identity-relevant narratives that their participants author about them, and which feature, for example, in documents, conversations and electronic media. By defining <b>collective</b> <b>identities</b> as {{the totality of}} such narratives I draw attention to their complex, and often fragmented and heterogeneous nature. My approach contrasts {{with much of the}} theorizing in this field which has tended to homogenize <b>collective</b> <b>identities</b> by emphasizing what is common or shared, failed to capture the interplay between different communities within organizations, and produced bland, undifferentiated empirical research. In particular, the theoretical framework that I outline focuses attention on the importance of "reflexivity, voice, plurivocity, temporality", and "fictionality" to an understanding of <b>collective</b> <b>identities</b> as locales for competing hegemonic claims. In combination, these notions form a unique conceptual model for theorizing and researching <b>collective</b> <b>identities.</b> This said, {{a narrative}} approach also has its limitations, and is proposed as an additional, not exclusive, interpretive lens.

25|$|In recent years, {{to fight}} the loss of {{regional}} diversity, many in France have promoted forms of multiculturalism and encouraged cultural enclaves (communautarisme), including reforms on the preservation of regional languages and the decentralization of certain government functions, but French multiculturalism has had a harder time of accepting, or of integrating into the <b>collective</b> <b>identity,</b> the large non-Christian and immigrant communities and groups {{that have come to}} France since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} part of the initiation of any sort of <b>collective</b> <b>identity</b> for African-born slaves began with relationships formed on slave ships crossing the middle passage.

Malungos were often ethnically related as well, for slaves shipped on the same boat were usually from similar geographical regions of Africa.|$|E

25|$|After the {{founding}} of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century, Njegoš was twice declared Yugoslavia's national poet, by the royal government in the 1920s, and by the communist authorities following the Second World War. In 1947, the 100th anniversary of the publication of Gorski vijenac, the government promoted Njegoš as a Montenegrin poet rather than a Serb. The change in Njegoš's ethnicity may have been related to the communist policy of Brotherhood and Unity and its promotion of a Montenegrin ethnic identity (which the communists had proclaimed distinct from that of Serbs in 1943). Njegoš' works, particularly Gorski vijenac, have been sources of <b>collective</b> <b>identity</b> for Serbs, Montenegrins and Yugoslavs. Njegoš's works {{have been removed from}} school curricula in Bosnia and Herzegovina so as not to incite ethnic tensions given the divisive nature of some of his works. His influence parallels that of Shakespeare in the English-speaking world, and his languagethough archaichas supplied modern Serbian with a number of well known quotations. The epic has become the basic educational text for Montenegrins and Serbs. In Montenegro it was (and still is) learnt by heart, and has been integrated into oral tradition. Njegoš's picture can often seen in taverns, offices, hospitals, on Yugoslav and Serbian currency and in people's homes in Montenegro and Serbia.|$|E

25|$|Non-financial cooperatives - such as {{fishermen}} coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, {{continue to}} provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to {{have given way to}} more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing to have a very close sense of 'community' and <b>collective</b> <b>identity</b> - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well-being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of collective enterprise, often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and seem to go through in cyclical fashion ever-since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.|$|E
500|$|Even {{prior to}} the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the {{subculture}} were identified in a 1981 issue of Fan Rōdo (Fan road) about [...] "culture clubs".

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze {{principles}} of the multiconfessional society in the early modern Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. I focus mainly on conflicts between elites of the different religion which I analyze through the concept of <b>collective</b> <b>identities.</b> The main target group of the analysis is the highest political elite of the Commonwealth. Through examples of the leading magnates from Lithuania and Ukraine I show the relation between different <b>collective</b> <b>identities,</b> loyalties and political pragmatism in the time of political crisis after the year 1648. My question is, how far different religion influenced formation of the political camps and behaviour of magnates in this age. I conclude that religion was an important factor in forming of the opposition groups and conflicts but one can not see the magnate society strictly devided between confessional groups. The different religion played an important role if it merged with other <b>collective</b> <b>identities</b> such as class, regional or national identity. This was the case of the conflict in Ukraine...|$|R

500|$|Delayed {{from its}} {{intended}} release date by {{over a month}} due to the extended period of production, All Things Must Pass was issued on Apple Records in late November 1970 to great acclaim. The triple album featured a cover photo of Harrison dressed in gardening attire, seated on the main lawn of Friar Park's south garden and surrounded by four figures from Crisp's extensive collection of Bavarian gnomes. Having been stolen [...] "in about 1871", according to photographer Barry Feinstein, the figures had just been returned to Friar Park and placed on the grass. Commentators interpret Feinstein's photo as representing Harrison's removal from the Beatles' <b>collective</b> <b>identity,</b> and the cover helped establish a synonymity between Harrison and Friar Park that Alan Clayson has described as equalling that between Queen Elizabeth II and Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|The stark {{black-and-white}} cover {{photo was}} {{taken on the}} main lawn at Friar Park by Wilkes' Camouflage Productions partner, Barry Feinstein.

Author and music journalist Mikal Gilmore has written that Lennon's initial negativity regarding All Things Must Pass was possibly because he was [...] "irritated" [...] by this cover photo; Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley attributes this reaction to envy on Lennon's part {{during a time when}} [...] "everything [...] touched turned to gold".|$|E
