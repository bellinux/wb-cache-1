5|$|On November 15, 2010, astronomers using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory {{announced}} that, while {{viewing the}} remnant of SN 1979C {{in the galaxy}} Messier 100, they have discovered an object which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> young, 30-year-old black hole. NASA also noted the possibility this object <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> spinning neutron star producing a wind of high energy particles.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} {{can also be}} cannibalized or {{evaporated}} by a companion star, causing the white dwarf to lose so much mass that it becomes a planetary mass object.

5|$|A Viking funeral <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and {{the grave}} goods {{were not considered}} to have been wasted. In {{addition to being a}} homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships.|$|E

5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E

5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
