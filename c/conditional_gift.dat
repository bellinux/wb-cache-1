Among Sendred's several stipulations for the bishop was that the sacriscrinius (churchwarden) Bonfill and his successors should not be removed from that post. In the church's cartulary, the Libri antiquitatum, the scribe has called this document a conveniencia (agreement), the earliest use of that spelling, which has persisted in modern Spanish.|$|E

Her desire is romantic, but {{simultaneously}} monstrous.|$|E

50|$|One case in New South Wales, Australia {{ended in}} the man suing his former fiancée because she threw the ring away, after he told her she could keep it even though the {{marriage}} plans had fallen through. The Supreme Court of New South Wales held that, despite what the man said, the ring remained a <b>conditional</b> <b>gift</b> (partly because his saying that she could keep it reflected his desire to salvage the relationship) and she was ordered to pay him its A$15,250 cost.|$|E
50|$|Southwestern has {{had many}} {{financial}} and non-financial supporters, but some stand {{out by the}} magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. During the Great Depression, a <b>conditional</b> <b>gift</b> from Southwestern alumna Louisa Carothers Wiess substantially increased the university's endowment and motivated the university to pay off all its debts. While serving in Congress, Lyndon Baines Johnson helped Southwestern acquire the Navy V-12 Program during World War II {{at a time when}} the university was struggling financially. Former student Red McCombs contributed financial support for the campus center and an apartment complex. The Brown Foundation, Cullen Foundation, and Mabee Foundation have contributed financial support for multiple construction projects.|$|E
5000|$|One {{challenge}} in settling disputes for breach of promise was {{determining whether a}} gift made during the engagement was an absolute gift—one given permanently, with no strings attached—or a <b>conditional</b> <b>gift,</b> given in the expectation of the marriage taking place. If an engagement gift was given on a holiday, such as Valentine's Day or Christmas, the gift could {{be considered to be}} non-contingent, and given partially for reasons other than marriage, and thus {{does not have to be}} returned. Christmas presents are generally taken to be absolute gifts, and thus cannot be recovered if the engagement dissolves, but engagement rings are generally taken to be conditional gifts, at least under most circumstances, which means that they must be returned if the recipient no longer chooses to go through with the marriage. [...] Whether an engagement ring must be returned if the giver breaks off the engagement varies.|$|E
40|$|Whenever an {{engagement}} {{comes to a}} premature end, the first question {{that seems to be}} asked is: “who gets the engagement ring?” This Comment seeks to answer this question. As societal views regarding marriage and a woman’s role within it began to change in the mid-twentieth century, courts started to recognize engagement rings as <b>conditional</b> <b>gifts</b> that were conditioned upon the marriage actually occurring. Even with this framework, states remain divided on whether fault should be included as part of the analysis in determining which party is entitled to the ring if {{an engagement}} ends before marriage occurs. This Comment examines {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the three approaches used by courts in determining suits to recover engagement rings, and ultimately proposes a universal, no-fault approach allowing exceptions for egregious conduct. Such an approach would allow for predictability, efficiency, and consistency among the states that is not currently available...|$|R
40|$|The maritagium and {{the gift}} in tail were <b>conditional</b> <b>gifts</b> by which {{land from the}} {{patrimony}} might be provided to daughters and younger sons while ensuring that when such cadet branches failed the land {{would return to the}} central inheritance. The coalescence of the common law around coherent principles and the legislation of Edward I on land conveyance resulted in the demise of the maritagium as a land conveyance form and its replacement by the gift in tail. Also, attitudes about the place of women in the family and marriage and the economic changes of the thirteenth century, which encouraged the development of a flexible strategy between demesne and rented lands created a land sales market, caused the practice of granting marriage portions in land to daughters to be replaced by monetary and chattel gifts, while no such change was made in the provision for younger sons...|$|R
40|$|In Graev v. Commissioner, the Tax Court {{decided whether}} the taxpayers’ {{donations}} of a facade easement and cash contributions were <b>conditional</b> <b>gifts</b> and therefore disallowable as charitable deductions under {{the requirements of}} the regulations. The court reviewed the facts to determine whether the condition was allowed because it was “so remote as to be negligible. ” The taxpayers argued that case law {{at the time of the}} donation allowed for a donation of between 10 and 15 percent of the value of the property, and that they had deducted a value constituting 11 percent of the property’s appraised value; that the example provided in Notice 2004 - 41 did not apply to the specific transaction at issue; that there was no possibility that the charity would return the property; that when the easement deed was recorded, the doctrine of merger extinguished the charity’s refund letter; and that the letter was a nullity under Commissioner v. Procter...|$|R
5000|$|In {{most states}} of the United States, {{engagement}} rings are considered [...] "conditional gifts" [...] under the legal rules of property. This is {{an exception to the}} general rule that gifts cannot be revoked once properly given. See, for example, the case of Meyer v. Mitnick, 625 N.W.2d 136 (Michigan, 2001), whose ruling found the following reasoning persuasive: [...] "the so-called 'modern trend' holds that because an engagement ring is an inherently <b>conditional</b> <b>gift,</b> once the engagement has been broken, the ring should be returned to the donor. Thus, the question of who broke the engagement and why, or who was 'at fault,' is irrelevant. This is the no-fault line of cases." [...] Though in certain states, whether a judicial action can be maintained at all to require return of an engagement ring is blocked by statute, as many states have statutes which state that no civil action shall be maintained for breach of promise to marry.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{consider}} how gift-exchange and bonus systems {{function in a}} natural field setting by measuring the effort response of participants to non-monetary gifts over time. Our field experiment tests the difference in effort response to unconditional gifts delivered immediately, promised unconditional gifts delivered later, and conditional gifts linked to reaching a specific performance target. We find important benefits from promising to give an unconditional gift later: participants respond positively to a promised gift twice by increasing effort when the gift is promised and again when it is received. A promised gift outperforms both the unconditional gift delivered immediately, {{which leads to a}} single positive response, and the <b>conditional</b> <b>gift</b> based on performance, which does not trigger any significant behavioural change after the gift is delivered. The study lends insights into the relativ...|$|E

Boby the butler, for instance, was previously {{a judge in}} Güllen, but ultimately opted out of the profession in order to enter into Claire's personal service. The salary, he explains to the town, was so high that he couldn't refuse her. This foreshadows the town's experience with Claire's <b>conditional</b> gift: the <b>gift</b> is so generous that the sacrifice of personal and collective dignity is not too high {{a price to pay}} in return.|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore how}} {{economic}} decisions diverge for different age groups. Two essays address the location decisions of older households while the third examines why different age cohorts donate to charities. The first essay estimates how the age {{distribution of the}} population across cities will change {{as the number of}} older adults rises. I use a residential sorting model to estimate the location preference heterogeneity between younger and older households. I then simulate where the two household types will live in 2030. All MSAs end up with a higher proportion of older households in 2030, and only eight of 243 MSAs experience a {{decline in the number of}} older households. The results suggest that MSAs in upstate New York and on the west coast, particularly in California, will have the largest number of older households in 2030. Florida will remain a popular place for older households, but its relative importance may diminish in the future. The second essay explores whether the basic motivations for charitable giving differ by age cohort. Using the results from a randomized field experiment, I test whether benefits to self or benefits to others drives the charitable giving decision for each age cohort. I find limited heterogeneity for benefits to self. Individuals between the ages of 50 and 64 increase average donations more than any other age cohort in response to emphasizing warm glow, and this heterogeneity is exclusively driven by larger <b>conditional</b> <b>gifts.</b> The third essay is preliminary joint work with H. Spencer Banzhaf and Carlianne Patrick. We build a unique data set of local homestead exemptions, which vary by generosity and eligibility requirements, for tax jurisdictions in Georgia. Using school-district-level Census data since 1970 along with the history of such exemptions, we will explore the impact of these exemptions, particularly exemptions targeting older households, on the demographic makeup of each jurisdiction and consider the impact of these laws on the relative levels of housing capital consumed by older and younger households...|$|R

The archaeology and occupational collections were a <b>gift</b> <b>conditional</b> upon {{the purchase of}} his ethnographic collection (furniture, treen, ceramics etc.) {{as well as the}} provision of suitable display facilities for the illustration of Bedfordshire occupations. The rural life gallery at Luton Museum remained on display until the 1970s when the then curator decided to change the gallery to one showing aspects of Luton life and history of the town.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how undergraduates’ financial aid packages affect their subsequent dona-tive behavior as alumni. The empirical work {{is based upon}} a rich set of micro data on alumni giving at an anonymous research university, which we call Anon U. We focus on three types of financial aid, scholarships, loans, and campus jobs. A novel aspect of our modeling strategy is that, consistent with the view of some professional fundraisers, we allow the receipt of a given form of aid per se to affect alumni giving. At the same time, our model allows {{the amount of the}} support to affect giving behavior nonlinearly. Our main findings are: 1) Individuals who took out student loans are less likely to make a gift, other things being the same. Further, individuals who take out large loans make smaller con-tributions as alumni, conditional on making a gift. This effect is unlikely to be {{due to the fact that}} repaying the loan reduces the alumnus’s capacity to give. We conjecture that, rather, it is caused by an “annoyance effect” — alumni resent the fact that they are burdened with loans. 2) Scholar-ship aid reduces the size of a <b>gift,</b> <b>conditional</b> on making a gift, but has little effect on the proba-bility of making a donation. Students who received scholarships are also less likely to be in the top 10 percent of givers in their class in a given year. The negative effect of receiving a scholar-ship on the amount donated decreases in absolute value with the size of the scholarship. Again, we do not find any evidence of income effects, i. e., that scholarship recipients give less because they have relatively low incomes post graduation. 3) Aid in the form of campus jobs does not have a strong effect on donative behavior. alumni, donations, financial aid, college...|$|R
