5000|$|As {{the time}} {{approached}} crews collected their parachutes and Mae West life preservers from the Parachute Section, and [...] "suited up" [...] in the [...] "crew room" [...] or locker room climbing into their flying suits ensuring {{that everything was}} comfortable ready for a flight which could be ten or twelve hours long, memoirs mention that lucky charms were checked and double checked, some men were quieter while others were noisy and putting a brave face on to cover their uncertainty. Airmen had to remove all personal effects from their pockets in case of capture in which event the intelligence value might assist an enemy interrogator, bus tickets, cinema tickets and cash were all forbidden. They made ready to climb aboard canvas topped trucks to be driven out by WAAFs to where their aircraft waited dispersed {{around the edge of}} the airfield's perimeter track. [...] On arrival the crew would check their aircraft over again before the pilot and flight engineer started the engines to [...] "run them up", following which he as captain of the crew, signed the ground crew chief's Form 700 on a <b>clip</b> <b>board</b> accepting responsibility for a fully serviceable bomber. Some crews urinated on the tail wheel, believing it brought luck before, at the appropriate time they climbed aboard and took their positions ready for take off. Most sorties were night time attacks and commenced with crews taking off at dusk or into the evening from bases in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire or Cambridgeshire.|$|E

This paper proposed a WAVE-based windshield inspection gauge design technology and the characteristics of WAVE technology was explained in detail.

50|$|Each {{destroyer}} would {{secure the}} tether of an inflated kite balloon {{from the air}} station dock just prior to leaving port. While the destroyer escorted a convoy, the pilot would board the kite balloon basket each morning just before daylight. The pilot would <b>clip</b> the <b>boarding</b> line to his parachute harness so four seamen could hoist him into the balloon by pulling {{the opposite end of}} the line through a pulley on the kite balloon. They tried to make the hoist during a calm period, but it was not unusual for the pilot to be dunked into the Atlantic before reaching his observation basket. The kite balloon might behave erratically in the turbulence abaft the destroyer, so the whole observation basket might also be dunked before the tether was extended allowing the kite balloon to go aloft. Wet or dry, the balloon pilot spent the whole day aloft in the kite balloon whose appearance and airborne movement earned it the nickname: rubber cow.|$|R
5000|$|What {{follows is}} a race of epic proportions. Halfway through {{disaster}} strikes when Jug Mckenzie <b>clips</b> Choppers <b>board</b> sending the two favourites crashing out of the race. Seemingly with their chances of winning totally ruined, both Mckenzie and Chopper surf like they never have before {{and by the time}} they hit the home stretch they are neck to neck, but McKenzie wins by less than an inch. Chopper is left stunned, in total disbelief that he lost. As Dredd moves in for the arrest, Chopper turns to Jug and congratulates the defending champion, telling him [...] "You're the tops, Jug - Number one." [...] Dredd raises his gun and calls for Chopper's surrender, but Chopper refuses, and slowly surfs away making no attempt at a quick getaway and giving Dredd plenty of opportunity to fire. But Dredd hesitates and is then struck from behind by Jug McKenzie, allowing Chopper to make a getaway into the Radback (Radioactive Outback - the Oz equivalent of the Cursed Earth).|$|R

5000|$|The {{popularity}} and accessibility of strips meant {{they were often}} clipped and saved; authors including John Updike and Ray Bradbury have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. Often posted on bulletin <b>boards,</b> <b>clipped</b> strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. The Baltimore Suns Linda White recalled, [...] "I followed the adventures of Winnie Winkle, Moon Mullins and Dondi, and waited each fall to see how Lucy would manage to trick Charlie Brown into trying to kick that football.

40|$|Abstract / Since their {{revival in}} the 1980 s, lindy hop and other swing dances have become increas-ingly popular with middle-class youth. There are {{hundreds}} of vibrant local swing-dance communi-ties throughout the developed world, and in each, dancing {{is the most important}} form of social interaction. Yet despite this emphasis on embodied cultural practice, swing dancers make great use of digital online technology, from YouTube and the exchange of digital audio-visual <b>clips</b> to discussion <b>boards,</b> instant messaging and email. Despite the transgressive and subversive history of swing dances in African American communities, {{the extent to which these}} legacies are taken up by contemporary swing dancers is a matter of debate. This article considers the uses of online audio-visual media by contemporary swing dancers and the extents to which they might realize their resistant history...|$|R
