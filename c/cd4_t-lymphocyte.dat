50|$|Cytometry for Life (C4L) is {{a program}} aimed at {{lessening}} {{the burden of the}} HIV/AIDS epidemic. The C4L program provides portable battery-powered laboratories that can identify the level of depression of the immune system of an HIV-positive individual to regions of the world lacking this ability. C4L’s portable laboratory is a <b>CD4</b> <b>T-Lymphocyte</b> counter and is designed to be simple to operate, portable, reliable and function on battery power. C4L was created by J. Paul Robinson and Gary Durack.|$|E
50|$|Many {{head and}} neck cancers are able to escape immune {{responses}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Once such example is through the production of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines. This can be achieved when the tumor recruits immunosuppressive cell subsets into the tumor's environment. Such cells include pro-tumor M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), Th-2 polarized <b>CD4</b> <b>T-lymphocytes,</b> and regulatory T-lymphocytes. These cells can then limit the responses of T cells through the production of cytokines and by releasing immune-modulating enzymes.|$|R
50|$|CD4 {{testing is}} a normal {{practice}} in the clinical laboratory, and is accomplished {{through the use of}} flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research institution around the world. While flow cytometry techniques are straightforward, they are not necessarily simple, particularly when applied to clinical practice. A great deal of automated technology is employed to gather measurements, analyze data, and produce reports. Consequently, the cost of performing these tests is relatively high. CD4 testing is generally performed by a flow cytometer. In this process, a small tube of blood cells is treated with a reagent which is specific to the CD4 lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell).The reagents used for identification are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These antibodies can specifically attach to a certain type of cell. In this case, the antibody will attach to a CD4 T cell. Certain molecules (called fluorochromes) areattached to the antibody to aid in the identification process. When a laser beam is fired at the cells, those cells with the attached molecules emit a signal identifying themselves. This signal is called fluorescence and can easily be measured with sensitive detectors. If hundreds or thousands of cells are forced past the laser very quickly, an accurate count can be obtained of all cells that are present. CD4 cells are measured in this manner. CD is an acronym for “cluster of differentiation,” and that simply means that this molecule can be classified into a well-defined group of cells. In this case, it is cluster of differentiation 4, or a <b>CD4</b> helper <b>T-lymphocyte</b> cell.|$|R
