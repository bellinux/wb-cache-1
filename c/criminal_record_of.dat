500|$|On 26 April, {{two days}} before [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] was due to air, the British {{government}} intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned Lord Thomson, chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast {{on the grounds that}} Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, [...] "paradoxically", the decision [...] "was not a difficult one. My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction". With a slightly altered rationale—that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest—Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E

2500|$|During Easter of 1948, Timothy Evans and {{his wife}} Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans {{informed}} police {{that his wife was}} dead. A police search of 10Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl Evans, her daughter, Geraldine, and a 16-week-old male foetus in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice over in a blanket and then a table cloth. The post-mortem revealed that both mother and daughter had been strangled and that Beryl Evans had been physically assaulted before her death, shown by facial bruising. Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched abortion operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police themselves, as the statement appears contrived and artificial. After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders. On 11January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife. Christie was a principal witness for the Crown and gave evidence denying Evans's accusations. The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> theft and violence, and, after an appeal on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 9 March 1950. (Christie himself lost the job he had held for four years at the Post Office Savings Bank due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.) ...|$|E

50|$|The law {{addresses}} {{serious issues}} in identifying fake ID cards and passports, producing double {{records for the}} same person, and identity theft which are caused when using the documentation of a person from whom the identity was stolen. These examples, allow the misuse of identification documents for illegal immigration, criminal and economic offenses, and activities which harm Israel's national security. Nowadays identification documents are easily forged by criminals, who often {{try to get the}} assistance of state workers. From 2005 to 2007 the Interior Ministry reported the loss, theft and destruction of about 150,000 ID cards per year, for which submitted requests were handed in for new identity cards. In many cases, in question the loss, theft and destruction of the ID cards occurred several times for the same resident during these three years. The data of the Israeli Police indicates that about 52 percent of the individuals who submitted requests for new identity cards after theirs was lost, stolen and/or destroyed, between the years 1995 to 2006 had a <b>criminal</b> <b>record,</b> <b>of</b> which 10 percent have a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> distribution of counterfeit documents.|$|E
