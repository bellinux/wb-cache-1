6000|$|How do journalists fetch {{up their}} drivel? I aim only at {{clearness}} {{and the most}} obvious finish, positively at no higher degree of merit, not even at brevity - I am sure {{it could have been}} all done, with double the time, in two-thirds of the space. And yet it has taken me two months to write 45,500 words; and, be damned to my wicked prowess, I am proud of the exploit! The real journalist must be a man not of brass only, but bronze. Chapter IX. gapes for me, but I shrink on the margin, and go on chattering to you. This last part will be much less offensive (strange to say) to the Germans. It is Becker they will never forgive me for; Knappe I pity and do not dislike; Becker I scorn and abominate. [...] Here is the tableau. I. Elements of Discord: Native. II. Elements of Discord: Foreign. [...] III. The Sorrows of Laupepa. [...] IV. Brandeis. V. The Battle of Matautu. VI. Last Exploits of Becker. VII. The Samoan Camps. VIII. Affairs of Lautii and Fangalii. IX. 'FUROR CONSULARIS.' X. The Hurricane. [...] XI. Stuebel Recluse. XII. The Present Government. I estimate the whole roughly at 70,000 words. Should anybody ever dream of reading it, it would be found amusing. 70000/300=233 printed pages; a respectable little five-bob volume, to bloom unread in shop windows. After that, I'll have a spank at fiction. And rest? I shall rest in the grave, or when I come to Italy. If only the public will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>me!</b> I lost my chance not dying; there seems blooming little fear of it now. I worked close on five hours this morning; the day before, close on nine; and unless I finish myself off with this letter, I'll have another hour and a half, or AIBLINS TWA, before dinner. Poor man, how you must envy me, as you hear of these orgies of work, and you scarce able for a letter. But Lord, Colvin, how lucky the situations are not reversed, for I have no situation, nor am fit for any. Life is a steigh brae. Here, have at Knappe, and no more clavers! ...|$|E
40|$|I {{dedicate}} {{my thesis}} to my participants because without them {{this would not}} be possible. You all were more than patient with me throughout the research and writing process, and I am thankful for the friendships we created throughout this process. I also dedicate my thesis to my niece, Kailey. While writing my thesis, she told me she wanted to grow her hair out to donate to young girls like me. At the age of four, you are so smart and caring. I could not have done it without you! I want to offer special thanks my parents, Stacy and Larry, and my sisters, Kylie and Kensie, who have experienced my condition and baldness with me. Although my dreams are ever-evolving, you all <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>me</b> without hesitation. I also want to thank my closest friends, Ashley; Taylr; Robyn; Ericka; and Josh, and my dog, MaryJane, for simply being there for me and for taking my mind off of the thesis process when I needed it the most...|$|E
40|$|In my life, I have {{sometimes}} {{heard that one}} cannot live alone. After finishing up my dissertation, I now feel that this statement truly applies to my dissertation process. I first would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Michael Goh. Without your support, I am sure that I {{would not have been}} able to finish my dissertation and write this acknowledgement. In spite of my slow progress, you continued to be committed to support and encourage me, and your consistent and stable attitude helped me a great deal to not to give up but keep on going, and even after the dissertation is done, I know that your existence in me will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>me</b> in the future, and in that sense, you gave me a much bigger and precious gift to me, more than just helping me to write a dissertation. And I am forever grateful to you. I would like to thank my wonderful committee members, Dr. Tom Skovholt, Dr. Kay Thomas, and Dr. Josef Mestenhauser. For Tom, I appreciate your calm and reassuring presence throughout my years in Minneapolis, as well as your genuine interest in my research topic and my personal process of writing the dissertation. For Kay, I think it has been more than 17 years since I met you when I first studied abroa...|$|E

Also, I {{would like to}} thank my friends, especially Esra Aycan, helping me when writing this thesis using LATEX. Without them, it may have taken too much time to write this document. Finally, I {{would like to thank}} my family who always <b>supported</b> <b>me</b> whole the TIME SYNCHRONIZATION IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS In this thesis, an enhanced synchronization algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks is proposed. This algorithm uses TPSN (Timing-sync protocol for sensor networks) as a base synchronizer and does modifications on it to achieve a better synchronization with a lower message overhead. Basically, there are three improvements that can be applied onto TPSN, which are clustering the network, chain synchronization among nodes and adaptive synchronization interval. In {{the first phase of the}} thesis, a simulatio...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank {{everyone}} in my family for all of their continuing support throughout my life in everything I do and being my biggest cheerleaders. I {{would like to}} thank the following: Barbara Turner for being an excellent proofreader, friend and an even better educator; Jesse Maurer for being my partner in life and thank him for <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>me</b> in my dreams, no matter how long they are taking to achieve; Sycamore High School allowed me unobstructed access to their records, interviews and any other help I needed to complete my research; my colleagues in the School of Education, specifically Myrna Baylis, to whom I owe my successful IRB, Alex Chapman, Lisa Gordon and Taylor Mancini who have been on this journey with me from the beginning, have helped me to laugh through the stress and keep my eye on the big picture and our purpose. Without you guys this process would have been a lot less fun. Suzanne Roybal has played a key part in my time in the School of Education and deserves a big thank you for all the work she does out of the kindness of her heart to help all of us reach our fullest potential in our research and in our lives. Lastly, I {{would like to thank}} the faculty in the School of Education at Dominican for allowing me to pursue m...|$|R
40|$|First, I {{would like}} to thank Dr. Roner for letting me join his lab. He is an {{excellent}} mentor. He was always very patient, supportive, and helpful. I learned a great deal from him, and I will always be grateful. I {{would also like to thank}} Dr. van Waasbergen. She gave me my first opportunity to do research in a lab. I learned a great deal from her as well. The knowledge and experience that I gained from both have made me a better scientist. I am very lucky to have been able to work with both. There were many people who helped me along the way. Dr. Formanowicz and Dr. Badon were always there to listen when I needed them to be. My fellow graduate student and the undergraduates that I worked in the lab with were always excellent sounding boards and sources of inspiration. I would especially like to thank Anthony Kappell, Guimel Molina, and Nicole Grose for their friendship. Last, but certainly not least, I {{would like to}} thank my family. My parents taught me that I could do anything that I wanted to do. Their love and <b>support</b> helped get <b>me</b> where I am today. Unfortunately, my father passed away before he could see me receive my PhD, but I know that he would have been proud and very happy for me. Most of all, I {{would like to thank}} my husband. He is my rock. Without his love and support, I could not have gotten this far. I know that there were many times when he wished that I had a “real ” job, but he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>me</b> no matter what. I feel very fortunate to be his wife. I hope he knows how much I love and appreciate him...|$|R

40|$|ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am {{grateful}} for the experiences I’ve had while furthering my education through this institution. Although this pursuit was not unique, in the trying endeavors of a graduate student, I feel that I am graduating with new skills and life lessons that will enrich my life hereafter. For this I have many to thank. Thank you, Dr. Church, for always putting me up to new challenges {{as well as providing}} me with opportunities to learn techniques at BIOS and FSU that would help me with my research. Thank you, Simon, for your encouragement, guidance and easy going but efficient approach to research. Thank you, Dr. Luther, for your ideas and valuable insight on trace metal chemistry. To my lab mate, Maria, thank you for your friendship these past few years- a balance of sharing life’s highs and a little empathizing here and there. Lastly, I am indebted to my parents, my brother and my boyfriend, whom all <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> and love <b>me</b> unconditionally...|$|R

These graces have carried me through difficult times and they have brought more joy to the good times than I ever could have imagined. The days of our lives, for all of us, are numbered. We know that. And, yes, there are certainly times when we aren't able to muster as much strength and patience as we would like. It's called being human.But I have found that in the simple act of living with hope, and in the daily effort to have a positive impact in the world, the days I do have are made all the more meaningful and precious. And for that I am grateful. It isn't possible to put into words the love and gratitude I feel to everyone who has and <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> and inspire <b>me</b> every day. To you I simply say: you know." ...|$|R
