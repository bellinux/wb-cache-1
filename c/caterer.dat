5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon.

For example, a New York <b>caterer</b> serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants.

The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the absorption of}} chromium, copper and arsenic released from treated wood used by street food <b>caterers</b> and household residents in an informal urban area and a peri-urban area in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants (n= 78) selected included {{an equal number of}} <b>caterers</b> and residents in each area. All participants answered an exposure questionnaire and were tested for urinary chromium, copper and arsenic, while the urine of 29 participants was also tested for toxic arsenic. Urinary chromium and arsenic exceeded the environmental exposure limit in 12 % and 30 % of participants, respectively. Toxic arsenic was detected in 30 % of samples of which 24 % exceeded the environmental exposure limit of 6. 4 ?g/g creatinine. Urinary chromium, copper, arsenic and toxic arsenic levels were not significantly different between participants from the two areas or between <b>caterers</b> and household residents, controlling for confounding effects. The study provides evidence of chromium and arsenic exposure amongst both informal <b>caterers</b> and household residents, which requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|As an industrialised {{high quality}} food commodity, organic milk would present a {{reliable}} option to feature catering for sustainability. However, {{its use in}} schools, hospitals and workplaces is minimal in Finland at the moment. To boost perspective taking on organic milk among <b>caterers,</b> a co-developmental dialogue in terms of organic milk was employed by researchers and practitioners. The first turn of the dialogue {{was taken by the}} researcher who invited the <b>caterers</b> to focus on organic milk; the second was offered by practitioners, who dislosed their views about organic milk in individual interviews and focus group discussions. The third turn was taken by the researcher, who shared information with <b>caterers</b> about their issues and suggested the test use of organic milk. As the fourth turn of the dialogue the <b>caterers</b> responded to the researcher by their chosen practices for the (test) use of organic milk. The dialogue as a participatory research method seemed to offer new ways to promote catering for sustainability...|$|R

5|$|The {{restaurant}} was {{moved into the}} Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La Tante Claire, {{in the same year}} that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named Chef of the Year by <b>Caterer</b> and Hotelkeepers Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E
