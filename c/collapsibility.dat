50|$|Resin binders {{are natural}} or {{synthetic}} {{high melting point}} gums. The two common types used are urea formaldehyde (UF) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins.

50|$|Molds for {{the casting}} process consist of two halves.

50|$|While {{based on}} the same design principles, this suit's matrix was formed non-collapsible to {{increase}} its protection from the rigors of deep space; also, its specialized nature made <b>collapsibility</b> unnecessary. Power was provided by a Mk IV micro-nuclear supply pack, supplemented by solar power converters. Systems were controlled via a cybernetic interface, though it proved to be overly sensitive; when Stark first used the armor he had difficulty triggering the appropriate command to activate the feature he wanted. The suit was designed for extended time outside of the atmosphere, up to two days in orbit (food and catheterization capable). The life support, boot jets and altitude maneuvering were powered by an on-board supply of liquid oxygen. Weaponry consisted of palm-mounted third-generation Repulsors (electron beams which require laser ionized path of air to travel through the atmosphere; the beam is moderated using a pulsing beam and early form of adaptive optics; objects are jolted away from the beam path by the combination of ionized air and the accelerated neutron beam) and a chest-mounted Unibeam (a variable intensity light source usable as a spotlight or a laser; the pentagonal shape of the emitter allowed for more accurate laser pulsing while in an atmosphere), and epaulet-mounted concussion-burst cannons. Sensors consisted of radar, sonar, infrared scanners, and radio. Additional features included ECM against radar and sonar, and the fully articulated hands could be fired out on retractable cables for use as long-range grapples. The most obvious feature on this special armor was its ability to attain escape velocity without aid of an external thruster, unique to this Iron Man version; however, the nuclear jets which allowed this made the suit bulky, heavy and awkward in Earth's gravity. The dangers inherent in an atomic-energy based propulsion system of such immense power seem to have driven Stark to build the thruster unit which he has been using ever since.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{potentially}} collapsible soils in the Czech Republic. <b>Collapsibility</b> {{is one of}} the dangerous phenomena of soils and in some cases it causes extreme deformation of structures. Hydrocollapse may happen especially at quaternary sediments - loess and in the made ground - spoilheaps. Loess is present at {{a large part of the}} Czech Republic and the risk of <b>collapsibility</b> may therefore be considerable. First, in the state of the art an overview of soil <b>collapsibility</b> is provided and the regions where the collapsible soils are present are identified. The main part of the thesis deals with the evaluation of the collapse potential and assessing the degree of <b>collapsibility.</b> It is concluded that in the Czech Republic only slight to moderate degree of <b>collapsibility</b> should be expected in natural soils. With respect to the made ground the fresh lumpy clay fills may exhibit a substantial degree of <b>collapsibility</b> if the macro-voids (high intergranular porosity) are retained until sudden saturating. Finally the possible methods of soil improvement to minimise the <b>collapsibility</b> of loess deposits are briefly summarised...|$|E

40|$|Maximal expiratory flow {{in chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{could be reduced}} by three different mechanisms; loss of lung elastic recoil, decreased airway conductance upstream of flow-limiting segments; and increased <b>collapsibility</b> of airways. We hypothesized that decreased upstream conductance would be related to inflammation and thickening of the airway walls, increased <b>collapsibility</b> would be related to decreased airway cartilage volume, and decreased <b>collapsibility</b> to inflammation and thickening of the airway walls. Lung tissue was obtained from 72 patients with different degrees of COPD, who were operated upon for a solitary peripheral lung lesion. Maximal flow-static recoil (MFSR) plots to estimate upstream resistance and airway <b>collapsibility</b> were derived in 59 patients from preoperatively measured maximal expiratory flow-volume and pressure-volume curves. In 341 transversely cut airway sections, airway size, airway wall dimensions and inflammatory changes were measured. Airflow obstruction correlated with lung elastic recoil and the MFSR estimate of airway conductance but not to airway <b>collapsibility</b> or to the amount of airway cartilage. The upstream conductance decreased as the inner wall became thicker. Airway <b>collapsibility</b> did not correlate with the amount of airway cartilage, inflammation, or airway wall thickness.

Intrathoracic tracheal <b>collapsibility</b> measured at paired inspiratory–expiratory low dose computed tomography (CT) and its correlation with clinical, functional, and CT-densitometric data were investigated in 69 patients with COPD according to their predominant conductive airway or emphysema phenotypes and according to sex. Intrathoracic tracheal <b>collapsibility</b> was higher in patients with predominant conductive airway disease (n= 28) and in females (n= 27). Women with a predominant conductive airway phenotype (n= 10) showed a significantly greater degree of <b>collapsibility</b> than women with predominant emphysema (28. 9 %± 4 % versus 11. 6 %± 2 %; P< 0. 001). Intrathoracic tracheal <b>collapsibility</b> was directly correlated with inspiratory–expiratory volume variation at CT and with forced expiratory volume (1 second), and inversely correlated with reduced CT lung density and functional residual capacity. Intrathoracic tracheal <b>collapsibility</b> was not correlated with cough and wheezing; however, intrathoracic tracheal <b>collapsibility</b> and clinical phenotypes of COPD are closely correlated. In patients with a predominant emphysematous phenotype, a reduced <b>collapsibility</b> may reflect the mechanical properties of the stiff hyperinflated emphysematous lung. The high <b>collapsibility</b> in patients with predominant airway disease, mild airway obstruction, and in women with this phenotype may reflect chronic airway inflammation. The lack of relationship with such symptoms as wheezing, cough, and dyspnea could indicate that intrathoracic tracheal <b>collapsibility</b> itself should be considered neither an abnormal feature of COPD nor a relevant clinical finding.
