40|$|Abstract Casting is {{a process}} where {{components}} are produced by pouring molten metal into moulds or dies which is then allowed to solidify. A variety of casting techniques are used in industry, but this thesis focuses on aluminium casting using a type of permanent mould casting called Gravity Die Casting (GDC). Casting {{is a process}} which is largely dictated by thermal conditions. Thermal conditions dictate solidification rate, which partly determines the microstructure and affects the mechanical properties of a component. Casting parameters such as melt temperature, initial die temperature, and die coating can also affect how heat is removed from a casting. The rate of heat removal is expressed as heat flux (q) (MWm- 2). The rate of heat removal from a casting and through a die is known as interfacial heat flux, and is calculated at the metal/mould boundary. Heat transfer at the metal/mould boundary can also be described by the interfacial Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) (Wm- 2 K- 1). In general if the HTC is large then solidification will be rapid. The HTC {{is a very important}} parameter in casting simulation programs, which are often used to optimise casting processes and die design. For most simulation programs the HTC is required, however, the HTC generally has to be estimated for the particular casting condition being simulated. Current state-of-the-art modelling packages, such as Magmasoft, have the ability to use variable HTCs in computations, but this information is rarely available. The variable HTC plots presented in this thesis provide a valuable database for more accurate modelling the solidification of gravity die cast aluminium-silicon alloys. Aluminum gravity die castings were produced using an experimental gravity die casting rig installed with a Heat Transfer Coefficient gauge. Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg aluminium alloy was used for all castings and two different die coatings were used. A <b>ceramic</b> <b>die</b> coating primarily consisting of titanium dioxide particles in a water suspension, and a graphite die coating were applied to the die using a spray gun with adjustable spray pressure. Two sets of castings were produced with the die set at variable thicknesses of 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm, one with the die coated in the ceramic coating and the other with the graphite coating. Castings were produced with the ceramic coating applied at different spray pressures of 2 bar, 4 bar and 6 bar. Heat flux and HTCs were calculated and plotted against time for all castings. The castings of various thicknesses had maximum HTCs in the range of 1. 4 to 1. 5 kWm- 2 K- 1 for castings from the graphite coated die, and 1. 3 to 1. 4 kWm- 2 K- 1 for castings from the ceramic coated die. Heat transfer data for castings from the die coated with ceramic coating applied at spray pressures of 2 bar, 4 bar and 6 bar were also plotted and analysed. It was found that the castings from the die coated at 4 bar had the highest HTC of 1. 3 kWm- 2 K- 1, with the 2 bar and 6 bar castings only reaching maximum HTCs of approximately 1. 0 kWm- 2 K- 1 and 1. 1 kWm- 2 K- 1, respectively. Microstructures from castings were also analysed with dendrite cell sizes and eutectic volume fraction measurements taken. This information was then compared to the HTC data and solidification times in order to establish links between heat transfer, maximum HTC and the resultant microstructures. Significant variations in the HTC are likely to occur as results of normal processes in commercial foundries. This thesis provides an idea of how much the absolute value of the HTC varies with changes in some typical parameters. From this knowledge a robust casting process can be designed to tolerate these typical changes in the HTC...|$|E

The wear mechanisms of Al 2 O 3 –TiC–CaF 2 composites layer and Al 2 O 3 –TiC composites layer are mainly abrasive wear and adhesive wear. The conical dies׳ self-lubricating capacity has been generated by the ‘dragging effect’ during drawing process. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{computer-aided}} design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) process chain for dental restorations starts with taking {{an impression of}} the clinical situation. For this purpose, either extraoral digitization of gypsum models or intraoral digitization can be used. Despite {{the increasing use of}} dental digitizing systems, there are only few studies on their accuracy. Objective This study compared the accuracy of various intraoral and extraoral digitizing systems for dental CAD/CAM technology. Material and Methods An experimental setup for three-dimensional analysis based on 2 prepared <b>ceramic</b> master <b>dies</b> and their corresponding virtual CAD-models was used to assess the accuracy of 10 extraoral and 4 intraoral optical non-contact dental digitizing systems. Depending on the clinical procedure, 10 optical measurements of either 10 duplicate gypsum dies (extraoral digitizing) or directly of the <b>ceramic</b> master <b>dies</b> (intraoral digitizing) were made and compared with the corresponding CAD-models. Results The digitizing systems showed differences in accuracy. However, all topical systems were well within the benchmark of ± 20 µm. These results apply to single tooth measurements. Conclusions Study results are limited, since only single teeth were used for comparison. The different preparations represent various angles and steep and parallel opposing tooth surfaces (incisors). For most digitizing systems, the latter are generally the most difficult to capture. Using CAD/CAM technologies, the preparation angles should not be too steep to reduce digitizing errors. Older systems might be limited to a certain height or taper of the prepared tooth, whereas newer systems (extraoral as well as intraoral digitization) do not have these limitations...|$|R

40|$|Ceramics are {{normally}} processed by consolidating powders using sintering at high temperatures. The {{time required for}} this process is usually measured in hours because of the slow rate of heating/cooling of the furnaces used. Spark plasma sintering (SPS), as it is commonly known, is a rapid sintering process, where the cycle can be completed in minutes. This generates the possibility of making ceramics with new microstructures and properties. Queen Mary University of London and its spin-out company, Nanoforce Technology Ltd, are working to exploit SPS technology in the UK. Spark plasma sintering has some similarities to hot-pressing, which involves applying pressure during sintering. The rapid heating rates in SPS are achieved by the direct Joule heating of the graphite dies in which the ceramics are sintered. This involves pulsed, direct current at low voltages (1, 000 A). The furnace at Nanoforce can achieve rates of up to 600 °C/min.

40|$|Over {{the last}} years all-ceramic crowns have gained a larger market-share than all-ceramic bridges and thus it seems that all-ceramic bridges are {{implemented}} {{with a great deal}} of caution. The purpose of this study was to show the correlation of the fracture-strength of four-unit zirconium-oxide bridges constructed with the CAD/CAM-designed LAVA-System, in a three point-bending test. Thereby special attention was placed on the different die materials and the influence of thermocycling on them. The die materials used were fibreglass-enforced resins (DC-Tell,Firm DCS), LAVA-Zirconiumoxide-ceramics (3 M ESPE) and yellow brass. Two dies of each material were embedded in Paladur Clear (Heraeus Kulzer), whereby a defined mobility of the dies was reached by a heat shrink tubing (3 M, type HSR) which was previously wrapped around the dental roots. For each group of die materials 20 bridges were cemented conventionally with zinc-oxide-phosphate cement (Hoffmann Berlin) and were then stored in 0, 9 % Sodiumchloride-solution for 21 days. Subsequently half of the bridges of each group were aged artificially through thermocycling. The results of the fracture strength test were analysed and described statistically with the t-test. The results showed that when using <b>ceramic</b> or metal <b>dies,</b> the fracture strength of the bridges were clearly higher than the bridges that were cemented on resin enforced dies. The artificial aging procedure through thermocycling had no significant influence in the case of <b>ceramic</b> or metal <b>die</b> materials, whereas it lead to a visible but not significant reduction of the fracture strength when full-ceramic bridges were cemented on fibre-enforced resin die material. In conclusion it can be noted that the fracture strength, that was detected for these ceramics, implies a clear indication for use in the cantilever region. The previous reconstruction of teeth using ceramic or brass core materials, even under constant influence of changing temperatures and fluids in the oral cavity, are clearly recommended. About the implementation of resin-based core materials, when testing these bridges clinically, no reliable conclusion can be done...|$|R

To avoid these inhomogeneities, the granules {{have to show}} optimized {{mechanical properties}}. The correlation between internal structure parameters and resulting mechanical properties of ceramic granules was investigated systematically by spray-drying of varied α-Al 2 O 3 suspensions. Nine granule samples with different internal structures were produced. The mechanical properties were characterized using a compression test of single granules. Internal granule structures were quantified using image analysis techniques. To detect structure parameters responsible for changed mechanic al granule properties, the internal structure parameters were divided in micro- and macrostructure parameters and their influence on resulting mechanical properties was studied individually. The variation of additive type or amount overlaid the effect of changed internal granule structure parameters on the resulting granule compression strength and strain. If the additive type and amount were kept constant and suspension parameters like solid content, primary particle size, particle surface charge or width of the primary particle size distribution were modified, a clear influence of changed internal granule structure parameters on the resulting mechanical granule properties were measured. Increased shell thickness (macrostructure) and reduced microporosity (microstructure) caused a granule strength increase. The effects of micro- and macrostructure parameters on mechanical granule properties can be added up. For the investigated samples a dominant influence of the microstructure on the resulting mechanical properties compared to the macrostructure effect was found...|$|R
