This was done to make the iron slightly more fluid than {{what it would be}} when normally molten. Although this type of phosphoric cast iron is rather hard and brittle, strength is not the main purpose of the metal when it is used in jewellery.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper will}} use a new method for {{predicting}} grain size and then apply it to various solidification environments to reveal which factors are dominant in determining the final grain size. This study will only focus on methods where the grain size is set during a solidification process. These processes include grain refinement by inoculation of the melt with grain refining particles, increasing the cooling rate, low superheat casting, ultrasonic treatment {{and the use of}} <b>chill</b> <b>moulds.</b> Each of these methods can control the grain size to some extent but in order to predict the outcome it needs to be understood how the alloy constitution, inoculant particle characteristics and the casting conditions affect the prime nucleation event for the formation of new grains. These methodologies are currently being used, or have potential to be used, for the production of fine spherical grained semi-solid slurries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Green {{sand casting}} and <b>chill</b> <b>mould</b> casting methods are {{representing}} the slow and fast cooling {{rates of the}} brass casting, respectively. The compositions of the raw material {{for this study were}} about Cu 70 and Zn 30, which falls under alpha (α) brass. Slow cooling rate casting shows coarse dendritric structures with large spacing between the dendrites. On the other hand, faster cooling rate casting shows finer grains with shorter dendrite spacing. The developed structure during solidification influences the properties of the cast samples. As grain size decreases, the strength of the cast brass increases; micro-porosity in the casting decreases and the tendency for the casting to fracture also decreases. However, the macro-examinations of fracture surfaces of these castings show the differences in the cast samples. Fracture surfaces of the sand cast specimen show larger dimples taking longer time to break indicating higher elongation. However, chill cast specimen shows smaller dimples and cleavage type fracture surface having higher strength and lower elongation...|$|R

Thus extensive bibliographycal review work was carried out {{on the influence of}} the cylindrical mould geometry wich yielded very lit ttle information on the matter, and presented rather complex models for solidification of cylinders. Again it became apparent from th~s study that analytical models were not viable for technological solutions due to their mathematical complexity. To solve this problem, experimental equations with known parameters were applied with the intention of determining the correctian factors. so as to equate these experimental equations with the experimental datas obtained in our investigations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{computer}} simulation tool capable of modelling multi-physics processes in complex geometry {{has been developed}} and applied to the casting process. The quest for high-quality complex casting components demanded by the aerospace and automobile industries, requires more precise numerical modelling techniques and one {{that need to be}} generic and modular in its approach to modelling multi-processes problems. For such a computer model to be successful in shape casting, the complete casting process needs to be addressed, the major events being:-• Filling of hot liquid metal into a cavity mould • Solidification and latent heat evolution of liquid metal • Convection currents generated in liquid metal by thermal gradients • Deformation of cast and stress development in solidified metal • Macroscopic porosity formation The above phenomena combines the analysis of fluid flow, heat transfer, change of phase and thermal stress development. None of these events can be treated in isolation as they inexorably interact with each other in a complex way. Also conditions such as design of running system, location of feeders and <b>chills,</b> <b>moulding</b> materials and types of boundary conditions can all affect on the final cast quality and must be appropriately represented in the model...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at The 8 th International Conference on Semi Solid Processing of Alloys and Composites, Limassol, Cyprus, 21 - 23 September 2004, and published in the Proceedings. An experimental apparatus using a cooling slope has been developed to mimic the UBE New RheoCasting (NRC) process. The microstructural characteristics of A 356 aluminium alloy processed by this route were characterised with this apparatus. The final microstructure is very sensitive to the superheat of the melt. Low pouring temperatures promote spheroidal morphology of the α-Al phase and longer holding times in the semisolid condition improve the spheroidicity of these particles. The microstructure is not completely homogeneous if the cooling slope product is cast in a cold <b>chill</b> <b>mould.</b> However, a great improvement in homogenisation and spheroidization of the α−Al phase is obtained if the mould is preheated and {{the duration of the}} holding time in the semisolid condition (at 580 oC) is increased. Quenching from different temperatures and holding times in the semisolid state allowed the characterization of the microstructural evolution of α-Al particles. Using optical microscopy, regions of quenched solid were easily distinguished from the surrounding quenched liquid. The results reveal that the cooling slope is an effective source of crystal seeds and, provided there is sufficient holding time at the semisolid temperature, the process gives successful production of raw material suitable for thixoforming...|$|R

The alloys are processed using <b>chilled</b> copper <b>mould</b> suction casting.

40|$|M. Tech. Owing to the {{difficulties}} in the procurement of internationally certified reference materials for iron and steel, local firms are using their own standards manufactured by casting techniques. It is necessary to assess the integrity of these materials using international standards as control to these in-house reference materials. Macro and micro-examination were carried out to reveal the nature of reference materials and hence evaluate their quality. The consistency of chemical composition of standard materials and {{the accuracy of the}} analyses based on the in-house standards were evaluated. The results showed that local standards were characterised by gross casting defects. In comparison the imported standards had micro-structural uniformity and free from casting defects. This shows the essential difference in production method. Casting has severe limitations {{when it comes to the}} production of components of low segregation and internal soundness. First, the partitioning of solutes between solid and liquid phases invariably leads to segregation and loss of homogeneity. Second, the volumetric change accompanying solidification results in shrinkage cavities. If stringent production controls are not observed, the proprietary standards are bound to have a widely varying chemical composition. In this regard, the calibration and standardisation would essentially be flawed. Hence the subsequent chemical analyses of standards cannot be reliable. It is necessary to establish an analytical methodology that yields reliable results. Standards used for calibration should have a high degree of chemical purity and homogeneity. The study covers other possible production options for standards that can be used for accurate calibration and standardisation of spectrometers for chemical analysis of iron and steel. The use of vacuum melting followed by rapid casting in special <b>chill</b> <b>mould</b> is recommended...|$|R
50|$|In {{centrifugal}} casting, {{a permanent}} mold is rotated continuously about its axis {{at high speeds}} (300 to 3000 rpm) as the molten metal is poured. The molten metal is centrifugally thrown towards the inside mold wall, where it solidifies after cooling. The casting is usually a fine-grained casting with a very fine-grained outer diameter, owing to <b>chilling</b> against the <b>mould</b> surface.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{peritectic}} reactions and transformations that occur during the solidification of many alloys. Peritectics {{are believed to}} be a major cause of crack-formation in many steels, thus, good knowledge of the mechanisms by which these phenomena occur is essential for preventing such defects. The thesis also handles the behaviour of metals, in particular cast structures, during hot forming. Grain size and microstructure are of most importance in determining the strength, toughness and performance of a steel. For achieving enhanced mechanical and microstructural properties, good understanding of the phenomena occurring during hot forming is required. Peritectic reactions and transformations were studied in Fe-base and steel alloys through differential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments and micrographic investigation of quenched DTA samples. The effect of the ferrite/austenite interface strain during the peritectic reaction on equilibrium conditions was thermodynamically analysed, and the results were related to temperature observations from DTA experiments conducted on Fe-base alloys and low-alloy steels. Massive transformations from ferrite to austenite were observed in the micrographs of a number of quenched low-alloy steel samples and it was proposed that these transformations are uncontrolled by diffusion, and occur in the solid state as a visco-plastic stress relief process. DTA study of an austenitic stainless steel indicated that the alloy can exhibit primary precipitations to either ferrite or austenite. A continuously-cast breakout shell of the steel was analyzed and it was suggested that the observed irregularities in growth were due to alternating precipitations of ferrite and austenite; parts of the shell with higher ratios of primary-precipitated ferrite shrink in volume at the peritectic temperature and experience reduced growths. An experimental method for studying the behaviour of metals during hot forming developed, and hot compression tests were conducted on cast copper and ball-bearing steel samples. Flow stress curves were obtained at varying temperatures and strain rates, and the results showed good agreement with earlier observations reported in literature. Micrographic analysis of quenched samples revealed variations in grain size and a model was fitted to describe the grain size as a function of deformation temperature and strain. Solidification growth during continuous casting of stainless steel and copper was numerically modelled. A varying heat transfer coefficient was proposed to approximate the experimentally measured growth irregularities in the continuously-cast stainless steel breakout shell. Solidification growth of pure copper was also modelled in the Southwire continuous casting process. Temperature measurements from the <b>chill</b> <b>mould</b> were used to approximate the temperature gradient and the heat extraction from the solidifying strand, and the results were used in a two-dimensional model of solidification.    QC 2010080...|$|R
50|$|The patternmaker or foundry {{engineer}} decides {{where the}} sprues, gating systems, and risers are placed {{with respect to}} the pattern. Where a hole is desired in a casting, a core may be used which defines a volume or location in a casting where metal will not flow into. Sometimes chills may be placed on a pattern surface prior to molding, which are then formed into the sand <b>mould.</b> <b>Chills</b> are heat sinks which enable localized rapid cooling. The rapid cooling may be desired to refine the grain structure or determine the freezing sequence of the molten metal which is poured into the mould. Because they are at a much cooler temperature, and often a different metal than what is being poured, they do not attach to the casting when the casting cools. The chills can then be reclaimed and reused.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNi 2 MnGa alloys are {{obtained}} by suction casting in water <b>chilled</b> cylindrical copper <b>moulds</b> 50 mm long and 1 - 4 mm in diameter; the microstructure and the magnetic properties are then investigated as {{functions of the}} cylinder diameter. The solidification substructures are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The martensitic transformation temperatures, determined by magnetization vs. temperature measurements, are lower than those measured in bulk Ni 2 MnGa single crystals (202 K). The demagnetization curves measured from saturation in the martensitic state show two steps: the first is at about+ 130 mT and the larger second one at relatively large inverse fields (about - 300 mT), except in cylinders 4 mm in diameter, where these steps overlap at low inverse fields. These steps are likely to arise from a demagnetization mechanism involving field induced twin boundary motion in a few martensite variants,indicating a ferromagnetic shape memory effect in the cylinders...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{computationally}} efficient numerical approach called gradient vector method (GVM) is proposed to visualise feed-paths and {{to evaluate the}} design of feeding systems with various thermal boundary conditions. It involves the computation of liquid-solid interfacial heat flux vector using an analytically derived solution to phase change-heat transport equation. The resultant of flux vectors gives {{the direction of the}} highest temperature gradient, which is continuously tracked to generate complete feed-paths. The originating points of the feed-paths indicate hot-spots that manifest as shrinkage defects. Mathematical models are proposed to handle the effect of various boundary conditions like insulation or exothermic sleeves around feeders and <b>chill</b> blocks in <b>mould.</b> The accuracy of GVM in predicting the location of shrinkage porosity defect has been validated by pouring and sectioning benchmark castings. Computation of feed-paths using this method was found to be an order of magnitude faster than level-set method for casting solidification simulation.

40|$|The present {{manuscript}} probes the decomposition behaviour of the ferromagnetic binary metastable Heusler alloy in the Al-Mn system. The ferromagnetic ordered tetragonal phase (L 1 (0), {{popularly known}} as tau phase), which is metastable in nature, was synthesised from the melt through a copper <b>mould</b> <b>chill</b> casting process using 10 -mm diameter mould.

The high-temperature phase cannot be retained through quenching experiment and its existence can only be established by in situ studies...|$|R
40|$|Sand-cast {{plates of}} a {{commercial}} AZ 91 C alloy {{have been used for}} the study. Varying the solidification rate by placing large cast-iron <b>chills</b> in the <b>mould</b> produced a range of secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) within the cast plates. The plates were solution heat-treated. quenched and aged at 165 degreesC for up to 350 h. The SDAS (mum) varied with the solidification time, t(f) (s), as SDAS = 5. 3 t(f) (0. 43). The tensile ductility in the as-quenched (T 4) condition did not depend on the solidification rate whilst in the T 6 condition it tended to decrease for slowly solidified material (SDAS > 50 mum). The yield strength and hardness increased and the ductility decreased with ageing. The fracture mode changed from predominantly transgranular in the T 4 condition to predominantly intergranular in the T 6 condition. The properties of the sand-castings are compared with those of high-pressure diecastings and the possible strengthening mechanisms are discussed. A number of areas that require more research are pointed out. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
