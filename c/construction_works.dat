5|$|An {{extension}} is also {{planned for}} the A5 motorway north of Osijek, across the Drava River, to the Hungarian border, where it will connect to the Hungarian M6 motorway at a Branjin Vrh/Ivándárda border crossing. This route will also contain two new exits near Čeminac and Beli Manastir and a new bridge over the Drava River. In July 2011, a groundbreaking ceremony {{was held at the}} bridge construction site, as a preparation for extension of the A5. In May 2012, Hrvatske autocestethe investor in the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> contractproposed cancellation of the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> as a cost-cutting measure, even though funding of the works was secured through European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development loans.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> for the atmospheric-propulsion system, the world's first railway flyover was {{constructed}} {{at the north end}} of Portland Road, to carry the new atmospheric line over the conventional steam line below. In 1847, the atmospheric propulsion experiment was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>work</b> {{began in}} 1923 {{and the city}} hall was {{completed}} in autumn 1931. Because of serious financial problems due to the growing international economic crisis, the <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> set in 1925 until spring 1929. As <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> got under way again, the plans were simplified and altered a more functionalistic direction.|$|R

5|$|The <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> were complex, {{and many}} {{contractors}} {{were involved in}} delivering them. The CTRL Section 2 <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London; in their wake redevelopment was stimulated. The large redevelopment area includes the run-down areas of post-industrial and ex-railway land close to King's Cross and St Pancras, a conservation area with many listed buildings; this was promoted {{as one of the}} benefits for building the CTRL. It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project, and some affected districts were said still to be in a poor state in 2005.|$|E

Despite an official ceremony to mark commencement of <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> on the section, no works beyond design and study development has been carried out there.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a bidding {{strategy}} model {{for use by}} contractors {{as part of a}} more informed approach in selecting which contracts to bid for, and as a basis for determining the most appropriate mark-up level for various types and sizes of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client types. Regression analysis is used in measuring a contractor’s competitiveness between bids (by using the lowest bid / own bid ratio) and within bids (by using the lowest bid / cost estimate ratio) according to type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client type. The model was tested on a large and reputable Hong Kong contractor. This particular contractor's bidding behaviour was found to be largely unaffected by type of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> but significantly affected by client type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work.</b> Three quadratic models (regressing lowest bid / cost estimate on size of <b>construction</b> <b>work)</b> are also successfully developed for projects from the private sector, the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Housing Authority respectively...|$|R

5|$|Initially, the District and the Met {{were closely}} {{associated}} {{and it was}} intended that they would soon merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were {{on the board of}} the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could {{indicate that the}} former also undertook <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were {{also found in the}} temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{electrification}} of the DR, Yerkes {{did not live}} to see the completion of the fast-paced <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> that he set in motion; he died in New York on 29 December 1905 and was replaced as UERL chairman by Edgar Speyer. Speyer was chairman of the UERL's backer Speyer Brothers and a partner in Speyer & Co. Sir George Gibb, general manager of the North Eastern Railway, was appointed managing director. The BS opened to passengers on 10 March 1906. The GNP followed on 15 December 1906, with the CCE on 22 June 1907. The three tube lines quickly {{came to be known as}} the Bakerloo Tube, Piccadilly Tube and Hampstead Tube.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{motorway}} {{along its}} Split–Dubrovnik sector started once the motorway sectors north of Split were complete, and the section between Split (Dugopolje interchange) and Šestanovac interchange opened on 27 June 2007. The last sections {{to be completed}} to date are Šestanovac–Ravča, opened on 22 December 2008, Ravča-Vrgorac section opened on 30 June 2011, and the Vrgorac-Ploče section opened on 20 December 2013. In the 2000s, as the motorway <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> were gradually progressing further south, the motorway earned its unofficial, yet widely used name—Dalmatina in Croatian press because it connected Zagreb to Dalmatia. In 2010, Donja Zdenčina interchange was opened between Lučko and Jastrebarsko interchanges, and in June 2012, Novigrad interchange opened bringing number of motorway exits to 33.|$|E
5|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>works</b> on {{the pyramid}} of Neferefre {{had just begun}} when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E

5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for the first time, as a museum.

5|$|The UERL {{was set up}} with {{an initial}} {{capitalisation}} of £5million (£ today). The company was backed by three merchant banks, Speyer Brothers in London, Speyer & Co. in New York and Old Colony Trust Company in Boston, each of which was to receive £250,000 from the capital raised. Almost 60 per cent of the initial share offering was bought in the United States, with a third sold in Britain and the rest mainly in the Netherlands. Further capital was soon needed for the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> and additional share and bond issues followed. The UERL eventually raised a total of £18million (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still had to raise the capital for the <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891). The original tube railway, the C, was also raising funds to construct extensions to its existing line. Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend, was able to raise its funds without difficulty.
