25|$|The {{vestibule}} is separated, by a tripartite {{screen with}} an arched <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> flanked above the cornice by bull's-eye openings in which baroque vases stand, from a grand Stair Hall. The Stair Hall projects {{from the south}} block to accommodate a grand staircase that sweeps forward through a heart-shaped opening into the floor space. This divides at a landing to return in matched recurving flights to the upper floor.|$|E
25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E

The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or os of the cervix by scraping it with an Aylesbury spatula. An endocervical brush is rotated in the <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> of the cervix. The cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the laboratory to be checked for abnormalities.|$|E

25|$|The western inner {{entrance}} {{is now a}} wicket door patterned after that of Yeocomico Church although it is unpainted. Previously, there were two <b>central</b> <b>opening,</b> compass-headed doors at the outer entrance of the porch arch. The southern {{entrance is}} a square-headed, battened door with decorative, molded bricks {{in the shape of}} an ovolo surrounding it. The images from the Library of Congress site are worth study, for they show in the late 1950s a compass headed door at this entrance that is evidenced by brick repairs above the doorway.|$|E
25|$|Secretory {{cells are}} found in a group, or acinus (plural, acini). Each acinus {{is located at the}} {{terminal}} part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: serous, mucoserous and mucous.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Ionic order becomes {{recognisable}} in temple architecture, it {{is increased}} to monumental sizes. The temple in the Heraion of Samos, erected by Rhoikos around 560 BC, is the first known dipteros, with outside dimensions of 52 × 105 m. A double portico of 8 × 21 columns enclosed the naos, the back even had ten columns. The front used differing column distances, with a wider <b>central</b> <b>opening.</b> In proportion to the bottom diameter, the columns reached three times {{the height of a}} Doric counterpart. 40 flutings enriched the complex surface structure of the column shafts. Samian column bases were decorated with a sequence of horizontal flutings, but in spite of this playfulness they weighed 1,500kg a piece. The capitals of this structure were probably still entirely of wood, as was the entablature. Ionic volute capitals survive from the outer peristasis of the later rebuilding by Polycrates. The columns of the inner peristasis had leaf decoration and no volutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is an L-shaped plan, with a ground floor, a mezzanine and two piani nobili. The latter, {{differently from the}} others, have a façade in Istrian stone. The {{left side of the}} façade is shorter, and thus the portal and the <b>central</b> <b>openings</b> of the floors are asymmetrically placed.|$|R
50|$|The {{openings}} on {{the upper}} level have semicircular arches. The three <b>central</b> <b>openings</b> have individual balconies with balustrading and a projecting cornice/balustrade that returns to the flanking side bays. These are plainer with narrower openings. The original glazing on the building {{has been replaced by}} aluminium framed glazing to a similar pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear of the}} {{building}} is divided into symmetrical gable ended sections that have <b>central</b> <b>openings</b> originally intended for goods delivery and serviced by small overhead gantries. These openings are flanked by double-hung windows on both levels. The end bay at the rear has been extended across the laneway. The laneway and rear of {{the building}} are also visually important.|$|R
500|$|In {{arch dam}} design, two basic shapes are adopted. These are the constant–radius arch and the constant-angle arch, the latter design is more complex. In the constant-radius arch design, {{which is also}} known as the single-radius arch, the shape of the dam is {{cylindrical}} with vertical upstream face while the downstream face is battered. The constant-angle arch design has also a variable–radius arch. In this design, the <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> angle is constant whereas the arch radius increases from the base to the crest; this increase towards the crest is proportional to the increase of the canyon width of the gorge. Further, according to the theory of constant-arch design, the arch action {{at the base of the}} dam exerts the maximum pressure on the base. A [...] "V" [...] shaped gorge in particular is considered an ideal feature for building this type of dam. This design ensures substantial savings in use of construction material as opposed to the constant–radius arch design. Lars R. Jorgenson who had conceived this concept had proved that the most economic design of the dam was obtained with an optimum opening angle of 133.6°, with the least quantity of concrete. This design was applied with some modifications for the Salmon Creek Dam, which was designed with constant opening angle of 113° with radius varying from [...] at the base to [...] at the crest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{upper level}} of the arch (the attic) was {{composed}} {{of a series of}} Corinthian columns and pilasters dividing the space into three rectangular openings. Each of the outer openings was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with dentils and a projecting geison, in the manner of the lower level. [...] The <b>central</b> <b>opening,</b> however, was flanked by antae with engaged Corinthian half-columns that supported a projecting triangular pediment, which rested above the dentils, geison, and sima that joined to those of the two wings. [...] At the peak of the pediment, there was a small vegetal acroterion. [...] The <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> of the upper level was originally closed off by a thin screen of stone, c. 7cm thick. Only the slots for its mounting are now preserved. [...] The design of this central aediculum-like, niche of the upper level is similar to the architecture of the scaenae frons (façade of ancient stage buildings) and highly evocative of the representations of aedicula in wall painting of the 2nd Pompeian style.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ruins of}} the Palace of Ardashir and Ghal'eh Dokhtar in Fars Province, Iran, built by Ardashir I (224240) of the Sasanian Empire, have the {{earliest}} known examples of squinches. The three domes of the Palace of Ardashir are 45 feet in diameter and vertically elliptical, each with a <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> or oculus to admit light. They were built with local stone and mortar and covered with plaster on the interior. At {{the center of the}} palace of Shahpur, at Bishapur, there is a vertically-elliptical dome that rests directly on the ground and is dated to 260. The large brick dome of the Sarvestan Palace, also in Fars but later in date, shows more elaborate decoration and four windows between the corner squinches. Also called [...] "the Temple of Anahita", the building may have been a Fire temple. Instead of using a central oculus in each dome, as at the Palace of Ardashir and as shown in the bas relief found at Kuyunjik, lighting was provided by a number of hollow terracotta cylinders set into the domes at regular intervals.|$|E
2500|$|The chancel {{still remains}} in the east wing and has some reconstructed colonial features. It is on a {{platform}} raised {{a foot or so}} from the church floor. On either side of the window opening are simple rectangular tablets bearing on the left The Lord’s Prayer above the Apostles' Creed and on the right Exodus XX (The Ten Commandments) under which is printed the Summary of the Law. In the middle is a reredos, obviously of non-colonial origin with an opening for the window incorporated within it. It bears, from the top down: 1) a cross placed so as to intersect center of the circular window; 2) a truncated tympanum, 3) a square-columned pilaster {{on either side of the}} window, and 4) a bottom forming a flat window sill. [...] The chancel is physically separated from the rest of the church by [...] vertical panels a few feet north and south of the window openings and a rail with 8 turned balusters on either side and a <b>central</b> <b>opening.</b> There are south and north facing [...] seats in the space between the side panels and the outer walls, on the north a built-in slip pew and on the south a short bench.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{distinctive}} [...] "other ribbed vaults" [...] (called [...] "Karbandi" [...] in Persian) in India {{which form}} {{no part of}} the development of European vaults, but are too remarkable to be passed over; one carries the central dome of the Jumma Musjid at Bijapur (A.D. 1559), and the other is Gol Gumbaz, the tomb of Muhammad Adil Shah II (A.D. 1626-1660) in the same town. The vault of the latter was constructed over a hall [...] square, to carry a hemispherical dome. The ribs, instead of being carried across the angles only, thus giving an octagonal base for the dome, are carried across to the further pier of the octagon and consequently intersect one another, reducing the <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> to [...] in diameter, and, by the weight of the masonry they carry, serving as counterpoise to the thrust of the dome, which is set back so as to leave a passage about [...] wide round the interior. The internal diameter of the dome is , its height [...] and the ribs struck from four centres have their springing [...] from the floor of the hall. The Jumma Musjid dome was of smaller dimensions, on a square of [...] with a diameter of , and was carried on piers only instead of immensely thick walls as in the tomb; but any thrust which might exist was counteracted by its transmission across aisles to the outer wall.|$|E

60|$|In {{the middle}} of the forest there was a dense thicket of lower growths on a piece of dry land lifted above the waters of a swamp. The place was the lair of such small wild things as still survived in the {{wilderness}} once the haunt of the wolf and the wild cat, and the resort of the bear allured by the profusion of the huckleberries which grew there. But, except in the early fall when the annual squirrel-hunt swept over the whole country side and the summer drought had made the swamp easily passable to the gunners, the place was unmolested. Even the country boy who seeks the bounty of nature wherever she offers it, and makes the outlying property of man his prey where nature has been dispossessed, did not penetrate the thicket in his search for hazelnuts or chinquapins; it was proofed against his venture by its repute of rattlesnakes and copperheads and the rumor of ghosts and witches. Few, of men or boys, knew the approach to the interior by the narrow ridge of dry land lifted above the marsh, and Dylks did not stop in his flight till he reached the thicket and saw in it his hope of securer refuge. He walked round it through the pools which the frog and turtle haunted, twice before he found this path, overhung by a tangle of grapevines. There his foot by the instinct which the foot has where the eye fails of a path, divined the scarcely trodden way, and he found himself in a <b>central</b> <b>opening</b> among the thickly growing bushes. It was warm there, without the close heat of the woodland, and dry except for the spring of clear water that bubbled up in the heart of it, and trickled out over green mosses into the outer waters of the swamp.|$|E
