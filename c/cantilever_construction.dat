5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
500|$|From 2004 until May 2016 {{the stand}} was {{sponsored}} by Jarrolds, a local department store. It is a single-tiered stand of <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> with a capacity of 8,212. [...] From 2016, the infill where the hotel is situated a large rotating screen which allows fans in the South Stand and the Barclay Stand to see various video broadcasts relating to the club. [...] The corner infill between the Jarrold and Norwich & Peterborough stands is called the Aviva Community Stand. [...] It was built in 2005 and named after sponsors Aviva. [...] It seats up to 1,700 fans, and also provides extensive facilities for disabled supporters.|$|E
500|$|Édifice Price was {{constructed}} in the art deco style of the time, as was the neighbouring Clarendon Hotel, whose extension was completed a few years earlier. The design uses setbacks to gradually taper floor area down, yielding the typical elongated [...] "wedding cake" [...] shape which contributes in reducing loads and softens the building's visual impact on the city's skyline. The upper setbacks were later used to build balconies. Because the building is deeper than it is wide, it appears much bulkier when viewed from the side. This is reminiscent of Finnish art nouveau architect Eliel Saarinen's work, and is the stylistic opposite of other buildings in the city such as the Château Frontenac, whose <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> widens as it gets taller.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the Company {{commissioned}} the square {{building in the}} plaza. Architect Ignacio Carrera-Justiz used <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction,</b> a style invented by Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright observed how well trees with taproots withstood hurricane-force winds. The building, raised 47 {{feet off the ground}} around a central core, features four massive walls, made of sections of inch-thick hammered glass mural tapestries, designed and manufactured in France. The design came from a painting by German artist Johannes M. Dietz.|$|R

500|$|The {{main pier}} was {{originally}} [...] long, {{and it is}} [...] wide with a <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction.</b> However the low water jetty was damaged in a storm in 1903, rebuilt in 1909 and finally dismantled in 1923 meaning that the pier is now [...] long, Due to architectural features such as abutments {{at either end of}} the pier, the pier resembles a bridge more than other pleasure piers. Fifteen groups of piles support a continuous lattice girder, each set comprising four piles screwed into the river bed at an angle with an X-brace between each adjacent pair. The fitting of screw blades to iron piles, as opposed to the then accepted wooden pile, created a deeper and far more resilient base support. This was one of the innovations brought by Eugenius Birch which have enabled many of the piers he designed to survive. There were problems with oscillations in the structure when bands marched on the pier, both on the opening day and again in 1886. As a result, further horizontal cross braces were added to the piles, and a law was passed banning marching on the pier. The gothic toll house and pierhead buildings were designed by local architect Hans Price.|$|E
2500|$|The project {{aerodynamicist}} on {{the design}} of the Me 262 was Ludwig Bölkow. He initially designed the wing using NACA airfoils modified with an elliptical nose section. Later in the design process, these were changed to AVL derivatives of NACA airfoils, the NACA 00011-0.825-35 being used at the root and the NACA 00009-1.1-40 at the tip. The elliptical nose derivatives of the NACA airfoils were used on the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces. Wings were of single-spar <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction,</b> with stressed skins, varying from [...] skin thickness at the root to [...] at the tip. To expedite construction, save weight and use less strategic materials, late in the war, wing interiors were not painted. The wings were fastened to the fuselage at four points, using a pair of [...] and forty-two [...] bolts.|$|E
2500|$|The park had a {{skeletal}} feel, and it {{was obvious}} that it had once been a minor league baseball stadium. For instance, fans in the bleachers literally had to leave the stadium to get to the grandstand. [...] The bleachers did not exist when the Met was originally built, and no concourse was ever built to connect them {{to the rest of the}} stadium. Unlike most multipurpose stadiums built during this time, there were very few bad seats for baseball. The stadium was built using <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> for the overhanging decks, eliminating posts that blocked the fans' view. It was well known as a hitter's park; its short foul lines343 to left, 330 to rightwere particularly friendly to pull hitters such as Harmon Killebrew. The [...] marker in right was actually closer to right-center, leading to speculation that right field was even closer. Since the Met was built in 1956, however, this would not have been a problem for the Twins; baseball required all parks built after 1958 to have foul lines of at least [...]|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} building {{remains the}} largest non-pillared auditorium in the Chicago area, and has permanent seating for 3,740 people, 2,270 {{on the main}} floor and 1,470 in the balcony. The curved balcony was one of the earliest examples of <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction,</b> and its curvature - as well {{as the rest of the}} layout of the auditorium - was designed so that all lines focus on the pulpit. Designed in an era before modern sound systems, the building has almost-perfect acoustics, and it is reported that the only element detracting from this aspect is the floor carpet.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this bachelor’s thesis is the design and {{analysis}} of perpendicular, one-span bridge construction across the millrace for electrical power station in the Litovel town. Object is located to 2 nd class road II/ 449. Three variants were designed - prestressed trapezoidal slab, prestressed double-beam construction and construction of four prestressed girders of shape I. After these variants were weigh up and the first one, with the length of <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction</b> 22, 5 m, was chosen for analysis. Calculation of load effects was made by software Scia Engineering 2013, it was compared to a manual calculation and the analysis was made by manual calculation according to current standards...|$|R
5000|$|The Vann {{stairway}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} examples of <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction</b> in Georgia. This was on one side of the main entrance, which originally faced the Federal Road, and works like a set of scales. To get a set of scales to balance themselves, an equal weight must be applied to each side. Though half of the staircase is suspended over the first floor hallway, roughly six inches of the opposite side of the stairway is in a solid brick wall. The brick wall is far denser than the second landing; this means there will never be enough weight on the landing to “tip the scale.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The theatre {{provides}} seating on {{four levels}} - Stalls, Grand Circle, Upper Circle and Gallery. Matcham {{was famous for}} his innovative style of <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> of the individual seating tiers, which virtually eliminated the need for supporting pillars, and the King's was no exception, with reasonable sightlines from most seats. Victorian and Edwardian theatres were almost always built to segregate patrons at each level, although subsequent modernisations often eradicate this. This has thus far not {{been the case in}} the King's, which still has separate entrances, some of which have traces of former pay boxes, now disused. The standard of seating and decoration is also less luxurious as you get further up the house. The Stalls and Grand Circle are accessed via the small main foyer, which still [...] impresses with its barrel vaulted ceiling, horizontal bands of red and white marble, and decorative plasterwork on the ceilings, including caryatids. The Upper Circle is accessed via a door to a stairwell {{to the left of the}} main Bath Street entrance. The Gallery is accessed via a staircase at the back of the building with its own entrance on Elmbank Street.|$|E
2500|$|Forget for a {{few minutes}} that you are reading a copy of your evening paper. Allow your {{imagination}} to carry you to the gentle slope of a moon-lit Spanish hill. Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, fleecy clouds are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as through [...] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is unobstructed by pillars. he balcony being of <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to sit behind one.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge is}} a box girder {{prestressed}} concrete bridge, and is built using cost-efficient <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction.</b> The integrated arch form {{is designed to}} appear minimal, while adequately supporting {{the weight of the}} trains that cross it.|$|E
50|$|The {{footbridge}} {{was completed}} in November 1951, and built using balanced <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction,</b> with two cantilever sections and a central suspended span. The total central span is 150 ft. It was designed by L.G. Mouchel and Partners and built by Taylor Woodrow.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} between 2003 and 2005 and was opened for traffic on June 13, 2005. Unusually for a two hinge concrete arch bridge, the arch was built using <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> supported by temporary cable stays. The bridge was engineered by Bilfinger Berger, who also acted as general contractors.|$|E
50|$|The Hong Kong {{region is}} {{susceptible}} to very strong typhoon winds, a fact that was {{taken into account in}} the design of the bridge. In October 2002 a 50 m mast was erected at the site to measure the speed, direction and turbulence of winds in the area. Readings, which continued until January 2004, were transmitted in real-time to an offsite location for further analysis. In particular, the stability of the 509 m long <b>cantilevers</b> during <b>construction</b> required special consideration in the design.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 Herts, with partner Hugh Tallant, formed Herts & Tallant {{and became}} {{known for their}} theater designs. Tallant was the designer, and Herts serving as the {{engineer}} and businessperson. The 1903 New Amsterdam Theatre was their first big success, followed by the Fulton (razed in 1982), the Gaiety (razed in 1982), the Liberty (defunct in 1933), the Lyceum, the New German Theatre, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Herts perfected the <b>cantilevered</b> arch <b>construction</b> that enabled theater architects to support balconies {{without the use of}} columns.|$|R
50|$|The Fokker V.1 {{was a small}} German {{sesquiplane}} experimental fighter prototype {{built in}} 1916 by the Fokker-Flugzeugwerke. Sporting a parasol wing, {{it was the first}} Fokker aircraft purportedly designed by Reinhold Platz—the respective roles played by Fokker himself, Platz, and possibly others in the conceptual design of Fokker airplanes are a matter of dispute among historians—and was an early experiment in <b>cantilever</b> wing <b>construction,</b> eliminating the bracing wires typical of aircraft design at the time, something that had already been achieved with metal materials in Hugo Junkers' own pioneering Junkers J 1 in 1915.|$|R
50|$|Later, Alexander {{assisted}} composer Arnold Schoenberg in {{the redesign}} of his studio in Brentwood, and also designed {{a house in}} Encino for scriptwriter David Greggory.

50|$|The new bridge {{consists}} of twin structures (northbound and southbound), each carrying two 12 ft, a 10 ft and a 3 ft. The southbound bridge {{also has a}} 6 ft. The bridge was designed with a record-setting 134 m—the longest precast <b>cantilever</b> segmental <b>construction</b> in the United States. To reduce the construction time, the NJDOT selected the segmental precast concrete construction method for both the superstructure and substructure. The department estimated that by using this type of approach, it would reduce the duration of construction {{by at least one}} year and save millions of dollars in life cycle costs.|$|R
50|$|During the {{construction}} phase between 2003 and 2005, both the M4 Western Motorway and Wallgrove Road continued to carry traffic as normal. This required {{the use of}} balanced <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> methods to position pre-cast concrete bridge segments at heights of up to 23 m above the active motorway. Upon completion, electronic tolling was implemented for vehicles entering the Westlink M7, allowing continuous flow of traffic.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most popular}} {{sport in the}} UK is {{association}} football; Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857, is the world's oldest football club. The home nations all have separate national teams and domestic competitions, most notably England's Premier League and FA Cup, and the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Cup. Referred to as the [...] "home of football" [...] by the international governing body FIFA, England hosted and won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The English Premier League (formed in 1992 by member clubs of the old Football League First Division) is the most-watched football league in the world, and its biggest clubs include Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. Scotland's Celtic and Rangers also have a global fanbase. [...] Football in Britain is renowned for the intense rivalries between clubs and {{the passion of the}} supporters, which includes a tradition of football chants, such as, [...] "You're Not Singing Any More" [...] (or its variant [...] "We Can See You Sneaking Out!"), sung by jubilant fans towards the opposition fans who have gone silent (or left early). Fans lined up for meat pies, burgers and chips. Football dropped its ban on floodlights in 1950, and night games attracted increasingly large crowds of fans - some of them unruly — as well as large television audiences.
