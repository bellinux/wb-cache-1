40|$|SummaryThe {{management}} of dry mouth {{is essential for}} patients with Sjögren's syndrome. The symptomatic treatment has included using air humidifiers, rinsing the mouth with water or mouthwash, {{the application of a}} salivary substitute and administration of secretagogues.

ACh treatment increased NCA in a dose dependent manner (p < 0. 001) and tiotropium pretreatment reduced ACh stimulation (dose effect; 0 to 1000 nM; p < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract: Saliva {{provides}} the principal protective milieu for teeth by modulating oral microbial ecosystems and reversing the initial phases of caries development. Patients with inadequate salivary function are {{at increased risk}} for dental decay. Therefore, it is likely that therapies that increase overall fluid output of these individuals will reverse early carious lesions. The most common causes of salivary dysfunction are medication usage, Sjögren’s syndrome, and damage of salivary parenchyma during therapeutic irradiation. For patients with remaining functional acinar tissue, treatment with the parasypathomimetic secretogogues pilo-carpine and <b>Cevimeline</b> may provide relief. However, these medications do not benefit all patients.

Therefore, alternative therapies are essential to restore salivary gland function. An option is to use bioengineered scaffolds to promote functional salivary gland regeneration. Previous studies demonstrated that the laminin- 111 protein is critical for intact salivary gland cell cluster formation and organization.

To get insight into this mode of action, in vitro receptor potency/left shift experiments in cells stably expressing the rat's M(1) receptor were performed. They revealed an inflection point value of BQCA corresponding to 306 nM, and potentiation of the agonist response up to 47 -fold in presence of 10 μM of BQCA. In vivo, brain microdialysis showed a maximal brain level of 270 nM, 40 min after i. p. administration at 10 mg/kg.

40|$|Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva®) {{is used as}} a {{bronchodilator}} {{in chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, clinical evidence suggests that tiotropium bromide may improve COPD by mechanisms beyond bronchodilation. We hypothesized that tiotropium bromide may act as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting monocyte chemotaxis, a process that {{plays an important role in}} the lung inflammation of COPD. To test this hypothesis monocytes were pretreated with tiotropium bromide prior to exposure to chemotactic agents and monocyte chemotactic activity (MCA) was evaluated with a blind chamber technique. Tiotropium bromide inhibited MCA in a dose- and time- dependent manner (respectively, p< 0. 01) by directly acting on the monocyte. Acetylcholine (ACh) challenge increased MCA (p< 0. 01), and tiotropium bromide effectively reduced (p< 0. 01) the increase in MCA by ACh. The inhibition of MCA by tiotropium bromide was reversed by a muscarinic type 3 (M 3) -muscarinic receptor antagonist (p< 0. 01), and was not effected by an M 2 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, a selective M 3 receptor agonist, <b>cevimeline,</b> and Gq protein stimulator, Pasteurella multocida toxin, significantly increased MCA (P < 0. 01), and tiotropium bromide pretreatment reduced (p< 0. 01) the increase in MCA induced by these agents.

Aims: The aim of the following study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit in stimulating the whole salivary flow rate in radiation induced xerostomia patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 subjects were included in the study. The study group consisted of 30 individuals and was divided into Group S 1 (n = 20), which was further subdivided into Group S 1 A (n = 10) subjects complaining of dry mouth who were undergoing head and neck radiotherapy with TENS stimulation during the commencement of radiotherapy, on the 3 rd, 6 th week and after a month of completion of radiotherapy and Group S 1 B (n = 10) with TENS stimulation daily during the full course of radiotherapy and Group S 2 (n = 10) subjects complaining of dry mouth who had undergone head and neck radiotherapy that ended 1 month prior to their entry into the study. The control group (n = 10) consisted of healthy individuals not complaining of dry mouth and who have not undergone head and neck radiotherapy. Whole saliva was collected without stimulation for 10 min and after electrostimulation with TENS unit for additional 10 min in a graduated test tube. The results were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis′s test. Results: The data analysis revealed that control and S 1 B group showed increased salivary flow rate after stimulation by TENS therapy compared with the unstimulated salivary flow, whereas in S 1 A and S 2 group it was found to be statistically non-significant. Conclusion: The present study gave us an insight about the effectiveness of TENS therapy in stimulating salivary flow in healthy subjects and it is very effective when used in conjunction with radiation therapy by reducing the side-effects of radiation therapy. Hence, TENS therapy can be used as an adjunctive method for the treatment of xerostomia along with other treatment modalities...|$|E

The presence and function of muscarinic receptor subtypes both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells has been demonstrated using extensive pharmacological data emerging from studies on transgenic mice. The possible involvement of ACh in different pathologies has been proposed in recent years and is becoming an important area of study. Although the lack of selective muscarinic receptor ligands has for a long time limited the definition of therapeutic treatment based on muscarinic receptors as targets, some muscarinic ligands such as <b>cevimeline</b> (patents US 4855290; US 5571918) or xanomeline (patent, US 5980933) have been developed and used in pre-clinical or in clinical studies for the treatment of nervous system diseases (Alzheimer' and Sjogren's diseases). The present review focuses on the potential implications of muscarinic receptors in different pathologies, including tumors. Moreover, the future use of muscarinic ligands in therapeutic protocols in cancer therapy will be discussed, considering that some muscarinic antagonists currently used in the treatment of genitourinary disease (e. g. darifenacin, patent, US 5096890; US 6106864) have also been demonstrated to arrest tumor progression in nude mice. The involvement of muscarinic receptors in nociception also is over-viewed. In fact, muscarinic agonists such as vedaclidine, CMI- 936 and CMI- 1145 have been demonstrated to have analgesic effects in animal models comparable or more pronounced to those produced by morphine or opiates. Likewise, the crucial role of cholinesterases (acetylcholinesterase and butirylcholinesterase) in neural transmission is discussed, as large number of drugs inhibiting cholinesterase activity have become of increasing relevance particularly for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Herein we summarize the current knowledge of the cholinesterase inhibitors with particular attention to recent patents for Alzheimer's disease drugs. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers...|$|E
