5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> shells {{with their}} pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
5|$|The New Englanders {{saw that}} the only {{possible}} place to <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest.

When the landing force was on the heights west of Quebec, the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, and {{the banks of the}} river had already been built up with field fortifications on the southwestern side. He proposed to fight only a skirmishing action there, holding his regulars in reserve for a European-style battle on the open ground west of Quebec.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>cracked</b> Brazilian disc (CBD) {{specimen}} {{is widely}} used {{in order to determine}} mode-I/II and mixed-mode fracture toughness of a rock medium. In this study, the stress intensity factor (SIF) on the crack-tip in this specimen is calculated for various geometrical <b>crack</b> conditions using <b>the</b> extended-finite element method (X-FEM). This method is based upon the finite element method (FEM). In this method, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> is modeled independently from the mesh. The results obtained show that the dimensionless SIFs for the pure modes I and II increase with increase in <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> length but <b>the</b> angle in which pure mode-II occurs decreases. For the mixed-mode loading, with increase in <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> angle, NI value decreases, while NII value increases to a maximum value and then decreases. The results obtained from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> propagation examinations show that <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> angle has an important effect on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> initiation angle. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> initiation angle increases with increase in <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> angle. When <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> angle is zero, then <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> is propagated along its initial direction, whereas in the mixed-mode cases, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> deviates from <b>the</b> initial direction, and propagates in a direction (approximately) parallel to the direction of maximum compressive load...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{used the}} elastic-plastic finite element {{analysis}} method based on strength reduction theory and researched the regularity of longitudinal formation <b>cracks</b> during <b>the</b> loess tunnel construction. It analyzed the development trend of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> dips and <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> surface <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> tunnel center by different depth conditions when using the full section method and the bench cut method during the construction. From that it can get the boundary value of tunnel depth that <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>crack</b> can reach <b>the</b> ground. The result shows that: (1) Through the {{finite element analysis}} of the continuum structural model, it is feasible and effective to use the method, {{which is based on}} the area including the shear stress greater than the cohesive stress, the mutant horizontal displacement, and the change trend of the vertical displacement, to analyze the trend and the scope of longitudinal <b>cracks</b> after <b>the</b> excavation of the loess tunnels. (2) When using the full section method, <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>cracks</b> can reach <b>the</b> ground as long as the buried depth is less than 50 m. With the increase of the buried depth, both of the depth of <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> and <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> and <b>the</b> tunnel center are all increased and <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> dips are changeable whose range is 56 º~ 67 º. However when the buried depth is more than 50 m, <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> can’t reach <b>the</b> ground and develop from the vault to the ground. The slip tendency near the ground is diminished. With the increase of the buried depth, the dips get larger, but the distance between <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> and <b>the</b> tunnel center and <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> depth are invariable. (3) When using the-bench-cut method, the development trend of <b>the</b> formation <b>crack</b> {{is similar to that of}} the full section method. <b>The</b> <b>cracks</b> can reach <b>the</b> ground when the depth is less than 40 m, and the range of <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> is 56 º~ 62 º, or else <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> can’t reach <b>the</b> ground.
