The paper studies agenda, amendment and vote stage lobbying. At the agenda stage an interest group can lobby the Commission. At the amendment and vote stages it can lobby the Council and the Parlia-ment. The paper finds that at the amendment stage an interest group lobbies the institution whose preferences are closer to its own.

40|$|The paper {{accounts}} for the veto player system that dominates the decisions on the medium-term expenditure ceilings (the Financial Perspectives) and on the revenues (the Own Resources Decision) and for the joint decision-making mode that has been gradually introduced for the European Union’s annual budgetary process. This two-tier system has been confirmed by the new Constitutional Treaty, which does not substantially innovate the intergovernmental procedures governing the medium term programming and financing. With respect to the annual budgetary process, the Constitutional Treaty institutionalises the rules which have been necessitated by practical constraints outside the Treaty machinery: the new process is modelled on {{a modified version of}} legislative Codecision and provides for incentives to the parties to agree on the budget draft decided by the Conciliation Committee.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of fast-track legislation in the European Union. Previous research has explained why fast-track legislation occurs and evaluated its democratic repercussions. This study focuses on the European Parliament (EP) ’s intra-organisational response. It first describes how the early adoption of EU legislation has informalised legislative decision-making, transformed inter-organisational relations, and induced power shifts. It then discusses the political response, showing that actors seek to redress power shifts, that reform attempts centre on the control of negotiation authority and information flows, and that reform is highly contested. The {{research suggests that the}} chance of successful redress is low in Parliament as a decentralised organisation unless two conditions are met: (i) the extent of fast-track legislation reaches a critical level, and (ii) the organisation goes through a period of wider reform; the former increases the visibility of disempowerment and reputational loss, the latter allows package deals and/or the strategic use of norms. Based on qualitative document analysis and semi-structured elite interviews an analysis is made of how Parliament’s rules of co-legislation have been contested, negotiated and reformed from the formal introduction of fast-track legislation in 1999 to the adoption of the Code of Conduct for Negotiating in the Context of <b>Codecision</b> <b>Procedures</b> in 2009. The analysis also shows that Parliament may have a price to pay for its successful fight for empowerment, namely a challenge to its institutional legitimacy and discontent of its of rank-and-file members. More generally, understanding the conditions for intra-organisational reform can inform the study of other democratic bodies which undergo a similar restriction and seclusion of de facto decision-making...|$|R
25|$|The {{ordinary}} {{legislative procedure}} is the main legislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted. It was {{formerly known as the}} <b>codecision</b> <b>procedure,</b> and is sometimes referred to as the community method as a contrast to the intergovernmental methods which can variously refer to the consultation procedure or to the open method of co-ordination.|$|E
25|$|However, {{after the}} Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained {{a much bigger}} role. Maastricht brought in the <b>codecision</b> <b>procedure,</b> which gave it equal {{legislative}} power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of Qualified Majority Voting in the Council, the Community pillar {{could be described as}} a far more federal method of decision making.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam {{transferred}} {{responsibility for}} {{free movement of}} persons (e.g., visas, illegal immigration, asylum) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC) as a result).

40|$|From the introduction]. The Constitution {{would have}} {{consolidated}} the EP's legislative powers, extending them, in particular, to new {{areas such as}} agriculture, and ensuring that codecision would become the normal EU legislative procedure. In the continuing absence of such a Constitution, the Parliament has not been sitting still, but has continued to be highly active in both legislative and related fields. Parliament has thus responded in three principal ways, which are all explored in the present paper. Firstly, it has sought to maximize its existing legislative powers, by playing decisive roles in areas of exceptional legislative complexity such as the Services Directive and the REACH chemicals legislation and by occasionally pushing out the frontier of existing rules such as in two recent first reading “rejections” of Commission legislative proposals. Secondly, {{it has also been}} carving out a stronger role for itself in other areas which have become of ever greater importance at a time of low legislative activity by the Commission. Among these are the legislative planning process itself, cross-cutting issues such as the Lisbon Agenda and the Sustainable Development Strategy, and also the Better Regulation Agenda (simplification, impact assessment, implementation, etc) which has been so heavily pushed by the Barroso Commission. It has forged stronger links than ever before with national parliaments. It has also been seeking to improve its own internal procedures, not least through its recently established Working Party on the Reform of EP Working Methods. Finally, the Parliament has pushed for new inter-institutional agreements (IIA's) to resolve a number of practical problems that have arisen, and to help codify existing rules. In this context, it has already reached agreement with the other institutions on important new groundrules on comitology, falling short of what is in the Constitution, but still representing a significant advance on the EP's previous powers in this area. The Parliament has also reached agreement with Commission and Council on an updated joint declaration on practical <b>codecision</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} game-theoretical model of European Union (EU) policy making which {{suggests}} that the amount of legislative activity depends {{on the size of the}} gridlock interval, consistent with Krehbiel’s (1998) study of US politics. This interval depends on two factors: (1) the preference configuration of the political actors; and (2) the legislative procedures in a particular period. Actors’ preferences and the procedures are not expected to have any effect beyond their impact on the gridlock interval. We predict smaller gridlock intervals, and thus more legislative activity, under the <b>codecision</b> (consultation) <b>procedure</b> when the pivotal member states and the European Parliament (Commission) are closer to each other. Furthermore, we expect more activity under qualified majority voting in the EU Council than under unanimity. We find empirical support for these propositions in an empirical analysis of EU legislative activity between 1979 and 2009. nrpages: 36 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Codecision is {{the main}} EU {{legislative}} procedure and the 2007 Reform Treaty draft has adopted it to improve the budgetary process. However, at close examination, codecision and the current budgetary process show an identical structure. Both are designed as non-cooperative alternating offers bargaining games between institutions and both, although in different measure, have gone through periods of interinstitutional deadlocks and conflicts, which can be ascribed to the insufficiency of the non-cooperative bargaining setup {{with respect to the}} task of providing for joint decision making by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers: in particular, the opportunistic interpretation of the Treaty provisions by the Parliament in the 1980 s was one of the consequences of the strict bargaining design. The lacking elements for joint decision-making have been gradually inserted in the procedures by means of informal negotiation institutions, which are not only mechanisms for equilibrium selection but also corrective devices to strict non-cooperative procedures. In the change from the current budgetary procedure to the one designed in the Reform Treaty, the Parliament does not seem to gain a formal ‘dominant position’, whereas the Commission improves its scope for action and the Council consolidates its role.

Critics of the Directive argued that the [...] "technical character" [...] requirement was open to too much interpretation and could lead to almost unlimited patentability of software. Proponents, also, felt that the amended version contained too many ambiguities to be capable of meeting the original purpose of the Directive, which was to harmonise the law across Europe.

40|$|The <b>codecision</b> <b>procedure</b> {{has changed}} radically since its {{inception}} in 1992. At first characterised by inter-institutional mistrust, the <b>codecision</b> <b>procedure</b> today is used to settle quick political agreements informally between the Parliament and the Council. This new negotiation culture can be seen in relation to the growing number of informal first reading agreements between the Parliament and the Council, {{at the expense of the}} more formalised and timeconsuming second and third reading agreements. While this change entails closer cooperation between the Parliament and the Council, it presents serious challenges for the Commission, which has some difficulty acting in this more informal and more political environment. This paper argues that the Commission’s problems are due to its internal organisation being split in two – there is: 1) a highly political ‘top’ level including the Commissioners, their cabinets and the Secretariat General, and 2) a less political ‘bottom’ level with more technically-minded civil servants. The Commission now faces a major problem when sending these civil servants to negotiate informally with the politicians in the Parliament: they simply don’t speak the language of politics and as a result the Commission runs the risk of being marginalised within the <b>codecision</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E
