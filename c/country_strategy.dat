40|$|The report's (RE- 253) primary {{objective}} is to propose a methodology for evaluating <b>country</b> <b>strategies,</b> understood as the set of strategies or {{ways of doing things}} in order to achieve preestablished objectives. This task involves examining the strategic concepts contained in country papers (CPs), {{in the context of the}} Bank's planning process, with a subsequent discussion of the evaluability of the strategies set forth in the CPs. The first conclusion is that there is a general lack of clarity, precision and explicitness in the ideas presented. Typically, CPs offer numerous objectives-specifying what is to be done-but fail to detail strategic alternatives and options for executing the objectives, shifting this responsibility, instead, to a group of projects. The present report highlights some of the difficulties of formulating <b>country</b> <b>strategies</b> in Bank documents. ...|$|R

Coaches and cross country runners debate {{the relative merits of}} fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.|$|E

5000|$|As the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Dr Nalaka Godahewa was {{instrumental}} in developing the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Strategy 2011-2016 which {{was approved by the}} Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka It was under his direction that Sri Lanka Tourism started promoting a clear value proposition of the destination being authentic, compact and diverse under the new tagline ‘Refreshingly Sri Lanka, the Wonder of Asia’. He has been commended by key corporate personalities in the country for creating a highly efficient and investor friendly management culture within a government organization and also for his highly strategic and focused approach towards developing tourism in the post war Sri Lanka. In the 2011/12 annual report the Chairman of Aitken Spence Group, Mr Harry Jayewardene, {{probably one of the most}} out spoken and highly critical business leader in the country, states [...] "I must commend the one-stop shop now operated by Sri Lanka Tourism for those interested in entering the industry. The new facilitation body is a much needed single point of contact and has clearly eased the processing and coordination complexities faced by investors". Godahewa was invited by UNWTO on several occasions to talk about Sri Lanka Tourism. He also took a special interest in promoting Chinese tourism to Sri Lanka and made a special contribution by bringing to limelight the historical records of the 14th century Chinese Naval Admiral Zheng He who visited Sri Lanka 6 times. [...] In 2012 Godahewa launched a coffee table book named Refreshingly Sri Lanka jointly with the photographer Dilum Alagiyawanna to support the Tourism promotions efforts of the country. However Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau changed the 'Refreshingly Sri Lanka' tagline immediately following the exit of Godahewa showing sharp differences of openion within the Ministry. In 2016 UNWTO/PATA included the Sri Lanka Tourism strategy speech presented by Dr Nalaka Godahewa in Guilin China in 2011 in a publication named 'Global Tourism Outlook 20017-2015' which included some of the best <b>country</b> <b>strategy</b> presentations made at UNWTO over the previous 12 years ...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{international}} division of labor, the trade value distribution on different prod-ucts substantiated by international trade flows can be regarded as one <b>country’s</b> <b>strategy</b> for competition. According to the empirical data of trade flows, countries may spend a large fraction of export values on ubiquitous and competitive products. Meanwhile, countries may also diversify their exports share on different types of products to reduce the risk. In this paper, we report that the export share distribution curves can be derived by maximizing the entropy of shares on different products under the product’s complexity constraint once the international market structure (the country-product bipartite network) is given. Therefore, a maximum entropy model provides a good fit to empirical data. The empirical data is consis-tent with maximum entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of the product complexity for each <b>country.</b> One <b>country’s</b> <b>strategy</b> is mainly determined by the types of products this country can export. In addition, our model is able to fit the empirical export share distribution curves of nearly every country very well by tuning only one parameter...|$|R
