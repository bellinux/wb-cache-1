25|$|In 1881, Charles Darwin {{and his son}} Francis {{performed}} {{experiments on}} coleoptiles, the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the <b>coleoptile</b> to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light. By covering {{various parts of the}} coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the <b>coleoptile</b> tip, but that bending occurs in the hypocotyl. However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the <b>coleoptile</b> was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the <b>coleoptile,</b> causing it to bend.|$|E
25|$|In monocot seeds, the embryo's radicle and {{cotyledon}} {{are covered}} by a coleorhiza and <b>coleoptile,</b> respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, followed by the radicle. The <b>coleoptile</b> is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface.

25|$|In 1928, the Dutch {{botanist}} Frits Warmolt Went {{showed that}} a chemical messenger diffuses from <b>coleoptile</b> tips.

Went cut {{the tips of the}} coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centred on top of the <b>coleoptile</b> to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} the gene responsible for three allelic lazy 1 mutations of Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning, complementation and RNA interference. Sequence analysis and database searches {{indicated that the}} wild-type gene (LAZY 1) encodes a novel and unique protein (LAZY 1) and that rice has no homologous gene. Two lazy 1 mutants were LAZY 1 null. Confirming and advancing the previously reported results on lazy 1 mutants, we found the following. (i) Gravitropism is impaired, but only partially, in lazy 1 <b>coleoptiles.</b> (ii) Circumnutation, observed in dark-grown <b>coleoptiles,</b> is totally absent from lazy 1 <b>coleoptiles.</b> (iii) Primary roots of lazy 1 mutants show normal gravitrop-ism and circumnutation. (iv) LAZY 1 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in gravity-sensitive shoot tissues (i. e. <b>coleoptiles,</b> leaf sheath pulvini and lamina joints) and is little expressed in roots. (v) The gravitropic response of lazy 1 <b>coleoptiles</b> is kinetically separable from that absent from lazy 1 <b>coleoptiles.</b> (vi) Gravity-induced lateral translocation of auxin, found in wild-type <b>coleoptiles,</b> does not occur in lazy 1 <b>coleoptiles.</b> Based on the genetic and physiological evidence obtained, it is concluded that LAZY 1 is specifically involved in shoot gravitropism and that LAZY 1 -dependent and-independent signaling pathways occur in <b>coleoptiles.</b> It is further concluded that, in <b>coleoptiles,</b> only the LAZY 1 -dependent gravity signaling involves asymmetric distribution of auxin between the two lateral halves and is required for circumnutation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the phytotoxicity of extracts and fractions of barks of Blepharocalyx salicifolius on elongation of etiolated <b>coleoptiles</b> of Triticum aestivum (wheat). The extracts hexane (Hx), ethyl acetate (AcOET), and aqueous (H 2 O) were obtained by means of exhaustive extraction with CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 OH and subsequent fractionation by partition chromatography coefficient. The extracts AcOET and Hx were fractionated by column chromatography by using organic solvents in increasing order of polarity, yielding 7 hexanic fractions and 6 ethylic acetate fractions. Subsequently, the fractions Hx 1 and Hx 5 were subfractionated by column chromatography. The extracts AcOET and Hx inhibited elongation of <b>coleoptiles.</b> Four ethylic acetate fractions inhibited elongation of <b>coleoptiles</b> at all concentrations. Five hexanic fractions inhibited elongation of <b>coleoptiles,</b> the fractions Hx 5 and Hx 1 fractions showed phytotoxic effects equivalent or superior to those observed by the herbicide GOAL® at the same concentrations. All subfractions obtained by means of fractionation of Hx 1 inhibited elongation of <b>coleoptiles.</b> Six fractions obtained by means of fractionation of Hx 5 inhibited elongation of <b>coleoptiles</b> at all concentrations. This study proves the phytotoxicity of extracts of barks of B. salicifolius, providing indications that they may act as promising natural herbicides...|$|R

Treatment of <b>coleoptiles</b> with 10 μM 4 -HBA resulted in enhancing of superoxide anion-radical generation and maintaining of hydrogen peroxide content there in. Increasing of the rate of ROS production was significantly suppressed by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (α-naphthol) and peroxidase (salicylhydroxamic acid). Under the influence of 4 -HBA the activities of superoxide dismutase and apoplastic forms of peroxidase were increased. The activity of oxalate oxidase and catalase has not changed. Exogenous 4 -HBA improved <b>coleoptiles</b> heat resistance and its effects were comparable with the influence of salicylic acid. Antioxidant agent BHT (butylhydroxytoluene), inhibitors of NADPH oxidase and peroxidase significantly reduced the increasing of wheat <b>coleoptiles</b> heat resistance, caused by 4 -HBA action. It was concluded that 4 -HBA influence on <b>coleoptiles</b> heat resistance is realized with the ROS mediation...|$|R

In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{activities}} of acid invertase and sucrose synthase during germination of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Kanchan) seeds were investigated. The activities of both acid invertase and sucrose synthase were changed during growth of seedlings. Until third day of germination their activities increased and thereafter decreased. The activity of acid invertase in the soluble fraction was higher than that of cell wall- bound fraction and for soluble fraction <b>coleoptiles</b> showed a significantly higher acid invertase activity than roots. But in the cell wall-bound fraction a higher activity was found in roots. Sucrose synthase activity was also higher in roots than in <b>coleoptiles.</b> Sucrose content was negatively correlated with the acid invertase activity in both <b>coleoptiles</b> and roots accounting well for the relation between substrate and the activity. Fructose content was significantly higher than the glucose and sucrose content and the amount of sugar was higher in roots than in <b>coleoptiles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dark-grown wheat <b>coleoptiles</b> {{developed}} strong curvatures within 5 h {{of being}} transferred in orbit from a 1 g centrifuge to microgravity during an experiment flown on the IML- 1 shuttle mission.

40|$|Galactose {{inhibited}} auxin-induced cell elongation of oat <b>coleoptiles</b> but {{not that}} of azuki bean stems. Galactose decreased the level of UDP-glucose in oat <b>coleoptiles</b> but not in azuki bean hypocotyls. Glucose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase activity (EC 2. 7. 7. 9), in a crude extract from oat <b>coleoptiles,</b> was competitively inhibited by galactose- 1 -phosphate, but that enzyme from azuki bean was not. A correlation was found between inhibition of growth by galactose and inhibition of glucose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase activity by galactose- 1 -phosphate using oat, wheat, maize, barley, azuki bean, pea, mung bean, and cucumber plants.

40|$|The <b>coleoptiles</b> {{of wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) {{seedlings}} of cultivar Tre´mie are desiccation tolerant when 3 days old, although the roots are not. Cutting {{some of the}} <b>coleoptiles</b> open prior to dehydration rapidly increased the drying rate. This rendered the <b>coleoptiles</b> sensitive to desiccation, providing a useful model with which to study desiccation tolerance. Both sensitive and tolerant seedlings were dehydrated to 0. 3 g H 2 O g 1 dry mass (g. g) and thereafter rehydrated. Sensitive tissues accrued the lipid peroxidation products H 2 O 2 and MDA, and substantial subcellular damage was evident in dry tissues. H 2 O 2 and MDA accumulated slightly only in dry tolerant <b>coleoptiles</b> and no subcellular damage was evident. The activity of antioxidant enzymes glutathione reductase (EC 1. 6. 2. 4), superoxide dismutase (EC 1. 14. 1. 1) and catalase (EC 1. 11. 1. 6) increased on drying in both tolerant and sensitive tissues, but were sustained on rehydration in only the tolerant tissues. It is proposed that free radical damage sustained during rapid drying exceeded the ameliorating capacity of antioxidant systems, allowed accrual of lethal subcellular damage. Slow drying enabled sufficient detoxification by antioxidants to minimize damage and allow tolerance to drying. Three LEA- (p 11 and Asp 52) and dehydrin- (XV 8) like proteins were detected by western blots in tolerant <b>coleoptiles</b> dried to 3. 0 g. g and below. Only one (Asp 52) was induced at low water content in rapidly dried sensitive <b>coleoptiles.</b> None were present in root tissues. XV 8 RNA (northern analyses) was induced on drying only in tolerant <b>coleoptiles</b> and correlated with protein expression. These putative stress-protein protectants (and XV 8 transcripts) appear to be down-regulated during germination but wheat seedlings temporarily retain the ability to reproduce them if drying is slow. Sucrose accumulation during dehydration was similar for both sensitive and tolerant tissues, suggesting that this sugar has little role, or is not effective in isolation, in protecting against desiccation damage in wheat seedlings. In summary, the slower rate at which tolerant <b>coleoptiles</b> were dried allowed for the mobilization of protection mechanisms with which to survive desiccation. Rapid drying of tissues precluded induction of some putative stress protein protectants and caused damage {{in excess of the}} ameliorating capacity of the antioxidant protection system...|$|R
