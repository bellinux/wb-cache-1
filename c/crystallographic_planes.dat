2500|$|Bragg {{diffraction}} {{occurs when}} radiation, with wavelength comparable to atomic spacings, is scattered in a specular fashion by the atoms of a crystalline system, and undergoes constructive interference. For a crystalline solid, the waves are scattered from lattice planes separated by the interplanar distance d. [...] When the scattered waves interfere constructively, they remain in phase since {{the difference between}} the path lengths of the two waves is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength. [...] The path difference between two waves undergoing interference is given by 2dsinθ, where θ is the scattering angle (see figure on the right). [...] The effect of the constructive or destructive interference intensifies because of the cumulative effect of reflection in successive <b>crystallographic</b> <b>planes</b> of the crystalline lattice (as described by Miller notation). This leads to Bragg's law, which describes the condition on θ for the constructive interference to be at its strongest: ...|$|E
