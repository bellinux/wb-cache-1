The real disposition of Waverley, on the other hand, notwithstanding his dreams of tented fields and military honour, seemed exclusively domestic. He asked and received no share in the busy scenes which were constantly going on around him, and was rather annoyed than interested by the discussion of contending claims, rights, and interests which often passed in his presence. All this pointed him out as the person formed to make happy a spirit like that of Rose, which corresponded with his own.|$|E

5000|$|Although Emelianenko {{is mainly}} {{known as a}} striker, he is {{considered}} to excel {{in all of the}} attributes of the MMA game. He favours a strategy of ground and pound executed with viciousness and dynamism, being able to negate his opponent's work from the bottom and cause damage with heavy strikes. He rarely seeks to improve position over his opponent, instead attacking freely from positions widely <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>dangerous,</b> sometimes baiting for submissions in order to create openings. On the stand-up, Emelianenko's aggressive boxing makes a wide usage of the [...] "Russian hook" [...] or casting punch popularized by Igor Vovchanchyn, as well as other types of more technical power punches to the body and head. This, combined with a smart footwork, allows him to disrupt the offensive of more scientific strikers and land the best hits against them. He frequently darts into striking range with either a left hook or an overhand right to disrupt counterpunches, resulting in a flurry of punches that often stun or flatten his opponents. On the wrestling aspect, Emelianenko has showed a high level acumen of hip throws from judo and sambo to bring his adversary to the ground, preferring to work from the clinch as opposed to the traditional leg takedowns.|$|E

40|$|The public {{perception}} of spiders and scorpions is skewed towards the potential harm they can inflict in humans, despite recent scientific evidence that arachnid venom components might be useful as bioinsecticides or even human therapeutics. Nevertheless, arachnids are becoming more popular as pets in Europe, America and Asia, raising the question for regulatory agencies in these regions {{as to whether they}} need to take measurements to protect their citizens. In order to decide upon the necessary regulatory steps, they first need to determine which arachnids are actually dangerous to humans. This review therefore provides an overview of the current literature on verified bites and stings from spiders and scorpions with the aim of assessing their potential danger for human health. As a guideline, we also provide a list of those arachnid genera that we <b>consider</b> <b>as</b> potentially <b>dangerous,</b> which includes 10 spider and 11 scorpion genera. The arachnid genera classified <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> comprise {{less than a quarter of}} all extant scorpion species and only 0. 5 % of all spiders species, with the actual number most likely being much lower than that, as not all species in those genera might turn out to pose an actual threat for humans. In conclusion, we found that only a small percentage of scorpions and a minute percentage of all spiders can be <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> potentially <b>dangerous</b> to humans. While in some countries of origin the high incidence of envenomations by dangerous arachnids can result in a serious problem to the health system, we assessed the risk that the same species pose when kept as pets under controlled maintenance conditions as significantly lower.
