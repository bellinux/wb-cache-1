40|$|From the Introduction]. [...] I {{will return}} to the key question: what role could {{powerful}} regions play in future Europe? Several scenarios are possible, and especially the scenarios offered by representatives of <b>constitutional</b> <b>regions</b> are rather optimistic. Their basic premise is that a strong Europe needs strong regions as its constituent units. On the one hand this perspective is justified and legitimated, and, usually the underlying arguments of this thesis are craftily developed. On the other hand, alternative, even opposite, views are also possible. In order to demonstrate this rather pessimistic argument, I imagine Europe’s future, say in the year 2007, after the new Constitutional treaty is in force as such. Under this new treaty the regions have the rights and powers, which they should have following the proposals made in the Convention’s working group documents and following some proposals of some Members of the Convention. In other words, seen {{from the perspective of the}} regions, dreams will come true. As I will be a little more critical, my reflections are labelled under the provocative title "Do Dreams or Nightmares come true? The role of powerful regions in future Europe". I will present my critical, sometimes polemic reflections in two steps. First, I will offer a short view on the "dream" expressed by the "Assembly of European Regions" in view of the hearing at the European Convention at the end of June 2002. In a second step I imagine the situation in a couple of years, after all these dreams of the regions dreams come true, and will make some critical comments on the role of powerful regions in future Europe...|$|R
40|$|From the introduction]. For {{a period}} in the later 1980 s and early 1990 s, {{the idea of a}} Europe of the regions gained {{political}} prominence within the European Union. The idea of a Europe of the regions was an old one, but it was given contemporary resonance in this period due to the European Union’s structural fund reforms in 1988 which gave a new level of prominence to regional governments, with those regional governments also seeking some level of institutional representation within the EU. The outcome of this pressure was twofold: the creation of the Committee of the Regions as a consultative body within the EU (Loughlin 1996, Kennedy 1997), comprised of members of local and regional authorities, and the passage of the Treaty of European Union (Maastricht), which gave regional governments the constitutional ability to represent Member State interests within the Council of Ministers. For regional governments (as well as local governments), there was now a level of institutional recognition in the EU, with efforts to improve the regional level at subsequent EU treaty revisions at Amsterdam, Nice and then with the Convention on the Future of Europe. At this latter juncture, some regional governments had grouped together to establish the Congress of Local And Regional Authorities in Europe in 1999. This body sought to promote the interest of ‘constitutional regions’ in the EU – meaning those regions with strong powers and the ability to make legislation. This organisation also gave birth to REGLEG (Regions with legislative powers) and sought to promote greater representation for <b>constitutional</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU, a defined role for the regions in the EU constitution, a clear definition of powers and functions between the EU, national and subnational level, a strengthening of the Committee of the Regions and a direct right of appeal for regions to the European Court of Justice (Lynch 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|Once {{again we}} are {{approaching}} {{one of those}} moments in Canada in which constitutional law becomes central to our politics. The fundamental cost of the current political crisis is its impact on the national unity of our country. Whenever the next election comes it might result in the failure of any of the federal parties to secure national representation in all our regions, particularly in Quebec. Professor Ignatieff takes issue with those who believe that politics does not need ideas and those who would avoid constitutional discussion. He believes the challenge to federalism should be met head on saying that Canada is the most successful and enduring multinational, multi-lingual liberal democratic federation on Earth and that Quebec has benefited and has not been threatened by federalist arrangements in Canada. <b>Constitutional</b> dialogue amongst <b>regions</b> and languages of Canada is an ongoing process and Professor Ignatieff argues that it is the very condition of our collective survival.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study, 22 AML {{patients}} with Normal Karyotype were retrospectively analyzed by using OGT Hematological Cancer 8 x 60 K CGH+ SNP array, in order to detect cryptic genomic aberrations. 11 out of 22 patients confirmed a normal genomic setting; 11 out of 22 patients instead showed unexpected genomic imbalances, such as trisomies (+ 4, + 8, + 10, + 13, + 16) or monosomies (- 7, - 5 q, -Y). In addition to this large rearrangements, some patients showed Copy Number Variations (CNVs) containing genes involved in hematological process or tumorigenesis. aCGH was also performed in a small group of patients with Complex karyotype in order to better define the cytogenetic results and to detect cryptic CNVs. This study suggests a potential role for the use of aCGH in the clinical workup of AML patients with Normal karyotype in order to identify cryptic leukemic clones. In the future this new approach will probably permit to better stratify the patients in risk category and make a more appropriate therapy. In the second part of the study, 22 renal-transplated patients were tested with OGT Oligoarray platform 4 x 180 K CGH array in order to evaluate constitutional CNVs that might predispose to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. <b>Constitutional</b> chromosomal <b>regions</b> involved in genomic imbalances (CNVs) affected mostly regions containing oncogenes or critical hematological regions,such as: 1 p 21. 1, 6 p 25. 31, 14 q 32. 33, and 16 p 11. 2. These copy number variations are exclusively described in patients who develop PTLD and patients without PTLD but with High-EBV viral Load, and thus, at risk to develop the disease.

5000|$|A Belgium 1993 <b>constitutional</b> {{revision}} granted <b>Regions</b> and Communities {{the right}} to develop international co-operation, including the celebration of treaties, in matters of their exclusive competence (article 167 (3)). Cultural and educational matters are, according to article 127 (3), those fields of their exclusive competence. This faculty includes the drafting of treaties, which are ratified by the French and the Flemish Community Councils by decree (article 128 (1.1)). Article 130 (4) provides the same right to the German-speaking Community, and adds [...] "personal issues" [...] to its fields of competence. Since the Communities have acquired exclusive right to develop their international relations on those exclusive matters, the King cannot sign, ratify or denounce treaties on their behalf. Only the treaties concluded before 18 May 1993 may be denounced by the King. The rigidity of Belgium sphere of competences raised legal difficulties to the approval of international treaties dealing with both federal and community's issues. These treaties are known as traités mixtes, and {{is the object of}} a co-operation agreement between the federal state, the Communities and the Regions (8 Mars 1994), which provides for a complex mechanism of shared responsibilities.|$|R
40|$|Multidimensional poverty {{persists}} in Kenya, especially among its pastoralist {{communities of the}} arid and semi arid lands (ASALs). This results from the failure of successive independence governments to decisively mitigate the ASAL's agro-ecological adversities, because these governments have hitherto considered the areas to be incidental to core national interests. The country's long-term development blue-print, Kenya Vision 2030, also pays scant attention to the ASALs, undermining the new constitution's aspiration for democratic, participatory governance that secures people's basic rights and equitable development, with special attention to marginalized communities, such as pastoralists. Prior to Kenya's recent discovery of viable stocks of natural resources, the country was cooperating internationally {{on the development of}} the Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor incorporating a rail, highway, oil pipeline and refinery network, to which have been added airports and resort cities - all sited in the pastoralist ASAL <b>regions.</b> <b>Constitutional</b> devolution encourages Kenya's 47 autonomous counties to plan and implement their respective development priorities. Meanwhile, the government has undertaken little or no consultation with the host ASAL communities over the grandiose LAPSSET project and the impending mining activities which are consequently likely to swamp the host counties' priorities, likely exacerbating their marginalization. This paper highlights the risks LAPSSET and the impending mining activities pose to the ASAL pastoralists and underscores the need for constitutionally mandated consultations over national development initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Two {{children}} are reported with bone marrow (BM) failure {{but without a}} precise diagnosis. Patient n. 1 is a 3 -year-old female with a severe anaemia associated with several dysmorphic/malformative symptoms. The standard karyotype was normal, but array-CGH showed a 4 Mb duplication of chromosome 1 short arms of and a 2 Mb deletion of chromosome 8 long arms. The anomaly was <b>constitutional.</b> The lacking <b>region</b> of chromosome 8 included the locus RUNX 1 T 1 which is relevant in transcription repression of several genes with a role in myelopoiesis. The expression of RUNX 1 T 1 in the BM was down-regulated. We postulate that the chromosome imbalances are the cause of BM failure and severe anaemia, besides of all extra-haematological signs. Patient n. 2 is a female of {{less than one year}} of age with severe pancytopenia, in absence of other symptoms. The karyotype showed a constitutional change that had been already diagnosed prenatally, and that was interpreted as a balanced translocation t(2; 8). No imbalances were disclosed by array-CGH. FISH with libraries and a number of BAC probes showed that the rearrangement was in fact an insertion of two adjacent portions of chromosome 2 short arms into the long arms of chromosome 8. The RUNX 1 T 1 gene was intact, but included in the portion between the two insertions of material from chromosome 2. The expression of RUNX 1 T 1 in BM was highly up-regulated, probably by position effects, and this was interpreted as the cause of the pancytopenia. The two cases reported here, together with other similar ones already reported by our group, demonstrate that a possible and not infrequent cause of BM failure is a chromosome anomaly, both balanced or unbalanced, either constitutional or acquired...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are to {{evaluate}} the role of environmental exposures, especially professional exposure to organic solvents and petroleum products in the etiology of acute leukemia and to investigate {{if there is a}} correlation between the exposure to a specific leukemogen factor and a clonal chromosome aberration of the leukemic cells. Papers I and II present results of a case-control study of environmental exposures, in all occupations during life-time, medical treatments with medicines, chemotherapy and radiation, tobacco-use and the exposure to chemical compounds in private life in 120 patients with acute leukemia and of 120 controls, matched for age (+ 4 years), residence and sex. The patientswere treated in one of five hospitals collaborating in the Leukemia Group of Middle Sweden. The controls were taken from the population register of the taxation authorities, where all inhabitants are listed district by district. Odds ratio (OR) and multivariate analysis with logistic regression on matched data were calculated. The analyses of the chromosome aberrations were done with the Q-banding technique ad modum Caspersson. Increased risk of acute leukemia was found in painters: OR: 13; 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) (binomial distribution) : 2 - 554, (P= 0. 002), in all different professions exposed to organic solvents: OR: 4. 9; 95 %CI: 2. 2 - 12. 1, (P< 0. 001) and in drivers: OR: 3. 0, 95 %CI: 1. 1 - 9. 2 (P= 0. 02). Multivariate analysis showed that the significances remained, after consideration was taken to exposures to organic solvents (P< 0. 001), therapeutic radiation (P= 0. 008) and petroleum products (P= 0. 020). No excess risks were found after professional exposures to other nonvolatile petroleum products, as machine oil and motor oil. Thus the exposures to organic solvents and to petroleum products were independent risk-factors for AML. Paper III describes chromosome 3 aberrations in acute myelocytic leukemia and the exposure to mutagens. All patients with monosomy 3 and deletions of chromosome 3 were found to be exposed to environmental mutagens or radiation and/or chemotherapy. They had a short survival. All breakpoints of chromosome 3 were found in the <b>constitutional</b> fragile site <b>regions</b> 3 p 14. 2, 3 q 21 and 3 q 26 - 27. Dysmegakaryo-cytopoiesis was found in cases with chromosome break-points at 3 q 21, 3 q 25 - 29 and in monosomy 3. Paper IV: The relationship between the occupational exposure to benzene and the occurrence of specific cytogenetic aberrations was studied in 179 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Fifty-seven (32 %) patients had a history of daily occupational exposure to benzene and 47 (82 %) of these were men, 10 were women (P< 0. 001). Numerical chromosome aberrations (P= 0. 002) as well as trisomy 8 (P< 0. 001) were significantly more common in patients exposed to benzene compared to non-exposed. Benzene-exposure was not significantly associated with the occurrence of complex karyotypes, deletions, translocations or aberrations of chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19. It is significantly correlated to monocytoid cell differentiation (FAB-M 5). Conclusions: The results show an increased risk of developing acute leukemia after exposure to organic solvents, especially in painters, but also in drivers and other professions exposed to organic solvents and petroleum products as gasoline and diesel. Exposure to benzene was significantly correlated with numerical chromosome aberrations, especially trisomy 8. Monocytoid cell-differentiation was significantly more often seen in benzene exposed patients than in non-exposed. Women had a significantly shorter mean-time of exposure to benzene (12. 1 years), compared to men (27. 8 years) (P= 0. 003), which could indicate a greater sensitivity to benzene exposure in women compared to men. Furthermore the results create a possibility to take preventive actions against the exposure to leukemogenic agents...|$|R
