500|$|In October 1888 Lang {{was elected}} to an All Souls Fellowship, and began to divide his time between London and Oxford. Some of his Oxford friends were {{training}} for ordination and Lang was often drawn into their discussions. Eventually the question entered Lang's mind: [...] "Why shouldn't you be ordained?" [...] The thought persisted, and one Sunday evening in early 1889, after {{a visit to the}} theological college at Cuddesdon, Lang attended evening service at the Cuddesdon parish church. By his own account, during the sermon he was gripped by [...] "a masterful inward voice" [...] which told him [...] "You are wanted. You are <b>called.</b> <b>You</b> must obey." [...] He immediately severed his connection with the Bar, renounced his political ambitions and applied for a place at Cuddesdon College. With the help of an All Souls contact, the essential step of his confirmation into the Church of England was supervised by the Bishop of Lincoln. Lang's decision to become an Anglican and seek ordination disappointed his Presbyterian father, who nevertheless wrote to his son: [...] "What you think, prayerfully and solemnly, you ought to do – you must do – we will accept." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause I feel we keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} can say I still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I <b>called</b> <b>you</b> selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E
