5|$|The {{acceleration}} {{index is}} the ratio between steering torque and lateral or <b>centripetal</b> acceleration.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces {{can be understood}} qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) causes {{a difference in the}} <b>centripetal</b> force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (<b>centripetal)</b> force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a <b>centripetal</b> force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the <b>centripetal</b> force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This <b>centripetal</b> force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. <b>Centripetal</b> moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is <b>centripetal,</b> meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a <b>centripetal</b> force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the <b>centripetal</b> acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a <b>centripetal</b> force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E
25|$|In a {{two-body}} rotation, such as {{a planet}} and moon rotating about their common center of mass or barycentre, the forces on both bodies are <b>centripetal.</b> In that case, {{the reaction to the}} <b>centripetal</b> force of the planet on the moon is the <b>centripetal</b> force of the moon on the planet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an object that is {{swinging}} around {{on the end of a}} rope in a horizontal plane, the <b>centripetal</b> force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The <b>centripetal</b> force can also be supplied as a 'push' force, such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the <b>centripetal</b> force for a wall of death rider.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} <b>centripetal</b> force arises in the helix that is traced out when a charged {{particle}} moves {{in a uniform}} magnetic field {{in the absence of}} other external forces. In this case, the magnetic force is the <b>centripetal</b> force that acts towards the helix axis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of distant objects and a {{rotating}} reference frame, what {{must be taken into}} account is the resultant force of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent <b>centripetal</b> acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious <b>centripetal</b> force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in <b>centripetal</b> direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in <b>centripetal</b> direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{second section}} {{establishes}} relationships between <b>centripetal</b> {{forces and the}} law of areas now known as Kepler's second law (Propositions 1–3), and relates circular velocity and radius of path-curvature to radial force (Proposition 4), and relationships between <b>centripetal</b> forces varying as the inverse-square of {{the distance to the}} center and orbits of conic-section form (Propositions 5–10).|$|E
25|$|Newton's {{idea of a}} <b>centripetal</b> force {{corresponds}} to what is nowadays {{referred to as a}} central force. When a satellite is in orbit around a planet, gravity {{is considered to be a}} <b>centripetal</b> force even though in the case of eccentric orbits, the gravitational force is directed towards the focus, and not towards the instantaneous center of curvature.|$|E
25|$|One common example {{involving}} <b>centripetal</b> {{force is}} the case in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path. The <b>centripetal</b> force is directed at right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the circular path. The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens.|$|E
25|$|For the <b>Centripetal</b> and Centrifugal {{forces are}} GOD SUSTAINING and DIRECTING.|$|E
25|$|In {{non-uniform}} {{circular motion}} the net acceleration (a) is along direction of Δv which is directed inside circle {{but does not}} pass through its center (see figure). The net acceleration may be resolved into two components: tangential acceleration and normal acceleration {{also known as the}} <b>centripetal</b> or radial acceleration. Unlike tangential acceleration, <b>centripetal</b> acceleration is present in both uniform and non-uniform circular motion.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, a reactive {{centrifugal force}} forms {{part of an}} action–reaction pair with a <b>centripetal</b> force.|$|E
25|$|The {{acceleration}} vector of the parcel is decomposed in the {{tangential acceleration}} parallel to s {{and in the}} <b>centripetal</b> acceleration along positive n. The tangential acceleration only changes the speed V and is equal to DV/Dt, where big d's denote the material derivative. The <b>centripetal</b> acceleration always points towards the centre of curvature O and only changes the direction s of the forward displacement while the parcel moves on.|$|E
25|$|It {{is subject}} to a <b>centripetal</b> force of one {{kilogram}} metre per square second, which is one newton.|$|E
25|$|The {{electron}} {{is held in}} {{a circular}} orbit by electrostatic attraction. The <b>centripetal</b> force {{is equal to the}} Coulomb force.|$|E
25|$|In the cross-stream {{momentum}} equation, after omitting {{the pressure}} force, the <b>centripetal</b> acceleration is the Coriolis force per unit mass.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface man. The <b>centripetal</b> force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This <b>centripetal</b> force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the <b>centripetal</b> force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the <b>centripetal</b> force requisite to the motion.|$|E
25|$|In {{this local}} {{coordinate}} system, the acceleration resembles the expression for nonuniform circular motion {{with the local}} radius ρ(s), and the <b>centripetal</b> acceleration is identified as the second term.|$|E
25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, {{the tension in the}} tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the <b>centripetal</b> force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the <b>centripetal</b> force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the <b>centripetal</b> force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E
25|$|Propositions 43–45 are {{demonstration}} {{that in an}} eccentric orbit under <b>centripetal</b> force where the apse may move, a steady non-moving orientation {{of the line of}} apses is an indicator of an inverse-square law of force.|$|E
25|$|In physics, uniform {{circular}} motion describes {{the motion of}} a body traversing a circular path at constant speed. Since the body describes {{circular motion}}, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates {{the presence of an}} acceleration; this <b>centripetal</b> acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times towards the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a <b>centripetal</b> force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1660s Newton {{studied the}} motion of colliding bodies, and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's {{interest}} in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called 'endeavour to recede' (now called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center. After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or <b>centripetal</b> force. According to Newton scholar J Bruce Brackenridge, although {{much has been made}} of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or <b>centripetal</b> forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and <b>centripetal</b> points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis. Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{cyclonic}} and anticyclonic gradient speeds {{approach it}} as the radius of curvature becomes indefinitely large—geostrophic balance is indeed the limiting case of gradient flow for vanishing <b>centripetal</b> acceleration (that is, for pressure and Coriolis force exactly balancing out).|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{centrifugal}} force, being {{one-half of}} the reaction pair together with <b>centripetal</b> force, is a concept which applies in any reference frame. This distinguishes it from the inertial or fictitious centrifugal force, which appears only in rotating frames.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya’s {{research}} {{provided the}} experimental data needed to model traumatic brain injury. His <b>Centripetal</b> theory was foundational to the biomechanics of traumatic brain injury. This work allowed for improved modeling of brain injury by engineers in their design of safety equipment in automobiles.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Newton's first law of motion, an object moves {{in a straight}} line {{in the absence of any}} external forces acting on the object. A curved path may however ensue when a physical acts on it; this force is often called a <b>centripetal</b> force, as it is directed toward the center of curvature of the path. Then in {{accordance with}} Newton's third law of motion, there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some other object, such as a constraint that forces the path to be curved, and this reaction force, the subject of this article, is sometimes called a reactive centrifugal force, as it is directed in the opposite direction of the <b>centripetal</b> force.|$|E
25|$|Applying Newton's laws, {{multiplying}} {{the acceleration}} by {{the mass of}} the walker, the inertial observer concludes that the walker is subject to two forces: the inward, radially directed <b>centripetal</b> force, and another force perpendicular to the radial direction that is proportional to the speed of the walker.|$|E
