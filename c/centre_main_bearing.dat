5000|$|The car {{at first}} {{had a new}} side-valve, six-cylinder, 7036 cc engine (7428 cc from 1910) with the {{cylinders}} cast in two units of three cylinders each {{as opposed to the}} triple two-cylinder units on the earlier six. A three-speed transmission was fitted at first with four-speed units used from 1913. The seven-bearing crankshaft had full pressure lubrication, and the <b>centre</b> <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> was made especially large to remove vibration, essentially splitting the engine into two three-cylinder units. Two spark plugs were fitted to each cylinder with, from 1921, a choice of magneto or coil ignition. The earliest cars had used a trembler coil to produce the spark with a magneto as an optional extra which soon became standard - the instruction was to start the engine on the trembler/battery and then switch to magneto. Continuous development allowed power output to be increased from [...] at 1,250 rpm to [...] at 2,250 rpm. Electric lighting became an option in 1914 and was standardised in 1919. Electric starting was fitted from 1919 along with electric lights to replace the older ones that used acetylene or oil.|$|E

The object of this work was to compare the theoretical prediction of bearing behaviour with the practical case. Engineering aspects of these measure-ments are given in the 1967 Institution of Mechanical Engineers Review Paper on dynamically loaded bearings. Reasons for the development of this system are given, along with a description of measurement techniques, including transmission of signals from the moving big-end to the measuring instruments. Data recording, analysis, and presentation of results are also described. One of the most significant features of this work was {{the manner in which the}} bearing distorted during an engine cycle. This has shown the need for further experimental measurements, which in turn have made it necessary for further development or partial automation of the measuring system...|$|R

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of: • radial deformations of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

40|$|The {{studies on}} the cause of fault at machine {{elements}} and materials have been explained by many authors already. But, the studies of actual machine parts {{under the influence of}} dynamic load are rare explained. Here the studies of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> siud at diesel engine are achieved and its solutlhn is proved. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The insufficient rigidity of engine bed is most cause of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studs at diesel engine. 2. Seconrlly, the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> stud suffered severe load by the weak structure of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> cap and therfore the better type of structure is recommended by the writer. 3. Tightness of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is important too. The maximum tensile stress of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studis about 2 times in comparison with one of the other studby fault of tighting and its value indicates about 28 kg/㎟. ディーゼル機関に於て主軸受スタッドの切損を屡々見受ける。この切損の特徴として，その装着位置からして早期発見が仲々むつかしく従って慨事故を発見した時は主軸受メタルの焼付・亀裂又はクランクジャーナル部の偏摩粍等を併発している事が多く，甚だしきに至っては機関台床亀裂等の大事故を起し機関再選転を不能ならしめた例もある。筆者の過去数年間に互る調査結果より推察すると，概切損事故の特色は機関主軸受NO・としてクランク両・端側の主軸受（例えば 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 1 及 8 主軸受）には事故皆無であり，切損の過半数は中央主軸受（ 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 4 及 5 主軸受）に発生している事である。尚スタッドの切損個所としてはスタッド植込部からが殆んどである。此等の調査結果を本稿中の表- 1 に示してある。主軸受スタッド切損に就て調査研究並びにこれに基ずく実験を行い，その原因を究明し得たのでその対策と併せて茲に発表する...|$|R

5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so). In addition, modern high-compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the crankthrows to have greater support from adjacent bearings, so it is now customary to design straight-sixes with seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find a method to study the {{lubrication}} character of the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and load condition of the crankshaft about the marine two-stroke diesel engine. Based on the finite element method, multi-body dynamics, elastohydrodynamic and Green-Tripp theory about contact, the simulation of coupling between the elastic crankshaft and engine block is carried out. The load of <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> the minimum of oil film thick, orbital path of journal, average of asperity contact pressure are explored. The results indicate that the lubrication is good except No. 2 <b>main</b> <b>bearing.</b> Parts of <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> appear three peaks in a working cycle, which shows that above theory and elastic crankshaft and engine block is obligatory to simulate the lubrication and load condition accurately...|$|R
50|$|Although {{this seems}} {{impossible}} at first glance, {{the geometry of}} the engine does permit this overlap. The big-end bearings of connecting rods are wider (along the crank axis) than {{the thickness of the}} rod itself. By making the crank webs with an offset to them, it is possible to place the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> closer together, closely sandwiching the rod passing between them, where this is now a narrower gap than the <b>bearing</b> size. The <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> are similarly confined and each <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> can be supported by only a thin wall across the crankcase.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the health {{monitoring}} of a wind turbine drivetrain in a system perspective. A 5 -MW reference drivetrain installed on a spar type floating wind turbine is selected. Degradation and damage in the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be {{a key factor in}} the “system” failure. This is a step forward in monitoring the wind turbine drivetrains on a system level...|$|R

A 5 -MW reference gearbox with 4 -point support is employed and the decoupled analysis approach is used for the load effect analysis. The effect of this fault event is then investigated for all bearings and gears inside the gearbox as well as <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> The results show that the blade-pitch fault creates significant axial forces on <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> which increases the nontorque force entering the gearbox. Due to the emergency shutdown, the rotor torque reversal occurs which causes force reversals in gears. The <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> are more affected than gears and bearings inside the gearbox in this fault condition and emergency shutdown, but first-stage bearings may also be considerably affected. It is therefore recommended to conduct a thorough inspection of <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and first stage bearings in case of such blade-pitch fault condition and emergency shutdown...|$|R
