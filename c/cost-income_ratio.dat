Utilizing a dataset of 662 relatively large commercial banks in 29 OECD countries from 1992 to 2006, we find that banks with relatively large asset sizes, low net interest margins, high impaired loan <b>ratios,</b> and high <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratios</b> tend to exhibit higher non-interest income shares. As for macroeconomic factors, banks in countries with slow economic growth, a stable inflation environment, and well- developed stock markets tend to show higher non-interest income shares. Second, we investigate the consequences of non-interest income expansion on bank profitability and risks. While the positive effects on profit and capital adequacy seem to become weaker under the consideration of macroeconomic factors and endogeneity problems, the adverse impact on profit variability remains robust. Overall, these findings suggest that expanding toward non-interest income may not produce desired income diversification effects, and it does not necessarily imply a shift toward superior return-risk frontiers...|$|R

Necessary data were gathered from the financial statements of nine Saudi banks listed in the stock exchange market over the period of 2007 - 2011. The results of analyzing the data based on the implementation of linear regression technique reveals {{that there is a}} meaningful relationship between capital adequacy, <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio</b> and bank size with profitability. Profitability represented in this study by the return on assets and return on equity has a negative relationship with capital adequacy.

One aim of the present study was to find a relative effect of growth of demand for energy services due to changes in income, energy consumption per unit of demand due to technological development, changes in electricity price and household income on household electricity consumption in Latvia. The method applied included system dynamics modeling and data from a household survey regarding the relationship between electricity saving activities and the electricity <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio.</b> The results revealed that, in direct contrast to the expected, a potential reduction of the electricity consumption is rather insensitive to electricity price and electricity <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> and that the efficiency of technologies could be the main drivers for future electricity savings. The results suggest that support to advancement of technologies and faster replacement of inefficient ones rather than influencing the energy price could be effective energy policy measures.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the banks {{established}} in the Italian Mezzogiorno have reduced their <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratios</b> and improved their ability to screen customers, thus increasing their profitability. They have also widened the range of services they provide to customers. The spread between the cost of bank lending to firms in the South and North of Italy has narrowed substantially in recent years. Taking into account {{the differences in the}} size and industry composition of firms in the two areas, the spread is currently equal to 0. 90 percentage points (the lowest value for fifteen years). Since 1990 the growth of bank loans in the North has outpaced that in the South. However, this divergence is only apparent, since it is largely a reflection of the greater proportion of new bad loans in relation to total lending in the South. Since the mid- 1990 s in the South the ratio of outstanding loans to local firms to funds raised locally has increased from 75 percent to around 85 percent. The ratio is lower than average for the banks established in the South, while it is greater than 100 percent for banks established in the North. The lower value of the loans-to-deposits ratio in the South reflects both structural features of the Southern economy {{and the way in which}} bank loans are allocated geographically in the financial statistics. banche, Mezzogiorno, fusioni bancarie...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{switching costs}} in China’s banking market in three main aspects. First, my thesis examines {{a model that}} investigates the effect of switching costs in the Chinese loan market on banking profitability. In keeping with the extant empirical literature it reports {{a positive relationship between}} bank profitability and switching costs. Furthermore it reports the estimation of a systems model of switching costs determination and profitability determination. The main result is that bank size measured by total assets is positively related to switching costs, while the ratio of deposits to assets is negatively related. The study also finds that banks that have higher <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratios</b> {{have a negative impact on}} switching cost. Second, this thesis examines the drivers of firms switching from one bank relationship to another. The results show that the principal driver of a switching action is the credit needs of the firm and a mixture of firm and bank characteristics. The findings support the extant literature that less opaque firms are able to switch more readily than opaque firms. The results also suggest that banks that develop their fee income services are more effective in locking-in their borrowers. Finally, this thesis determines the factors that decisions of firms to keep single bank loan providers or multiple bank loan providers. The results show that large firms are more likely to switch from single to multiple lending relationships. This study also finds that medium size and small firms with high quality prefer a single borrowing relationship while larger and higher quality firms are more likely to be involved in a large number of banking relationships. Increasing market competition decreases the probability of single bank-firm relationship...|$|R

With the present global credit crunch, capital adequacy and the <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio</b> being critical for banks, the present study examines the relationship between these variables and profitability. Using the return on assets and the return on equity as proxies for bank profitability for the period 1998 to 2007, the study finds that bank profitability is positively related to the core capital ratio and the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. This implies that an increase in capital may raise expected earnings by reducing the expected costs of financial distress, including bankruptcy. The study also establishes that there exists negative relationship between the equity capital ratio and profitability. The study also finds out that Kenyan banks are not competitive enough globally in terms of their efficiency as measured by the <b>Cost-Income</b> <b>Ratio</b> (CIR). The study reveals that the CIR is inversely related to both bank profitability measures. The study also reveals that the CIRs of Kenyan banks are higher than those of developed countries. This means that Kenyan banks should strive to keep their CIR to a minimum level, if possible below the 50 % threshold for them to be more efficient so as to be globally competitive...|$|E

We find the changes in interest rates and income to be the major determinants of aggregate delinquency rate. In the second step, we adopt a stress testing approach to calculate the potential impact on banks’ position of any adverse changes in these determinants. These calculations suggest that a 1. 3 percentage point increase in mortgage interest rate leads to a 20 % decrease in a typical bank’s distance to default. Finally, {{we look at the}} cross-sectional differences to identify the most vulnerable banks.

The results seem to indicate that, in the 1999 - 2002 period, in which the banks considered were traded in Euro, the factor loading against the market factor and against the default spread may be systematically related to banks fundamental characteristics like asset quality indicators (especially reserves for bad loans over loans), to the composition of income (share of interest and commission revenue), and to a general indicator of banks efficiency like the <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} profitability using an unbalanced panel of 78 East Asian and 89 Latin American banks for the period 2003 - 2014. We regress profitability against bank-specific variables (capital adequacy, <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> liquidity ratio, loan loss reserve ratio, and bank size) and macroeconomic variables (gross domestic product, inflation and bank concentration). Our dynamic panel regression model suggests that bank profitability in East Asia is determined by more bank-specific variables than macroeconomic variables; the reverse, however, applies to Latin America. We contribute to current literature by: 1) using a more robust profitability measure (risk-adjusted returns); 2) employing both bank-specific and macroeconomic variables; 3) studying two large and fast-developing regions of East Asia and Latin America. Our findings enhance our theoretical and practical knowledge of bank-specific profitability determinants.

The fixed effects indicate that {{both internal and external}} factors are influential in determining the profitability of the banks. Specifically, the <b>cost–income</b> <b>ratio</b> and capital ratio negatively and significantly influence profitability. Measuring revenue diversification with the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), the results indicate that the more diversified the bank is, the more profitable it is.

With data from a survey of 3029 employees from 27 state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a hierarchical linear model (HLM) is used to identify the influencing factors of employee commitment to organizational culture at the enterprise level. An empirical study indicates that apart from the factors of employee satisfaction and demographic background, four contextual variables of enterprises, namely, comprehensive management, energy intensity, <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> and capacity-load ratio, also influence commitment to organizational culture levels. Results show that applying HLM can substantially improve the explanatory power of employee satisfaction factors on commitment to organizational culture using nested enterprise contextual variables. Although measurement scales and satisfaction models have been proposed over the years, only {{a few studies have}} addressed the particular nature inherent in Chinese SOEs. HLM, which accounts for the nested data structure and determines the effects of employee satisfaction factors on commitment to organizational culture without bias, is developed in this study.

40|$|The role {{of banks}} is {{integral}} and significant {{to the economic}} development and private initiative of any country. Therefore, we can read different and opposing studies in economic literature about various bank corporate governance regimes and issues. Given the renewed attention on the corporate governance in banks with the global financial crises, this paper investigates the relevance of board size, board composition and CEO qualities in the Macedonian banks and their performance. Thus, the following paragraphs will elaborate {{on the development of}} hypotheses to test whether good corporate governance structure can contribute towards higher banks performance measured by Return on assets (ROA), Return on equity (ROE), <b>Cost-Income</b> <b>ratio</b> and Capital adequacy ratio (CAR). We find that board size is only positively related to the bank’s profitability measures by ROA. Further, the research indicates negative association between board independence and ROA and ROE. Also, the results stress that banks in Macedonia which is managed by powerful CEOs that hold this position for a longer period are more profitable than those with CEOs serving their first four-years tenure. In addition, it is important to highlight that our research findings and insights is different and more important than some other studies, both practical and theoretical, as the primary object of study is commercial banks from insufficiently explored financial system and developing economy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the methodology of}} budget standards, then proposes adjustments {{to make it more}} suitable for analysis of housing affordability. The model’s usefulness is evaluated through application to two policy questions. The first is a comparison of the relative financial hardship faced by a range of target groups for social housing. Secondly, differences in the capacity of low-income renters to meet their housing and household costs are investigated across Queensland’s regions. Australia’s budget standards were developed by the Social Policy Research Centre (Saunders et al, 1998). They estimate the costs for selected family types to achieve a defined standard of living at a particular time and location, so that incomes can be compared with an explicit and transparent standard of living. As with the Henderson poverty line, before-housing analysis which assumes average regional housing costs is typically used to measure income sufficiency, but published research which compares incomes after actual housing costs has been limited to date. This approach to budget standards analysis is much more appropriate for understanding the impact of housing markets on low-income renters. Queensland also publishes a regional price index, so costs in the budgets have been adjusted to include regional relativities. One outcome {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that higher costs for goods and services in some regions do have a significant impact on housing affordability. Another key element of budget standards ’ flexibility is the estimation of costs for each family type, an area where traditional analysis of housing affordability as a <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio</b> is too simplistic. Comparison with measured financial stress confirms that budget standards estimates of need have a better fit with experience of hardship than ratio affordability. 1 The assistance of the Department of Family and Community Services in preparing the confidentialised Housing Dataset is gratefully acknowledged...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is a major}} global {{public health}} problem which affects poorest {{individuals}} the worst. A high proportion of patients incur 'catastrophic costs' which {{have been shown to}} result in severe financial hardship and adverse health outcomes. Data on catastrophic cost incidence is not routinely collected, and current definitions of this indicator involve several practical and conceptual barriers to doing so. We analysed data from TB programmes in India (Bangalore), Bangladesh and Tanzania to determine whether dissaving (the sale of assets or uptake of loans) is a useful indicator of financial hardship. METHODS: Data were obtained from prior studies of TB patient costs in Bangladesh (N[*]=[*] 96), Tanzania (N[*]=[*] 94) and Bangalore (N[*]=[*] 891). These data were analysed using logistic and linear multivariate regression to determine the association between costs (absolute and relative to income) and both the presence of dissaving and the amounts dissaved. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates such as age, sex and rural/urban location, we found a significant positive association between the occurrence of dissaving and total costs incurred in Tanzania and Bangalore. We further found that, for patients in Bangalore an increase in dissaving of 10 USD was associated with an increase in the <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 10 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). For low-income patients in Bangladesh, an increase in dissaving of 10 USD was associated with an increase in total costs of 7 USD (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Dissaving is potentially a convenient proxy for catastrophic costs that does not require usage of complex patient cost questionnaires. It also offers an informative indicator of financial hardship in its own right, and could therefore play an important role as an indicator to monitor and evaluate the impact of financial protection and service delivery interventions in reducing hardship and facilitating universal health coverage. Further research is required to understand the patterns and types of dissaving that have the strongest relationship with financial hardship and clinical outcomes in order to move toward evidence-based policy making...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the banking sector performance in Zimbabwe is motivated by the unique developments that typified the sector during the period 2009 - 2014 after emerging from an economic crisis. The Zimbabwean economy returned to stability and growth in 2009, after a decade long economic decline. Economic stability brought about growth in deposits, loans, assets, capitalization and profits during this period. The banking sector {{has been accused of}} excessive profiteering through overpricing their products, which culminated in the intervention by the authorities in the sector. The interest rates spread, fees and other charges were presumed to be high which motivated the need to understand whether the banking sector is efficient or inefficient given the high interest rate spreads between the deposit rates and lending rates. Furthermore the high interest rates have raised the question of whether banks were exploiting their market power to price their products highly or whether their prices were determined by the dictates of market forces. Continued profitability of the sector also called for an investigation into what was driving the persistence of profitability over time. The primary objective of this research was to measure the performance of the banking sector during the period 2009 - 2014. The study contributes to the empirical literature by measuring and assessing the drivers of banking sector competition, efficiency and profitability and applying them at much disaggregated levels. This study also contributes to the debate on the relationships among the performance measures of competition, profitability and efficiency. The study adopted a number of methods which contributes to the array of tools central banks can employ to measure bank performance. The study employed a number of methodologies to measure the competition, efficiency and profitability performance of the banking sector. Competition was estimated using the new empirical industrial organisation methods of Panza and Rose (1987) and the Lerner (1934) Index was used. Cost and revenue efficiency was estimated using the two step methods of Data Envelopment Analysis followed by the Tobit regression method. An assessment of the persistence and drivers of profitability was measured using the Generalised Method of Moments. This study shows that the banking sector was operating under monopolistic competition market structure. This implies that banks held some market power as a result of product differentiation due to unique features such as brands, image and advertising, among others. The study indicates that competition increased during the period 2009 - 2014. Market power/competition in the banking sector during the study period was driven by capital adequacy, non-performing loans, liquidity risk, <b>cost-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> economic growth and government policy on pricing of bank products. The study suggests that the banking sector experienced an average inefficiency level of approximately 35 per cent in relationship with the best performing institutions in the sample. As a result of stability experienced in the economy, the average revenue and cost efficiency increased between 2009 and 2014. The study further established that the discord around the implementation of the indigenisation and empowerment law, coupled with the government intervention in the banking sector had a negative impact on the banking sector efficiency. It also found that efficiency is determined by market power, capital adequacy, cost income ratio, economic growth, inflation, market share and profitability. The Granger Causality test between cost efficiency and market power suggests that causality is bidirectional. On the other hand granger causality between revenue efficiency and market power is unidirectional and positive, running from revenue efficiency to market power. The result implies that policy measures should bring a balance between increasing competition and improving the revenue efficiency. The study shows that the banking sector was profitable during the period 2009 to 2014. The profitability was a reflection of a stable macroeconomic environment, typified by low inflation levels, despite the crises during this period. It further reveals that the banking sector‟s profitability persisted over time, reflecting the regulatory structure of the sector. The study established that profitability was determined by market power, non-performing loans, liquidity risk, capital adequacy, bank size and cost efficiency. This implies profitability was driven by bank specific determinants. There are a number of policy implications derived from the study. Regulatory measures such as forced consolidations can lead to excessive market power by the banking institution; hence it should be moderated. Banks should enhance credit risk because NPLs has been dragging profits. Banks should take advantage of the various measures introduced, such as the setting up of the special purpose vehicle and credit reference bureau. The government should avoid tampering with market forces as this reduces competition, efficiency and profitability and put in place measures that grow the economy as it increases the efficiency and profitability of the banking sector...|$|E
