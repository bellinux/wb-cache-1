5000|$|By way of history, the Australian Government {{established}} the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 {{to develop a}} national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, Lionel Murphy, {{established the}} Australian Legal Aid Office. Murphy recognised {{the urgent need for}} legal aid in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: [...] "one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive legal aid arrangements throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that legal aid be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts." [...] (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>Commissions.</b> These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need. In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the Commonwealth Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>Commission</b> Act 1977 (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which legal aid would be provided by independent legal <b>aid</b> <b>commissions</b> to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>Commission</b> of Western Australia, followed in 1978 the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>Commission</b> of Victoria (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>Commission</b> of Tasmania. The cooperative arrangements that were established by the LAC Act provided for Commonwealth and state and territory legal aid funding agreements, which began in 1987.|$|R
