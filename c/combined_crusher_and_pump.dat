50|$|Polymetallic nodules have {{economically}} valuable metals such as Copper, Cobalt, Nickel and Manganese in {{them and}} are viewed as potential resources {{to take care of}} the depleting land resources and increasing demand of these metals. There are 380 million tons of nodules in the retained Indian Pioneer area. However development of deep subsea technology for mining these resources is a major challenge considering the ultra high pressure environment, very soft soils and other factors. NIOT has been working on a mining concept where a crawler based mining machine collects, <b>crushes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pumps</b> nodules to the mother ship using a positive displacement pump through a flexible riser system. It is expected that multiple mining machines will cover the mining field during large scale commercial mining operations. With this perspective, the integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} slow Wallerian degeneration mutation, whilst delaying axonal degeneration after optic nerve crush, does not protect retinal ganglion cell (RGC) bodies in adult rats. To test {{the effects of a}} combination approach protecting both axons and cell bodies we performed <b>combined</b> optic nerve <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> lens injury, which results in both enhanced RGC survival as well as axon regeneration past the lesion site in wildtype animals. Results As previously reported we found that the Wld S mutation does not protect RGC bodies after optic nerve crush alone. Surprisingly, we found that Wld S transgenic rats did not exhibit the enhanced RGC survival response after <b>combined</b> optic nerve <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> lens injury that was observed in wildtype rats. RGC axon regeneration past the optic nerve lesion site was, however, similar in Wld S and wildtypes. Furthermore, activation of retinal glia, previously shown to be associated with enhanced RGC survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> lens injury, was unaffected in Wld S transgenic rats. Conclusions RGC axon regeneration is similar between Wld S transgenic and wildtype rats, but Wld S transgenic rats do not exhibit enhanced RGC survival after <b>combined</b> optic nerve <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> lens injury suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of lens injury on RGC survival may be limited by the Wld S protein. </p...|$|R

After allowing the cement to dry, the pieces are sometimes acid washed to counteract the high pH of the materials, and then allowed to soak in clean water for one or more months.

40|$|We have {{undertaken}} noble gas analyses of four polycrystalline framesite diamonds from the Jwaneng kimberlite pipe, Botswana. These samples yielded complex, multiple noble gas components (crustal, atmospheric and in situ radiogenic/fissiogenic), which were successfully deconvoluted by <b>combining</b> vacuum <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> step-heating experiments and examining a full suite of noble gas isotope and elemental abundances. The most striking observation {{is the presence}} of crustal nucleogenic neon, released on graphitisation of the framesites. Neon of this composition can only have been produced in the crust and subsequently incorporated during formation of the framesites in the mantle. This may indicate that noble gases produced in the crust, such as nucleogenic neon and possibly xenon, and some radiogenic 4 He and 40 Ar and fissiogenic xenon, were introduced into the subcontinental mantle source during ancient subduction-related processes. If correct, then some parts of the mantle may contain significant quantities of crustal noble gases...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{incineration}} {{bottom ash}} fine fraction contains {{a significant amount}} of aluminium, but previous works have shown that current recovery options based on standard on-step Eddy Current Separation (ECS) have limited efficiency. In this paper, we evaluated the improvement in the efficiency of ECS by using an additional step of <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> sieving. The efficiency of metallic Al recovery was quantified by measuring hydrogen gas production. The ash samples were also tested for total aluminium content with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). As an alternative to material recovery, we also investigated the possibility to convert residual metallic Al into useful energy, promoting H 2 gas production by reacting metallic Al with water at high pH. The results show that the total aluminium concentration in the < 4 mm bottom ash fraction is on average 8 % of the weight of the dry ash, with less than 15 % of it being present in the metallic form. Of this latter, only 21 % can be potentially recovered with ECS <b>combined</b> with <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> sieving stages and subsequently recycled. For hydrogen production, using 10 M NaOH at 1 L/S ratio results in the release of 6 – 11 l of H 2 gas for each kilogram of fine dry ash, equivalent to an energy potential of 118 kJ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} demand to optimise yield and increase capacity of crushing plants. Research {{in this area}} {{has resulted in the}} development of numerous optimisation tools, and resent research has shown that the economic aspects of production have great influence on the optimisation results. The profitability of a product is influenced by several parameters, and control of all these parameters is necessary to use some sort of optimisation software. In this paper, we present a case study of a typical crushing plant, with the goal of reducing the number of crusher while keeping the plant capacity and quality. By reducing the number of crusher the plant will need less maintenance which will decrease the operating costs. The article presents a method to <b>combine</b> <b>crushing</b> plant simulation <b>and</b> optimisation with quality and economic considerations in order to successfully study alternative configurations of the plant...|$|R

40|$|Square {{honeycombs}} {{are effective}} as cores for all-metal sandwich plates {{in that they}} <b>combine</b> excellent <b>crushing</b> strength <b>and</b> energy absorption with good stiffness and strength in out-of-plane shear and in-plane stretch. In applications where sandwich plates must absorb significant energy in crushing under intense impulsive loads, dynamic effects {{play a significant role}} in the behaviour of the core. Three distinct dynamic effects can be identified: (i) inertial resistance, (ii) inertial stabilization of webs against buckling, and (iii) material strain-rate dependence. Each contributes to dynamic strengthening of the core. These effects are illustrated and quantified with the aid of detailed numerical calcula-tions for rates of deformation characteristic of shock loads in air and water. A continuum model for high rate deformation of square honeycomb cores is introduced that can be used to simulate core behaviour in large structural calculations when it is not feasible to mesh the detailed core geome-try. The performance of the continuum model is demonstrated for crushing deformations. Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The pharynx of Caenorhabditis elegans {{consists}} of a syncytium of radially orientated muscle cells that contract synchronously and rhythmically to ingest <b>and</b> <b>crush</b> bacteria <b>and</b> <b>pump</b> them into the intestine of the animal. The action potentials that support this activity are superficially similar to vertebrate cardiac action potentials in appearance with a long, calcium-dependent plateau phase. Although the pharyngeal muscle can generate action potentials {{in the absence of}} external calcium ions, action potentials are absent when sodium is removed from the extracellullar solution (Franks et al. 2002). Here we have used whole cell patch clamp recordings from the pharynx and show low voltage-activated inward currents that are present in zero external calcium and reduced in zero external sodium ions. Whilst the lack of effect of zero calcium when sodium ions are present is not surprising in view of the known permeability of voltage-gated calcium channels to sodium ions, the reduction in current in zero sodium when calcium ions are present is harder to explain in terms of a conventional voltage-gated calcium channel. Inward currents were also recorded from egl- 19 (n 582) which has a loss of function mutation in the pharyngeal L-type calcium channel and these were also markedly reduced in zero external sodium. Despite this apparent dependence on external sodium ions, the current was partially blocked by the divalent cations, cadmium, barium and nickel. Using single-channel recordings we identified a cation channel for which the open-time duration was increased by depolarisation. In inside-out patches, the single-channel conductance was highest in symmetrical sodium solution. Further studies are required to determine the contribution of these channels to the pharyngeal action potential...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 47 Many {{centrifugal}} pump vibration problems {{are due to}} synchronous phenomena such as vane-pass frequency energy and running speed energy. To address such problems, guidelines {{have been developed to}} assist with their identification and to evaluate their severity. However, nonsynchronous phenomenon such as recirculation, stage-stall, and shaft instabilities can also cause vibration problems. These types of problems are more difficult or diagnose, since the excitation mechanisms are less obvious. Discussed herein are field measurements and computer analysis that were done to analyze and solve supersynchronous shaft vibration problem on a two-stage horizontal centrifugal coke <b>crusher</b> <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> a vertical single-stage centrifugal water pump. These pumps were marginally stable at low discharge pressures, but were unstable at high discharge pressures. Field tests indicated that the shaft instability vibrations of both pumps could be removed by installing vanes on {{the back side of the}} impellers (?pumpout? vanes). Although the pumpout vanes were very effective in eliminating the destabilizing forces on these pumps, the exact effects of the pumpout vanes on the rotor instabilities are not clearly understood.

40|$|Abstract—A {{huge amount}} of surplus soil and muddy soil was {{produced}} from the construction earth works in Japan. To reuse these soils in the construction sites, the soil improvements by mixing with cement or lime were sometime adopted. Recently, the {{case in which the}} improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted was supposed. As the improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted, it was necessary to evaluate the strength of the improved soil. However, the strength of stabilized soil was decreased by repetition of excavation, refill and compaction processes. In this paper, the deterioration of strength of the lime-stabilized soil subjected to the repetition of <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction process was discussed. A series of unconfined compression tests were carried out to evaluate the deterioration of strength of the stabilized soil by repeating <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction processes. As a result, it is found that the strength was decreased by repetition of <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction processes from that without the <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction process.
