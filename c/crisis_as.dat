5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929, {{which resulted in a}} hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious <b>crisis,</b> <b>as</b> the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E
5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic <b>crisis</b> <b>as</b> a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro would better see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the <b>crisis.</b> <b>As</b> a result, investing there would become less risky and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E

Moving to Iceland, Booth details the banking practices that led to the collapse of the country's largest banks in the 2008 financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>as</b> well as the popular belief among Icelanders in the existence of Huldufólk (elves).|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} {{the high point of}} {{relations}} between Diệm and Washington, as in later years, the US government and members of the AFV became increasingly disillusioned with Diệm's failure to liberalize his government and enact changes to make South Vietnam more democratic.

In 1963, American support for Diệm collapsed during the Buddhist <b>crisis</b> <b>as</b> Washington concluded that Diệm was incapable of offering a solid alternative to the communists, and he was overthrown in a US-backed military coup and executed after being captured.|$|E

The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir <b>Crisis.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic, {{in order to keep the}} fleet closer to Germany.

5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding the state government or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a <b>crisis</b> <b>as</b> the state government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run the state government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do but watch.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1943, the German Wehrmacht faced a <b>crisis</b> <b>as</b> Soviet forces encircled and reduced the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad and {{expanded}} their Winter Campaign towards the Don River. On 2 February 1943 the Sixth Army's commanding officers surrendered, and an estimated 90,000 men were captured by the Red Army. Total German losses at the Battle of Stalingrad, excluding prisoners, were between 120,000 and 150,000. Throughout 1942 German casualties totaled around 1.9 million personnel, and by {{the start of}} 1943 the Wehrmacht was around 470,000 men below full strength on the Eastern Front. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht was equipped with around 3,300 tanks; by 23 January only 495 tanks, mostly of older types, remained operational along {{the entire length of the}} Soviet–German front. As the forces of the Don Front were destroying the German forces in Stalingrad, the Red Army's command (Stavka) ordered the Soviet forces to conduct a new offensive, which encompassed the entire southern wing of the Soviet–German front from Voronezh to Rostov.|$|E
5|$|Both Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German fleet. Irene frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht on cruises throughout Europe. In 1894, Irene was deployed to East Asian waters; Prinzess Wilhelm joined her the following year. Prinzess Wilhelm {{was one of}} three ships involved in the seizure of the naval base Kiaochou Bay in November 1897, led by Admiral Otto von Diederichs. Irene was in dock for engine maintenance at the time, and so she was not present during the operation. As a result of the seizure, the Cruiser Division was reorganized as the East Asia Squadron. Both ships were present in the Philippines {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish–American War in 1898. Diederichs hoped to use the <b>crisis</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity to seize another naval base in the region, though this was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder <b>crisis,</b> <b>as</b> they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E

40|$|How do crises shape policy possibilities? While some {{scholars}} cast <b>crises</b> <b>as</b> material shocks, this paper offers a Post Keynesian or constructivist theory of <b>crises</b> <b>as</b> events that agents interpret.

Whereas Galbraithian interpretations of the former stressed abuses of market power and legitimated wage-price guideposts, classical interpretations of the latter stressed regulatory excesses and delayed the imposition of price caps. This paper concludes {{that the absence of}} wage-price guidelines compelled the post- 1970 s use of austerity to limit inflation, explaining reduced U.

He diagnoses that the international community's inadequate response to the 1997 crisis {{is one of the}} reasons for the current <b>crises,</b> <b>as</b> it prompted emerging nations to focus excessively on building up foreign reserves, thus contributing to global imbalances.|$|R
