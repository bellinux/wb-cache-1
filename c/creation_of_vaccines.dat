40|$|The Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI) {{was founded}} in 1990 / 91 {{as a means to}} {{revolutionize}} the way that vaccines were developed for the South. The system for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> was a dis-articulated one in which basic research, product development and delivery were handled by different, often insufficiently linked groups. The public sector was deeply involved in research and delivery but not the vital product development area. That area was left to the private sector which was increasingly driven by the needs to maximize profits. Potential vaccines for diseases found in the South, where a hard currency market was limited, were often left undeveloped. The CVI was designed to change that situation. The CVI hoped to exploit the discoveries of biotechnology and produce not only new and improved vaccines, but ultimately to work towards a single multi-antigen vaccine given near birth that would immunize children for life.

Electronic submission and peer-review, {{along with the}} immediate posting of accepted papers online, assure a rapid turnaround. Call for PapersThe field of vaccines is {{more than two hundred}} years old. Nevertheless, new technical developments and the terrific success record of vaccines have led to a recent explosion of interest in the field. Vaccines {{are one of the most}} highly cost-effective modalities in health-care. It has been estimated that vaccination is responsible for more than 10 years of the total increase in the average human lifespan worldwide during the 20 th century, an increase second in impact only to that of clean water. There are over 10 million deaths annually worldwide, as well as considerable morbidity, mostly among young children, that are attributable to infectious diseases. Many of these deaths could be prevented by increased use of existing vaccines, while the great majority would be preventable by the development and wide-scale use of effective new vaccines. The increasingly broad array of new technologies is based upon breakthrough discoveries in the fields of immunology, biochemistry, molecular biology and related areas.

40|$|Influenza is a {{seasonal}} infectious disease widespread across the globe. In Russia {{the share of}} influenza and other acute respiratory viral infections account for up to 90 % of all infectious diseases. Scientific and reasonable method of influenza prevention is vaccination. However, traditional current influenza vaccines can’t induce protection against various virus strains that differ substantially {{in terms of their}} antigenic structure, and thus require periodic updates to its immunogenic components. In addition, there is the risk of a pandemic caused by an entirely new antigen in relation to variants of influenza virus A. Attempts to improve on traditional approaches to vaccination have focused primarily on improving production technologies and to increase immunogenicity of vaccines. Therefore, the urgent task is the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> able to induce immune response a broad spectrum against different influenza virus strains and human strains of avian influenza, also can cause disease in humans. Protective effect of universal vaccine should be the induction of integrated immune response, based on the formulation of cross-reactive antibodies and T cells. The development of such universal vaccine could remove the need for periodical strain composition update of existing vaccines and, accor dingly, will be able to give the vaccine manufacturer itself, production planning regardless of epidemic seasons. Currently, the most widely studied antigens as key components of flu vaccines are proteins M 2 and NP as well as the hemagglutinin of influenza virus.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that girls aged 11 - 12 receive the HPV vaccine. At present, eighteen states have already decided or are considering to make HPV vaccination mandatory for adolescent girls. As the HPV vaccine becomes mandatory, the demand for the vaccine is expected to rise dramatically. This increase in demand could make our nation vulnerable to interruptions in HPV vaccine production. If an interruption occurs, many adolescent girls and women could be at an unnecessary risk of acquiring HPV if they were to miss routine HPV immunizations. One major factor in the prevention <b>of</b> HPV <b>vaccine</b> shortages is the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> stockpiles by the CDC. In this paper, mathematical models are used to determine and analyze stockpile levels sufficient to minimize the effects of a production interruption for the HPV vaccine.

40|$|Abstract Background The European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), one of {{the most}} {{extensively}} cultured species in European aquaculture productions, is, along with the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), a prospective model species for the Perciformes which includes several other commercially important species. Massive mortalities may be caused by bacterial or viral infections in intensive aquaculture production. Revealing transcripts involved in immune response and studying their relative expression enhances the understanding of the immune response mechanism and consequently also the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The analysis of expressed sequence tags (EST) is an efficient and easy approach for gene discovery, comparative genomics and for examining gene expression in specific tissues in a qualitative and quantitative way. Results Here we describe the construction, analysis and comparison of a total of ten cDNA libraries, six from different tissues infected with V. anguillarum (liver, spleen, head kidney, gill, peritoneal exudates and intestine) and four cDNA libraries from different tissues infected with Nodavirus (liver, spleen, head kidney and brain). In total 9605 sequences representing 3075 (32 %) unique sequences (set of sequences obtained after clustering) were obtained and analysed. Among the sequences several immune-related proteins were identified {{for the first time in}} the order of Perciformes as well as in Teleostei. Conclusion The present study provides new information to the Gene Index of seabass. It gives a unigene set that will make a significant contribution to functional genomic studies and to studies of differential gene expression in relation to the immune system. In addition some of the potentially interesting genes identified by in silico analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR are putative biomarkers for bacterial and viral infections in fish. </p...|$|E

40|$|A central {{obstacle}} {{to the design of}} a global HIV- 1 vaccine is virus diversity. Pathogen diversity is not unique to HIV- 1, and has been successfully conquered in other fields by the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> cocktails. Here we describe the testing of an HIV- 1 envelope cocktail vaccine. Six macaques received the vaccine, delivered by successive immunizations with recombinant DNA, recombinant vaccinia virus and recombinant envelope proteins. Following vaccination, animals developed a diversity of anti-envelope antibody binding and neutralizing activities toward proteins and viruses that were not represented by sequence in the vaccine. T-cells were also elicited, as measured by gamma-interferon production assays with envelope-derived peptide pools. Vaccinated and control animals were then challenged with the heterologous pathogenic SHIV, 89. 6 P. Vaccinated monkeys experienced significantly lower virus titers and better maintenance of CD 4 + T-cells than unvaccinated controls. The B- and T-cell immune responses were far superior post-challenge in the vaccinated group. Four of six vaccinated animals and only one of six control animals survived a 44 -week observation period post-challenge.

40|$|Emerging {{data suggest}} that a {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte response against a diversity of epitopes confers greater protection against a human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus infection than does a more focused response. To facilitate the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> strategies that will generate cellular immune responses with the greatest breadth, {{it will be important}} to understand the mechanisms employed by the immune response to regulate the relative magnitudes of dominant and nondominant epitope-specific cellular immune responses. In this study, we generated dominant Gag p 11 C- and subdominant Env p 41 A-specific CD 8 + T-lymphocyte responses in Mamu-A* 01 + rhesus monkeys through vaccination with plasmid DNA and recombinant adenovirus encoding simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) proteins. Infection of vaccinated Mamu-A* 01 + rhesus monkeys with a SHIV Gag Δp 11 C mutant virus generated a significantly increased expansion of the Env p 41 A-specific CD 8 + T-lymphocyte response in the absence of secondary Gag p 11 C-specific CD 8 + T-lymphocyte responses. These results indicate that the presence of the Gag p 11 C-specific CD 8 + T-lymphocyte response following virus challenge may exert suppressive effects on primed Env p 41 A-specific CD 8 + T-lymphocyte responses. These findings suggest that immunodomination exerted by dominant responses during SHIV infection may diminish the breadth of recall responses primed during vaccination...|$|R
