40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{previous research}} in corporate social reporting (CSR) {{by using a}} taxonomy of five distinct rhetorical strategies to examine any differences in term of type of ethical categories and to identify moral attitudes towards different societal activities between Shari’ah compliant company Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB) and Non-Shari’ah compliant company Malayan Banking Berhad (Maybank). The data is analyzed using content analysis. The findings revealed that there are different rhetoric applied in both types of companies such as Agency (profit), Benefit (collective welfare), Compliance (law and <b>contracts),</b> <b>Duty</b> and Ethos (virtue). In term of moral attitudes, both types of companies disclosed relatively similar behaviour and commitment towards CSR. This research {{is the first of}} its kind to be conducted in Malaysia by using this new approach and will contribute new insights to existing CSR literatures in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|In many {{countries}} (e. g. Japan, China) {{it has been}} proved that a key-driven factor in increasing their economical development consists on employeesâ€™ attitude toward work. Based on the assumption, the main objective {{of this article is}} to compound a descriptive image on drivers and barriers on work ethic in Romania, which illustrate the most frequent ethical issues in firm-employee relation. In this respect, the sense which I attributed to the term â€œwork ethicsâ€ refers to specific attributes of relationship between two parts: employee and firm and in the second paper I will use this term based on Weberâ€™s definition as a belief in the moral value of the work. The empirical evidences presented here are the results of a research based on an online survey which I applied to managers and/or persons in leading position in Romanian small and medium enterprises. Using this methodological instrument, I collect responses from 828 companies from 41 different Romanian counties land. The resultants indicates that the main source of the unethical practices is based upon a double phenomenon: employees fail to comply with their labor <b>contract</b> <b>duties</b> and management administration restricts employeesâ€™ rights to work (applying discriminatory practices) and rights to a fair wage...|$|R

50|$|An illusory promise, or {{one which}} the {{promisor}} actually has {{no obligation to}} keep, does not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible. Accordingly, courts will often read implied-in-fact or implied-in-law terms into the <b>contract,</b> placing <b>duties</b> on the promisor. For instance, if a promisor promises to give away {{a third of his}} earnings for the year and earns nothing, he has no actual obligation to do anything.|$|R

40|$|When {{a client}} asks his lawyer what his duties are under a {{particular}} contract, normally the lawyer’s first response is “show me the contract. ” Does the contract {{provide all the}} <b>contract</b> <b>duties</b> in its expressed form? Definitely not. By now everyone acknowledges that, to some extent, all contracts have some gaps. Even the most carefully drafted document rests on volumes of assumptions that cannot be explicitly expressed. 1 The inevitability of gaps reflects both our “relative ignorance of fact” and “our relative indeterminacy of aim. ” Generally speaking, there are three types of gaps: first, the parties to a contract have not agreed upon a term; second, the parties have agreed upon a term, but the term itself is so vague {{that it is impossible}} to ascertain its meaning; and third, the parties have agreed to agree upon a term sometime after contract formation, but then never reach an agreement on that point. A remarkable trend in modern contract law is the relaxation of the requirement of certainty of terms. Modern legislation and courts are willing to enforce contracts even where many terms are missing, including such seemingly essential terms as time of delivery and price. But once the courts relax the certainty requirement, they themselves must find a way to fill the gaps in the binding arrangements...|$|R

50|$|Some contracts, {{known as}} {{executory}} contracts, may be rejected if canceling {{them would be}} financially favorable to {{the company and its}} creditors. Such contracts may include labor union contracts, supply or operating contracts (with both vendors and customers), and real estate leases. The standard feature of executory contracts is that each party to the <b>contract</b> has <b>duties</b> remaining under the contract. In the event of a rejection, the remaining parties to the contract become unsecured creditors of the debtor. For example, in some districts a contract for deed is an executory contract, while in others it is not.|$|R
30|$|The {{credit risk}} {{has been the}} most {{important}} management issue to banks. The quality of credit risk management, good or bad, matters a lot to banks which absorb the financial risks in exchange of benefits as their essence of business. The credit risk is like as follows: the borrower or the business counterparties are unable to fulfill the <b>duty</b> of their <b>contracts</b> out of the deterioration and other factors from the entrepreneurs (such as entanglement between firms); therefore this causes the risk of agreement violation and the loss of money. Generally, from different objects and behaviors, the credit risk could be further divided into two types: (1) lending risk, also called, issuer risk. This type of risk is duo to the violation of agreement when borrowers or bond issuers do not repay their debts or their credits get deteriorated, causing the money loss. Lending risk or issuer risk are often correlated to borrowers and bond issuers’ debt credit situations, and correlated to the risk sensitiveness degree of the financial products. (2) The second credit risk is counterparty risk; it could be further divided into two risks: settlement risk and pre-settlement risk. Settlement risk is the risk that counterparties do not fulfill their <b>contract</b> <b>duties</b> in the due settlement time and cause the loss of the equality principal to the bank. Pre-settlement risk is the risk that counterparties violate the agreement before the final settlement day and cause the risk of contract violation to the bank.|$|R
40|$|This article {{advances}} {{the premise}} that the hybrid contract-property model of leases may be appropriate to provide flexible choices for many areas of landlord-tenant law and, perhaps, may be suitable as a general model, but that it has failed as applied {{to the question of the}} tenant 2 ̆ 7 s remedies for breach of the warranty of habitability. As applied to remedies, the contract-property hybrid is a false dichotomy, or perhaps more accurately, the wrong dichotomy. The proper analysis of tenant remedies when the landlord breaches the habitability duty requires that a line be drawn between the tort <b>duties</b> and the <b>contract</b> <b>duties</b> that the landlord owes to the tenant. 2 ̆ 70 That line should be based upon whether the particular habitability duty in question is waivable by the tenant. Such differentiation of tort and contract elements of habitability clarifies remedies by focusing the inquiry on what type of interest is to be protected: a tenant 2 ̆ 7 s expectation of habitable premises secured by contract, or a right to habitable premises imposed as a matter of public policy and protected under tort principles. Recognition of a tort action for the second situation permits the fashioning of damage rules that neither overcompensate nor undercompensate for the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s injury. One principal benefit of the use of tort remedies lies in the analysis of non-economic damages-when, for example, the tenant claims mental distress stemming from a habitability failure...|$|R
