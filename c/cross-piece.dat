Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words also {{states that}} the primary meaning of stauros was an upright pale or stake on which malefactors were nailed for execution. Vine said {{the shape of the}} ecclesiastical form of two-beamed cross had its origin in ancient Chaldea, and was used as the symbol of the god Tammuz (taking on the shape of the mystic Tau, the initial of his name) in Chaldea and nearby lands, {{including}} Egypt. He said third century churches, which by then had departed from certain doctrines of the Christian faith, accepted pagans into the faith in order to increase their prestige and allowed them to retain their pagan signs and symbols. [...] "Hence the Tau or T, in its most frequent form, with the <b>cross-piece</b> lowered, was adopted to stand for the 'cross' of Christ." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{times the}} gibbet {{was only one}} {{vertical}} stake, called in Latin crux simplex. This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a <b>cross-piece</b> attached either at the top to give {{the shape of a}} T (crux commissa) or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (crux immissa). Jehovah's Witnesses argue that Jesus was crucified on a crux simplex, and that the crux immissa was an invention of Emperor Constantine. [...] Other forms were {{in the shape of the}} letters X and Y. Apparently the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).

I had {{beforehand}} drilled several holes in the shelves of cupboards, so as to accustom myself to use the auger, and it did not take me many minutes before it came through on the other side. The corks were of two sizes; one fitted tightly into the hole, the other could be drawn in or out with very little difficulty. I had gone out one day and bought some tubes of paint of the colors that I thought would match the graining of the door frame. I also bought a corkscrew that was about an inch and a half shorter than the depth of the hole. It was meant to be used by a <b>cross-piece</b> that went through a hole at the top. I had got this <b>cross-piece</b> out with some trouble, and tied a short loop of string through the hole it had gone through. I put the corkscrew into one of the smaller corks and pushed it through until it was level with the frame on the sitting-room side, and found that by aid of the loop of string I could draw it out easily. Then I put one of the larger corks in at the bedroom side of the hole and pushed it in until it was level with that side. Then I painted the ends of the corks to resemble the graining, and when it was done they could hardly be noticed a couple of feet away.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} Kari grew perplexed at this patient defence of mine, and never a blow struck back. At least he {{withdraw}} a little, then came {{for me with}} a rush, holding his sword high above his head {{with the purpose of}} striking me above that guard, or so I supposed. Then, of a sudden, I knew what to do. Wheeling Wave-Flame with all my strength in both hands, I smote, not at Kari but at the ivory handle of his sword. The keen and ancient steel that might well have been some of that which, as legend told, was forged by the dwarfs in Norseland, fell upon the ivory between his hand-grip and the <b>cross-piece</b> and shore through it as I had hoped that it would do, so that the blade of Kari's sword, severed just above the hilt, fell to the ground and the hilt itself was jarred from his hand.|$|E
60|$|What {{follows is}} worth consideration. The forward engine {{had no more}} work to do. Its {{released}} piston-rod, therefore, drove up fiercely, with nothing to check it, and started most of the nuts of the cylinder-cover. It came down again, {{the full weight of}} the steam behind it, and the foot of the disconnected connecting-rod, useless as the leg of a man with a sprained ankle, flung out to the right and struck the starboard, or right-hand, cast-iron supporting-column of the forward engine, cracking it clean through about six inches above the base, and wedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the ship's side. There the connecting-rod jammed. Meantime, the after-engine, being as yet unembarrassed, went on with its work, and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of the forward engine, which smote the already jammed connecting-rod, bending it and therewith the piston-rod cross-head- the big <b>cross-piece</b> that slides up and down so smoothly.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} so-called ultrasonic quasi-Rayleigh waves to detect surface defects of mechanical constructions, namely plate structures. The application of quasi-Rayleigh waves allows {{the extension of the}} scope of detection using conventional ultrasonic methods that are based on bulk waves. This extension means larger distances as well as higher sensitivity of the detection of surface defects such as fatigue or corrosion cracks. An advantage of this method is the transfer of wave energy from one side of a plate to another, which helps to overcome one-sided obstacles (such as <b>cross-pieces,</b> reinforcement elements). The article describes characteristic properties of quasi-Rayleigh waves that are important for the proper (in terms of frequency in particular) design of the excitation of waves towards the structure. FEM simulation results then provide information regarding the sensitivity of the wave response to the presence and sizes of surface defects (perpendicular slots) in an isotropic material with the properties of steel. The theoretical knowledge is set against experimental measurements obtained {{with the use of a}} steel plate with <b>cross-pieces</b> welded to it...|$|R
60|$|The {{bottom of}} the pole has an iron ring, and a hole in which four-cornered borers of {{hardened}} iron can be fitted. The barrel to be bored is buried upright in the ground, the borer is inserted into it, {{the top of the}} stick or vertical shaft is held by a <b>cross-piece</b> of bamboo with a hole in it, and the basket is filled with stones to get the required weight. Two boys turn the bamboo round. The barrels are made in pieces of about eighteen inches long, which are first bored small, and then welded together upon a straight iron rod. The whole barrel is then worked with borers of gradually increasing size, and in three days the boring is finished. The whole matter was explained in such a straightforward manner that I have no doubt the process described to me was that actually used; although, when examining one of the handsome, well-finished, and serviceable guns, {{it was very hard to}} realize the fact that they had been made from first to last with tools hardly sufficient for an English blacksmith to make a horseshoe.|$|E
60|$|As the Irishman {{was nothing}} loth, {{all three were}} soon in the court, whence Mike led {{the way through the}} gate, round {{to the point where the}} stockade came near the cliffs, on the eastern side of the buildings. This was the spot where the path that led down to the spring swept along the defences, and was on the very route by which the captain {{contemplated}} retreating, as well as on that by which Maud had entered the Hut, the night of the invasion. At a convenient place, a palisade had been sawed off, so low in the ground that the sods, which had been cut and were moveable, concealed the injury, while the heads of the pins that ought to have bound the timber to the <b>cross-piece,</b> were in their holes, leaving everything apparently secure. On removing the sods, and pushing the timber aside, the captain ascertained that a man might easily pass without the stockade. As this corner was the most retired within the works, there was no longer any doubt that the hole had been used by all the deserters, including the women and children. In what manner it became known to Nick, however, still remained matter of conjecture.|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} rush {{the water had}} almost filled the level where it occurred, and, {{sweeping}} onward about eight fathoms to a winze, plunged down and partly over it. The greater part, however, {{went down to the}} eighty-five fathom level. East of this a man named Anguin, with his two sons, William and James--youths of about twenty years of age--were at work. They heard the roar of the approaching torrent, and the father and younger son James rushed towards the winze, intending to ascend the ladder. Before they reached it the flood was pouring down with deafening noise. The least harmful part of the cataract was the water, for the current now carried along with it stones, pieces of timber, and rubbish. To encounter all this might have caused the stoutest hearts to quail, but miners can never calculate the probable extent of an inundation. They might, indeed, by remaining in the roof of the level, escape; but, on the other hand, if the flood should be great enough to fill the place, they would certainly be drowned. Father and son, therefore, preferred to make a desperate effort to save their lives. They dashed into the flood and made a grasp at the ladder, but before their hands touched the first round they were beaten down and swept away dead corpses. William, on the other hand, climbed to a <b>cross-piece</b> of timber, where he remained until the water abated, which it did in a very short time, for events of this kind are for the most part awfully sudden and brief as well as fatal. Then, descending, he groped his way in the dark over the very spot where his father and brother lay dead--fearfully mutilated and covered with rubbish--and escaped up the shaft.|$|E
50|$|The Manuel Primary was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} built around an open, vertical, tapered girder with a horizontal upper member {{and a lower}} one shaped at the front into a shallow keel. The girder was strengthened {{with a series of}} vertical and diagonal <b>cross-pieces.</b> The keel projected forward of the foremost vertical member and carried the pilot's seat on its upper edge. The thick-profile wing was attached to {{the upper part of the}} girder and was straight edged with constant chord apart from the angled tips of the ailerons. Extensions of two of the forward girder <b>cross-pieces</b> formed a triangular structure over the wing which acted as a king post for a pair of landing wires. Flying wires from the keel and the upper member about half way to the rear of the girder carried the lifting loads on the wing. There were also bracing wires from wing to the rear of the aircraft to restrain horizontal bending of the girder. The rectangular tailplane was likewise fixed to the top of the girder and carried elevators with a cut-out in which the all-moving rectangular rudder, which extended to the lower girder, could operate.|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} (October 12th), my men {{set to work}} making anchors and oars. The native Malay anchor is ingeniously {{constructed}} {{of a piece of}} tough forked timber, the fluke being strengthened by twisted rattans binding it to the stem, while the <b>cross-piece</b> is formed of a long flat stone, secured in the same manner. These anchors when well made, hold exceedingly arm, and, owing to the expense of iron, are still almost universally used on board the smaller praus. In the afternoon the head men arrived, and promised me as many rowers as I could put on the prau, and also brought me a few eggs and a little rice, which were very acceptable. On the 14th there was a north wind all day, which would have been invaluable to us a few days earlier, but which was now only tantalizing. On the 16th, all being ready, we started at daybreak with two new anchors and ten rowers, who understood their work. By evening we had come more than half-way to the point, and anchored for the night in a small bay. At three the next morning I ordered the anchor up, but the rattan cable parted close to the bottom, having been chafed by rocks, and we then lost our third anchor on this unfortunate voyage. The day was calm, and by noon we passed the southern point of Gilolo, which had delayed us eleven days, whereas the whole voyage during this monsoon should not have occupied more than half that time. Having got round the point our course was exactly in the opposite direction to what it had been, and now, as usual, the wind changed accordingly, coming from the north and north-west,--so that we still had to row every mile up to the village of Gani, which we did not reach till the evening of the 18th. A Bugis trader who was residing there, and the Senaji, or chief, were very kind; the former assisting me with a spare anchor and a cable, and making me a present of some vegetables, and the latter baking fresh sago cakes for my men; and giving rue a couple of fowls, a bottle of oil, and some pumpkins. As the weather was still very uncertain, I got four extra men to accompany me to Ternate, for which place we started on the afternoon of the 20th.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{profitable}} visits were rare. For {{days the}} two pioneers {{of trade and}} progress would look on their empty courtyard in the vibrating brilliance of vertical sunshine. Below the high bank, the silent river flowed on glittering and steady. On the sands {{in the middle of}} the stream, hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side. And stretching away in all directions, surrounding the insignificant cleared spot of the trading post, immense forests, hiding fateful complications of fantastic life, lay in the eloquent silence of mute greatness. The two men understood nothing, cared for nothing but for the passage of days that separated them from the steamer's return. Their predecessor had left some torn books. They took up these wrecks of novels, and, as they had never read anything of the kind before, they were surprised and amused. Then during long days there were interminable and silly discussions about plots and personages. In the centre of Africa they made acquaintance of Richelieu and of d'Artagnan, of Hawk's Eye and of Father Goriot, and of many other people. All these imaginary personages became subjects for gossip as if they had been living friends. They discounted their virtues, suspected their motives, decried their successes; were scandalized at their duplicity or were doubtful about their courage. The accounts of crimes filled them with indignation, while tender or pathetic passages moved them deeply. Carlier cleared his throat and said in a soldierly voice, [...] "What nonsense!" [...] Kayerts, his round eyes suffused with tears, his fat cheeks quivering, rubbed his bald head, and declared. [...] "This is a splendid book. I had no idea there were such clever fellows in the world." [...] They also found some old copies of a home paper. That print discussed what it was pleased to call [...] "Our Colonial Expansion" [...] in high-flown language. It spoke much of the rights and duties of civilization, of the sacredness of the civilizing work, and extolled the merits of those who went about bringing light, and faith and commerce to the dark places of the earth. Carlier and Kayerts read, wondered, and began to think better of themselves. Carlier said one evening, waving his hand about, [...] "In a hundred years, there will be perhaps a town here. Quays, and warehouses, and barracks, and--and--billiard-rooms. Civilization, my boy, and virtue--and all. And then, chaps will read that two good fellows, Kayerts and Carlier, were the first civilized men to live in this very spot!" [...] Kayerts nodded, [...] "Yes, it is a consolation to think of that." [...] They seemed to forget their dead predecessor; but, early one day, Carlier went out and replanted the cross firmly. [...] "It used to make me squint whenever I walked that way," [...] he explained to Kayerts over the morning coffee. [...] "It made me squint, leaning over so much. So I just planted it upright. And solid, I promise you! I suspended myself with both hands to the <b>cross-piece.</b> Not a move. Oh, I did that properly." ...|$|E
