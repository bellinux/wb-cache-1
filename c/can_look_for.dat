5|$|In Las Vegas Rachel {{falls in}} {{with a group of}} skaters who live {{together}} and play in a band, after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. Mr. Will finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the man on the tape, who Rachel thinks is the father of her child. When Clyde and Rachel break into his parents' house looking for food and money, Clyde's father calls the police and Mr. Will is arrested while Rachel flees. Remembering one of her mother's bedtime stories, she impulsively follows a red Mustang and discovers that its owner, Tim, is the man who recorded the tape, and is, in fact, her biological father.|$|E

25|$|Like {{theoretical}} astrophysics, theoretical X-ray astronomy uses a {{wide variety}} of tools which include analytical models to approximate the behavior of a possible X-ray source and computational numerical simulations to approximate the observational data.

Observers <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognized}} competitions, {{all players}} {{are required to}} record all the moves of both players in order to resolve disputes about whether a player has made an illegal move and what the position should now be. In addition, {{if there is a}} time limit rule that requires each player to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, as there is in most serious competition, an accurate count of the moves must be kept. All chess coaches strongly recommend the recording of one's games so that one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> improvements in one's play. The algebraic and descriptive notations are also used in books about chess.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the tracks on Otis Blue are cover versions, including three by Sam Cooke who had been shot dead the previous December. The album opens with the [...] "mournfully harried" [...] "Ole Man Trouble". For Claudrena N. Harold of PopMatters, the song {{is one of his}} most phantasmagoric tunes. The lyrics deal with a man, who is [...] "unable to escape the brutal realities of the blues", and has been compared with Paul Robeson's [...] "Ole Man River". [...] "Respect" [...] was inspired by a quote of drummer Al Jackson, Jr., who allegedly said to Redding after a tour, [...] "What are you griping about? You're on the road all the time.

500|$|According to the drummer, Jackson, Redding wrote [...] "Respect", after a {{conversation}} they had {{during a break}} in the recording session, in which he told Redding: [...] "You're on the road all the time. All you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> is a little respect when you come home." [...] An alternative story is told by Redding's friend and road manager, Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Sims, who states that the song [...] "came from a group I was singing with", and that even though Redding rewrote it, [...] "a lot of the lyric was still there"; Sims adds: [...] "He told me I would get a credit, but I never did". [...] Sims also states that he sang the backing chorus of [...] "Hey hey hey". The song used for the fifth track, [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long", had been previously recorded in mono with Booker T. Jones on piano and released as a single in April 1965, becoming a number-two hit on Billboards R chart; it was rerecorded in stereo for the album.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; By bell hooks; Mother to Mother", Nicole Abraham criticizes hooks's {{unconventional}} format rationalization. Abraham suggests that, if her rationalization for {{not providing}} footnotes and bibliographic information in her writing {{is that it}} will help her reach a broader (presumably a less academic) audience, hooks either assumes the average person has [...] "no real interest or knowledge about who really wrote what ideas and where we <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> more thoughts on similar subjects" [...] or [...] "she mean that we are lazy readers who have not the sophistication to grapple with the complications of an endnote".|$|E

2500|$|Naturalized from Latin into English (a loanword), caries in its English form {{originated}} as a mass noun {{that means}} [...] "rottenness", that is, [...] "decay". When used in that sense, it takes singular verb inflections (just {{like the word}} decay does). Thus caries was not traditionally a plural word synonymous with holes or cavities; that is, {{it was not the}} plural form of any singular form cary meaning hole or cavity. Nonetheless, the idea that it is such a plural is a reanalysis that naturally occurs to most English speakers, and the reanalyzed sense is common enough to be entered in various dictionaries and to exist in respectable usage. It still shows a hint of its reanalyzed origins in that it remains idiomatically limited to a plurale tantum sense—that is, like scissors or glasses, one speaks of plural caries obligately in the plural—not of one scissor, glass, or cary. (This is why one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a singular count-noun form of dental cary in any of a dozen major medical and general dictionaries and not find it listed.) Many still use it in the traditional sense (mass, singular), which is why they speak of carious lesions rather than just caries when they intend the plural count sense.|$|E
2500|$|Mill {{argues that}} if people who are [...] "competently acquainted" [...] with two pleasures show a decided {{preference}} for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and [...] "would not resign it for any quantity of the other", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these [...] "competent judges" [...] will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, {{the judgment of the}} majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that [...] "many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher." [...] Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for {{there is no other way}} of measuring [...] "the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations." [...] "It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>for,</b> as the world is constitute, is imperfect." ...|$|E
