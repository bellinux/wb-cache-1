40|$|We {{design an}} {{arbitrary}} high-order accurate nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximation for the nonlinear two dimensional shallow water equations with non-constant, possibly discontinuous, bathymetry on unstructured, possibly curved, quadrilateral meshes. The scheme {{is derived from}} an equivalent flux differencing formulation of the split form of the equations. We prove that this discretisation exactly preserves the local mass and momentum. Furthermore, combined with a special numerical interface flux function, the method exactly preserves the mathematical entropy, which is the total energy for the shallow water equations. By adding a specific form of interface dissipation to the baseline entropy conserving scheme we create a provably entropy stable scheme. That is, the numerical scheme discretely satisfies the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, with a particular discretisation of the bathymetry source term we prove that the numerical approximation is well-balanced. We provide numerical examples that verify the theoretical findings and furthermore provide an application of the scheme for a partial break of a <b>curved</b> <b>dam</b> test problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Scarcity {{of water}} {{resources}} and huge costs of establishing new hydraulic installations necessitate optimal exploitation from existing reservoirs. Sustainable management and efficient exploitation from existing finite water resources are important factors in water resource management, particularly in the periods of water insufficiency and in dry regions, and on account of competitive allocations {{in the view of}} exploitation management. This study aims to minimize reservoir water release from a determined rate of demand. A numerical model for water optimal exploitation has been developed using GAMS introduced by the World Bank and applied to the case of Meijaran dam, northern Iran. The results indicate that this model can optimize the function of reservoir exploitation while required water for lower parts of the region will be supplied. Further, allocating optimal water from reservoir, the optimal rate of water allocated to any group of the users were specified to increase benefits in <b>curve</b> <b>dam</b> exploitation.

40|$|Upstream {{tailings}} dams {{may experience}} slope stability problems when {{the rate of}} raising is too fast. Tailings consolidate slowly due to low hydraulic conductivity. The excess pore pressures can build up due to accelerated rate of raising. The cumulative increase in excess pore pressures due to successive raisings can endanger slope stability of a tailings dam. The stability of a tailings dam {{is closely related to}} the consolidation process. The consolidation process and associated stability of an upstream tailings dam during staged construction was modelled with the finite element program PLAXIS. The analysis indicated that the stability of the dam reduced during raising due to increase of excess pore pressures. The safety of the dam was improved by adding rockfill banks on the downstream side. The volume of the rockfill banks was minimized with an optimization technique. This technique involves (i) construction of a rockfill bank on the downstream side when the factor of safety is less than a permissible limit, (ii) utilization of a minimum volume of the rockfill that is necessary to stabilize the slope. This technique can be practicable when the rate of raising is moderate, and partial consolidation occurs between consecutive raisings. Numerical analysis was also performed on a curved embankment of an upstream tailings dam in order to investigate the possible risk of hydraulic fracturing and internal erosion {{in a corner of the}} dam. The analysis showed that low compressive stresses occurred above the phreatic level, near the zones of filter and rockfill banks. These zones contain coarse material, and are, therefore, not susceptible to hydraulic fracturing and internal erosion. An increase in the radius of the corner is suggested in order to prevent large reductions in compressive stresses that may occur due to future raisings. Presently the <b>curved</b> <b>dam</b> section is stable. However, an additional rockfill bank on the downstream side will be required for future raisings. Static liquefaction is considered as a common cause of disastrous flow failures of tailings dams. These flow failures can be predicted with numerical modelling using suitable constitutive models. In this context, some constitutive models capable of simulating static liquefaction behaviour of loose saturated sands are reviewed. It is generally concluded that the finite element method can be a helpful tool for modelling stability of tailings dams.
