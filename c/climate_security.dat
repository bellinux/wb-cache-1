Shortly before, Corker had offered three amendments to the act which focused on returning as much money as possible to American consumers, in part by eliminating free allowances and international offsets. Two years later he supported a proposed Senate resolution to express disapproval of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency on its endangerment finding identifying greenhouse gases as a matter for regulation under the Clean Air Act. In spring 2011 he was a co-sponsor of the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would have amended the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and aimed thus to protect households and businesses from paying increased costs passed on to them by businesses compelled to comply with new regulations. Corker said {{at the time that he}} hoped that as an alternative to administrative regulations by the EPA, Congress would [...] "determine a rational energy policy for the country, broadly advancing our energy security and maintaining existing policies to ensure clean air and water.” ...|$|E
