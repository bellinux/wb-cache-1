40|$|Background: <b>Cervical</b> pillow <b>height</b> is an {{important}} factor that affects the perception of pillow comfort. However, few studies have addressed methods for predicting a patient's preferred cervical pillow size. We studied the effect of pillow size preference on the strength and electromyographic (EMG) signals of the upper extremity muscle. If the response of the upper extremity muscle is affected by pillow size preference, this would aid in devising an alternate strategy for selecting the optimal pillow size. Methods: Twenty-nine healthy individuals (mean age: 28. 6 years, range: 24 – 55 years) participated in this study. The participants performed isometric maximal finger extension in the supine position with their heads supported on four different size preferences of cervical pillow (the most comfortable, next most comfortable, worst, and next worst). Maximal contraction force and peak-to-peak EMG amplitude of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) during contraction were measured. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of pillow size preference. We also explored the relationship between anthropometric parameters and the individual's <b>cervical</b> pillow <b>height</b> preference. Results: The two most comfortable pillows were associated with significantly larger maximal EDC force than the two worst pillows. However, no significant differences in EMG were observed between pillows. No statistically significant correlation was found between anthropometric parameters and pillow height preference. Conclusion: The results suggest that anatomical body measurements are not good predictors of optimal pillow height. As EDC muscle strength is affected by pillow height preference, maximal EDC muscle strength may be a useful complement for selecting the optimal pillow size...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. During growth, {{proportions}} of craniofacial and cervical structures are changed. Craniofacial and cervicovertebral structures are morphologically and functionally connected, but their each other’s influence is still unknown. Objective. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the changes in cervical lordosis and cervicovertebral morphology in different age periods and the possibility of estimating skeletal maturity, based on the percentage of anterior <b>cervical</b> vertebrae body <b>height</b> sum in the total anterior C 2 -C 5 height. Methods. The study included lateral radiographs of 120 patients of both sexes, divided into three different age groups: eight, 12 - 13 and 17 - 18 years of age. Five craniofacial and 15 cervical parameters were measured and analyzed. Results. The results showed significant correlation between cervical lordosis angle and age, gender, anterior and posterior body height of C 3, C 4, C 5, anterior C 4 -C 5 and posterior C 2 -C 3, C 3 -C 4, C 4 -C 5 intervertebral space, anterior body height of C 2 -C 5. Overall values of all <b>cervical</b> body <b>heights</b> were more present in the total height of the spine in females, while all intervertebral spaces were more present in males. The percentage of anterior and posterior C 2, C 3, C 4, C 5 body height sum compared to total C 2 -C 5 height increases with age. Conclusion. The cervical lordosis becomes more curved and vertebral bodies occupy more space in females, while intervertebral spaces occupy more in males. Skeletal maturity could be estimated following vertebral percentage distribution in the total anterior C 2 -C 5 part...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to radiologically and {{clinically}} compare the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage and cervical disc prostheses used in anterior cervical microdiscectomy operations during the postoperative period. Methods: The study evaluated 25 cervical disc hernia patients. The cervical disc prosthesis group (Group A) comprised 10 patients while the PEEK cage group (Group B) comprised 15 patients. Before and after the operation, the cervical graphics from radiological monitoring and VAS, NDI and Odom scores from clinical monitoring were used. The patients&# 146; preoperative and postoperative <b>cervical</b> graphics disc <b>height,</b> <b>cervical</b> axis and segmental angles were evaluated to determine statistical relationships with neurological situation and quality of life. Results: In the cervical disc prosthesis group (Group A) in the early postoperative period (3 rd week), 3 rd month and late period (18 - 36 months), the intervertebral disc height measurements were significantly higher than the cervical PEEK cage group (Group B) (early p 0. 05). Clinical evaluation of the patients found no statistical difference in the evaluation of VAS, NDI or Odom scores of the two groups before and after the operation. Conclusion: It was shown that in the cervical disc prosthesis group (Group A) in the early and later postoperative period, intervertebral disk heights were preserved by a statistically significant amount compared to the PEEK cage group (Group B).

40|$|Background: Compared with {{polyetheretherketone}} (PEEK) titanium (TTN) cages have {{a higher}} modulus of elasticity and are reported to show a higher loss of correction and more frequent cage subsidence after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Direct comparison of both cage types appears to favour PEEK cages to maintain <b>cervical</b> interspace <b>height</b> and achieve better fusion in patients with a degenerative disc disease (DDD), but clinical studies on this subject are very rare. Methods: From 2002 to 2007 154 patients underwent single-level ACDF for DDD. Clinical and radiological outcome were assessed in 86 eligible patients after a mean of 28. 38 months. 44 patients received a TTN- and 42 patients a PEEK-cage. Results: A solid arthrodesis was observed in 93. 2 % of the TTN-group and 88. 1 % of the PEEK-group. Cage subsidence was observed in 20. 45 % of the TTN- and 14. 28 % of the PEEK-group. Statistical analysis of these results revealed no differences. The analysis of the clinical data assessed by the neck pain disability index (NPDI), visual analogue scale (VAS) of neck and arm pain and Odom’s criteria did not show any {{significant differences between the}} groups.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Biological age is an {{important}} parameter for growth and development assessment. It can be evaluated through the observation of radiographic changes in skeletal maturation of cervical vertebrae. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to: a) verify if there is correlation between growth curve and the stages of bone age of animals used in laboratories, by evaluating radiographs of the cervical vertebrae; b) correlate these stages with their correspondents in humans. METHODS: 35 Wistar rats were evaluated {{for a period of}} 160 days, starting at day 22 nd (weaning), with cross sections for periodic weighing, length measurement and digital radiography. Radiographs of the cervical vertebrae (C 2 and C 3) were measured by means of a computer program (Radio IMP). Data were submitted to statistical analysis (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation. RESULTS: Growth spurt was characterized by fast increasing in weight and length. Through ANOVA, differences were observed in the cervical measurements between days 22, 97, 127, 157, 187 and 217 (p < 0. 001). A high correlation was found between increasing in body length and weight, as well as in <b>cervical</b> vertebrae <b>height</b> (r = 0. 86). Increments in concavities of vertebrae were also observed, similar to humans. CONCLUSIONS: There is correlation between body growth and maturation of cervical vertebrae in rats.

40|$|Head {{and neck}} posture is an {{important}} factor in neck pain related to computer use; however, the evidence for an optimal posture is unconvincing. This study measured the 3 -D postures of 36 young adults during use of three different display <b>heights.</b> <b>Cervical</b> extensor muscle strain was estimated using modelled gravitational load moments and muscle capacities. The influence of more or less upper vs. lower cervical movement was also explored across a broad range of potential postures. Overall cervical extensor muscle capacity diminished away from a neutral posture whilst gravity moment increased with flexion. Overall cervical extensor muscle strain increased with head flexion but remained stable into head extension. Individual differences in the amount of upper and lower cervical movement had an important effect on strain, particularly for some muscles. Computer display height guidelines are an important component of ergonomics practice, yet the relative strain on neck extensor muscles as a function of display height has not been examined. The current findings provide more detailed biomechanical evidence that ergonomists can incorporate with usability and other evidence to determine appropriate display height recommendations...|$|R

M?TODOS: Cento e vinte br?quetes met?licos foram avaliados, divididos em 4 grupos (n= 30 por grupo) : grupo C (Controle, como recebido do fabricante) e os grupos T 12, T 24 e T 36 (br?quetes recuperados ap?s 12, 24, e 36 meses de tratamento, respectivamente), fios de a?o inoxid?vel retangulares que permaneceram na cavidade oral por 12 a 24 meses tamb?m foram analisados. Estabilidade dimensional, morfologia da superf?cie e composi??o dos br?quetes, resist?ncia ao deslizamento do conjunto br?quete/fio e rugosidade {{superficial}} dos fios foram analisados por microscopia ?ptica de medi??o, microscopia eletr?nica de varredura e por energia dispersiva de Raios X, m?quina universal de ensaios e microscopia de for?a at?mica, respectivamente. O pH bucal foi avaliado nos diferentes tempos de tratamento a partir de tiras indicadoras de pH pelo m?todo colorim?trico. RESULTADOS: O tempo influenciou gradativamente do 12 ? ao 36 ? m?s para o ac?mulo de biofilme e detritos alimentares sobre a superf?cie dos br?quetes, presen?a de deforma??es nas aletas, al?m do aparecimento de pontos de corros?o. Alturas oclusal e cervical dos br?quetes aumentaram significativamente ap?s o uso cl?nico de 36 meses comparado as alturas dos br?quetes novos (p< 0. 05). Carbono e Oxig?nio demonstraram ser elementos com aumentos expressivos e diretamente proporcional ao tempo, assim como, houve um aumento progressivo do coeficiente de atrito e rugosidade dos fios em fun??o do tempo de uso cl?nico com maior aumento ap?s 36 meses. O pH bucal demonstrou diferen?a significativa apenas entre o grupo T 36 com seu controle (p< 0. 05). CONCLUS?ES: A hip?tese foi parcialmente aceita, br?quetes e fios ortod?nticos apresentaram altera??es f?sico-qu?micas significativas devido ao uso cl?nico. No entanto, o tempo de tratamento e o ac?mulo de biofilme/detritos nos slots dos br?quetes demonstraram ser mais influentes sobre o processo de degrada??o e for?a de atrito destes dispositivos do que o pH bucal. OBJECTIVE: The {{focus of}} this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment time and oral pH had an influence on the physical chemical properties of orthodontic brackets and arch wires. METHODS: 120 metal brackets were evaluated. They were divided into 4 groups (n= 30) : Group C (Control) and Groups T 12, T 24 and T 36 (brackets recovered after 12, 24, and 36 months of treatment, respectively), rectangular stainless steel arch wires that remained in the oral cavity for 12 to 24 months were also analyzed. Dimensional stability, surface morphology and composition of brackets, resistance to sliding of the bracket/wire set and surface roughness of wires were analyzed by optical microscopy by measurement, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray, universal test machine and atomic force microscopy assays, respectively. Oral pH was evaluated by means of pH indicator strips by the colorimetric method. One-way analysis of variance ANOVA, followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test were used for statistical analysis (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: There was gradual influence of time from the 12 th to 36 th month for biofilm and food debris accumulation on bracket surfaces, presence of deformations on winglets and points of corrosion. Occlusal and <b>cervical</b> <b>heights</b> of brackets increased significantly after clinical use for 36 months, compared with new bracket heights (p< 0. 05). Carbon and Oxygen were shown to be elements that increased expressively and in direct proportion to time, and there was a progressive increase in the coefficient of friction and roughness of wires as a function of time of clinical use after 36 months. Oral pH showed significant difference only between group T 36 and its control (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was partially accepted, brackets and orthodontic wires suffered significant physical-chemical changes due to clinical use. However, the treatment time and biofilm and debris accumulation in bracket slots were shown to have more influence on the degradation process and frictional force of these devices than oral pH...|$|R

Study designA cross-sectional study was performed. Cold knife cone specimens with a diagnosis of CIN II/III were selected. Epidemiological data and pathology reports were obtained through a chart review. All samples from each cone specimen showing CIN II/III and the squamocolumnar junction were selected. Cone height (mean±standard deviation), intraepithelial lesion size, and size of endocervical surgical margins were measured. ResultsFour hundred and forty-seven samples were analyzed from 97 cone specimens. Section size ranged from 3. 4 to 29. 7 mm, tumor size from 0. 3 to 17. 5 mm, and tumor distance from the endocervical margin, from 0. 0 to 22. 0 mm. Age and parity were similar in the positive vs. negative margin groups (37. 6 ± 10. 0 years vs. 37. 7 ± 11. 9 years respectively, p= 0. 952, and 2. 2 ± 1. 7 births vs. 2. 6 ± 1. 9 births respectively, p= 0. 804), whereas cone height (22. 4 ± 6. 9 mm vs. 17. 1 ± 5. 6 mm, p= 0. 013) and tumor size (6. 12 ± 3. 25 mm vs. 10. 6 ± 4. 45 mm, p< 0. 001) were significantly different in negative vs. positive margin groups respectively.

This comparative effectiveness study compared the patient-rated and radiographic outcomes of 2 -level ACDF versus 1 -level ACCF. METHODS: This single-center study was nested within the EuroSpine Spine Tango data acquisition system. Inclusion criteria were the following: consecutive patients presenting with signs of cervical spondylotic myelopathy who underwent 2 -level ACDF or 1 -level ACCF between 2004 and 2011. Before and 12 months after surgery, patients completed the multidimensional Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) and also rated global treatment outcome and satisfaction with care on 5 -point Likert scales. <b>Cervical</b> lordosis, segmental <b>height,</b> and fusion rate were assessed radiographically before and immediately after surgery and at the last follow-up (20. 4 ± 13. 7 months, mean ± SD).

40|$|Carotid artery {{bifurcation}} (CB) is {{the preferred}} site for development of atherosclerosis (AS) in extracranial cerebral arteries; internal carotid artery stenosis {{is the most common}} cause of ischemic stroke. The frequent atherosclerotic disease of CB may best be explained by the hemodynamic influence of complex blood flow that results from the unique geometry of the bifurcation. Few papers analyze all possible geometric structural characteristics of this bifurcation. While performing many carotid endarterectomies, we noticed that a certain correlation between CB height in the neck and its angle existed, that a larger angle is accompanied with increased frequency of elongation and kinking and that CB shape influences distribution of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and evaluate these clinical observations. Radiogrametric analysis of 154 bi-plane orthogonal aortic arch arteriograms of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery disease was performed and a total of 289 CBs were analyzed. The CB height in relation to cervical spine segments was measured and real angles of each bifurcation were calculated. A positive linear correlation between CB height and angle exists: the CB angle increases/decreases 3, 34 o for each third of the <b>cervical</b> vertebral body <b>height</b> or intervertebral space height. The CB is positioned a little higher on the left side. The proximal border of the atherosclerotic process is found at the level of intersection of the axes of the common carotid artery branches in 92. 6 % of examined CBs. In lower CBs (with smaller angles) the proximal border was located in the last segment of the common carotid artery, while in high bifurcations (wider angles) the proximal border of the AS process is more distally in the blood flow, in the beginning of the internal carotid artery, and the process was more extensive. High CBs are more suitable for eversion endarterectomy while normal and low CBs are more suitable for open (classic) carotid endarterectomy. The influence of the geometric risk factor demands further investigation...|$|R

Para isso, foram utilizadas 58 tomografias de indivíduos maiores de 14 anos de idade não tratados ortodonticamente. Os indivíduos foram divididos em 3 grupos de acordo com o padrão facial avaliado pelo índice VERT de Ricketts: Grupo 1 : composto por 18 indivíduos com padrão braquifacial, com idade média de 21, 58 anos (d. p. = 7, 43); Grupo 2 : composto por 23 indivíduos com padrão mesofacial, com idade média de 19, 14 anos (d. p. = 5, 19); e Grupo 3 : composto por 17 indivíduos com padrão dolicofacial, com idade média de 19, 09 anos (d. p. = 6, 89). Foi realizada uma avaliação quantitativa das tábuas ósseas vestibular e lingual dos dentes pósteroinferiores, em tomografias de feixe cônico. As medidas utilizadas foram: altura do osso mandibular vestibular e lingual, largura mandibular cervical e média, inclinação mandibular, inclinação da face vestibular, largura do molar, angulação do molar e ângulo dente/osso. A comparação intergrupos foi realizada com a utilização do teste ANOVA a um critério de seleção e teste de Tukey quando necessário. Para verificar se existe correlação entre o padrão facial e as variáveis estudadas foi utilizado o teste de correlação de Pearson. Os resultados demonstraram que os indivíduos braquifaciais apresentaram uma menor inclinação mandibular quando comparados aos indivíduos mesofaciais e dolicofaciais. Houve diferença significante da altura mandibular vestibular entre os três grupos avaliados, sendo que esta foi menor no grupo braquifacial, intermediária no grupo mesofacial e maior no grupo dolicofacial. A altura mandibular lingual foi menor no grupo braquifacial em comparação aos grupos mesofacial e dolicofacial. A largura mandibular média foi maior nos indivíduos braquifaciais em relação aos mesofaciais. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare, with cone beam computed tomography, the axial inclination of posterior teeth and mandibular alveolar bone morphology among individuals with different facial patterns. For this, 58 CT scans of untreated individuals orthodontically aged more than 14 years were used. The subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the facial pattern evaluated by the VERT index by Ricketts: Group 1 comprised 18 individuals with brachyfacial pattern, with a mean age of 21. 58 years (s. d. = 7. 43); Group 2 comprised 23 individuals with mesofacial pattern, with a mean age of 19. 14 years (s. d. = 5. 19); and Group 3 comprised 17 individuals with dolichofacial pattern, with a mean age of 19. 09 years (s. d. = 6. 89). A quantitative assessment of the buccal and lingual bone plates of the mandibular posterior teeth were made in cone beam CT scans. The variables measured were: buccal and lingual mandibular <b>height,</b> <b>cervical</b> and middle mandibular width, mandibular inclination, inclination of the buccal surface, molar width, molar angle and tooth/bone angle. The intergroup comparison was performed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey test when necessary. To check whether there is a correlation between facial pattern and the variables studied, the Pearson correlation test was used. The results showed that the brachyfacial subjects had a smaller mandibular angle when compared to mesofacial and dolichofacial individuals. There was significant difference in the buccal mandibular height between the three groups, and this was smaller in the brachyfacial group, intermediate in the mesofacial group and larger in the dolichofacial group. Lingual mandibular height was smaller in brachyfacial group when compared to mesofacial and dolichofacial groups.

40|$|Resumo: Recessões gengivais estão freqüentemente associadas às lesões cervicais não-cariosas. O tratamento dessa lesão combinada é um desafio. Trabalhos recentes têm apresentado resultados de tratamento conjunto de cirurgia {{periodontal}} e dentística restauradora para tratamento da lesão combinada. Porém nenhum trabalho demonstrou resultados de longo prazo desse tipo de abordagem, além de variações desse tratamento e dos fatores anatômicos locais que poderiam influenciar na resultado dessas terapias. Portanto, os objetivos do presente estudo foram: 1. Apresentar os resultados após 2 anos de tratamento de recessões gengivais associadas à lesões cervicais tratadas com retalho posicionado coronariamente (RPC) sozinho ou associado à restauração de ionômero de vidro modificado por resina (CIV). 2. Avaliar os resultados, após 6 meses de tratamento do enxerto de tecido conjuntivo (ETC) associado ou não à restauração de CIV para tratamento da lesão combinada. 3. Avaliar a possível influência das características anatômicas locais no recobrimento das lesões combinadas tratadas pelas técnicas do retalho posicionado coronariamente e pelo enxerto de tecido conjuntivo. Para o primeiro objetivo, foi realizado um estudo clínico controlado e randomizado que foram incluídos 16 indivíduos apresentando duas recessões gengivais bilaterais associadas à lesões cervicais em caninos ou pré-molares superiores. Os defeitos foram tratados com RPC sozinho ou associado à restauração de CIV. Os resultados não demonstraram diferença significante entre os grupos após 2 anos com relação à redução da recessão gengival, ganho no nível clínico de inserção e sangramento à sondagem. Para o segundo objetivo, foi realizado um estudo clinico controlado e randomizado que foram incluídos 40 indivíduos apresentando uma recessão gengival associada à lesão cervical em caninos ou pré-molares superiores. Os defeitos foram tratados com ETC sozinho ou associado à restauração de CIV. Os resultados não demonstraram diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos após 6 meses com relação à redução da recessão gengival, ganho no nível clínico de inserção, ganho de tecido queratinizado e sangramento à sondagem. No entanto, o grupo que recebeu ETCe a restauração de CIV foi estatisticamente melhor na redução da hipersensibilidade dentinária. Para o terceiro objetivo, as características anatômicas locais dos indivíduos dos dois estudos clínicos prévios foram medidas e analisadas através de regressão linear multipla. Os resultados demonstraram correlação estatisticamente significante entre a profundidade da lesão cervical não-cariosa e o a redução na recessão gengival quando RPC foi utilizado de forma isolada. A altura da lesão combinada também apresentou correlação estatisticamente significante com a redução da recessão gengival para ambos os estudos. Além disso, a deiscência óssea apresentou correlação estatisticamente significante quando ETC foi utilizado. Dentro dos limites desse estudo, pode-se concluir que a restauração de ionômero de vidro modificado por resina parece não interferir no recobrimento da lesão combinada após 2 anos de avaliação, quando o retalho posicionado coronariamente foi utilizado e após 6 meses quando o enxerto de tecido conjuntivo foi utilizado. A profundidade da lesão cervical pode ter alguma influência quando RPC é utilizado e a deiscência óssea parece não interferir negativamente no recobrimento quando ETC foi utilizado. Abstract: Gingival recessions {{are frequently}} associated with non-carious cervical lesion. Previous {{studies have shown}} results from a combined treatment (periodontal surgery plus restoration of the cervical lesion) {{to deal with the}} association of these two lesions. However, there is lack of information regarding the long term evaluation of the combined treatment. Moreover, no additional information regarding other surgical techniques and the influence of the local anatomical characteristics have not been evaluated. Thus, the objectives of this study were: 1. Evaluate the 2 -year-follow-up outcome of the treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions by coronally advanced flap alone (CAF), or in combination with a resin-modified glass ionomer restoration 2. Evaluate the 6 -month-follow-up outcome of the treatment of gingival recession associated with cervical lesion by connective tissue graft alone (CTG), or in combination with a resin-modified glass ionomer restoration, and 3. Evaluate the possible influence of local anatomy on the amount of soft tissue coverage achieved and on the clinical attachment gain by the use of CAF and CTG, alone or in combination with resin-modified glass ionomer restoration to treat the combined defect. For the first objective, 16 patients with bilateral Miller Class I buccal gingival recessions, associated with non-carious cervical lesions were selected. The defects received either CAF alone or CAF plus a resin-modified glass ionomer restoration. The results showed that both groups showed statistically significant soft tissue coverage. The differences between groups were not statistically significant in reduction of gingival recession, gain in the clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing after 2 years. For the second objective, 40 patients with Miller Class I buccal gingival recessions, associated with non-carious cervical lesions were enrolled. The defects were randomly assigned to receive either CTG alone or CTG plus a resin-modified glass ionomer restoration. The results showed that both groups showed statistically significant soft tissue coverage. The differences between groups were not statistically significant in gingival recession, gain in the clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing, after 6 months. However, the group CTG plus the restoration showed statistically significant reduction in dentin sensitivity when compared to CTG alone. For the third objective, the local anatomical characteristics from the patients enrolled in the 2 previous studies were correlated with the reduction of the gingival recession and the gain in the clinical attachment level using Stepwise Multivariate Linear Regression. The results showed that the cervical lesion depth was significantly correlated with reduction in gingival recession, when considering data from the CAF group. The <b>cervical</b> lesion <b>height</b> was statistically correlated with the reduction in gingival recession when the two groups were analyzed. Additionally, the bone level was statistically correlated with reduction in gingival recession when evaluating the CTG group. Within the limits of the present study it can be concluded that the presence of the resin-modified glass ionomer restoration may not interfere with the amount of coverage achieved either by CAF after 2 years or CTG after 6 months. The cervical lesion depth may have some influence on the final coverage achieved when CAF is applied and the bone level may not play any role when CTG is applied...|$|R
