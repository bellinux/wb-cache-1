5|$|Nevertheless, O'Brien {{confirmed}} on February 18, 2009, that Weinberg and {{the band}} were indeed coming with him. Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and E Streeter Van Zandt said {{that no amount of}} rehearsal by another drummer <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E
5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family {{did not believe that}} Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not be}} substantiating the requested amount, as no money <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2008, Rutgers {{attempted}} to convert Westerman to defensive tackle, so he <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> the departed Eric Foster. However, Westerman ended up playing defensive end during the season. Against Morgan State, Westerman blocked a punt and recovered the loose ball. Westerman suffered a torn biceps against Louisville {{and was forced}} to sit {{out the rest of the}} season which included a bowl game. Despite his injury, he led Rutgers with six sacks on the season.|$|E

According to the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, for the President of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, the proposal would be “incompatible with the deeper integration of the bloc”.|$|R
5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|From its beginning, {{the main}} {{features}} of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> {{a huge number of}} other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E

50|$|With the {{completion}} of the Steel Bulk Mail van, one second-class carriage was deleted from the standard Spirit of Progress consist, to give eleven cars with four first-class and three second-class. This left one of each class spare, for a rotating maintenance schedule. If one of the other cars was unavailable, Murray <b>could</b> be <b>replaced</b> with the Long W type carriage Avoca; Steel Bulk Mail <b>could</b> be <b>replaced</b> with 1D, a 1929-build steel replacement for a destroyed E-type mail van, and the Steel CE <b>could</b> be <b>replaced</b> with a normal, timber CE. There was no replacement for the Parlor car; if this was faulty {{it would have to be}} removed from the train.|$|R
5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|Aviation was not neglected. Plans {{called for}} an air force of 18 flying boats, 18 {{reconnaissance}} fighters, 18 torpedo bombers and 18 single-seat fighters to protect them. Royal Air Force airfields were established at RAF Tengah and RAF Sembawang. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, argued that 30 torpedo bombers <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and Portsmouth in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were {{to have a chance}} of hitting a battleship.|$|E

5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1940, Berger {{had filled}} the {{authorised}} quota of new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> the many older Allgemeine SS reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler's control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht recruiting controls.|$|E
5|$|In early 1948, Nick Shoemaker, Wiescamp's senior {{stallion}} and Skipper W's sire, {{died in a}} freak accident {{while in}} his paddock, by slipping on some ice and breaking his neck against a fence. This meant that Skipper W's show career was cut short so that he <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> his sire as the main breeding stallion. During his entire career, Skipper W never was bred to any mare that was not owned by Wiescamp. Wiescamp {{wanted to make sure that}} the mares that he bred his stallions to were the best possible matches for the particular stallion. From the time of Nick Shoemaker's death until Skipper W's own death, the horse remained Wiescamp's senior stallion.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E

5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{proved to}} be the most {{controversial}} of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to national pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside Charles Horsky, although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed. The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans, although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in coram nobis proceedings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed {{as a sign of}} weakness, now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons {{appointed}} Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel's home {{for the rest of their}} lives. His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia. Over two years, he negotiated with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84 million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government's budgetary difficulties. Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he <b>could</b> <b>replace</b> Lyons as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons' health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest in returning. In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.|$|E
