5000|$|Mead {{was a very}} {{important}} figure in 20th century social philosophy. One of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms, discussed in Mind, Self and Society, also known as social behaviorism. [...] This concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology. Rooted intellectually in Hegelian dialectics and process philosophy, Mead, like Dewey, developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action. Human activity is, in a pragmatic sense, the criterion of truth, and through human activity meaning is made. Joint activity, including <b>communicative</b> <b>activity,</b> is the means through which our sense of self is constituted. The essence of Mead's social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm, nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure. This approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body. The emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment; it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior, that is, thought. Mind, in Mead’s terms, is the individualized focus of the communication process. It is linguistic behavior {{on the part of the}} individual. There is, then, no “mind or thought without language;” and language (the content of mind) “is only a development and product of social interaction” (Mind, Self and Society 191-192). Thus, mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual, but is emergent in “the dynamic, ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience (Mind, Self and Society 7).|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of psychological literature shows that {{ability of the}} student of higher education institution to constructive influence in <b>communicative</b> <b>activity</b> in late youthful age (18 - 20 years) is both a factor of socialization of the personality, and a factor of formation of future expert, a kind of manifestation of its competitiveness in professional activity. Purpose. On {{the basis of an}} activity approach and fundamental methodological theories the structurally functional model of formation of ability to the constructive influence was developed. On the same basis the subject of approbation and experimental confirmation on formation of this ability were researched. On the basis of the developed model the special course program with the purpose of formation of this ability was developed and realized. According to received results the studies, based on the model, influenced the development of the psychological qualities providing ability of the student of higher education institution to constructive influence in <b>communicative</b> <b>activity.</b> In research the following methods were used: poll, testing, questioning, interview, and methods of mathematical statistics were also applied. The data received as a result of research, were analyzed with application of parametrical and nonparametric methods of statistics. Quantitative characteristics were subjected to statistical processing by a way of calculation of selective average arithmetic (mm). Productivity of skilled and experimental work was defined on the basis of comparison of indicators of two experimental and one control groups at different stages of experiment. Reliability and validity of the received distinctions between average sizes of groups determined by means of calculation of an average error of a difference, reliability degree - by Student-Fischer's table. Conclusions. Research established dynamics which testifies to a positive tendency in formation of the specified ability. If at the beginning of forming experiment it was noted that average and low level of a formation of this ability at students (75, 3 %) prevailed, at the end of experiment high level (grew by 27 %), average (for 7, 3 %), and low level on (for 7, 8 %).

This {{study was}} designed to investigate the relationships among types of classroom activities, defined as either structural or communicative, and the motivation, communication, and achievement of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. The participants were 22 Turkish EFL students at the pre-intermediate level of proficiency attending the Middle East Technical University Preparatory program. The researcher used two different techniques to collect her data for this study: classroom observations to determine communication, operationalized as student participation in the classroom, and questionnaires to measure students' motivation. The study attempted to answer three research questions. The first research question concerned to what extent student motivation is related to the communicativeness of classroom activities. The mean score calculated from the motivation questionnaires showed that students' motivation during <b>communicative</b> <b>activities</b> was higher than the mean score for motivation during structural activities (Ms = 3. 22 and 2. 78, respectively). Thus, <b>communicative</b> <b>activities</b> were able to motivate more than structural activities. The second research question answered the question to what extent participation in the classroom is related to the commnunicativeness of classroom activities. The results obtained from the observation checklists indicated that the students participated more, and thus communicated more during <b>communicative</b> <b>activities</b> since the mean score for participation during <b>communicative</b> <b>activities</b> was higher than the mean score for participation during structural activities (Ms= 6. 62 and 2. 16, respectively). The third research question investigated to what extent the achievement of students is related to their motivation and classroom participation. The results showed a strong relationship between both structural and communicative participation and achievement (r=. 57 and. 59; p =. 005 and. 003 respectively), but the relationship between both types of students' motivation and achievement was not significant. However, an indirect relationship between motivation and achievement was found, since motivation is related to participation, which in turn is related to achievement. In addition, results of the study show 67 % co-variance between structural and communicative participation, suggesting that students who participate in structural activities also take part in <b>communicative</b> <b>activities,</b> and vice versa. There is also considerable co-variance, 54 %, between motivation during structural activities and motivation during <b>communicative</b> <b>activities,</b> indicating that students who are motivated during one type of activity are also motivated during the other type. The results of the study showed that there is a strong relationship among activity types and motivation, participation, and achievement of the students. If teachers keep in mind that students can be motivated to participate in class, and that participation in both structural and <b>communicative</b> <b>activities</b> is strongly related to achievement, they will include activities in the classroom which enable students to participate in the class and thus to get good results in learning the language.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} various communication strategies {{applied in}} the English speaking class. <b>Communicative</b> <b>activities</b> in speaking are very interesting for the students. Speaking seems challenging for either the students or the teacher. To {{be able to use}} English in real communication appropriately, it needs much practice and experience in using English in speaking class. Good communication strategy in speaking class is necessary, as communication strategy applied will much influence the student’s competence in the target language-English. Closely related to the case there are some speaking strategies that could be applied in speaking, such as; using conversation maintenance cues, and using mime and nonverbal expressions to convey meaning.
