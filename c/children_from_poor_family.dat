He was most influenced by Johannes Peter Müller. He defended his thesis titled de rheumate praesertim corneae (corneal manifestations of rheumatic disease) for medical degree on 21 October 1843, with Müller as his doctoral advisor. Immediately on graduation he became subordinate physician to Müller. But shortly after, he joined the Charité Hospital in Berlin for internship. In 1844, he was appointed as medical assistant to the prosector (pathologist) Robert Froriep, from whom he learned microscopy for his interest in pathology. Froriep was also the editor of an abstract journal that specialised in foreign work, allowing Virchow {{to be exposed to}} the more forward-looking scientific ideas of France and England.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{achievement}} gap between <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>family</b> backgrounds and others; {{this is not}} unique to the UK, but found in all other countries of the OECD. This article examines the reasons why children from poorer backgrounds do not, on average, do as well academically at school as those from more advantaged backgrounds. It argues that the family, income and material resources are highly significant, although schools also play an important role. Possible implications for policy are discussed together with associated tensions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the effects of}} social inequities on the health and nutrition of children in low and middle income countries. METHODS: We reviewed existing data on socioeconomic disparities within-countries relative {{to the use of}} services, nutritional status, morbidity, and mortality. A conceptual framework including five major hierarchical categories affecting inequities was adopted: socioeconomic context and position, differential exposure, differential vulnerability, differential health outcomes, and differential consequences. The search of the PubMed database since 1990 identified 244 articles related to the theme. Results were also analyzed from almost 100 recent national surveys, including Demographic Health Surveys and the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. RESULTS: Children from poor families are more likely, relative to those from better-off families, to be exposed to pathogenic agents; once they are exposed, {{they are more likely to}} become ill because of their lower resistance and lower coverage with preventive interventions. Once they become ill, they are less likely to have access to health services and the quality of these services is likely to be lower, with less access to life-saving treatments. As a consequence, <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>family</b> have higher mortality rates and are more likely to be undernourished. CONCLUSIONS: Except for child obesity and inadequate breastfeeding practices, all the other adverse conditions analyzed were more prevalent in children from less well-off families. Careful documentation of the multiple levels of determination of socioeconomic inequities in child health is essential for understanding the nature of this problem and for establishing interventions that can reduce these differences...|$|E

40|$|For most societies, {{children}} {{involvement in}} household {{work and to}} some extent in community work is considered normal and has become a common practice until now. In fact, this practice is regarded necessary {{in the development of a}} child; socially, physically and emotionally, as something that they need to become an adult. Furthermore, it also contributes to the wellbeing of the family, as shown by study of Rama, Sharma and Linda M. Richter (2007). However, despite the benefit it brings, it is also necessary to really look into that practice as most of the time the work done by children is undermined by other people even by family member, and there is concern that children contribution might bring unintended impact on their wellbeing and will further deter the fulfillment of their rights. Concerns are more obvious especially for <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>family</b> and during economic crises, as their contribution might be higher than children from other families. Based on that, this paper aims to describe the condition of children that are doing household work including caring activities, and see how it will affect their wellbeing and fulfillment of their rights. First, the paper will explore children contribution in the household work; what kind of work they are doing, especially related to unpaid care work, the time allocated for that activities and the likely impact of doing that work to their wellbeing. This paper will also highlight the potential role of social protection in maintaining child 2 ̆ 7 s rights and wellbeing in such circumstances...|$|E
40|$|One in five U. S. {{children}} {{lives in}} poverty. There are 14. 7 million poor children and 6. 5 million extremely poor children (Children 2 ̆ 7 s Defense Fund, 2015). Children raised in impoverished environments {{are more likely}} to experience lower levels of academic achievement than their more advantaged peers (Strelitz 2 ̆ 6 Lister, 2008). Low-income parents tend to exert a harsh parenting style that is based on parental control over the child (Engle 2 ̆ 6 Black, 2008). Research has shown that whereas positive parenting can reduce the negative effect of poverty on children 2 ̆ 7 s school achievement (Kiernan 2 ̆ 6 Mensah, 2011), harsh parenting has the opposite effect (Vogel et al., 2010). The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore harsh parenting as a mediator of the association of poverty with academic problems of <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>family</b> backgrounds. Data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project Study sample (EHSREP; Vogel et al., 2010) provided an opportunity to examine children 2 ̆ 7 s academic functioning in relation to harsh parenting at age 11 years (N= 1, 632). Using a parenting resilience model, it was hypothesized that the association between poor family environments and child academic achievement would be mediated by harsh parenting. Hierarchical regression to explore mediation showed that harsh parenting had a partial mediating effect for the pathway from family income to child academic skills, as shown by a substantial decrease in the coefficient for family income after harsh parenting was added to the model and by a significance test of the indirect effect. This study supports the importance of consequences and correlates of the quality of parenting that influences child academic development in a context of poverty. Therefore, guiding parents in low-income families to reduce hash parenting and increase positive interactions with their children would provide greater leverage for children to succeed academically...|$|E

40|$|There is {{emerging}} {{evidence to suggest}} that initial differentials between the health of poor and more affluent children in the UK do not widen over early childhood.

The results suggest that <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>families</b> {{do not have access to}} markedly worse quality primary care, and further, that the quality of primary care does not appear to have a large effect on differentials in child health in early childhood. primary care quality, child health...|$|R
5000|$|The {{parenting}} {{practices that}} a child is raised with influences their future educational achievement. However, parenting styles are heavily influenced by the parents' and family's social, economic, and physical circumstances. In particular, immigration status (if applicable), education level, incomes, and occupations influence the degree of parental involvement their children's academic achievement. [...] These factors directly determine the access of the parents to time and resources to dedicate to their children's development. These factors also indirectly determine the home environment and parents' educational expectations of their children. For example, <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>families</b> have lower academic performance in kindergarten than <b>children</b> <b>from</b> middle to upper-class backgrounds, but <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> <b>families</b> who had cognitively stimulating materials in the home demonstrated higher rates of academic achievement in kindergarten.
