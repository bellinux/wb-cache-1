5|$|Marine {{deposition}} occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, creating thick {{sequences of}} conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear {{parts of the}} supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed {{on the edges of}} these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion wedge of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediment</b> then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave way about 550 Ma to a carbonate platform which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} cave sediments: their {{characteristics}} and their application as paleoclimate archives. Cave sediments can be separated into two broad categories, <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> and chemical sediments. Of these, stream-transported <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> and calcite speleothems are both {{the most common and}} also the most useful as climatic records. Techniques for dating cave sediments include radiocarbon and U/Th dating of speleothems and paleomagnetic reversals and cosmogenic isotope dating of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments.</b> Cosmogenic isotope dating of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> in caves with multiple levels or which occur at different elevations provide a geomorphic record of cave ages and river system evolution over the past 5 Ma. Isotope profiles, trace element profiles, color banding and luminescence profiles of speleothems, mainly stalagmites, produce a detailed paleoclimate record with very high time resolution over the past several hundred thousand years. There is potential application of these methods to late Holocene climates with implications for evaluation of current concern over global warming...|$|R

25|$|Subsequent {{erosion of}} the Targhee Uplift was driven by steepened stream gradients. Gravel, {{quartzite}} cobbles, and sand from this erosion eventually became the 5,000 foot (1,500 m) thick Harebell Formation seen today as various conglomerates and sandstones in the northern and northeastern parts of the park. In the Paleocene epoch large amounts of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediment</b> derived from uplifted areas covered the Harebell Formation to become the Pinyon Conglomerate.

25|$|The {{coast is}} an {{environment}} dominated by wave action. At a beach, dominantly denser sediment such as sand or gravel, often mingled with shell fragments, is deposited, while the silt and clay sized material {{is kept in}} mechanical suspension. Tidal flats and shoals are places that sometimes dry because of the tide. They are often cross-cut by gullies, where the current is strong and the grain size of the deposited sediment is larger. Where rivers enter the body of water, either on a sea or lake coast, deltas can form. These are large accumulations of sediment transported from the continent to places {{in front of the}} mouth of the river. Deltas are dominantly composed of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediment</b> (in contrast to chemical).|$|E
2500|$|The {{early history}} of this region was {{dominated}} by volcanic activity, magmatic intrusion and deformation. The Eastern Pilbara Terrane is mostly volcanic in nature, and this volcanic activity occurred in relatively short, and repeated cycles These ultramafic-mafic-felsic cycles which last approximately 10–15 Myr each are accompanied by metamorphism/deformation, and followed by long pauses ( [...] 75 myr) and <b>clastic</b> <b>sediment</b> deposition. Some of the granitic intrusions {{in the region are}} subvolcanic, which can be determined through the comparative chemical analysis of the intrusion and associated greenstones. All of these cycles are interpreted {{to be the result of}} successive mantle plume events. These events resulted in the overall dome (granite) and syncline (greenstone) structure of the region, which can still be seen on modern geologic maps. The overall thickness of this succession during its formation and the geochemical analysis indicating that these rocks were mantle derived supports that this region was formed as a thick volcanic plateau.|$|E

40|$|Gladysvale Cave {{is one of}} the few Plio-Pleistocene hominin-bearing cave {{sites in}} South Africa that {{contains}} a well-stratified cave fill with <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> interspersed with flowstones. The <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> can be divided into units based on the presence of intercalated flowstones, forming flowstone bounded units (FBU). Ten MC-ICP-MS uranium-series dates on several flowstone horizons in the Gladysvale Internal Deposit fan indicate deposition from the late mid-Pleistocene (approximately 570 ka) to Holocene (approximately 7 ka) during limited periods of higher effective moisture. Clastic sedimentation occurred during the interceding, presumably more arid, periods. This sequence is not consistent with earlier models for South African caves that simply assumed interglacial sedimentation and glacial erosion. (13) C/(12) C data suggest that flowstone tended to form during periods with higher proportions of C(3) plants in the local vegetation, while <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> reflect higher proportions of C(4) grasses, although this is not always the case. We argue that flowstones are precipitated during periods of higher effective precipitation and restricted cave entrances, while <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> accumulated during periods with more open vegetation. The sedimentary fill of the fossiliferous deposits are, therefore, highly episodic in nature, with large periods of time unlikely to be represented. This has serious implications for the other hominin-bearing caves close by, as these deposits are likely to be similarly episodic. This is especially pertinent when addressing extinction events and reconstructions of paleoenvironments, as large periods of time may be unrecorded. The Gladysvale Cave fill sediments may serve as a climatically forced chronostratigraphic model for these less well-stratified and well-dated Plio-Pleistocene sites. 602 Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGeochemical methods (major {{elements}} and Sr, Nd isotopes) {{have been used}} to (1) characterize Lake Le Bourget sediments in the French Alps, (2) identify the current sources of the <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> and estimate the source variability over the last 600 years. Major element results indicate that Lake Le Bourget sediments consist of 45 % clastic component and 55 % endogenic calcite. In addition, several individual flood levels have been identified during the Little Ice Age (LIA) {{on the basis of their}} higher clastic content (> 70 %). Potential sources of Lake Le Bourget <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> have been investigated from Sr and Nd isotope compositions. The sediments from the Sierroz River and Leysse River which are mainly derived from the Mesozoic Calcareous Massifs are characterised by lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios and slightly lower Nd(0) ratios than the Arve River sediments which are derived from the Palaeozoic Mont-Blanc External Crystalline Massifs. The Rhône River appears to have been the main source of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments</b> into the lake for the last 600 years, as evidenced by a similar Sr and Nd isotopic compositions analyzed in core B 16 sediments (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 719, Nd(0) = − 10) and in the sediments of the Rhône River (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 719, Nd(0) = − 9. 6). The isotopic signatures of flood events and background samples from core B 16 in Lake Le Bourget are also similar. This indicates that prior to 1800, the inputs into the lake have remained relatively homogeneous with the proportion of clastic component mainly being a function of the palaeohydrology of the Rhone River. Early human modification (deforestation and agriculture) of the lake catchment before the 1800 s appears to have had little influence on the source of <b>clastic</b> <b>sediments...</b>|$|R
