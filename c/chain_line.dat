50|$|In the {{offshore}} industry the word catenary {{is used as}} an adjective or noun with a meaning wider than is its historical meaning in mathematics. Thus, an SCR that uses a rigid, steel pipe that has a considerable bending stiffness {{is described as a}} catenary. That is because in the scale of depth of the ocean, the bending stiffness of a rigid pipe has little effect on the shape of the suspended span of an SCR. The shape assumed by the SCR is controlled mainly by weight, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces due to currents and waves. Thus, in spite of using conventional, rigid steel pipe, the shape of an SCR can be closely approximated with the use of ideal catenary equations, used historically to describe the shape of a chain suspended between points in space. A <b>chain</b> <b>line</b> has by definition a zero bending stiffness and those described with the ideal catenary equations use infinitesimally short links.|$|E

40|$|We {{start from}} two closure {{operators}} defined on {{the elements of}} a special kind of partially ordered sets, called causal nets. Causal nets are used to model histories of concurrent processes, recording occurrences of local states and of events. If every maximal <b>chain</b> (<b>line)</b> of such a partially ordered set meets every maximal antichain (cut), then the two closure operators coincide, and generate a complete orthomodular lattice. In this paper we recall that, for any closed set in this lattice, every line meets either it or its orthocomplement in the lattice, and show that to any line, a two-valued state on the lattice can be associated. Starting from this result, we delineate a logical language whose formulas are interpreted over closed sets of a causal net, where every line induces an assignment of truth values to formulas. The resulting logic is non-classical; we show that maximal antichains in a causal net are associated to Boolean (hence "classical") substructures of the overall quantum logic.

Background An ultimate objective of technical examination of laid papers is to help determine their date and location of manufacture. Prior to the mid- 18 th century laid papers were made by scooping paper pulp with a mold comprised of a screen within a rectangular wooden frame (Hunter, 1978) (Loeber, 1982). The screen allowed the water to drain from the pulp leaving {{a sheet of paper}} – sized by the borders of the frame – that would be removed to dry. The mold-based procedure for producing laid papers described in (Hunter, 1978) and (Loeber, 1982), leaves impressed features, including chain and laid lines and watermarks, detectable as thinner locations on a sheet of paper. Transmitted light photographs and beta-radiographs are often proposed for revealing these impressions as the thinner portions of the paper impede the signal less and therefore stand out in the image produced. Transmitted light photographs have the disadvantag...|$|E
40|$|For {{years it}} has been customary, in the {{prediction}} the Low Frequency (LF) dynamic behaviour of moored offshore structures, {{to assume that the}} mooring system only influences the restoring force characteristics. The contribution of the mooring system to the total system damping was neglected. Research and model tests in recent years have shown that mooring line damping can be an important contributor to the total system damping of the LF-surge or sway motions of moored offshore structures and vessels. A number of tests even showed that mooring line damping can be the major part of the total system damping. In 1986, Huse proposed the following theory. Drag forces normal to the mooring line are assumed to be the main source of energy dissipation due to the motion of the mooring lines through the water. A small offset of the top end of the line (fairlead) can result in large transverse displacements along the mooring line. This is the reason why in some cases considerable drag forces, and thus energy dissipation, can be expected. Given the catenary configuration of the mooring line it is possible to calculate the energy dissipated by the line {{in the case of a}} LF-sinusoidal surge motion of the top end of the line. A simplified calculation is possible on the assumption of a quasi-static response, implying that the configuration of the mooring line stays catenary at all times during the oscillation. In the present study, an analytical model by Huse to calculate the dissipated energy per cycle has been derived. The verification of this model is performed by means of experiments. The experiments have been executed in the towing tank of the Ships Hydromechanical Laboratory, Delft, were the top end of a modelled <b>chain</b> <b>line</b> was forced into a horizontal, LF-sinusoidal oscillation. A wide spectrum of catenary configurations of a single mooring line were tested for a number of top end oscillations at different frequencies. During each test run, the in-line tension fluctuations were measured. By integrating the scalar product of the measured in-line tension with the instantaneous top end velocity over one full period of oscillation, the total dissipated energy per cycle is obtained. The hydrodynamic model has been verified by comparison with the measured energy dissipations. Two methods for the numerical evaluation of this model are executed. The results of a graphical calculation method, developed by Huse in 1988, and the results of an analytical version of the current investigation, have been verified. The results of Huse's graphs did not agree with the verification test, while the results of the current investigation, which were based on a direct numerical evaluation of Huse's theory, corresponded very well. The source of the apparent errors in the graphical results of Huse are not yet known. The presented hydrodynamic model for the calculation of the energy dissipation during one surge cycle, due to drag forces normal to the mooring lines, describes the measured dissipated energy very well. This model is especially considered a useful tool in the description of LF-dynamics of moored floating structures, when the WF motions are very small compared to the LF-motions of the structure. We can conclude that the influence of mooring line damping for moored structures in low seastates can be analysed very well with the presented model.
