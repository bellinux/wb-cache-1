5|$|A {{murder by}} cyanide was sensational news in Washington. When another tainted bottle {{from the same}} lot {{was found in a}} grocery store in nearby Kent, Washington, the {{manufacturers}} of Excedrin, Bristol-Myers, responded to the discovery with a heavily publicized recall of all Extra-Strength Excedrin products in the Seattle, Washington area, and a group of drug companies <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> offer a $300,000 reward for the capture of the person responsible.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.|$|E

5|$|Through {{most of the}} Archean Eon, the Earth had a heat {{production}} at least twice that of the present, which caused tectonic processes to be more active. As a result, plates and continents were smaller. No broad blocks as old as 3Ga are found in Precambrian shields. Toward {{the end of the}} Archean, however, some of these blocks or terranes <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> form larger blocks welded together by greenstone belts.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> work in {{grassroots}} political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E

5|$|Nan Chiau High School commemorated its 70th {{anniversary in}} 2017 along with Nan Chiau Primary School (its former {{ancillary}} primary section before 2001). On 27 January 2017, {{a total of}} 3,398 staff and students both institutions <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> craft knots on a triple-ring with red strings, which resembles the school logo. The event set a national record for the most people making knotted rings together. A dedicated maker-space was also opened on 10 March 2017. Named The Nest, the tools equipped space allow students to design, construct or modify meaningful or handy items in their own accord.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Literary Theatre project {{lasted until}} 1901, when it {{collapsed}} owing {{to lack of}} funding. In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, John Millington Synge, Æ, Annie Horniman and William and Frank Fay <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> form the Irish National Theatre Society. The first performances staged by the society {{took place in a}} building called the Molesworth Hall. When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting {{to meet the needs of}} the society.|$|E

5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E
5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the wall of his home office.|$|E
5|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats on an open field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. In the late Anglo-Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead <b>came</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly, called demesne land, {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the 11th century, a market economy was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built to grind flour, freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|E
