5000|$|There {{are many}} {{difficulties}} {{in creating a}} comprehensive response. [...] It is argued that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue.</b> Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures. [...] MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health. [...] These targets are significantly off-track.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{policy is}} still the most {{important}} <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> in climate and economic policies. Implementation of Green Policy would see electricity generation from 100 percent renewable sources as early as 2040. The development of renewable energy and combined heat and power is also a great opportunity for technical and economic innovation. Solar industry and environmental technologies are already a significant part of key industries providing jobs which need to be developed and promoted vigorously. In addition, a priority of green energy policy is increasing the thermal insulation and energy efficiency of homes, the phaseout of all nuclear energy generation with possible high-efficiency gas-fired power plants operational during the transition phase.|$|E

She has spoken on the issue of missing persons at countless public forums, including the United Nations and the US Congress, and she has been interviewed by the BBC, the Guardian, the New York Times, the Financial Times, the Economist and many other media outlets, as well as participating in TV and film documentaries.

50|$|The Division of 'Science Policy is {{responsible}} for functions of the office related to science policy, programs and issues and initiatives that are heavily science-oriented, including public health issues that involve complex or rapidly evolving science and technology issues. Areas include public health emergency preparedness, biomedical research policy, drug safety, food safety, pandemic preparedness, emerging infectious diseases, prescription drug issues, personalized health care advances and related topics. It works closely with and {{is responsible}} for analytical responsibilities relating to the HHS science agencies National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and for <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> areas. The Division fosters efforts across HHS toward ensuring that the science components of proposed regulations, legislation, plans, budgets and other policy initiatives are coordinated and meet high standards of science quality and integrity.

40|$|Enterprise {{development}} programs recognize &# 039;gender&# 039; {{as an important}} <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue.</b> Strategy to address gender, however, is loosely defined with interpretations varying across agencies. Many such programs consider &# 039;gender&# 039; more like an &# 039;annex&# 039; rather than effectively addressing gender issues in the project design, with appropriate provisions for gender mainstreaming. In spite {{of the importance of}} research on the role of enterprise development initiatives implementing BDS market development approach to facilitating women&# 039;s entrepreneurship and economic growth, the issue has not been adequately studied. Further, academic research with data from such programs is almost non-existent. This paper makes an attempt to address this research gap by presenting data on how {{development programs}} address or struggle to address gender as a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue.</b> It further builds on data of 120 male and female entrepreneurs and business development service providers. The paper argues that addressing gender should often be a matter of &# 039;choice&# 039; for impact, outreach and sustainability and not always of &# 039;cost effectiveness&# 039; of program interventions...|$|E

40|$|The European Union's {{efforts for}} poverty {{reduction}} {{are based on}} the principle of Sustainable Human Development. Meeting the terms of this principle entails the consideration of aspects of general interest, known as "cross-cutting issues", at all levels of intervention. <b>Cross-cutting</b> <b>issues</b> comprise issues like human rights, gender equity, environmental concern, democracy as a social value, or the participation and empowerment of the beneficiaries of development. These issues concern social phenomena that are difficult to isolate in time or capture empirically, causing operational difficulties when projects are subjected to evaluation. Traditional methods of project evaluation, such as Cost Benefit Analysis or the Logic Framework, struggle to incorporate impacts that are difficult to measure or estimate in terms of indicators or monetary value. Therefore, in the field work at a rural development programme located in Bolivia, a need arose spontaneously to find and implement an approach that, complementary to traditional methods of project evaluation, could allow project managers {{to keep an eye on}} project performances in terms of <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issues.</b> This article describes how the MACBETH multicriteria approach was implemented in practice, in order to help an important rural development programme build a project evaluation tool, taking into account <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issues</b> through a series of interviews and decision conferences attended by specialists and the programme staff...|$|R

40|$|The water {{crisis is}} a crisis of governance. A {{literature}} review reveals that this crisis concerns definitional issues, issues of ownership and access, boundary issues, the multiple uses of water, and the levels at which water should be managed. Paradigms for managing water have evolved from integrated water resource management through more experimental and learning based adaptive governance to understanding that water is not a sector but a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> and should perhaps be dealt with through the ‘nexus’ approach. The literature reveals a toolbox of policy instruments, infrastructures and institutions for managing water but concludes that solutions need to be crafted in a context relevant manner taking the relevant drivers of water use and misuse into account...|$|E
