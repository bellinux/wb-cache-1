This research is to determine the effectiveness of combined electro-Fenton and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) method on the removal of SS, <b>colour,</b> <b>COD</b> and NH 3 -N. The experimental involved three major parts were coagulation-flocculation, electro-Fenton and SBR method. This process could be operated independently in a batch mode and optimum conditions for each treatment were identified. In the combined process, leachate was first fed to coagulation-flocculation for pre-treatment. Then, the effluent from that process was oxidized in electro-Fenton process. The final process is the effluent of leachate was fed to a SBR method. The combined treatment was operated under the optimum conditions for all the processes. The result of coagulation-flocculation shown PAC is more effective at 2500 mg/L of optimum dosage. After coagulation-flocculation process, the removal of SS, <b>colour,</b> <b>COD</b> and NH 3 -N were 80 %, 77 %, 61 % and 35 % respectively.

Chemical analysis data (2005 to 2007) for head of works samples available in the municipal database were combined with flow balances on the WWTW catchments to determine the industrial effluent contributions to pollutant loads to these WWTWs.

Most of these dyes have complex structures that resist degradation in conventional wastewater treatment process. Due to these factors, it is an urgent need to find a way to preserve the environment while keeping the economic growing. In this study, the removal of C. I Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) and C.

FTIR confirms the existence of functional group and interaction occurred between dyes and esterquat surfactant. The Critical Micelle Concentration of PBE and VBE surfactant obtained was at range of 93 to 97 mg/L and 152 to 159 mg/L via conductivity method and UV-Vis spectrophotometric method. It is verified that the developed simplified method for analysis of surfactant concentration is in a good agreement with the existing colourimetric method. The micelles was formed in vesicle arrangement with particle diameter at size range from 140 to 1500 nm. The MEMF process was performed by using hydrophilic mixed cellulose esters microfiltration membrane (MCE) with pore size of 0. 45 |im. Results obtained in MEMF study using PBE and VBE surfactant shows almost complete decolourization of RB 5 and R 016 and confirms the existence of competitive binding interaction between RB 5 and R 016. The best operating condition obtained for MEMF was achieved at surfactant concentration of 2 CMC, pressure of 150 kPa, stirring speed of 200 rpm and initial pH of 5. 5 (unadjusted pH).

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{evaluates the}} {{treatment}} of textile dyeing wastewater using new composites as adsorbents and / or heterogeneous catalysts for Modified UV-Fenton oxidation. The efficiency of the process was explored {{as a function of}} the experimental parameters: pH, hydrogen peroxide concentration and Steel scrap catalyst content. The composites with high Steel scrap content were effective to adsorb <b>colour</b> and <b>COD</b> in textile dyeing wastewater, and the adsorptive capacity increased with the superficial iron concentration. These Steel scrap was also used as heterogeneous catalyst and had the advantage of being effective at pH 3. 0 with a consumption of H 2 O 2 lower then required by the homogeneous Fenton process.

40|$|Textile dye wastewaters are {{characterized}} by strong colour, salts and other additives, high pH, temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biodegradable materials. Being aesthetically and environmentally unacceptable, these wastewaters need to be treated before their discharge. Anaerobic bioprocesses have been proposed as being environmentally friendly and relatively cheap; however, when applied to real effluent with a complex composition, they can fail. In this study, a photoreactor combining UV light and TiO 2, immobilized in cellulosic fabric, was applied {{for the treatment of}} two industrial textile wastewaters. High <b>colour</b> and <b>COD</b> removal, and detoxification, were achieved for both wastewaters, at controlled pH of 5. 5. Effluents showed very poor biodegradability due to their complex composition; thus, the proposed process is an efficient alternative...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to compare the efficiency of biological and chemical-physical treatments for the removal of organic azo dyes in the textile wastewater. Regarding the biological reduction of the wastewater colour the anaerobic/aerobic (ANA/AER) sequential step-treatment provides the best reductions in <b>colour</b> and <b>COD.</b> A lab-scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with synthetic wastewater and mono-azo dye (at the initial concentration of 25 mg/l) was used achieving 84 % colour reduction and 82 % COD removal. Chemical-physical treatments were performed using the oxidative method with Fenton's reagent and adsorption on the activated carbon achieving respectively colour reduction over 90 % (from the initial concentration of 250 mg/l) and 155 mg col/g GAC total adsorption capacity (from the initial concentration of 1 g/l) ...|$|R
40|$|Palm oil {{is now one}} of the top few {{edible oils}} in the world and will be leading player in the oil and fats market. However, palm oil mills {{generate}} large amount of by-product such as liquid effluent which requires effective management practices to minimize their negative impact on the environment. Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is a highly polluted wastewater that pollutes the natural environment directly due to its high chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), phenol and color concentration as well as unpleasant odors. This study was conducted to treat colour of final discharge POME using single bacterial culture. The processes being biological rely on suitable bacteria to break down the organic pollutants. The bacteria were originally isolated from palm oil mill sludge. The initial part of the research was selection of bacteria that can grow best in POME and screening the highest percentage of colour removal bacteria. Primary isolation is effected by streaking sample on the surface of agar containing nutrient broth and POME. The bacterium that showed the maximum reduction of colour was characterized from the genus Bacillus spp. via biochemical test. Parameters such as <b>colour,</b> <b>COD,</b> ammoniacal nitrogen, phenolic compound, lignin and pH were monitored. During the treatment, the maximum removal of colour was obtained up to 56 % (2480 ADMI), COD removal of 26 % (788 mg/L), ammoniacal nitrogen of 14 % (42 mg/L), phenolic compound of 77 % (56 mg/L) and lignin of 79 % (25 mg/L) within 6 days. The pH of wastewater was in alkaline condition and increased from pH 9. 36 to pH 9. 59. In conclusion, biological treatment could potentially contribute in decolourisation of POME by using single bacteria itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{performance of}} potassium ferrate(VI), ferric sulphate and aluminium sulphate {{for the removal}} of turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (<b>COD),</b> <b>colour</b> (as Vis 400 -abs) and bacteria in sewage treatment was evaluated. For coagulation and disinfection of sewage, potassium ferrate(VI) can remove more organic contaminants, COD and bacteria in comparison with the other two coagulants for the same doses used. Also, potassium ferrate(VI) produces less sludge volume and removes more contaminants, which should make subsequent sludge treatment easier...|$|R
30|$|From the batch study, it was {{observed}} that Langmuir fit for ion metals is good with correlation coefficient R 2 in the range of 0.85 – 0.97. The maximum monolayer coverage capacities, Q o, increased proportional to the amount of resin dosage. However, the adsorption of ammonia nitrogen, <b>colour</b> and <b>COD</b> was not applicable to the Langmuir isotherm model. Compared to Langmuir isotherm, Freundlich isotherm showed better fit to the experiment data. The adsorption intensity coefficient n, lying between 0.2287 and 0.8002 for all the adsorbates studied, represents good sorption potential and high affinity of the Indion MB 6 SR mixed bed resin. For all the systems studied, the intraparticle diffusion model, pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order isotherm models provide the best correlation of the experimental data. Conclusively, the analysis provided important information for designing and modelling the processes.|$|R
