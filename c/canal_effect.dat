40|$|A Vertigem Posicional Paroxística Benigna (VPPB) é uma das mais freqüentes patologias do sistema {{vestibular}} e é caracterizada por episódios de vertigens recorrentes desencadeados por movimentos da cabeça ou mudanças posturais. Há várias opções para o seu tratamento, porém as efetividades terapêuticas das mesmas permanecem controversas. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a efetividade terapêutica das manobras específicas disponíveis para o tratamento da VPPB. METODOLOGIA: Realizou-se uma busca eletrônica nas principais bases de dados, selecionando-se estudos clínicos randomizados envolvendo adultos com diagnóstico de VPPB confirmado com o teste de Dix-Hallpike e tratamento com manobras específicas (Epley ou Semont, por exemplo). Considerou-se como desfecho clínico a negativação do teste de Dix-Hallpike e a melhora das queixas subjetivas. Agruparam-se em metanálise os estudos com Escala de Jadad igual ou superior a três. RESULTADOS: Cinco estudos clínicos preencheram os critérios de inclusão, ou seja, ensaios randomizados de fase I comparando a manobra de Epley com placebos e controles. A metanálise mostra evidência dos efeitos benéficos da manobra de Epley para o tratamento do canal semicircular posterior (magnitude do efeito de 0, 11 [IC 95 % 0. 05, 0. 26] de melhora objetiva (Dix-Halpike) após uma semana, 0. 24 [IC 95 % 0. 13, 0. 45] após um mês e 0. 16 [IC 95 % 0. 08, 0. 33] de melhora referida pelos pacientes após a primeira semana). CONCLUSÃO: Evidencia-se boa eficácia clínica da manobra de Epley para o tratamento da VPPB do canal semicircular posterior. Contrariamente, trabalhos com a manobra de Semont e as propostas de manejo dos demais canais semicirculares não obtiveram qualidade metodológica satisfatória, não sendo possível demonstrar a efetividade dos mesmos.

40|$|International audienceThe brain areas {{activated}} by bilateral galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In six human volunteers, GVS led to activation {{in the region}} of the temporoparietal junction, the central sulcus, and the anterior interior intraparietal sulcus, which may correspond to macaque areas PIVC, 3 aV, and 2 v, respectively. In addition, activation was found in premotor regions of the frontal lobe, presumably analogous to areas 6 pa and 8 a in the monkey. Since these areas were not detected in previous studies using caloric vestibular stimulation, they could be related to the modulation of otolith afferent activity by GVS. However, the simple paradigm used did not allow separation of the otolithic and semicircular <b>canal</b> <b>effects</b> of GVS. Further studies must be performed to clarify the question of cortical representation of the otolithic information in the human and monkey brain...|$|R

Also, it seems that investments and interventions in these two areas can have medium-term significant impact on opportunity entrepreneurship. Furthermore, from the findings in the entrepreneurship literature, it appears that opportunity entrepreneurship is extremely difficult to influence, and therefore the fact that the present paper demonstrates some <b>canal</b> <b>effects</b> is fascinating. In addition, the present paper demonstrates that the wider social and political environment might affect opportunity entrepreneurship. For example, the level of risk and uncertainty in the economy can be considered as a productive factor in shaping the economic conditions that affect opportunity entrepreneurship.

40|$|The G-excess {{illusion}} {{is increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} cause of aviation mishaps especially when pilots perform high-speed, steeply banked turns at low altitudes. Centrifuge studies of this illusion have examined the perception of subject orientation and/or target displacement during maintained hypergravity with the subject's head held stationary. The transient illusory perceptions produced by moving the head in hypergravity are difficult to study onboard centrifuges because the high angular velocity ensures the presence of strong Coriolis cross-coupled semicircular <b>canal</b> <b>effects</b> that mask immediate transient otolith-organ effects. The present study reports perceptions following head movements in hypergravity produced by high-speed aircraft maintaining a banked attitude with low angular velocity to minimize cross-coupled effects. Methods: Fourteen subjects flew on the NASA KC- 135 and were exposed to resultant gravity forces of 1. 3, 1. 5, and 1. 8 G for 3 minute periods. On command, seated subjects made controlled head movements in roll, pitch, and yaw at 30 second intervals both in the dark and with faint targets at a distance of 5 feet. Results: head movement produced transient perception of target displacement and velocity at levels as low as 1. 3 G. Reports of target velocity without appropriate corresponding displacement were common. At 1. 8 G when yaw head movements were made from a face down position, 4 subjects reported oscillatory rotational target displacement with fast and slow alternating components suggestive of torsional nystagmus. Head movements evoked symptoms of nausea in most subjects, with 2 subjects and 1 observer vomiting. Conclusions: The transient percepts present conflicting signals, which introduced confusion in target and subject orientation. Repeated head movements in hypergravity generate nausea by mechanisms distinct from cross-coupled Coriolis effects...|$|R

40|$|Everglades {{periphyton}} mats are tightly-coupled autotrophic (algae and cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic (eubacteria, fungi and microinvertebrates) microbial assemblages. We {{investigated the}} effect of water column total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, water depth and hydroperiod on periphyton of net production, respiration, nutrient content, and biomass. Our study sites were located along four transects that extended southward with freshwater sheetflow through sawgrass-dominated marsh. The water source {{for two of the}} transects were canal-driven and anchored at canal inputs. The two other transects were rain-driven (ombrotrophic) and began in sawgrass-dominated marsh. Periphyton dynamics were examined for upstream and downstream effects within and across the four transects. Although all study sites were characterized as short hydroperiod and phosphorus-limited oligotrophic, they represent gradients of hydrologic regime, water source and water quality of the southern Everglades. Average periphyton net production of 1. 08 mg C AFDW− 1 h− 1 and periphyton whole system respiration of 0. 38 mg C AFDW− 1 h− 1 rates were net autotrophic. Biomass was generally highest at ombrotrophic sites and sites downstream of canal inputs. Mean biomass over all our study sites was high, 1517. 30 g AFDW m− 2. Periphyton was phosphorus-limited. Average periphyton total phosphorus content was 137. 15 μg P g− 1 and average periphyton total N:P ratio was 192 : 1. Periphyton N:P was a sensitive indicator of water source. Even at extremely low mean water total phosphorus concentrations (≤ 0. 21 μmol l− 1), we found <b>canal</b> source <b>effects</b> on periphyton dynamics at sites adjacent to canal inputs, but not downstream of inflows. These <b>canal</b> source <b>effects</b> were most pronounced at the onset of wet season with initial rewetting.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} a research project to investigate vestibular aspects of visual updating in roll-tilted subjects. The focus of the first part is on errors in verticality perception of tilted subjects. Although tilted subjects accurately known how much they are tilted and also know the line orientation relative to their body, they are not able to estimate the line orientation relative to gravity. An important model that tries to explain this relies solely on otolith signals, but other studies suggests that canal signals play a role. Our results confirm that the canals do not play a role at tilt up to about 135 degrees. However, at large tilts a sudden transition to errors of opposite sign occurs. After the transition, we find <b>canal</b> <b>effects</b> and also a strong correlation between verticality perception and body-tilt perception. Our study is the first to thoroughly quantify and discuss these phenomena. The second part of this thesis focuses on another question: how are signals of the otoliths and semicircular canals combined to update the internal representation of visual space? We tested visual stability during dynamic head rotations at different frequencies, in conditions with and without otolith cues. Our results show that subjects severely underestimate head rotation. An illusory translation percept is present at higher frequencies. The results shows that the canal contribution to visual orientation perception has high-pass characteristics. The otolith contribution is low-pass and relatively small. Current models cannot explain these findings. We suggest that the brain forms two estimates of head tilt, one based on otolith signals and one based on canal signals, and that the final estimate is a weighted sum of these two. The violations of visual position constancy are compatible with leaky integration of an internal estimate of head acceleration...|$|R

40|$|The planned Seine Scheldt West canal {{will provide}} a viable inland {{waterway}} connection of the Port of Zeebruges with the Seine-Scheldt liaison and the (Western) European waterway network. An extensive feasibility study was carried out, showing that from cost-benefit and technical point of view, a connection along the existing Derivation canal of the Lys is the most feasible route. The Lys itself, the most important affluent of the Scheldt, is {{the backbone of the}} Seine Scheldt liaison in the Scheldt Basin. This paper is only dealing with the aspects of salt intrusion, which is a consequence of connecting the canal to the Zeebruges Port. Different mathematical models were used to describe the effects of constructing this canal, allowing stretched Vb convoys on the water system, including the effect of salt intrusion. Salt flux to the canal was calculated {{on the basis of a}} measurement campaign, and used as input to calibrate diffusion and dispersion parameters for a scenario model of the new canal. Assuming reduced fluxes for a Dunkirk type lock, average canal salinity was calculated, which on its turn was used as a boundary condition for a density dependent groundwater model. The surface water model shows that with limited discharges the saline front can be stopped in the polder area where actually already saline groundwater occurs. The groundwater model shows that in the connection area of the Port, where a new canal must be constructed with a much higher canal head than the head of the surrounding groundwater, the deeper saline groundwater levels are mobilized and drained by the hydrographic network. This results in an increase of saline water concentrations near the new canal, while along the existing <b>canal</b> <b>effects</b> are fairly limited. Measures against salt intrusion imply a certain amount of fresh water use. As the own catchment is limited in size, in periods of drought additional water resources must be addressed in order to supply the necessary fresh water. Theoretically, these resources can be created and filled up with fresh water of flood events which would normally be diverted through the canal. In fact the canal was built in the second half of the 19 th century to relieve the area of Ghent from floodings. Through the widening and deepening this function of the canal will even improve. Mathematical models were used to quantify the reduction of risk for flooding, which was included as a benefit in the cost-benefit analysis. Although the discharges required to prevent saline intrusion are rather limited (in the order of 1 m³/s) and hardly matter on the whole of transfers, the claims on the water resources in the densely populated Scheldt basin are high and still increasing. In the context of the expected dryer summers due to global warming, there is a need to fit any new project in a global water resources management strategy on basin scale, in order to make it socially acceptable...|$|R

Ag-Zn-MCSNs showed no significantly negative effects on either the flexural strength or the modulus of elasticity of dentin, while CH decreased the flexural strength of dentin significantly (P< 0. 05). These findings suggested that Ag and Zn {{can be incorporated into}} MCSNs using a template method, and the Ag-Zn-MCSNs may be developed into a new disinfectant for the root canal and dentinal tubules...|$|R
50|$|Hood Canal’s hypoxic {{state has}} had devastating {{effects on the}} sub-basin’s biodiversity. Valuable {{commercial}} species such as geoduck clam and Dungeness crab may be adversely affected by hypoxic conditions. Critically low oxygen levels, due to increased bacterial growth, were observed in the lower portion of Hood Canal {{during the summer months}} of 2004 and 2005. A low dissolved oxygen content in Anna’s Bay and Lynch Cove {{is believed to have been}} responsible for the corresponding decline in spot shrimp catch by Skokomish Nation fishers within the same period of time. In 2010, there was a massive fish kill in the southern part of Hood Canal. Hundreds of fish and thousands of shrimp were found washed up onto the shore. Jan Newton, a local oceanographer, concluded that the water contained less than 1 milliliter per liter of dissolved oxygen and that such a low level is extremely stressful, often lethal, to the marine life in Hood <b>Canal.</b> The <b>effects</b> of Hood <b>Canal’s</b> hypoxic conditions are clearly seen by the public though massive fish kills, but it is important to identify other harmful impacts resulting from a lack of oxygen in the basin. Eelgrass beds, which are nurseries for salmon and crab, have declined more in Hood Canal than any other area of the Puget Sound. Bottom dwelling rockfish have also seen a decline due to a lack of eelgrass. Other notable cases of hypoxia and its adverse effects on biodiversity include the large-scale hypoxic zone that appears in the Gulf of Mexico each summer.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the root canal morphology of permanent mandibular incisor teeth in the Indian subpopulation with the use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: CBCT images of 200 patients with 800 permanent mandibular incisors, fulfilling necessary inclusion criteria and aged 18 to 60 years were evaluated. The number of roots, number of root canals and canal configuration were investigated and then classified according to Vertucci’s classification of root <b>canals.</b> The <b>effect</b> of gender on the incidence of root canal morphology was also investigated. RESULTS: All the permanent mandibular incisors had a single root. The majority of mandibular incisors (66. 5 %) had a single root with a single canal. The prevalence of second canals was as follows: right central incisor - 33. 5 %, left central incisor - 30 %, right lateral incisors - 33. 5 % and left lateral incisor - 36. 5 %. According to gender, 15. 2 % of men and 20. 4 % of women had a second root canal. Type 1 Vertucci configuration was most prevalent, followed by type 3, type 2, type 5 and type 4 in that order. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 Vertucci's classification (64. 5 %) was the most prevalent canal configuration in the mandibular anterior teeth in the Indian population. Type 5 Vertucci's classification was the most frequently observed canal configuration of the two-canalled teeth. CBCT is an excellent imaging modality for detection of different canal configurations of mandibular incisors...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microgravity}} on frog semicircular canals {{have been studied}} by electrophysiological and morphological approaches. Reduced gravity (microG) was simulated by a “random positioning machine” (RPM) which continually and randomly modified the orientation in space of the anesthetized animal. As this procedure stimulates the semicircular <b>canals,</b> the <b>effect</b> of altered gravity was isolated by comparing microG-treatment with an identical rotary stimulation {{in the presence of}} normogravity (normoG). Electrophysiological experiments were performed in the isolated labyrinth, extracted from the animals after the treatment and mounted on a turntable. Junctional activity was measured by recording quantal events (mEPSPs) and spikes from the afferent fibers close to the junction, at rest and during rotational stimulation. MicroG treated animals displayed a marked decrease in the frequency of resting and evoked mEPSP discharge, versus both control and normoG (mean decrease ~ 50 %). Spike discharge was also depressed: 57 % of microG-treated frogs displayed no spikes at rest and during rotation at 0. 1 Hz, vs. 23 - 31 % of control or normoG frogs. Among the firing units, during one cycle of sinusoidal rotation at 0. 1 Hz microG treated units emitted an average of 41. 8 +/- 8. 06 spikes, vs. 77. 2 +/- 8. 19 in controls. Patch-clamp analysis on dissociated hair cells revealed altered Ca 2 + handling, after microG, consistent with and supportive of the specificity of microG effects. Marked morphological signs of cellular suffering were observed after microG, mainly in {{the central part of the}} sensory epithelium. Functional changes due to microgravity were reversible within a few days...|$|R
40|$|In open {{channels}} and water supply canals, the brusque operation of control valves and gate may induce large unsteady flow motion called surges. To date the literature {{focused on the}} propagation of surges in smooth <b>canals,</b> ignoring the <b>effects</b> of large roughness and debris. Herein a physical study was conducted under controlled flow conditions to study the turbulent mixing in the close vicinity of a large bed roughness element during the upstream propagation of positive surges. Detailed free-surface and instantaneous velocity measurements were conducted with and without the cylindrical element. For some tests, the experiments were repeated 25 times {{and the results were}} ensemble-averaged. The data suggested that the positive surge propagation was associated with large instantaneous free-surface fluctuations for all investigated flow conditions. The velocity measurements showed large variations in longitudinal velocity during the surge generation, as well as large fluctuations of all velocity components. The presence of the large bed element modified the velocity fluctuations and unsteady Reynolds stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} element. The present results implied the potential for bed scour around the element during surge propagation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Abnormalities {{of central}} sensory {{processing}} {{may play a}} role in the pathogenesis of chronic pain. The Chiari I malformation is a congenital hindbrain anomaly characterized by protrusion of the cerebellar tonsils into the upper cervical <b>canal,</b> with variable <b>effects</b> on the lower brain stem and cervical cord. The purpose of this study was to compare sensory function and pain among patients with chronic pain who had these disorders incidentally diagnosed, to assess the effect on pain in these patients in comparison with those without central nervous system disease. Design: Retrospective study in which pain, mood, and sensory function in 32 patients with chronic pain who had mild Chiari I malformation were compared with that in 53 patients with chronic pain who had moderate to severe compression of the cervical spinal cord and 52 patients with chronic pain who had no apparent central nervous system disorder. Data had been collected previously as part of standard clini-cal assessments, including clinical neurological examinations, quantitative sensory testing, pain drawings, and psychometric testing with the Symptom Checklist 90. Patients: All subjects were patients of a hospital-based pain management practic...|$|R
40|$|Polymyxin E is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} oral drug for flora suppression of the gastrointestinal <b>canal.</b> The suppression <b>effect</b> is dose dependent because polymyxin E is moderately inactivated by faecal and food compounds. Three oral polymyxin E doses (150, 300, 600 mg daily) were given to six volunteers for 6 days. The Enterobacteriaceae suppression effect was compared {{by means of the}} suppression index i. e. ratio of total number of faecal samples free of Enterobacteriaceae to the total number of faecal samples. The impact on the indigenous (mostly anaerobic) flora was measured in four ways: (i) beta-aspartylglycine content; (ii) volatile fatty acid pattern; (iii) yeast overgrowth and (iv) Streptococcus faecalis decrease. Enterobacteriaceae suppression was most successful during 600 mg oral polymyxin E (suppression indices during 150, 300 and 600 mg were 0. 32, 0. 55 and 0. 89 respectively). None of the four markers of indigenous flora alterations were positive. However, using this dosage half of the volunteers suffered rather severe gastrointestinal side-effects. Oral polymyxin E in a dosage of minimum 600 mg daily seems to possess the ideal properties of a flora suppression agent, if the gastrointestinal side-effects could be mitigated...|$|R
