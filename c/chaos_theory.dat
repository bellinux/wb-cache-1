40|$|<b>Chaos</b> <b>theories</b> {{developed}} {{in the last three}} decades have made very important contributions to our understanding of dynamical systems and natural phenomena. The meaning of chaos in the current theories and in the past is somewhat different from each other. In this work, the properties of dynamical systems and the evolution of chaotic systems were discussed in terms of the views of ancient philosophers. The meaning of chaos in Anaximenes' philosophy and its role in the Ancient natural philosophy has been discussed in relation to other natural philosophers such as of Anaximander, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Leucippus (i. e. atomists) and Aristotle. In addition, the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics and the current <b>chaos</b> <b>theories</b> were discussed in relation to the views in Ancient natural philosophy. The roots of the scientific concepts such as randomness, autocatalysis, nonlinear growth, information, pattern, etc. in the Ancient natural philosophy were investigated. chaos, randomness, dynamical systems, natural philosophy, ancient philosophy, information, biological evolution, nonlinearity...|$|R
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. <b>Chaos</b> <b>theory</b> is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

In the final match of round two, Team TNA faced Team Mexico. Team TNA's Kaz defeated Team Mexico's Ultimo Guerrero in 5 minutes. Kaz won the bout by pinfall after slamming Guerrero face-first onto the mat with his signature Wave of the Future maneuver.

25|$|<b>Chaos</b> <b>theory</b> {{has been}} used for many years in cryptography. In the past few decades, chaos and {{nonlinear}} dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of cryptographic primitives. These algorithms include image encryption algorithms, hash functions, secure pseudo-random number generators, stream ciphers, watermarking and steganography. The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys. From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by <b>chaos</b> <b>theory.</b> Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with <b>chaos</b> <b>theory,</b> offers a way to encrypt images and other information. Many of the DNA-Chaos cryptographic algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{models have}} been vitally {{important}} {{in the development of}} technologies in building engineering. A literature review identifies that linear models are the most widely used building simulation models. The advent of intelligent buildings has added new challenges in the application of the existing models as an intelligent building requires learning and self-adjusting capabilities based on environmental and occupants' factors. It is therefore argued that the linearity is an impropriate basis for any model of either complex building systems or occupant behaviours for control or whatever purpose. <b>Chaos</b> and complexity <b>theory</b> reflects nonlinear dynamic properties of the intelligent systems excised by occupants and environment and has been used widely in modelling various engineering, natural and social systems. It is proposed that <b>chaos</b> and complexity <b>theory</b> be applied to study intelligent buildings. This paper gives a brief description of <b>chaos</b> and complexity <b>theory</b> and presents its current positioning, recent developments in building engineering research and future potential applications to intelligent building studies, which provides a bridge between <b>chaos</b> and complexity <b>theory</b> and intelligent building research...|$|R
