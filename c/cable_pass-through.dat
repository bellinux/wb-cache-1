Even though the Game Boy Advance and the DS are region-free, Japanese e-Reader cards work only on Japanese e-Readers and North American e-Reader cards will only work on North American e-Readers. The system will display 'region error' on both systems if a user attempts to use another region's cards on their own device.|$|E
40|$|In 2010, Desert Research and Technology Studies (Desert RATS), NASA's annual field {{exercise}} {{designed to}} test spacesuit and rover technologies, {{will include a}} first generation lunar habitat facility, the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU). The habitat will participate in joint operations in northern Arizona with the Lunar Electric Rover (LER) and {{will be used as}} a multi-use laboratory and working space. A Geology Laboratory or GeoLab is included in the HDU design. Historically, science participation in Desert RATS exercises has supported the technology demonstrations with geological traverse activities that are consistent with preliminary concepts for lunar surface science Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). Next year s HDU demonstration is a starting point to guide the development of requirements for the Lunar Surface Systems Program and test initial operational concepts for an early lunar excursion habitat that would follow geological traverses along with the LER. For the GeoLab, these objectives are specifically applied to support future geological surface science activities. The goal of our GeoLab is to enhance geological science returns with the infrastructure that supports preliminary examination, early analytical characterization of key samples, and high-grading lunar samples for return to Earth [1, 2]. Figure 1 : Inside view schematic of the GeoLab a 1 / 8 section of the HDU, including a glovebox for handling and examining geological samples. Other outfitting facilities are not depicted in this figure. GeoLab Description: The centerpiece of the GeoLab is a glovebox, allowing for samples to be brought into the habitat in a protected environment for preliminary examination (see Fig. 1). The glovebox will be attached to the habitat bulkhead and contain three sample pass-through antechambers that would allow direct transfer of samples from outside the HDU to inside the glovebox. We will evaluate the need for redundant chambers, and other uses for the glovebox antechambers, such as a staging area for additional tools or samples. The sides of the glovebox are designed with instrument ports and additional smaller ports for <b>cable</b> <b>pass-through,</b> imagery feeds and environmental monitoring. This first glovebox version will be equipped with basic tools for manipulating, viewing, and early analysis of samples. The GeoLab was also designed for testing additional analytical instruments in a field setting...|$|E

50|$|The Monster3D {{line was}} based on 3dfx Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 chips which did not contain a 2D engine, {{requiring}} a separate VGA card connected externally using a <b>pass-through</b> <b>cable.</b> When the 3D engine was called into use, the 3dfx-based card would disconnect the 2D pass-through signal and begin driving the display directly. Both Voodoo and Voodoo2 based offerings were in production until the STB-3dfx merger. The series was highly successful as the Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 chipsets introduced consumer-grade 3D graphics into the PC and arcade markets, whereas such capabilities had previously been present primarily in very high-end CAD and graphic design workstations.|$|R

The accessory included a <b>pass-through</b> <b>cable</b> for the PS2 gamepad; when activated, the attached accessory would issue {{a sequence of}} rapidly alternating left-right movement commands to the console, producing a kind of [...] "wiggle stereoscopy" [...] effect additionally aided by the wired LC shutter glasses which worked in sync with these movements. The kit arrived {{too late in the}} product cycle of the console when it was effectively replaced by the PlayStation 3, and only a few games were supported, so it was largely ignored by gamers.|$|R
5000|$|The Voodoo2 (or Voodoo2) {{was a set}} {{of three}} {{specialized}} 3D graphics chips on a single chipset setup, made by 3dfx. It was released in February 1998 {{as a replacement for}} the original Voodoo Graphics chipset. The card ran at a chipset clock rate of 90 MHz and used 100 MHz EDO DRAM, and was available for the PCI interface. The Voodoo2 came in two models, one with 8 MB RAM and one with 12 MB RAM. The 8 MB card had 2 MB of memory per texture mapping unit (TMU) vs. 4 MB on the 12 MB model. The 4 MB framebuffer on both cards supported a maximum screen resolution of 800 Ã— 600, while the increased texture memory on the 12 MB card allowed more detailed textures. Some boards with 8 MB could be upgraded to 12 MB with an additional daughter board. Each of the three chips present on the card had its own 64-bit RAM interface, giving the card a [...] "total" [...] bus width of 192 bits. The Voodoo2 had an increased chip-count compared to the original two-chip Voodoo card. Competing products such as the ATI Rage Pro, NVIDIA RIVA 128, and Rendition Verite 2x00 were single-chip products, each with integrated 2D GUI/VGA accelerators. As with the original Voodoo, the Voodoo2 was a dedicated 3D accelerator, and had to be used in conjunction with a conventional 2D graphics card. It required the same external <b>pass-through</b> <b>cabling</b> familiar to owners of the Voodoo.|$|R
