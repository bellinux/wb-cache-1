60|$|The celebrated zebra {{wood with}} its golden stripes cannot exceed in quaint beauty {{the grain of}} {{unpainted}} chestnut, prepared simply with a coat or two of oil. The butternut has a rich golden brown, the very darling color of painters, a shade so rich, and grain so beautiful, {{that it is of}} itself as charming to look at as a rich picture. The black-walnut, with its heavy depth of tone, works in well as an adjunct; and as to oak, what can we say enough of its quaint and many shadings? Even <b>common</b> <b>pine,</b> which has been considered not decent to look upon till hastily shrouded in a friendly blanket of white paint, has, when oiled and varnished, the beauty of satin-wood. The second quality of pine, which has what are called shakes in it, under this mode of treatment often shows clouds and veins equal in beauty to the choicest woods. The cost of such a finish is greatly less than that of the old method; and it saves those days and weeks of cleaning which are demanded by white paint, while its general tone is softer and more harmonious. Experiments in color may be tried in the combinations of these woods, which at small expense produce the most charming effects.|$|E

50|$|Diprion pini, the <b>common</b> <b>pine</b> sawfly, is a sawfly {{species in}} the genus Diprion.

It affects the Scots, mountain, eastern white, radiata, lodgepole and black pines. Scots pines are not generally killed by a single defoliation, but weakened trees may suffer increased attack by bark beetles, buprestid beetles, and pine weevils, which can kill trees, as can repeated defoliation.|$|E
