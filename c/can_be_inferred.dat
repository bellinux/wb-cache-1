5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred {{several times during}} evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
5|$|More generally, an {{historical}} or literary tradition concerning {{events in the}} time of Djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of Old Kingdom as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from the tombs of Harkuf and Iny. These two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands–Punt and Byblos– under Merenre I and Pepi II and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of Djedkare Isesi.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a radical}} {{distinction}} between things and persons. This is a Kantian standing point from which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>infer</b> that people has to be analyzed with specific philosophical categories, and not with categories elaborated for things.|$|R

5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} {{portrayal of}} Sarah Boyer {{is probably the}} closest character to her portrayal in the novelisation. In the book, her companion was named Vic, not Bob, and in the 1970s series, she was named Anne Tranter. Vic's fate is not revealed in the novelization, but it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that he starved to death. In the 2008 television series, Bob survives his initial abandonment. In the 1970s series, Anne (Sarah in the 2008 version) leaves during Episode 11; in the 2008 version, she dies from a mutated version of the virus.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E

5|$|The smog {{event of}} 1966 {{was preceded by}} two other major smog episodes in New York City: one in November 1953, and one in January–February 1963. Using {{statistical}} analysis that compares {{the number of deaths}} during periods of smog with the number of deaths during the same time in other years, medical scientists led by Leonard Greenburg were able to determine that excess deaths occurred during those smogs, from which it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that the smog caused or contributed to those deaths. An estimated 220–240 deaths were caused by the six-day 1953 smog, and an estimated 300–405 deaths were caused by the two-week 1963 smog. Other episodes of smog had occurred in the city prior to 1966, but were not accompanied by significant excess deaths.|$|E
5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens {{in one or more}} of the sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps {{as far as}} the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited with being the first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach {{at least as far as}} Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part in this land expedition. However, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.|$|E

5|$|Stela 16 {{celebrates the}} {{accession}} {{of a local}} sajal, or Maya leader, at the nearby satellite kingdom of La Mar. Tatiana Proskouriakoff had originally used this stela to misidentify the sixth ajaw of Piedras Negras, assigning the title to the sajal, instead of Ha' K'in Xook. The uniqueness of a La Mar ruler being celebrated on a Piedras Negras stela seems to signify that La Mar had, {{at the time of}} Yo'nal Ahk III and possibly earlier, attained a certain degree of importance in the Piedras Negras hegemony. The front of the stela is eroded, but according to Megan O'Neil, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that the monument had an image of Yo'nal Ahk III on the front, based on comparisons with other stelae at Piedras Negras, like Stelae 6 and 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from the endocast. Large {{olfactory}} bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs {{are comparable to}} large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E

25|$|This is in {{most cases}} conjectural, as most {{auxiliary}} regiments were founded in the Julio-Claudian era (ante 68), while {{the vast majority of}} datable auxiliary records date from the Flavian era onwards (post 70), and of these most from the 2nd century. However, the foundation period <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from other evidence e.g. numeration sequence e.g. Cohors VII Raetorum is attested in the year 38 AD. From this it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that all the Raetorum cohorts with a lower number than VII were also in existence by that date, and so were almost certainly founded in the Augustus/Tiberius period.|$|E
