5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties.</b> He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> here. The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties,</b> musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. She preferred the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, though she could be curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books she had read.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> is a <b>party</b> {{at which}} <b>cocktails</b> are served. It is {{sometimes}} called a [...] "cocktail reception". Women who attend a <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> may wear a cocktail dress. A cocktail hat is sometimes worn as a fashion statement.|$|R
25|$|Informal gatherings and <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> - The hosts often serve small {{open-face}} sandwiches, {{similar to}} those at a Scandinavian smorgasbord, topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth.

25|$|The club holds {{sporting}} {{and social}} functions for {{members and their}} guests. These include golf days, {{a day at the}} races, the Annual first day of the Sydney Test match breakfasts, luncheons, dinners and <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> associated with Test and One-Day International matches. In October 1981, the charity hosted a dinner that brought together every living Olympic and Paralympic Medal winner.|$|E
25|$|The town hosts {{an annual}} festival called the Annual Zihua Sail Fest, which raises {{funds for the}} {{education}} of disadvantaged children in Zihuatanejo. The five-day event takes place in February with more than 100 boats, some {{from as far away as}} Alaska coming into the bay. Events include <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties,</b> concerts, auctions and sailboat races, chili cook offs and street fairs. In 2009, the event raised $640,000 pesos, along with a matching grant and a donation of $20,000 USD by the Rotary Club.|$|E

500|$|The {{hotel has}} several bars, namely the Ritz Bar, Bar Vendôme, Bar Hemingway and the Pool Bar. The Ritz Bar, {{just inside the}} Rue Cambon {{entrance}} on the left, gained a reputation over the years for its glamorous <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> and the unique bartending skills of Frank Meier, head barman from 1921 {{until his death in}} 1947. One of his best-known cocktails was the potent [...] "Rainbow", consisting of anisette, mint, yellow chartreuse, cherry brandy, kümmel, green chartreuse and cognac. The Ritz Bar is designed in the Victorian style with red-velvet armchairs and bar furnishings, a marble fireplace and historic portraits. The Ritz Bar may have been the world's first hotel bar.|$|E
500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties.</b> His elder brother {{recommended}} that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, {{but there was}} no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. I knew right then that I would be a jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were what he had to work hardest on.|$|E
500|$|Joe {{accepts the}} job, and sadly leaves his father. [...] He soon finds himself ministering to hypochondriacs; he is {{required}} to spend time at <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> marked by useless conversation ("Yatata, Yatata, Yatata"). [...] Charlie {{is also part of}} the practice, but the former football star has turned to drink. [...] Joe himself is becoming careless due to the distractions; one mistake is caught by his nurse, Emily, who greatly admires the physician Joe could be ("The Gentleman Is a Dope"). [...] Denby congratulates Joe on his skills, both medical and social. [...] The elder doctor has less time for a nurse, Carrie Middleton, who has worked at his hospital for thirty years and once dated him, but who is involved in a labor protest—Denby orders her fired at the request of Lansdale, an influential trustee and soap manufacturer. [...] Charlie, Joe and Emily comment on the frenetic pace of the Chicago world in which they live ("Allegro").|$|E

2500|$|As {{competition}} among railroads intensified, dining car service {{was taken to}} new levels. When the Santa Fe unveiled its new Pleasure Dome lounge cars in 1951, the railroad introduced the travelling public to the Turquoise Room, promoted as [...] "The only private dining room in the world on rails." [...] The room accommodated 12 guests, and could be reserved anytime for private dinner or <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties,</b> or other special functions. The room was often used by celebrities and dignitaries traveling on the Super Chief.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} crew bars, one named The Pig & Whistle. ("The Pig" [...] for short and a {{tradition}} aboard Cunard ships), Castaways and the Fo'c's'le Club.

Named The Officers Wardroom this area enjoyed forward facing views and was often opened to passengers for <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> hosted by the senior officers. [...] The crew mess was situated at the forward end of One Deck, adjacent to the crew services office.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to the <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> problem that uses a cortronic articial neural network architecture (Hecht-Nielsen, 1998) as the front end of a speech processing system. Our approach is novel in three important respects. First, our method assumes and exploits detailed knowledge of the signals we wish to attend to in the <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> en-vironment. Second, our goal is to provide preprocessing in advance of a pattern recognition system rather than to separate {{one or more of the}} mixed sources explicitly. Third, the neural network model we employ is more biologically feasible than are most other approaches to the <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> problem. Although the focus here is on the <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> prob-lem, the method presented in this study can be applied to other areas of information processing. ¤ To whom all correspondence should be directed a...|$|R
40|$|In <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> {{listening}} scenarios, {{the human}} brain is able to separate competing speech signals. However, the signal processing implemented by the brain to perform <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> listening is not well understood. Here, we trained two separate convolutive autoencoder deep neural networks (DNN) to separate monaural and binaural mixtures of two concurrent speech streams. We then used these DNNs as convolutive deep transform (CDT) devices to perform probabilistic re-synthesis. The CDTs operated directly in the time-domain. Our simulations demonstrate that very simple neural networks are capable of exploiting monaural and binaural information available in a <b>cocktail</b> <b>party</b> listening scenario...|$|R
2500|$|When Santa Fe {{rolled out}} its new [...] "Pleasure Dome"-Lounge cars in 1951, the {{railroad}} introduced the Turquoise Room, promoted as [...] "The only private dining {{room in the}} world on rails". The room accommodated 12 guests, and could be reserved anytime for private dinner or <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties.</b> The room was often used by celebrities and dignitaries. As was the case on other railroads, dining car service was a losing proposition financially. Santa Fe, {{more than any of}} its competitors, took the concept of using on-board meal service as a [...] "loss leader" [...] to the highest level to attract and retain customers. The name Super Chief became synonymous with the finest fare available on wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Families {{were further}} angered after a May 20, 2014 black-tie, VIP {{cocktail}} party for donors at the museum. Among the 60 attendees were former mayor Michael Bloomberg {{and representatives of}} Condé Nast. Family members objected to a party near unidentified remains; the sister of victim Robert Shay, Jr. tweeted, [...] "Did you enjoy having drinks {{on top of my}} brother's grave last night?" [...] Shay and dozens of other visitors were angered that first responders were turned away from the museum the previous day while staff prepared for the party. She said, [...] "I am outraged that I can't visit my brother's final resting place without an appointment but people like Mike Bloomberg can wine and dine there whenever they want. This memorial and museum is sacred ground and last night it was desecrated." [...] A retired FDNY fire marshal said, [...] "You don't have <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> at a cemetery." [...] A mid-2014 proposal to open a Danny Meyer restaurant in the museum was criticized.|$|E
2500|$|In New York, Stuart {{sought to}} return to stage acting on Broadway. [...] "I {{wanted to be a}} theater actress," [...] she said, [...] "but I thought {{it would be easier to}} get to New York and the theater if I had a name than if I just walked the streets as a little girl from California. When I went back to New York with {{somewhat}} of a name, they didn't want movie actresses." [...] Stuart was, however, welcomed into summer stock theater on the east coast, and performed in Man and Superman, The Animal Kingdom, The Night of January 16th, Accent on Youth, Route 101, Mr. and Mrs. North, The Pursuit of Happiness, Here Today, Sailor Beware and was Emily to Thornton Wilder’s Stage Manager—under Wilder’s own direction—in Our Town. But for two years, as many readings, lunches and <b>cocktail</b> <b>parties</b> as she attended, no director, producer or writer (not even Sheekman) gave Stuart a role on Broadway.|$|E
