30|$|Chloride, in {{the form}} of {{chloride}} (Cl−) ion, {{is one of the major}} inorganic anions in water and wastewater. It can originate from natural and anthropogenic activities, such as sewage and industrial effluents. Ethiopian Standard sets the <b>Chloride</b> <b>limit</b> of 250  mg/L Chloride for drinking water (ES 2001). Although, a total of 39 samples has exceeded the standard limit of 250  mg/L, a higher number of well water samples have contributed to this divergence. The regional distribution as shown in Table  1, 2, and 3 puts Afar region at the top having 21 samples in compliance to the national standard. Relatively, chloride concentration was detected higher in well water samples than spring and tap water samples. The very high Chloride value of spring water sources, 1399.6  mg/L from Somali (Afder, Bare) and 5598  mg/L from Oromia (North Shoa Ejere) were recorded. Additionally, in the well water sources extremely high chloride concentration of 3338.96  mg/L from Somali (Gilfega village), 12, 995.97  mg/L from Afar (Dubty, magenta), and 13, 195.91  mg/L from Afar (Hamiltole School), were recorded. The high chloride content may harm metallic pipes and structures (Terrence et al. 2007) and chloride concentrations in excess of about 250  mg/L can give rise to detectable taste in drinking water. On the other hand, no health based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking water.|$|E

40|$|Photosynthesis is {{the process}} by which cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants convert light energy to {{chemical}} energy via the biosynthesis of carbohydrates. Photosystem II is a multi-protein/pigment complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane. CP 43 is the product of the psbC gene, and is an intrinsic component of the photosystem II complex. CP 43 is 473 amino acids long and has five hydrophilic loops connecting six transmembrane alpha helices, including a large extrinsic loop E which is exposed to the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. Short deletions of regions of the loop E of CP 43 resulted in mutants that fail to grow photoautotrophically and are devoid of oxygen-evolving activity. A mutation was introduced in loop E that altered arginine at position 305 to a serine residue, producing a mutant with severely reduced growth and oxygen evolving activity under <b>chloride</b> <b>limiting</b> conditions. However, when grown under normal conditions, the R 305 S mutant showed no extreme phenotype. After isolation of photosystem II particles and chemilumininescent staining for cytochromes, it was determined that this specific mutation resulted in loss of binding of an extrinsic photosystem II protein, cytochrome c- 550. Deletion of the psbV gene encoding cytochrome c- 550 resulted in the loss of photoautotrophic growth in media lacking chloride and/or calcium. X-ray crystallography of photosystem II does in fact show a close proximity between cytochrome c- 550 and CP 43. Based on the crystal structure, two residues on cytochrome c- 550 were identified that might interact with CP 43 and are in close proximity with the arginine residue at position 305. These residues on cytochrome c- 550 are both highly conserved asparagines, located at positions forty nine and fifty one. In this work, the asparagine residue at position fifty one on cytochrome c- 550 was mutated to either an alanine or aspartic acid residue. The N 51 mutations were transformed into wildtype Synechocystis, a cyanobacterial model organism that has been widely used to study photosystem II. The N 51 mutants were characterized by photoautotrophic growth in complete and chloride-limiting media, oxygen evolution assays, variable florescence yield measurements and photoinactivation assays. Based on these assays, the control and N 51 mutant strains exhibited similar phenotypes in complete media while the control and N 51 D mutant strains exhibited similar phenotypes in <b>chloride</b> <b>limiting</b> media. The N 51 A mutant had a small but reproducible decrease in photoautotrophic growth rate, oxygen evolution rates and enhanced sensitivity to photoinactivation in <b>chloride</b> <b>limiting</b> media. Therefore, asparagine at position fifty one on cytochrome c- 550 might contribute to a weak interaction between arginine on CP 43 and cytochrome c- 550, which is likely to involve hydrogen bonding. However, further studies are needed to validate the proposed interaction between subunits cytochrome c- 550 and CP 43 of photosystem II.   M. S...|$|R

40|$|An article {{published}} in the Boston Globe in October 2014 titled “For concrete, climate change may mean a shorter lifespan” pointed out {{to the general public}} some pessimistic, but still worth noting, predictions: collapse of reinforced concrete structures due to steel reinforcement corrosion could be the most immediate vulnerability resulting from climate change. In marine environments, chlorides present in seawater cause de-passivation of the steel and consequent corrosion phenomena. To prevent the risk of premature degradation in new concrete constructions, whenever it makes sense, non-corrosive reinforcement in the form of composites or stainless steels should be adopted. In the past decades, the scientific community, industry, owners and regulators have addressed the problem of steel reinforcement corrosion by focusing on: the physico-mechanical properties of concrete, the use of strict <b>limits</b> for admixed <b>chlorides</b> and prevention of chloride penetration by low permeability. If reinforcement corrosion were not the most compelling concern, some of these sought-after properties would have no reason to be implemented and, without detrimental effects on durability, concrete itself could become a more sustainable material. This paper presents the preliminary results of a research aimed at changing the current perspective: by using proper types of corrosion resisting reinforcement, it becomes possible to produce concrete without <b>chloride</b> <b>limits</b> that can include seawater instead of freshwater for mixing and curing, and recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) that may already be chloride-contaminated replacing natural aggregate. If successful, this “greener” concrete would also allow the use of cements without chloride restriction; thus, giving cement manufacturers the opportunity to use solid waste as kiln fuel (co-generation) as well as adding kiln dust (byproduct that currently requires disposal) back to the clinker...|$|R

Model sensitivity analyses found that: (1) <b>Chloride</b> availability <b>limits</b> the formation of nitryl chloride at ground level but not aloft; (2) When excess particulate chloride was assumed to be present at ground level through sea salt, ClNO 2 concentrations increased in some locations by a factor of 13, as compared to cases where sea salt chloride was assumed to be limited; (3) Inland formation of ClNO 2 seems feasible based on chloride availability and could have a large impact on total ClNO 2 formed in the region; and (4) ClNO 2 formation is quite sensitive to the assumed yield of ClNO 2 from N 2 O 5 uptake.

The first part of the paper deals with the formation of these adducts. It is shown that the ternary nucleic acid-cis-platinum-ethidium bromide complexes in which ethidium bromide and nucleotide residues are cross-linked by cis-platinum, are relatively unstable at 37 degrees C. In the presence of acridine, ethidium bromide (but not cis-platinum) is slowly released which leads to the formation of monofunctional cis-platinum-nucleic acid adducts. After removal of acridine, the monofunctional adducts react further to become bifunctional. The second part of the paper deals with the kinetics of disappearance of the monofunctional adducts in several polynucleotides but not in poly(dG). poly(dC). When the adducts possess a <b>chloride</b> ligand, the <b>limiting</b> step in the cross-linking is the rate of aquation reaction of the chloride ligand. The rate constants are an order of magnitude larger when the monofunctional adducts do not possess a chloride ligand. In both the cases, the rate constants are apparently independent of the nucleic acid sequence...|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{chloride}} concentration at the rebar, {{there are other}} randomly varying factors which {{play a crucial role}} in depassivation. As mentioned previously, these factors include pre-cracks, air voids, water channels, bar orientation, rebar surface conditions and workmanship (Angst et al. 2017). As an example, the presence of small air voids at the SCI can have a strong shielding effect and retard the depassivation of rebar at those locations, because a high pressure is required to fill these air voids and might take decades to completely fill in. On the contrary, water pockets usually found under horizontally placed rebars can lead to a faster attainment of depassivation. In continuum-based models, these variable factors at the SCI cannot be easily accounted for, due to their probabilistic nature and difficulties in experimental quantification. Several models would be required to investigate the effect of each factor, thereby considerably increasing the computational effort. Therefore, in this study, we have included these varying parameters into a randomly distributed mathematical function fpCl_T with varying <b>chloride</b> threshold <b>limits</b> along the rebar surface. The range of Clth is obtained from experiments by Alonso et al. (2000) with 0.39 [*]<[*]Clth<[*] 1.16 (free Cl− as a percentage of binder weight) and is used as end limits for fpCl_T. This function includes numbers varying within the Clth range at equal intervals and fitted with a smooth cubic spline function. Anodic activation is therefore accounted in the model with spatial and temporal resolution at locations where the chloride content has exceeded its randomly assigned value at a particular location on the rebar surface. The numerical model is able to change the metal dissolution currents at these spatial locations. Other models employing a varying chloride threshold include works of Sagüés et al. (2014), Walsh (2015) and Michel (2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{collagens}} {{were studied}} in 13 normal and 19 myxomatous human mitral valves. The collagens of the valve were completely solubilized {{by using a}} method consisting of guanidinium <b>chloride</b> extraction, <b>limited</b> pepsin digestions and CNBr cleavage of the residue. The normal valves contained 74 % type I, 24 % type III and 2 % type V collagen. The type I and type III collagens had similar solubility patterns, although only type I collagen was detected in the guanidinium chloride extract. Type V collagen was only detected in the first pepsin extract. The type I and III collagens had higher contents of hydroxylysine than did the same collagens from age-matched dermis. The two-dimensional electrophoretic 'maps' of CNBr-cleavage peptides showed low recoveries of the C-terminal alpha 1 (I) CB 6 and alpha 1 (III) CB 9 peptides, which are involved in forming intermolecular cross-linkages. Most of the reducible cross-linkages were present in large-Mr peptide complexes, and these complexes were shown by labelling with 125 I to include the tyrosine-containing alpha 1 (I) CB 6 peptide. The myxomatous valves contained 67 % type I, 31 % type III and 2 % type V collagens. There was {{a significant increase in}} the concentration of each type of collagen, which consisted of a 9 % increase of type I collagen, a 53 % increase of type III collagen and a 25 % increase of type V collagen. The contents of hydroxylysine in type I and III collagens and the electrophoretic 'maps' of the CNBr-cleavage peptides involved in cross-linkages did not differ significantly from the results obtained from the normal valves. The biochemical findings suggest that there is an increased production of collagen, in particular type III collagen, and glycosaminoglycan as well as a proliferation of cells as part of a repair process in the myxomatous valves...|$|R
30|$|Another {{limitation}} of the current bench experiments was the necessity of adjusting dialysate pH to obtain usable measurements with our laboratory blood gas analyzer. For this purpose, hydrochloric acid was added. As a result, the final chloride concentration exceeded 116  mmol/L (Table  1). Consequently, although pH increased slightly in the post-dialyser plasma (Table  2), it {{did not return to}} physiologically normal levels of 7.35 – 7.45, since the chloride resulted in a metabolic acidosis. It should be highlighted, however, that this small pH increase, despite removal of bicarbonate, proving the concept that bicarbonate can be removed without further lowering pH. In future work, we plan to define the safe pH boundaries of our dialysate and target the final dialysate pH accordingly, while <b>limiting</b> <b>chloride,</b> and accomplishing CO 2 removal with restoration of a physiological pH. Importantly, bicarbonate removal resulted in lower CO 2 levels and was achieved at much lower blood flows than those required for conventional ECCO 2 R. At these low blood flow rates, about 10 % of cardiac output, blood exiting the dialyzer would be significantly diluted by venous blood in circulation.|$|R
30|$|The {{problem of}} {{unnecessary}} patient {{exposure to radiation}} could arise from two sources: 68 Ge breakthrough that is not removed in the labelling process and possibly imperfect labelling, leading to an insufficient yield and, hence, to free 68 Ga in the radiopharmaceutical. As they have an influence on the labelling process, traces of non-radioactive metallic contaminants in the eluate {{have to be taken}} into account. The requirements {{on the quality of the}} primarily eluted gallium chloride solution as well as the labelled compound are defined in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph Eur) [18],[19]. The radionuclidic purity of 68 Ga in the gallium <b>chloride</b> solution is <b>limited</b> to a minimum of 99.9 % of the total radioactivity [18], but the content of 68 Ge should not exceed 0.001 % [18]. Gamma-ray spectrometry is recommended as the method of choice for the determination and quantification of the impurities. The European Pharmacopeia states precisely that peaks in the gamma-ray spectra that do not belong either to 68 Ga (Table  1), to annihilation radiation or a possible sum peak at 1, 022  keV shall ‘represent not more than 0.1 per cent of the total radioactivity’ [18].|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} and coordination properties of complexes formed upon {{the interaction of}} copper(II) and chromium(II) chlorides with dialkylimidazolium chloride (RMIm+Cl-) ionic liquids and glucose are studied {{by a combination of}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In the absence of the carbohydrate substrate, isolated mononuclear four-coordinated MeCl 42 - species (Me = Cu, Cr) dominate in the ionic liquid solution. The organic part of the ionic liquid does not directly interact with the metal centers. The interactions between the RMIm+ cations and the anionic metal <b>chloride</b> complexes are <b>limited</b> to hydrogen bonding with the basic Cl- ligands and the overall electrostatic stabilization of the anionic metal complexes. Exchange of Cl- ligands by a hydroxyl group of glucose is only favorable for CrCl 42 -. For Cu 2 + complexes, the formation of hydrogen bonded complexes between CuCl 42 - and glucose is preferred. No preference for the coordination of metal chloride species to specific hydroxyl group of the carbohydrate is found. The formation of binuclear metal chloride complexes is also considered. The reactivity and selectivity patterns of the Lewis acid catalyzed reactions of glucose are discussed in the framework of the obtained results...|$|R

40|$|Simple commercially {{available}} phenols {{have been investigated}} for their abilities to bind and sense anionic guests. Catechol is able to strongly and selectively bind chloride, as the O-H groups are located in positions particulariy appropriate for chelate binding of this anion. The addition of an electron withdrawing group to the catechol motif results in an increased chloride affinity. Catechol also demonstrates large electrochemical responses upon the addition of chloride and optical responses upon the addition of basic anions such as fluoride. A series of novel bis-catechol siderophore analogues has been successfully synthesised and their binding with chloride has been investigated. The affinity of ortho-substituted bis-catechol compounds for <b>chloride</b> was <b>limited</b> by {{the ability of the}} O-H groups to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the ortho substituent. Ortha-substituted compounds, which were able to form six membered intramolecular rings, were found to have the weakest affinity for chloride. The strongest receptor of this. type, which could bind chloride more th~n twice as strongly than catechol, was only capable of forming a seven membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonded ring. The affinity of meta-substituted bis-catechols for chloride was found to be limited, not by the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the meta substituent, but by a lack of rigidity inherent within the structure. Simple meta-substituted catechols demonstrate chloride binding affinities comparable with catechol {{due to a lack of}} competitive intramolecular hydrogen bonds. However, the lack of rigidity within meta-substituted bis-catechols meant a well defined binding site could not be presented to the guest chloride. A series of receptors containing a tren-core have been synthesised and their anion and acid binding has been studied. Placing large organic functionality around the tren-core results in preferred binding of the smaller anions due to the formation of an extended binding cavity. Tren-cored receptors are also capable of transporting H+Crthrough a bulk organic phase. The ability to transport was based largely on receptor polarity rather than guest affinity. Finally, a preliminary investigation of transport through phospholipid bilayers was undertaken. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A bronze bowl {{belonging}} to a private collection, stylistically consistent with the Achaemenid art was investigated to {{determine the cause of}} the artwork local fragmentation. The corrosion products were characterised by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (EDXRF), Raman Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The last technique was also used to determine the chemical composition of the alloy. The metallographic analysis showed that the bowl was obtained from a monophasic bronze alloy, containing about 11 % tin and other elements in traces. The presence of an inhomogeneous microstructure with both thermal twin bands and slip lines was consistent with multiple hammering steps followed by partial annealing treatments. On the bowl a very <b>limited</b> <b>chloride</b> contamination was observed and chlorides were never detected in proximity to the metal. These findings and the morphological/compositional characteristics of the patinas permitted to classify that on the internal side of the bowl as a modified Type I morphology, while the patina on the external side of the bowl was less compact, so that it was judged borderline between a “noble” patina and a disfiguring one. On this side, a significant intergranular attack was found, reputed responsible for the fragmentation occurred...|$|R
