40|$|The {{mastery of}} English <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex {{sentences}} is of a paramount importance {{because it can}} help us to study the basic utterances of English spoken and written sentences. In addition, <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences {{can also be used}} to express ideas that are impossible to express in one word, one phrase, or even in one simple sentence. In fact, they can be used to produce the effectiveness and clarity in English oral or written communication. Thus, the analysis of errors in English <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences can be used as an input for the remedial teaching program. The present research tries to study three types of <b>compound</b> sentences <b>and</b> three types of complex sentences with the limitation on twenty five coordinators and thirty five subordinators being tested. The problems which were investigated in this study were: 1) the types of errors made by the students in constructing English <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences, 2) the frequency of occurrence of each type of error made by the students in constructing <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences, and 3) the areas of difficulties encountered by the students in constructing <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences. With these problems, the present study had three purposes: 1) to find out the types of errors made by the students in constructing <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences, 2) to find out the frequency of the occurrence of each type of error made by the students in constructing <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences, and 3) to describe the areas of difficulties encountered by the students in constructing <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences. The subjects of this study consisted of 79 sixth semester students of the English Department who were taking the translation course at Widya Mandala Surabaya Catholic University. The instrument used to collect the data was a pencil and paper test on <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences in sentence combining and translation with 25 coordinators and 35 subordinators. This test was administered to the subjects who had finished their grammar courses. The study reveals the following findings: 1) The types of errors made by the students in constructing <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> complex sentences consisted of (1) 11. 51...|$|R

5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant <b>compounds</b> <b>and</b> adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation {{and serve as a}} signal to other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of the}} colony.|$|E
5|$|As for all metals, {{molecular}} <b>compounds</b> <b>and</b> polyatomic ions of cobalt {{are classified}} as coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness {{of a series of}} ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co+3 complexes tend to have ammine ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).|$|E

5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} <b>compounds</b> <b>and</b> repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E

Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes.|$|E
