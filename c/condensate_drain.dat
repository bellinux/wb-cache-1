The ceiling protection switch is mainly used in applications where a piece of HVAC equipment is located in an attic or interior space where water damage is likely to occur. The switch does not guarantee the prevention of overflow, but may reduce the amount. Overflow water occurs when the <b>condensate</b> <b>drain</b> line becomes clogged restricting the flow of condensation from the interior to {{the exterior of the}} space.

50|$|During normal operation, rotor {{imbalance}} {{can lead}} to vibration, which, {{because of the high}} rotation velocities, could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine. Also, turbines are run with high-quality steam: either superheated (dry) steam, or saturated steam with a high dryness fraction. This prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades (moisture carry over). Also, liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft. To prevent this, along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam, <b>condensate</b> <b>drains</b> are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine.|$|R

40|$|Decentralized {{ventilation}} systems should combine {{a small and}} economical design with high aerodynamic and thermal efficiency. The Counter Flow Heat Recovery Fan (CHRF) provides the ability to meet these requirements by using only one cross flow fan {{with a large number}} of blades to generate both airflows and which simultaneously acts as a regenerative counter flow heat exchanger. The successful development of the first laboratory prototype has shown the potential of this ventilation system.

Studies confirm that these surfaces are effective antimi-crobial agents that kill microbes within hours. In today’s modern buildings, concerns about exposure to toxic microorganisms have created a dire need to improve the hygienic conditions of heating, ventila-tion and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which {{are believed to be}} factors in over 60 % of all sick building situations (Collet and Associates).

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made for}} tho laminar film condensation on a rotating axisymmetrical general curved body of which the cylinder, the disc and the cones are special examples. The body rotates about a vertical axis and the film is assumed to drain {{under the influence of}} gravitational and centrifugal accelerations. The problem is formulated as a solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations. A differential equation which governs the growth of the condensate film is obtained and solved to yield one equation which is applicable to all rotating axisymmetrical bodies. The equation involves the geometry of the body and requires a single integration for the complete solution. Theoretical results of condensate layer thickness and heat transfer coefficients are given for a curved body whose generator forms a circular are of 90 for a speed range of 0. 1 to 10 (^ 6) rev/min. It is shown that when the curvature is neglected, the analysis over estimate the local film thickness by 71 per cent. Experimental results for the curved body confirm the theoretical findings. However, due to the formation of roll-waves on the condensate layer and hence a departure from the laminar model, the experimental results for the heat transfer coefficient were 1. 055 to 1. 440 times greater than the theoretical predictions. No detachment of drops from the film of condensate was observed at the experimental speed range of 0. 0 to 1000 rev/min. and the <b>condensate</b> <b>drained</b> as a film along the generator.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} cooling systems produce {{water as}} a byproduct, which can be recovered and put to good use. In order to product cool air from a compressed refrigerant, a set of coils allow a hot, high-pressured refrigerant to dissipate its heat and condense into a liquid. An expansion valve is then typically used to evaporate and cool the refrigerant. This cool gas then runs {{through a set of}} coils that allows it to absorb heat and cool the air, which is blown over the coils and into the inside of the building. This process cools the warm coils, so when the warm air blowing past the coils reaches its dew point the moisture in the air condenses onto the coils, producing what is essentially distilled water. This byproduct of air conditioning units is called as <b>Condensate</b> <b>drain</b> water. The quality of condensate created by Air Conditioners is typically very high, having low amounts of suspended solids, a neutral to slightly acidic pH, and low temperatures. These characteristics make the condensate adequate for several non-potable uses such as irrigation, cooling tower make-up or toilet flushing. In addition to quality water, high recovery capacity is a major benefit of these systems. Although the amount of condensate produced can vary greatly and depends on the size and operational load of the Air-conditioning system as well as the ambient temperature and humidity within a particular region. A rule of thumb created by Karen Guz (Director of the Conservation Department for the San Antonio Water System, USA) is that 0. 1 to 0. 3 gallons of condensate per ton of air being chilled is produced every hour that the system is operating. Seizing this opportunity by replacing or supplementing potable water with the recovered condensate can considerably reduce a building’s demand for potable water. By implementing a condensate recovery system free, clean and unused water will be replacing costly, treated, high demand potable water. Decreasing the use of potable water within buildings {{plays a major role in}} conserving municipal sources. Moreover following potential LEED credits can be achieved. Water Efficient Landscaping a.

40|$|Ten {{heat pump}} water heaters (HPWH) {{were placed in}} an {{environmentally}} controlled test facility and run through a durability test program of approximately 7300 duty cycles (actual cycles accumulated ranged from 6640 to 8324 for the ten units). Five of the units were upgraded integral types (HPWH mounted on storage tank, no pump) from the same manufacturer as those tested in our first durability program in 2001 (Baxter and Linkous, 2002). The other five were ''add-on'' type units (HPWH with circulation pump plumbed to a separate storage tank) from another manufacturer. This durability test was designed to represent approximately 7 - 10 years of normal operation to meet the hot water needs of a residence. The integral units operated without incident apart from two control board failures. Both of these were caused by inadvertent exposure to very hot and humid (> 135 F dry bulb and > 120 F dew point) conditions that occurred due to a test loop failure. It is not likely that any residential water heater would be installed where such conditions were expected so these failures are not considered a long-term reliability concern. Two of the integral HPWHs featured a condensate management system (CMS) option that effectively eliminated any need for an evaporator <b>condensate</b> <b>drain,</b> but imposed significant efficiency penalties when operating in high humidity ambient conditions. The add-on units experienced no operational failures (breakdowns with loss of hot water production) {{during the course of}} the testing. However, their control systems exhibited some performance degradation under the high temperature, high humidity test conditions [...] HPWHs would shut off with tank water temperatures 15 - 20 F lower than when operating under moderate ambient conditions. One unit developed a refrigerant leak during the test program and lost about 50 % of its charge resulting in reduced efficiency. Efficiency measurements on all the integral units and four of the add-on units showed significantly higher efficiencies than conventional electric water heaters (EWH). DOE Simulated Use Tests conducted prior to starting the durability testing resulted in energy factors (EF) of about 2. 3 for the integral design and 1. 4 for the add-on design compared to the minimum value of 0. 86 prescribed for EWHs. Based on the experience from this and the previous durability testing, there is no evidence that strongly suggests that any of the HPWHs suffered significant performance degradation after undergoing over 7000 water heat cycles...|$|E

50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the <b>condensate</b> <b>drains</b> from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|R

40|$|Steam {{quality is}} an {{important}} measurement in steam generation. It's a measurement of steam to moisture ratio.

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on energy management has helped sites reduce system cost through {{the diagnosis and}} repair of ?Leaking? or ?Blowing? steam traps (?Leakage Failures?). Timely maintenance response is a significant action to lower energy use and GHG emissions generated by steam production. But, what action should be taken with Cold Traps? In every steam trap survey to determine the steam trap population?s current state of health, there are usually {{a significant amount of}} steam traps determined to be ?Cold? or ?Low Temp? (?Drainage Failures? or ?Cold Traps?). It seems that site personnel commonly assign a lower response priority to these Drainage Failures traps, and sometimes actually implement a practice to intentionally convert Leaking traps into Cold Traps by closing the inlet stop valve to immediately stop energy leakage. Subsequently, they may label those traps as ?Valved- Out? or ?Out of Service,? but those trap stations were originally designed as needed to <b>drain</b> retained <b>condensate</b> from the system. So, the correct designation for such a trap station is ?Cold,? regardless of the current intention. If the trap station does not <b>drain</b> <b>condensate</b> and is not hot, it is ?Cold. ? It can be astounding that many sites are not convinced of what actions or priority to take to repair Cold Traps, even while intrinsically understanding that {{there is something wrong with}} having Cold Traps that cannot <b>drain</b> <b>condensate</b> from a steam system. It often is simply because sites may not be fully aware of the potential dangers of uncorrected Cold Traps or the significant safety, reliability, and energy benefits of addressing them.

Unfortunately, proactive response to repair Cold Traps in a steam system is not always achieved, often because the real benefits of such a response are not understood. Therefore, further review of ?WHAT TO DO ABOUT COLD TRAPS?AND WHY?? is warranted for safe, reliable, and energy-efficient management of the condensate discharge locations (CDLs).

40|$|A {{monolithic}} block of densely welded tuff was excavated from a site on Fran Ridge near Yucca Mountain, Nevada so that coupled thermohydrological processes could be studied in a controlled, in situ experiment. A series of heaters {{were placed in}} a horizontal plane about 3 m {{from the top of}} the 3 m by 3 m by 4. 5 m high block. Temperatures were measured at many points within and on the block surface and a suite of other measurements were taken to define the thermal and hydrologic response. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) was used to map 2 dimensional images of moisture content changes along four planes in the block. The ERT images clearly delineate the drying and wetting of the rockmass during the 13 months of heating and subsequent six months of cool down. The main feature is a prominent dry zone that forms around the heaters then gradually disappears as the rock cools down. Other features include linear anomalies of decreasing moisture content which are fractures dehydrating as the block heats up. There are also examples of compact anomalies of wetting. Some of these appear to be water accumulation in fractures which are <b>draining</b> <b>condensate</b> from the block. Others may be rain water entering a fracture at the top of the block.

40|$|For maximum {{effectiveness}} in steam systems, steam traps should have operating characteristics which closely match {{the requirements of}} the applications for which they are used. A trap which holds back condensate until it is subcooled and some of the sensible heat has been utilized is unsuitable where the need is to get maximum output from an exchanger by discharging condensate as soon as it forms. Equally, a trap discharging condensate at steam temperature can exacerbate flash steam problems in cases where surplus heat exchange area exists and a subcooling trap might be more suitable. In all cases, undersized traps simply cannot <b>drain</b> <b>condensate</b> from the steam equipment at the required rate, while oversized traps which cost more will usually wear faster and begin leaking expensive steam. This emphasizes the need for carefully selecting trap sizes that are properly engineered for maximum system efficiency. And, of course, the ability of a trap to cope with varying loads and to discharge noncondensible gases is often important. The recommended procedure is to first select the trap type which has performance capabilities that satisfy specific application needs, and then to choose a size which handles the condensate load without any unnecessary excess capacity. The Selection Guide, Table 1, is not comprehensive but helps in many applications where no unusual operating conditions or severe corrosion problems exist. Choosing the correct trap size then implies estimating the steam consumption rate, which of course equals the condensate load. Sometimes the load has already been measured, or the rated output of the steam equipment is known or can be obtained from the original manufacturer. In other cases, an estimate must be made and a Table o f Load Formulas will help although it, too, cannot be comprehensive. After making the best possible estimate of the load, a safety factor is applied. This allows for any inaccuracies in the estimating, for increased condensation rates at start-up, and for lower than anticipated pressure differentials across the trap...|$|R

This study establishes a technical basis for emplacement drift (i. e. at the waste package surface) environment criteria to be considered in the development of the waste package design. The information will support development of several SDDs and resolve emplacement drift external environment questions in the criteria of those documents. This study supports the following System Description Documents (SDDs) : Uncanistered SNF Disposal Container, Canistered SNF Disposal Container, DHLW Disposal Container, DOE Waste Forms Disposal Container, Non-Fuel Components Disposal Container, Naval SNF Disposal Container and Ex-Container Systems development. Minimum and maximum bounding values for the parameters described in the scope of this study are established to support environment criteria development for those systems...|$|R
40|$|A solar {{desalination}} system basically has two components: the heating unit (solar collectors) and the desalination unit (tower). Among its main advantages, this device {{does not need}} electrical power to operate, since it is driven by thermosiphon. In its operation, brackish water is heated and it evaporates. The evaporated vapor rises and hits the coller walls of the above tray, where it <b>condensates</b> and <b>drains</b> through a specially designed geometry, structure to be finally by {{in a set of}} gutter. The already demineralized water flows through a main channel where it is stored in a container, outside the desalination tower. The resulting water from this process is pure and free from contamination, either microorganisms or salt. This study analyzes the performance of a desalination system with a desalination tower and a set of three solar collectors. The heat transfer medium between the collector and the tower was thermal oil flow, Lubrax Utile OT- 100. The experimental results demonstrate the operation of this type of desalinator, since ideal conditions for its correct functioning was only achieved after the installation of a positive displacement pump, which that promoted the oil circulation. Thermocouples installed in the stages of tower registered the temperature increase throughout the day. Peaks of 77 ÂC were measured in the storage tank of the tower. The mean values of production per day were 25 liters of desalinated water with an average conductivity always less than 10 &# 956;S / cm Â, representing a salt removal efficiency greater than 99 %. In performance calculation, the best result was obtained when the pumping system was combined {{with the use of a}} solar reflector, achieving GOR value of 2. 85. Um dessalinizador solar possui basicamente duas unidades: a unidade de aquecimento (coletora) e a unidade de dessalinizaÃÃo (torre). Apresenta entre suas principais vantagens o fato de nÃo precisar de energia elÃtrica para seu funcionamento, pois Ã acionada por termossifÃo. A operaÃÃo se dÃ pelo aquecimento da Ãgua salobra atÃ que esta comece a evaporar. O vapor, ao subir e encontrar com uma superfÃcie com temperatura inferior, condensa e escorre atravÃs de estruturas em uma geometria especialmente projetada para este fim e sÃ entÃo Ã coletada por um sistema de calhas. A Ãgua jÃ desmineralizada segue por uma calha principal onde escorre e Ã armazenada em um recipiente, jÃ fora da torre de dessalinizaÃÃo. A Ãgua resultante desse processo Ã praticamente pura e isenta de contaminaÃÃo, tanto por microrganismos como por sais e outros contaminantes. O presente trabalho analisa o desempenho do dessalinizador composto por uma torre de dessalinizaÃÃo e um conjunto composto por trÃs coletores solares acionados por Ãleo tÃrmico Lubrax Utile OT- 100. Os resultados experimentais comprovam o funcionamento desse tipo de dessalinizador, visto que condiÃÃes ideais para seu correto funcionamento sÃ foram atingidas graÃas Ã instalaÃÃo de uma bomba de deslocamento positivo que promoveu a circulaÃÃo do Ãleo.

40|$|Aerosol {{are solid}} or liquid {{particles}} {{suspended in the}} atmosphere {{ranging in size from}} 10 3 to 102 m. Aerosol influence both the regional and global climate of the earth by its direct and indirect effect. Role of atmospheric aerosols on the radiative forcing of atmosphere is a matter of serious research for past few decades and still it remains highly uncertain as acknowledged by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Heterogeneous nature of aerosol both spatially and temporally makes it more complex in estimating radiative forcing compared to that of greenhouse gases. Compounding to the existing difficulty in determining the climate effects, changing aerosol concentration and nature of the aerosol further increases the complexity in determining its effects in both regional and global climate. Increasing aerosol loading is emerging to be an issue of major concern over several regions. The first step towards achieving this goal is by determining the trends in the physical and optical properties of aerosol over the globe. Main objective of the thesis is the determination of the recent trends in aerosol loading over the globe and then to focus specifically on the properties of aerosol over an urban site in southern India. Specific objectives are (a) to determine the trend in aerosol physical and optical properties over the globe using AERONET surface observations (b) to characterize the chemical properties of water soluble inorganic aerosol over an urban site in Southern India, Bangalore (c) to have a better estimation of aerosol radiative forcing over Bangalore with measured aerosol chemical concentration, black carbon concentration and aerosol optical depth (AOD). To quantify the recent trends in aerosol loading over the globe, we have used the surface observations from AERONET and the study provided the first step in giving a global picture of the recent trends in the fundamental optical and physical property of aerosol. Trend analysis showed a significant spatial inhomogenity, and Asian continent clearly showed an increasing trend in AOD compared to other continents. Solar village (24. 9 oN, 46. 4 oE) of Saudi Arabia showed a maximum with a value of 0. 04 /yr and Bac -Giang (21 oN, 106 oE) of Vietnam showed the minimum value of - 0. 04 /yr. North American study region included 18 sites in which eastern US (E. US) exhibited a decreasing trend while the scenario in western US (W. US) is different with more of sites with increasing AOD trend. Single scattering albedo (SSA) trend in W. US showed a decreasing trend irrespective of the AOD trend. Study sites in South America include Cordoba -CETT (31. 5 oNS, 64. 5 oN W) Alta Floresta (9. 8 oS, 56. 1 o W), Riobranco (9. 9 oNS, 67. 8 o W) and Soa Poulo (23. 5 oS, 46. 7 o W). Except Riobranco which has a positive trend in AOD, all other sites exhibited a statistically signi cant negative trend. Over Australia, there is an inclination towards increasing AOD in sites and all the three sites in Australia exhibit a statistically significant increasing trend in SSA. According to the recent trends in AOD over African region, there exists a significant decrease in AOD compared to that reported for few years earlier, showing the high temporal in homogeneity and need for continuous observation of aerosol over the regions. European study region included 15 stations, among them only 3 sites showed an increasing trend in AOD, remaining 12 sites showed a significant decreasing trend in aerosol loading over the period of study. SSA was also observed to be decreasing over most of the European sites, even with a decreasing AOD over most of the sites. A Comparison study carried out to determine the relation of population growth rate and aerosol loading, and it revealed that the increasing AOD trend not always coincided with the sites having high population growth rate. Having determined the trends in AOD and other aerosol parameters over the globe and seeing an alarmingly increasing trend over most of the Asian sites, especially over Indian region, we have then focused over work on the aerosol properties of one of the rapidly growing urban location in southern India, Bangalore. While physical properties of aerosol have been extensively studied over Bangalore, chemical characteristics are still an unexplored area. Extensive information on aerosol chemical composition is not available over Indian region except for a few locations based on campaign mode. Even available data is of very coarse temporal resolution, since hours or full day sampling is needed to gather enough samples for chemical analysis. High temporal resolution data of aerosol chemical characteristics, especially for all season is completely lacking over Indian subcontinent. Among aerosol, water soluble aerosol form an important component in particulate matter, since it can change its size, composition, can easily mix with other aerosols and can act as cloud condensation nuclei, based on its hygroscopic nature. Present study provided the rst time results from a high temporal resolution water soluble inorganic aerosol chemical data over Indian region, which is first step towards estimating aerosol climate impacts more accurately. Water soluble inorganic aerosol ions over Bangalore namely, sulphate, nitrate, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and ammonium are measured using Particle Into Liquid Sampler Ion Chromatograph (PILS-IC). PILS is an online sampling technique for quantitatively measuring the chemical concentration of ion in water soluble aerosol particles. PILS IC {{used in the present study}} is developed in Georgia Institute of Technology. Instrument samples ambient air at a flow rate of 16. 7 Lmin 1. Particles below PM 2. 5 micron are collected for the analysis using cyclone impactor. Two annular glass denuders are used to remove inorganic gases which else will interfere with the aerosol ion concentration. Ambient air which is deprived of the inorganic gases is then mixed with steam vapours at 150 oC, eventually high supersaturated atmosphere is produced with rapid adiabatic mixing of steam and ambient air. High supersaturated air allows droplets to grow enough to be collected by inertial impaction onto a quartz impactor plate. Entire PILS condensation unit is kept at a slight tilt of 15 o, to remove all <b>condensate</b> through <b>drain</b> tube connected to the end of the PILS condensate body. Condensed liquid sample is collected from the impaction chamber and known concentration LiF is allowed to mix with the collected sample at a constant rate. LiF known as carrier liquid is added to know the dilution occurring to the collected sample. Sample with carrier liquid is then collected to a debubbler and is supplied to the IC through peristaltic tubings for determining the ion chemical concentration. Seasonal variation of mass concentration of water soluble aerosol species and the influence of long range transport is carried out using HYSPILT back trajectory analysis. Marine air mass from Arabian Sea dominated the air parcel reaching the site for both SW monsoon and summer. Continental air mass dominated the site during both NE monsoon and winter with slight contribution from marine atmosphere. Source characteristics of sulphate, potassium, calcium and magnesium ions are carried out based on sea salt (ss) and non sea salt (nss) origin and it is observed that the nss contribution is dominant over the site for all these ions except magnesium where ss component comparatively dominates the source. SO 24 and NO 3 form the dominant anions while NH+ 4 makes the dominant cation species. Monthly variation of the ratio of ammonium to nss -sulphate is carried out to determine the possible cation -anion relation existing between these two major ions. During later winter and summer months ammonium bi sulphate is found to be the existing chemical form and ammonium sulphate during other seasons. High temporal resolution data enabled us to study the diurnal variation of aerosol ions and it is influenced by various mechanisms from boundary layer to local emissions. Optical properties of aerosols depend upon the size and the relative abun-dance of each components. It is usual practice to assume default aerosol chemical composition in radiative transfer models due to unavailability of data, which can lead to errors in forcing estimates. Incorporating realistic aerosol chemical composition in models is essential to reduce the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing. Hence we have included measured aerosol chemical compositions, black carbon and AOD to improve the determination of radiative forcing of aerosol. OPAC and SBDART models were used for estimating the aerosol radiative forcing over Bangalore. We have used mainly four components namely, soot, water soluble, sea salt and dust. Except dust all are other components are measured over the site and formed a constrain for the calculation. Dust concentration was altered so that the OPAC AOD matched the measured AOD within 5 %. Mineral dust shows the highest contribution in AOD among the four components, however water soluble and soot even being less is mass concentration compared to mineral dust, has significant impact on the AOD. This clearly indicate the influence of both water soluble and soot aerosol over the regional climate of the site. Sea Salt exhibited low AOD compared to other three constituents. The results presented in the thesis highlights the importance of varying trends in the aerosol properties and its effects on a global picture and speci - cally over an urban site in Indian region, we explored the temporal variations of water soluble inorganic aerosol ions and its effects on regional climate. Hence the thesis addressed some of the unexplored areas in aerosol science. This study also suggests the need of continuous observation of aerosol over both spatial and temporal scale, which is essential to estimate their effects on earth's climate...|$|R
