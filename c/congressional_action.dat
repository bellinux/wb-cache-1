5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for <b>Congressional</b> <b>action</b> also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between <b>congressional</b> <b>actions</b> and public attitudes about {{government}} responsiveness, public efficacy, and public trust in government. <b>Congressional</b> <b>actions</b> are moves by members of Congress that are potentially consequential to public opinion. The theory contends that actions taken by Congress influence these perspectives on government within an alert stratum of the public. This relationship is demonstrated by employing a pooled time-series logistical regression modeling data that come from the American National Election Studies merged with historical actions data. The findings support the contention that increased actions by Congress increase public efficacy and trust in government, and also improve public attitudes about government responsiveness...|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of <b>Congressional</b> <b>action</b> that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because <b>Congressional</b> <b>action</b> seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would designate a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{stricken}} with polio, {{and was one}} of the moving forces of the March of Dimes. The ten-cent coin could be changed by the Mint without the need for <b>congressional</b> <b>action,</b> and officials moved quickly to replace the Mercury dime. Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock prepared models, but faced repeated criticism from the Commission of Fine Arts. He modified his design in response, and the coin went into circulation in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed <b>congressional</b> <b>action,</b> and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending <b>congressional</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jewell's {{first order}} as Secretary, issued in October 2013, {{established}} {{a process for}} the Department of the Interior to offset large development projects with conservation efforts. The effort was an extension of existing programs that use fees for offshore drilling permits to expand or build parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without <b>Congressional</b> <b>action.</b> Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, give the president broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President were prepared to use {{as part of a}} balanced approach between development and conservation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for <b>Congressional</b> <b>action.</b> In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended <b>Congressional</b> <b>action</b> on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E

5|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, {{after leading}} the United States {{through much of}} the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had {{suffered}} from polio since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the March of Dimes to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece was an obvious way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced that the Mercury dime (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation {{about the end of the}} year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design was beautiful and that the limited space on the dime would not do justice to Roosevelt; he advocated a commemorative silver dollar instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No <b>congressional</b> <b>action</b> was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the 1932 presidential election, President Herbert Hoover {{supported}} the Glass bill.
