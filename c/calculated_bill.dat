40|$|Abstract. Energy meter {{monitoring}} {{with automatic}} tariff calculation {{is a project}} that can produce the output from energy meter to prepare a bill of electricity. Energy meter is a device that measure the amount of electric energy consumed. In Malaysia, the meter of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) travels for a long distance and take the reading manually to prepare the bill by visiting inside each of consumer house. This is high dependent on human forces. Sometimes the absence of consumer during billing process visiting make difficult to the meter reader to get the reader. Moreover many consumers are {{not satisfied with the}} estimate bills which are calculated based on average consumption. Soaring bill by estimate bills of electricity which consumer have to pay extra for the electricity billing. By using microcontroller and radio frequency transmitter for remote monitoring, the meter reader do not have to travel anymore.

Such differences in growth parameters can cause the sexes to be impacted by environmental variability in different ways, and understanding these differences allows {{a better understanding of}} patterns in productivity between individuals and populations. We investigated differences in growth rate and diet between male and female Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks during two breeding seasons at Cape Crozier, Ross Island, Antarctica. Adélie Penguins are a slightly dimorphic species, with adult males averaging larger than adult females in mass (~ 11 %) as well as bill (~ 8 %) and flipper length (~ 3 %). We measured mass and length of flipper, bill, tibiotarsus, and foot at 5 -day intervals for 45 male and 40 female individually-marked chicks. Chick sex was molecularly determined from feathers. We used linear mixed effects models to estimate daily growth rate as a function of chick sex, while controlling for hatching order, brood size, year, and potential variation in breeding quality between pairs of parents. Accounting for season and hatching order, male chicks gained mass an average of 15. 6 g d - 1 faster than females. Similarly, growth in bill length was faster for males, and the <b>calculated</b> <b>bill</b> size difference at fledging was similar to that observed in adults. There was no evidence for sex-based differences in growth of other morphological features. Adélie diet at Ross Island is composed almost entirely of two species [...] one krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) and one fish (Pleuragramma antarctica), with fish having a higher caloric value. Using isotopic analyses of feather samples, we also determined that male chicks were fed a higher proportion of fish than female chicks. The related differences in provisioning and growth rates of male and female offspring provides a greater understanding {{of the ways in which}} ecological factors may impact the two sexes differently...|$|E

Strongly consumer–centric models should prove even more attractive to consumers as they enable consumers to incorporate independent consistency or reasonableness checks as well as raise alarms when apparent discrepancies are suspected in consumption figures; furthermore, innovative charging schemes can be constructed by consumers that are themselves offering third party services. Strongly consumer–centric accounting models have the desirable property of openness and transparency, since service users are in a position to verify the charges billed to them.|$|R

40|$|Residential {{natural gas}} {{customers}} in the United States face volumetric charges that average about 30 % more than the marginal cost of gas. This inefficient departure from marginal cost pricing allows gas utilities to cover their fixed infrastructure and operating costs. Proposals for recovering these costs instead through fixed monthly fees are often opposed because of a widespread belief that current rate schedules have desirable distributional consequences. Using nationally-representative household-level data we show that the correlation between household income and natural gas consumption is indeed positive, but surprisingly weak, so current rate schedules are only mildly progressive. In part, we argue that this is because poor households tend to have larger families and less energy-efficient homes. We <b>calculate</b> <b>bill</b> impacts {{under a variety of}} different scenarios and show that even a modest energy assistance program would more than offset the distributional impact of tariff rebalancing for most low-income households...|$|R
