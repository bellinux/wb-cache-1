5000|$|This {{compound}} {{is often}} improperly called (even in chemistry articles) copper carbonate, <b>cupric</b> <b>carbonate,</b> and similar names.

50|$|Benedict's {{solution}} is a deep-blue solution {{used to test}} {{for the presence of}} the aldehyde functional group, - CHO. It is an aqueous alkaline mixture of CuSO4 and sodium citrate. Here sodium citrate is the complexing agent that keeps Cu2+ in solution, which would otherwise precipitate as <b>cupric</b> <b>carbonate.</b> The substance to be tested is heated up to 95 °C (for example, in a water bath) with Benedict's solution; formation of a brick-red precipitate indicates presence of the aldehyde group in relatively high concentrations. Since simple sugars (e.g., glucose) give a positive test, the {{solution is}} used to test for the presence of glucose in urine, a symptom of diabetes. One litre of Benedict's solution contains 173 grammes sodium citrate, 100 grammes sodium carbonate, and 17.3 grammes cupric sulphate pentahydrate.It reacts chemically similarly to Fehling's solution; the cupric ion (complexed with citrate ions) is reduced to cuprous ion by the aldehyde group (which is oxidised), and precipitates as cuprous oxide, Cu2O.|$|E
40|$|Reaction of {{iodoacetic acid}} with <b>cupric</b> <b>carbonate</b> in water in dimmed light yields green Cu(ICH 2 COO) (2 center dot) H 2 O (1). From X-ray crystallography, {{it is found}} to be a tetra-acetato bridged copper(II) dimer with the water {{molecules}} occupying the apical positions. In thermogravimetry, the coordinated water molecules are lost in the temperature range 50 - 100 degrees C. From magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range 300 - 1. 8 K, the exchange coupling constant J {{is found to be}} - 142 (1) cm(- 1) and g = 2. 18 (2) with the spin Hamiltonian H = - 2 J{S-Cu 1 center dot S-Cu 2 }. It reacts with 2, 2 '-bipyridine (bpy) to yield [Cu(bpy) (2) I]I. It oxidises thiophenol to Ph-S-S-Ph under dry N- 2 atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Curly {{malachite}} (CM) {{is found}} as a green <b>cupric</b> <b>carbonate</b> hydroxide corrosion product on archaeological bronze, mostly on artefacts retrieved from graves. In this paper, a morphological characterization approach is proposed, enabling {{the investigation of}} the formation process of CM. It is suggested that curly malachite precipitates from an aqueous solution, for which the surrounding soil conditions provide local triggers. Anthropic activities associated with ritual burials do not significantly affect the growth of CM. It is also confirmed that curly malachite is usually not a pseudomorph of formerly organic material. Although the understanding of the formation process is far from complete, this study has shown that CM is expected to be found more often than is currently recognized, due to its relatively simple formation mechanisms and boundary conditions.

40|$|Biochar from Spartina alterniflora (SA) {{and rice}} straw (RS) under N 2 /CO 2 were {{evaluated}} for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution. The result indicates SA biochar prepared at 700 °C under CO 2 can achieve a Cu(II) sorption capacity of 89. 12 ± 2. 77 mg/g, which {{is higher than}} that from N 2 by about 50 %. CO 2 can promote the development of multi-porous structure, enhance specific surface area, and increase the amounts of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on biochar. In addition, CO 2 can inhibit the thermal decomposition of inorganic carbonate, such as MgCO 3 and CaCO 3 in biochar. These matters facilitate Cu(II) removal via the formation of chemical precipitation of Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3. The dissolution of inherent inorganic matter makes Cu(II) transformed into hydrolyzed species or amorphous precipitation, which contributes to about 75 % (w/w) of Cu(II) removal. Metal exchange with complexed cations {{and the formation of}} basic <b>cupric</b> <b>carbonate</b> are time-consuming and responsible for about 24 % (w/w) of Cu(II) removal. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to improve the}} process for CO{sub 2 } capture by alkanolamine absorption/stripping by developing an alternative solvent, aqueous K{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } promoted by piperazine. The best K{sup +}/PZ solvent, 4. 5 m K{sup +}/ 4. 5 m PZ, requires equivalent work of 31. 8 kJ/mole CO{sub 2 } when used with a double matrix stripper and an intercooled absorber. The oxidative degradation of piperazine or organic acids is reduced significantly by inhibitor A, but the production of ethylenediamine is unaffected. The oxidative degradation of piperazine in 7 m MEA/ 2 m PZ is catalyzed by Cu{sup ++}. The thermal degradation of MEA becomes significant at 120 C. The solubility of potassium sulfate in MEA/PZ solvents is increased at greater CO{sub 2 } loading. The best solvent and process configuration, matrix with MDEA/PZ, offers 22 % and 15 % energy savings over the baseline and improved baseline, respectively, with stripping and compression to 10 MPa. The energy requirement for stripping and compression to 10 MPa is about 20 % of the power output from a 500 MW power plant with 90 % CO{sub 2 } removal. The stripper rate model shows that a ''short and fat'' stripper requires 7 to 15 % less equivalent work than a ''tall and skinny'' one. The stripper model was validated with data obtained from pilot plant experiments at the University of Texas with 5 m K{sup +}/ 2. 5 m PZ and 6. 4 m K{sup +}/ 1. 6 m PZ under normal pressure and vacuum conditions using Flexipac AQ Style 20 structured packing. Experiments with oxidative degradation at low gas rates confirm the effects of Cu{sup + 2 } catalysis; in MEA/PZ solutions more formate and acetate is produced in the presence of Cu{sup + 2 }. At 150 C, the half life of 30 % MEA with 0. 4 moles CO{sub 2 }/mole amine is about 2 weeks. At 100 C, less than 3 % degradation occurred in two weeks. The solubility of potassium sulfate in MEA solution increases significantly with CO{sub 2 } loading and decreases with MEA concentration. The base case corrosion rate in 5 M MEA/ 1. 2 M PZ is 22 mpy. With 1 wt% heat stable salt, the corrosion rate increases by 50 % to 160 % in the order: thiosulfate< oxalate<acetate<formate. <b>Cupric</b> <b>carbonate</b> is ineffective in the absence of oxygen, but 50 to 250 ppm reduces corrosion to less than 2 mpy in the presence of oxygen...|$|E
