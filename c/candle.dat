5|$|The Peace <b>Candle</b> {{was first}} erected in 1951, {{and has been}} put up almost every year since then. Due to damage or disrepair, the Peace <b>Candle</b> has been {{replaced}} with new <b>candle</b> structures twice since the original construction. The first <b>candle</b> lasted until 1968, the second <b>candle</b> from 1969 to 1989, and the current <b>candle</b> was built in 1990 {{and is expected to}} last until around 2014. The structure is dedicated to the Easton area {{men and women who have}} served or are serving in the United States armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the <b>candle</b> was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace <b>Candle,</b> as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace <b>Candle</b> would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace <b>Candle</b> structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the <b>candle</b> up.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace <b>Candle</b> during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current <b>candle</b> structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace <b>Candle</b> cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace <b>Candle,</b> opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} <b>candle.</b> They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas <b>candle</b> in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a <b>candle</b> would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the <b>candle</b> has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace <b>Candle,</b> calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, however, one of {{the neon}} lights in the flame {{structure}} short-circuited and started a fire on the yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue, causing an actual fire on the Christmas <b>Candle</b> flame for a brief amount of time. The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas <b>Candle,</b> but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this setback, the Christmas <b>Candle</b> was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas <b>Candle.</b> The <b>candle</b> was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active.|$|E

5000|$|Soy <b>candles</b> [...] are <b>candles</b> {{made from}} soy wax, {{which is a}} {{processed}} form of soybean oil. They are usually container <b>candles,</b> because soy wax typically has a lower melting point than traditional waxes, but can also be made into pillar <b>candles</b> if certain additives are mixed into the soy wax. The wax blend in soy <b>candles</b> prevents tunneling, with a soot-free and even burn.|$|R
5|$|On November 14, 2015, the <b>candle</b> was lit {{nearly two}} weeks prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the <b>candle</b> to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a <b>candle</b> light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The <b>candle</b> remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} <b>candle</b> clocks {{comes from a}} Chinese poem, written in 520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated <b>candle</b> was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lighting}} {{ceremony for}} the new <b>candle</b> was held on November 28, 1969, and attended by about 450 people. Mayor Fred Ashton Jr. threw the switch, and Rev. Harry Maue of the Olivet Presbyterian Church urged that the symbol serve {{as a symbol of}} peace in America, nothing the growing casualties in the Vietnam War at the time. Schultz said the new <b>candle</b> was symbolic of the growing development in the Easton area. The new <b>candle</b> was stored in the city's garage on Bushkill Drive while not assembled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Candles</b> {{were made}} by the Romans {{beginning}} about 500 BC. These were true dipped <b>candles</b> and made from tallow.

25|$|Inexpensive small wax <b>candles</b> {{sold for}} Hanukkah burn for {{approximately}} {{half an hour}} so should be lit no earlier than nightfall. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since <b>candles</b> may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the <b>candles</b> must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat <b>candles.</b> Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger <b>candles</b> than usual, followed by the Shabbat <b>candles.</b> At {{the end of the}} Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.|$|R
5|$|The new <b>candle</b> was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked {{almost exactly the same}} as the old previous <b>candle,</b> with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The <b>candle</b> cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace <b>Candle</b> ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new <b>candle</b> was held November 23, 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{the city}} {{released}} a china plate with the Peace <b>Candle</b> {{along with a}} Christmas tree, which was meant to symbolize the first tree in the nation, which was {{believed to have been}} erected in Easton in 1816. During the 2000 holiday season, the Easton Holiday Committee produced and sold commemorative plates marking the 50th anniversary of the Peace <b>Candle,</b> which included a painting of the structure by local artist Preston Hindmarch. They were sold for $32 along with ceramic ornaments of the Easton eatery Colonial Pizza, which sold for $22. Over the years, Christmas cards depicting the Peace <b>Candle</b> have continued {{to be used as a}} means of raising funds for the structure.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace <b>Candle</b> were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace <b>Candle</b> itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the <b>candle</b> from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, <b>candles</b> are lit before icons, usually of Jesus Christ or the Holy Theotokos. Usually Orthodox churches {{only use}} long, thin <b>candles.</b> These are usually placed in round {{container}}s, having either various sockets {{to hold the}} <b>candles,</b> or in a container filled with sand, in which the worshippers place their <b>candles.</b> Orthodox churches will usually have a separate place to put <b>candles</b> lit for the departed; Anglican and Roman Catholic churches make no such distinction.|$|R

5|$|On October 25, 1968, {{a fire at}} {{the former}} {{incinerator}} plant off Route 611, where the Peace <b>Candle</b> was being stored, destroyed the four smaller candles that surround {{the base of the}} larger <b>candle.</b> The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building. Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour. Damage was estimated at a cost of $1,200. Initially, city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1. However, the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating {{the construction of a new}} Peace <b>Candle</b> prior to the fire. On October 29, Henry Schultz, now chairman of the Christmas committee, announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no effort would be made to rebuild them. Instead, the committee would build an entirely new <b>candle</b> within a year.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected the <b>candle</b> each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project}} for free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace <b>Candle</b> lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the <b>candle</b> to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace <b>Candle</b> to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against the <b>candle</b> structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The <b>candle</b> suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of slow-release chemical oxidants for sub-surface remediation {{is a relatively}} new technol­ogy. Our objective was to develop slow-release persulfate-paraffin <b>candles</b> to treat BTEX-contaminated ground­water. Laboratory-scale <b>candles</b> were prepared by heating and mixing Na 2 S 2 O 8 with paraffin in a 2. 25 to 1 ra­tio (w/w), and then pouring the heated mixture into circular molds that were 2. 38 cm long and either 0. 71 or 1. 27 cm in diameter. Activator <b>candles</b> were prepared with FeSO 4 or zero-valent iron (ZVI) and wax. By treat­ing benzoic acid and BTEX compounds with slow-release persulfate and ZVI <b>candles,</b> we observed rapid trans­formation of all contaminants. By using 14 C-labeled benzoic acid and benzene, we also confirmed mineraliza­tion (conversion to CO 2) upon exposure to the <b>candles.</b> As the <b>candles</b> aged and were repeatedly exposed to fresh solutions, contaminant transformation rates slowed and removal rates became more linear (zero-order); this change in transformation kinetics mimicked the observed dissolution rates of the <b>candles.</b> By stacking per­sulfate and ZVI <b>candles</b> {{on top of each other}} in a saturated sand tank (14 × 14 × 2. 5 cm) and spatially sampling around the <b>candles</b> with time, the dissolution patterns of the <b>candles</b> and zone of influence were determined.

The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace <b>Candle</b> would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace <b>Candle</b> was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E
