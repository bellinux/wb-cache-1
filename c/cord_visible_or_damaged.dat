40|$|Abstract Thermal plasma {{discharges}} {{have been}} widely used in the past for treatment of living human and animal tissue. However, extensive thermal damage and tissue desiccation occurs due to extreme temperatures. Some solutions have been offered where the temperature is lowered by short current pulses, addition of noble gases, or significant decrease in the size of treatment electrodes. We propose a method of direct treatment of living tissue that occurs at room temperature and pressure without <b>visible</b> <b>or</b> microscopic tissue <b>damage.</b> The presented Floating-Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma is proven electrically safe to human subjects and our results show no gross (visual) <b>or</b> histological (microscopic) <b>damage</b> to skin samples in minutes, complete tissue sterilization from skin flora in seconds, and blood clot formation in seconds of electric plasma treatment. We also observe significant hastening of blood clot formation via electric plasma induced catalysis of “natural ” processes occurring in human blood. A model describing these processes is offered...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are increasingly being}} used in aircraft structures due to their superior properties. Although composites have a higher ability than metals to withstand fatigue loading, they have a lower resistance to impact. Moreover, unlike in metals where impact results in a <b>visible</b> dent <b>or</b> <b>damage,</b> impact on composite structures results in internal defects, which cannot be detected through a regular visual inspection. Thus composites necessitate more sophisticated methods of non-destructive inspection resulting in higher maintenance costs. One {{of the ways to}} bring down this cost is Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). SHM technologies would lead to a 'condition-based maintenance' or 'maintenance-on-demand' paradigm that would increase inspection intervals, leading to lower maintenance costs. Apart from the diagnostic role that SHM would play, an equally important aspect is prognostics, wherein the damage/defect growth rates can be predicted or estimated. The key to an effective SHM system for aircraft structures is not only the appropriate sensor selection but also the processing of the sensor data to predict the flight load and the damages, if any, in the structure. However, structural failure along with sensor malfunction during flight can pose a serious challenge and can lead to erroneous load estimation <b>or</b> inaccurate <b>damage</b> quantification which is extremely critical as far as a robust health monitoring scheme is considered. This paper discusses the issues and challenges in realizing a fully online SHM system...|$|R

40|$|Liver explants from 20 -day-old {{foetuses}} cultured for 48 h in {{the absence}} of serum released 70 % of their total soluble protein content into the medium. In the presence of serum this loss still amounted to 60 %. The concentration of total particulate protein remained unchanged but there was some translocation of mitochondrial enzymes to the cytosol, and enzymes expected to increase during this stage of development failed to do so. The addition of cortisol plus glucagon (to serum-containing media) did not decrease the loss of total soluble protein from the explants but induced considerable tyrosine aminotransferase activity which was not released into the medium. The observations suggest that under the usual culture conditions a minority of the cells retain their functional integrity.

30|$|The early {{texts on}} fire {{investigations}} promoted {{the use of}} identifying the varying degree of charring throughout the compartment to assist with origin determination. Rethoret (1945) describes that the fire investigator should “study closely the depth of carbonization at various places, as this will bring the investigator in {{getting back to the}} point of origin”. Straeter and Crawford (1955) text identified that “the point of deepest char in the wood {{is likely to be the}} point of origin of the fire”. Kennedy (1959) relates that “wooden joists or studding are exposed to burning…the sides exposed to the direction from which the fire is coming will be more severely burned and charred”. Prominent forensic scientist, Paul Kirk (1969), wrote in support of using depth of char for fire investigation in the following, “variations in depth of the char will inevitably be noted…and that this feature of the fire is of primary importance”. None of these texts, however, provided a methodology to the reader on how to go about identifying what constitutes greater and lesser <b>visible</b> <b>or</b> measurable char <b>damage.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research program conducted to enable accurate prediction {{of the impact}} tolerance of the shuttle Orbiter leading-edge wing panels using physics-based codes such as LS-DYNA, a nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic finite element code. The shuttle leading-edge panels are constructed of Reinforced-Carbon-Carbon (RCC) composite material, which is used because of its thermal properties to protect the shuttle during reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Accurate predictions of impact damage from insulating foam and other debris strikes that occur during launch required materials characterization of expected debris, including strain-rate effects. First, analytical models of individual foam and RCC materials were validated. Next, analytical models of foam cylinders impacting 6 - in. x 6 -in. RCC flat plates were developed and validated. LS-DYNA pre-test models of the RCC flat plate specimens established the impact velocity of the test for three damage levels: no-detectable damage, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) detectable <b>damage,</b> <b>or</b> <b>visible</b> <b>damage</b> such as a through crack or hole. Finally, the threshold of impact damage for RCC on representative Orbiter wing panels was predicted for both a small through crack and for NDE-detectable damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, and the Swedish cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea has steadily increased {{during the past}} 10 years. Seals locate the fishermen’s nets, damage the catch and tear holes in the nets. In this study we investigated the damages caused by seals on the net fishery for cod, Gadus morhua, in the central Baltic Sea. Damage includes both the visible damage and the hidden damage i. e. the fish that are taken whole without leaving any <b>visible</b> trace <b>or</b> <b>damages</b> to the nets. To gather the required data an observer joined two professional fishermen {{for a period of}} tree months in 2005. During that period all catch were recorded together with any visible damages. On some experimental links of nets the caught fish were marked without being removed from the net. The net was reset and when retrieved again the number of <b>damaged</b> <b>or</b> lost marked fish was noted. Corrections to the data were made to account for fish that spontaneously fall off. On 101 out of 184 links set out damaged fish were found. Damaged fish was most often found as small remains or with only the head of the fish left. At 20 out of 31 occasions when fish were left in the net, marked fish were missing <b>or</b> found <b>damaged</b> indicating a seal visit. 64. 3 percent of the marked cod were removed from the damaged links without leaving any visible trace, and an additional 10. 1 percent were damaged adding up to a total damage of 74. 4 percent of the catch. There was also a significant difference in catch per effort (cod caught per 100 m* 24 h) between damaged and non-damaged experimental links. Our findings show that the damage to the cod fishery caused by seals is large and that damage can not only be estimated by observing and counting retrieved damaged fish. The hidden damage is significant an...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{revealed that}} subjecting `Russet Burbank' potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants to 2 days of cool temperature growing conditions (18 °C days/ 10 °C nights) {{did not produce}} <b>visible</b> <b>damage</b> <b>or</b> changes in tuber pith tissue when compared to warm-grown tubers (23 °C days/ 18 °C nights). However, damage to some tuber pith cells was observed after 5 days of cool treatment. Eight days of cool treatment produced extensive alterations in cell structure. The cytoplasm of the cool-treated tuber pith cells had become highly vesiculated and there was evidence of complete destruction of amyloplast membranes and tonoplasts. In many cases the starch grains appeared to be undergoing hydrolysis suggesting total disruption of normal cell function. Sixteen days of cool treatment were sufficient to produce visible brown center development in all cool-grown tubers examined. Electron microscopy of these tissues revealed that, although some organelles were still present, the cytoplasm had become extremely vesiculated and lacked any resemblance to that of tissue from warm-grown tubers. Gross, irregular thickening of cell walls was also detected...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the usability of a variable square pulse (VSP) erbium-doped {{yttrium aluminium garnet}} (Er:YAG) laser for a lateral access osteotomy to the maxillary sinus {{in the course of}} a sinus elevation procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In six formalin-fixed human heads and six fresh sheep heads, a VSP Er:YAG laser was used to perform a bilateral maxillary access osteotomy. For the osteotomies, the Er:YAG laser was applied with a pulse energy of 1000 mJ, a pulse duration of 300 mus, and a frequency of 12 Hz. The spot size was 0. 9 mm, and the handpiece was kept approximately 10 mm from the bone surface. RESULTS: In all 24 sites investigated, the Er:YAG laser osteotomy was possible without any <b>visible</b> carbonization <b>or</b> thermal <b>damage.</b> The average time required for laser osteotomy for 12 standardized rectangular lateral windows in human cadavers was 39 s. No anatomical structures limited laser osteotomy, yet a critical evaluation of any membrane perforations was not possible because the postmortem fixation method caused partial detachment and fractional destruction. Laser-access osteotomy in six fresh sheep heads (12 sites) revealed major disruptions and perforations (< 8 mm) of the sinus membrane (100...|$|R

The {{current study was}} undertaken {{to determine if the}} fasteners of a clamp-type armrest receiver were prone to failure. The first test was used to examine the potential misalignment of the armrest receiver components that attach it to the frame. The second test was to evaluate the entire armrest using the American National Standards Institute/Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America armrest static strength standard. Finally, we conducted three fatigue tests. The first fatigue test was performed by repeating the static stability tests multiple times. The last two tests were {{a modified version of the}} double-drum wheelchair fatigue test used to apply repeated loading and vibration simultaneously. A paired t-test showed that there is no statistically significant difference (p = 0. 08), with a confidence of 95 %, between critical alignment measurements. The armrest including the receiver passed the standard requirement of a force of 760 N being applied outward at 15 °. During fatigue testing, we found that armrests did not exhibit any <b>visible</b> <b>or</b> functional <b>damage.</b> Upon completion of the tests, the armrests and receivers functioned properly. At about 100, 289 cycles on a double-drum test machine, three bolts failed on each armrest receiver when the screws were loosened to have only five threads engaged prior to commencing the test. The design of the armrest tested was in compliance with existing national and international standards. Currently, both International Standards Organization and American National Standards Institute/Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society committees are developing standards for seating systems that will include static, impact, and fatigue strength testing of devices like lateral torso supports, lateral hip support, etc. Methods similar to those explored in this study should be considered. This study may help manufacturers when designing products and purchasers or regulatory agencies when attempting to evaluate the safety and quality of armrest assemblies. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

Past {{studies have shown that}} levels of extracellular phenolics are elicited in plant cell suspensions in response to bacteria, and that tomato plants infected with viroids showed changes in apoplastic phenolics. The method described here monitored changes in apoplastic phenolics in tobacco leaves following bacterial inoculation of the same tissue.

Location of the inoculation on the leaf, position or developmental age of the leaf on the plant, and inoculum concentration were standardized for further experiments. The patterns of phenolic change in the apoplast were compared for tobacco inoculated with P. syringae pathovars, pv. syringae, which causes a resistant HR reaction within 15 h, and pv. tabaci, which causes a susceptible reaction with delayed visible symptoms. Both pathogens elicited lower increased levels of acetosyringone compared to the saprophyte, P. fluorescens but had greatly increased levels of the chlorogenic acid derivatives. The latter metabolites appear to have come from the intracellular stores, which coul...|$|R
