5000|$|Throughout {{the colonial}} period {{pilotage}} continued to develop.

By 1763 the Board of Wardens was created to regulate and license pilots and to strengthen <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilotage</b> established by early acts. When the first American president, George Washington, arrived in Elizabeth, New Jersey he boarded a stately ceremonial barge rowed by thirteen pilots in white uniforms to the Battery for his inauguration. [...] In 1784 the New York legislature recognized and strengthened state pilotage law. Under this legislation Zachary Rusler became the first New York State-licensed Sandy Hook Pilot. His license was signed by Governor George Clinton. When war came again with Great Britain the New York pilots distinguished themselves bravely by running the blockade and bringing news of war to American vessels in European ports as far as Gothenburg and Archangel. This service allowed American vessels valuable time to escape to neutral ports for safety. For much of the war commerce was in ruins and many pilots, whose exploits fill volumes, took to privateering, establishing a tradition of patriotism still alive today.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} {{vessels in}} excess of size limits determined by local authorities are handled in confined areas by a marine (or maritime) pilot. Marine pilots are seafarers with extensive seafaring experience and are usually qualified master mariners who have been trained as expert ship-handlers. These pilots are conversant with all types of vessel and propulsion systems, as well as handling ships of all sizes in all weather and tidal conditions. They are also experts in the geographical areas they work.In most countries, the pilot takes over the 'conduct' of the navigation from the ship master. This means that the master and crew should adhere to the pilot's orders in respect of the safe navigation of the vessel when in a <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilotage</b> area. The master may with good cause resume 'conduct' of the vessel's navigation. However this should never be done lightly. In situations where the pilot is an [...] "advisor" [...] {{even though he has}} the , the pilot or his [...] "Association" [...] have no responsibility or liability {{in the case of an}} accident. The master, upon realizing there is a dangerous situation developing, must take such action as to avoid an accident or at least to minimize the damage from one that can't be avoided.In some countries and areas (e.g. Scandinavia and the U.S.A.), the pilot's role is as an advisor. However, in practice, they are likely to have the conduct of the vessel, especially on larger ships using tug boats to assist. The general rule of thumb is that a pilot assumes command of a vessel and is not classed as [...] "an advisor" [...] in the Panama Canal, crossing the sill of a drydock, or in any port in Russia (or, perhaps, all the old Soviet states). This distinction is important because when a pilot is in command, the master can not take any action, but is limited to advising the pilot on any circumstance that creates what he considers a dangerous situation.|$|E

40|$|Does the {{creation}} of a deemed servant-master relationship, between pilot and ship-owner or master through section 76 (2) of the National Ports Act (hereafter the NPA); accurately reflect the de facto relationship in which the parties stand? Can the provision's importation of the doctrine of vicarious liability and consequent foisting of liability on the ship-owner be defined as logical, just and practical? It will be argued after having had recourse to the manner in which these roles have come to be defined and understood in South African labour jurisprudence, the governing law, respective positions occupied by ship-owner and port authority, broad-based considerations of policy, and key tenets of the rationale underpinning the concept of vicarious liability; that the answer to the above-raised questions is are sounding no. In addition, the writer will submit that the privatisation of pilotage services presents a solution, alternate to the irrational imposition of the doctrine of vicarious liability, which is palatable to government, ship-owning interests and pilot. a) Introduction Typically, claims arising from consequences of pilot error satisfy the definition of a 'maritime claim' contained in s 1 (1) (e) and s 1 (1) (l) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Regulation Act. As a result thereof; a South African court sitting in admiralty has jurisdiction to hear such claims. As to the identification of the appropriate law; s 6 (2) dictates that South African statute, if relevant, trumps pre-existing English admiralty law and is the law to be applied. The NPA, chiefly through sections 75 and 76, regulates the extent of the pilot's liability for his/her acts or omissions whilst a vessel is under <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilotage.</b> Thus, the Act is applicable to disputes arising from pilot error, before a South African court sitting in admiralty...|$|E

E-mail:hazmirusli@usim. edu. my. ［Abstract］The Straits of Malacca and Singapore {{are two of}} the world's most {{significant}} maritime chokepoints with navigational traffic amounting to approximately 74, 000 vessels annually. Part III of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) prescribes that vessels and aircraft of all flags may exercise the right of unimpeded transit passage when navigating through straits used for international navigation. Conceptually, through the introduction of the transit passage regime, the UNCLOS has prohibited any form of toll imposition on transiting ships. The conferment of this right to ships of all flags has created a difficult situation for the States bordering these busy waterways, particularly in protecting the marine environment of such straits from vessel-source pollution. Australia has been successful in designating the Torres Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) in 2005 ，with <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilotage</b> as the applicable Associated Protective Measure (APM), thus, minimising the risks of maritime casualties in the said waterway. Assuming that the PSSA designation is also extended to the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, the implementation of the most potentially suitable APM would probably materialise through the introduction of a “cost recovery mechanism” which could be in the form of toll-levying scheme, given the nature of the Straits which are busy with transiting traffic. The funds collected from toll collection could be used to maintain and upgrade the aids to navigation installed along the Straits, which, in turn, would enhance the safety of navigation, hence reducing the risks of maritime accidents that may pose threats to the marine environment of the Straits. This paper aims to discuss the question of the viability and practicability of the application of this toll-levying scheme if such is introduced in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore and the potential legal and political implications arising out of such an implementation. ［文摘］马六甲和新加坡海峡是世界上两个重要的海上通道，每年有总计约 7. 4 万艘船舶的航行交通量。 1982 年《联合国海洋法公约》第三部分规定，所有船旗国的船舶和飞机，在通过用于国际航行的海峡时，都享有不受阻碍的过境通行权。从概念上来说，通过引入过境通行制度，《联合国海洋法公约》已经禁止对过境船舶征收任何形式的通行费。给予所有船旗国船舶这一权利，令毗邻这些繁忙航道的国家处境困难，尤其是在保护海峡海洋环境免受来自船舶的污染方面。澳大利亚已于 2005 年成功指定托雷斯海峡为“特别敏感海域”，并以强制引航作为可适用的相关保护措施，这有助于托雷斯海峡海上事故风险的最小化。假定将马六甲和新加坡海峡也指定为特别敏感海域，鉴于其繁忙的过境交通性质，通过引入“成本回收机制”(以通行费征收制度的形式) ，或许能实现最适宜的相关保护措施的实施。收取通行费而筹集的基金可以用于维护和更新沿整个马六甲和新加坡海峡设置的助航设备，提高航行安全，从而降低可能对海峡海洋环境造成威胁的海上事故的风险。本文旨在探讨在马六甲和新加坡海峡引入这种通行费征收制度的可行性和实用性问题，以及实施中可能引起的法律和政治影响...|$|E
40|$|The Great Barrier Reef sustains {{a variety}} of {{commercial}} and recreational activities and livelihoods including fishing, tourism, recreation and shipping. Those activities pose a source of harm to the biodiversity, use and amenity values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The threat of day-to-day shipping operations on the Reef’s ecosystem is largely unquantified but could represent a not inconsequential contribution to the overall levels of contaminants entering the Marine Park, potentially diminishing the amenity or water quality at sites which are already affected by other activities or susceptible to influxes of land sourced pollutants. There is also the potential for more serious impacts to the outstanding natural, social and economic values of the region following a major shipping accident. While the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is the principal custodian of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the administration of a suite of measures to regulate all ships and vessel activities {{in the region is}} shared with two other Commonwealth government authorities and one state government authority. The complexity of international and domestic shipping and environmental protection laws presents many challenges for the region’s responsible management. This thesis examines the environmental and socioeconomic impacts to the Reef from the operations of ships and other vessel based activities and the practical application and effect of regulatory measures that have been developed and implemented to remedy those impacts. It describes the origins, development and implementation of the key ship routeing initiatives in the form of <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilotage,</b> a vessel traffic service and provisions under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 to control use and access to high conservation zones. It also analyses recent developments at international and national law prescribing actions that can be taken to deal with operational vessel sourced waste discharges, the administrative arrangements for dealing with a maritime casualty as well the preparedness and response to oil and chemical spills. A significant part of the intellectual value of the thesis is derived from analysing the operation and interaction of international, Commonwealth and Queensland State marine pollution legislation and identifying issues which could affect the efficacy of those laws and related measures in protecting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The findings of the research support the premise that shipping and other vessel based activities within the Great Barrier Reef are generally conducted to a high standard. Nonetheless, as shipping and other vessel based activities continue to expand within the region, so does the risk of an accident or marine pollution event. It is suggested that the ship regulatory authorities should judiciously apply the precautionary principle and keep under review the widest possible range of ship safety, marine pollution prevention and environmental standards and measures available under international law to ensure the Great Barrier Reef remains a national and international icon...|$|E
