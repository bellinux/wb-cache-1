50|$|Like the OPR-1000 and {{preceding}} C-E designs, the APR-1400 has two {{reactor coolant}} loops.

In loop 2, there is one pressurizer (PZR) on the hot leg, where a steam bubble is maintained during operation. The loops are arranged symmetrically, so the hot legs are diametrically opposed on the RPV's circumference. Because the SGs are elevated relative to the RPV, natural convection will circulate reactor coolant {{in the event of}} RCP malfunction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} status of the {{progress}} that was made towards Design Certification of System 80 +{trademark} during the US government`s 1996 fiscal year. The System 80 + Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) is a 3931 MW (1350 MWe) Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). The design covers an essentially complete plant. It is based on EPRI ALWR Utility Requirements Document (URD) improvements to the Standardized System 80 Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) in operation at Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3. The NSSS is a traditional two-loop arrangement with two steam generators, two hot <b>legs</b> and four <b>cold</b> <b>legs,</b> each with a reactor coolant pump. The System 80 + standard design houses the NSSS in a spherical steel containment vessel which is enclosed in a concrete shield building, thus providing the safety advantages of a dual barrier to radioactivity release.

60|$|A {{little out}} of the village, Modestine, filled with the demon, set her heart upon a by-road, and {{positively}} refused to leave it. I dropped all my bundles, and, I am ashamed to say, struck the poor sinner twice across the face. It was pitiful to see her lift her head with shut eyes, {{as if waiting for}} another blow. I came very near crying, but I did a wiser thing than that, and sat squarely down by the roadside to consider my situation under the cheerful influence of tobacco and a nip of brandy. Modestine, in the meanwhile, munched some black bread with a contrite hypocritical air. It was plain that I must make a sacrifice to the gods of shipwreck. I threw away the empty bottle destined to carry milk; I threw away my own white bread, and, disdaining to act by general average, kept the black bread for Modestine; lastly, I threw away the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> of mutton and the egg-whisk, although this last was dear to my heart. Thus I found room for everything in the basket, and even stowed the boating-coat on the top.

A mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an enormous ham, a <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation.

40|$|We use the TESIS EUV {{telescope}} {{to study the}} current sheet signatures observed during flux rope eruption. The special feature of the TESIS telescope was its ability to image the solar corona up to a distance of 2 R_ from the Sun's center in the Fe 171 Å line. The Fe 171 Å line emission illuminates the magnetic field lines, and the TESIS images reveal the coronal magnetic structure at high altitudes. The analyzed CME had a core with a spiral-flux rope-structure. The spiral shape indicates that the flux rope radius varied along its length. The flux rope had a complex temperature structure: <b>cold</b> <b>legs</b> (70 000 K, observed in He 304 Å line) and a hotter core (0. 7 MK, observed in Fe 171 Å line). Such structure contradicts the common assumption that the CME core is a cold prominence. When the CME impulsively accelerated, a dark double Y-structure appeared below the flux rope. The Y-structure timing, location, and morphology agree with the previously performed MHD simulations of the current sheet.

6000|$|I {{knew one}} disrespectable dog. He was far liker a cat; cared {{little or nothing}} for men, with whom he merely coexisted as we do with cattle, and was entirely devoted {{to the art of}} poaching. A house would not hold him, and to live in a town was what he refused. He led, I believe, a life of troubled but genuine pleasure, and perished beyond all {{question}} in a trap. But this was an exception, a marked reversion to the ancestral type; like the hairy human infant. The true dog of the nineteenth century, to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance, is in love with respectability. A street-dog was once adopted by a lady. While still an Arab, he had done as Arabs do, gambolling in the mud, charging into butchers' stalls, a cat-hunter, a sturdy beggar, a common rogue and vagabond; but with his rise into society he laid aside these inconsistent pleasures. He stole no more, he hunted no more cats; and conscious of his collar he ignored his old companions. Yet the canine upper class was never brought to recognize the upstart, and from that hour, except for human countenance, he was alone. Friendless, shorn of his sports and the habits of a lifetime, he still lived in a glory of happiness, content with his acquired respectability, and with no care but to support it solemnly. Are we to condemn or praise this self-made dog! We praise his human brother. And thus to conquer vicious habits is as rare with dogs as with men. With the more part, for all their scruple-mongering and moral thought, the vices that are born with them remain invincible throughout; and they live all their years, glorying in their virtues, but still the slaves of their defects. Thus the sage Coolin was a thief to the last; among a thousand peccadilloes, a whole goose and a whole <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> of mutton lay upon his conscience; but Woggs,[22] whose soul's shipwreck in the matter of gallantry I have recounted above, has only twice been known to steal, and has often nobly conquered the temptation. The eighth is his favourite commandment. There is something painfully human in these unequal virtues and mortal frailties of the best. Still more painful is the bearing of those [...] "stammering professors"[23] in the house of sickness and under the terror of death. It is beyond a doubt to me that, somehow or other, the dog connects together, or confounds, the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness of guilt. To the pains of the body he often adds the tortures of the conscience; and at these times his haggard protestations form, in regard to the human deathbed, a dreadful parody or parallel.|$|E

The complexity of this accident scenario is compounded by multiple physical phenomena {{that are involved in}} the air ingress event.

In an attempt to better understand the phenomenon, the FLUENT- 6 computational fluid dynamics code was used to assess two air ingress experiments.

These separate effects tests were conducted to understand and model the a multi-component experiment in which all three processes were included with the introduction of air in a heated graphite column. MIT used the FLUENT code to benchmark these series of tests with quite good results. These tests are generically applicable to prismatic reactors and the lower reflector regions of pebble-bed reactors.

From original LBLOCA input deck file, the nodalization of downcomer and junction connections with 4 <b>cold</b> <b>legs</b> and direct vessel injection lines are modified for reflecting the realistic cross-flow effect and real downcomer structure. The analysis results show that the peak cladding temperature of new input deck decreases more rapidly than previous result and that the drop of peak cladding temperature was advanced by application of momentum flux term in cross-flow. Additionally, the authors developed a new input deck with multi-dimensional downcomer model and ran MARS code with multi-dimensional input deck as well.

40|$|High {{neutron flux}} in {{core of a}} nuclear reactor can affect the {{material}} of Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV). The neutron radiation has a detrimental impact on the mechanical properties of the RPV material such as hardening (or embrittlement) while neutrons are absorbed by the material. A major concern in embrittled RPVs is propagation of critical flaw which may cause through-wall cracks. Some transients leading to overcooling of RPV intensify the propagation of the cracks and known as Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS). Such situation could be created in case of Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) actuation which leads to injection of cold water into the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> of the primary loop in some accidents, e. g. Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA). The investigation of PTS is performed throughout three steps including Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA); thermal-hydraulics and structural mechanics i. e. fracture mechanics. The final goal of the thermal-hydraulics analysis step is the prediction of the imposed temperature gradient on the downcomer {{as a result of}} single-phase and two-phase phenomena. Depending on the leak size, its location and the operation condition of the plant after LOCA, water in the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> can be in single-phase or two-phase condition. Two-phase PTS will occur when steam and water are in the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> during the injection of ECCS water. The ECCS water enters the hot steam flow environment in the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> and two phase stratified flow propagates in the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> by means of density difference between water and steam. Condensation of steam and mass transfer between two phases is the only heat source in this zone and the accurate modeling of DCC plays a significant role to predict temperature profile in downcomer. The interfacial heat transfer coefficient is defined according to eddy contact time with both steam and water at interface which is a function of turbulence characteristics. The high gradient of velocity generates too high turbulence when differential eddy viscosity models are used and some modifications should be considered in turbulence models at the interface. Implementation of turbulence damping function in turbulence eddy frequency transport equation is one of this modification. Although the new source function improves velocity profile of smooth stratified flow, but significant deviations reveal when the vertical motion of the interface is considerable. Also, the value of turbulence kinetic energy decreases substantially by employment of damping function without the other modification. The reduction of turbulence kinetic energy at the interface changes the value of heat transfer coefficient. In this paper, the other source function of turbulence is proposed by consideration of different boundary condition at the interface and the effect of turbulence characteristics on condensation rate is demonstrated. The results show that implementation of damping function, without any special treatment of turbulence kinetic energy, leads to a considerable overestimation of condensation rate which would be improved with employment of proposed turbulence source function at the interface. then, the new turbulence model is used for stratified flow zone in PTS scenario in VVER- 1000 RPV to find the effect of interfacial heat transfer coefficient on temperature profile in the <b>cold</b> <b>leg.</b> For this purpose, the plant response to LOCA is simulated by RELAP system code until the injection of ECCS water.

The results show that, in the <b>cold</b> <b>leg</b> safety injection the primary pressure decreases with time and remains higher than the secondary pressure {{for a period of time}} (~ 500 sec) during whichthe steam generators remains as a heat sink for the primary side, the accumulators start late and functioning on remaining transient time, and a repeatable loop seal clearing and refill occurs. During the hot leg safety injection the primary pressure decreases rapidly but remains higher than the secondary pressure for a longer period of time (~ 600 sec), the accumulators start early and functioning on a part of the transient time before they are totally discharged, and there is no repeatable loop seal clearing and refill. In the two modes the maximum clad surface temperature does not violate the safety limit...|$|E
40|$|During a {{postulated}} loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) in a {{pressurized water}} reactor (PWR) it is of vital importance that the reactor core remains properly cooled. The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) in German PWRs compensates the loss of coolant with injection of additional coolant into the <b>cold</b> <b>legs</b> as well as into the hot legs. While the coolant is injected in the <b>cold</b> <b>legs</b> through nozzles, the hot leg injection is performed {{by means of a}} secondary pipe placed {{at the bottom of the}} pipe of the primary circuit. The subject of this thesis concerns the latter case. The liquid injected into the hot leg flows directly into the core from its upper part and constitutes a rapid delivery of coolant into the reactor core at high mass flow rate. However, saturated steam is generated in the reactor core due to depressurization of the primary system and flows out of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) into the hot leg. Therefore, a countercurrent stratified flow of injected coolant and saturated steam occurs along one and a half meter inside the hot leg before the coolant reaches the RPV. This horizontal stratified countercurrent flow of coolant and steam is only stable for a certain range of coolant and steam mass flow rates. Even if the coolant is injected at very high velocities and high Froude numbers, there is always a threshold steam velocity above which the cooling of the reactor core can be reduced or complete interrupted. This phenomenon is known in two-phase flow science as countercurrent flow limitation (CCFL), since there is a limitation of liquid delivery due to the presence of a gas phase flowing countercurrently to the liquid phase. CCFL in reflux condensation cooling was more investigated than in ECC in the hot leg. For this purpose, the test facility WENKA was built at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH (Germany) to investigate for which flow conditions CCFL poses a safety risk during hot leg injection and to provide experimental data to support the analysis of such an accident scenario with CFD - Codes. The WENKA test facility models a simplified PWR hot leg geometry including the secondary pipeline placed at the bottom of the main coolant line. The countercurrent flow of coolant and saturated steam during injection by means of the ECCS was investigated with air and water in a rectangular test section. The fluid dynamics of the injection process was reproduced for a wide range of flow conditions to identify flow regimes and to derive 1 -dimensional models to predict the limits of coolant delivery. On the other hand, a data base of local flow parameters was established to enhance CFD - Codes performance. Experimental local velocities of the liquid film were obtained by means of particle image velocimetry and the liquid film morphology was analyzed depending on the flow regimes. (orig.)

40|$|The RELAP/MOD 3. 2 {{computer}} code has been assessed using an 11 % upper plenum break {{experiment in the}} PSB test facility at the Electrogorsk Research and Engineering Center. This work was performed {{as part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's International Nuclear Safety Program, and is part of the effort addressing the capability of the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 code to model transients in Soviet-designed reactors. Designated VVER Standard Problem PSBV 1, the test addressed several important phenomena related to VVER behavior that the code needs to simulate well. The code was judged to reasonably model the phenomena of two-phase flow natural circulation in the primary coolant system, asymmetric loop behavior, leak flow, loop seal clearance in the <b>cold</b> <b>legs,</b> heat transfer in a covered core, heat transfer in a partially covered core, pressurizer thermal-hydraulics, and integral system effects. The code was judged to be in minimal agreement with the experiment data for the mixture level and entrainment in the core, leading to a user recommendation to assess the sensitivity of transient calculations to the interphase drag modeling in the core. No judgments were made for the phenomena of phase separation without mixture level formation, mixture level and entrainment in the steam generators, pool formation in the upper plenum, or flow stratification in horizontal pipes because either the phenomenon did not occur in the test or there were insufficient measurements to characterize the behavior...|$|R
