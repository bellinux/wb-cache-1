The cascade heat pump consists of 4 systems: the chilled water system, the low-temperature refrigeration cycle using R 22, the high-temperature heat pump cycle using R 134 a and the hot water system. The cascade heat pump produces both chilled water for cooling application and hot water for heating application. A transient performance is observed when the hot water system is in a closed-loop operation. As the hot water temperature increases, the <b>condensing</b> <b>pressure</b> of the heat pump cycle also increases but the other refrigerant pressures have marginal changes. The operation of the test rig is terminated when the <b>condensing</b> <b>pressure</b> reaches the limit of the system. The <b>condensing</b> <b>pressure</b> at high hot water flow rate increases at a lower rate than that in case of the low hot water flow rate, so the working period is higher. The compressor power of the heat pump cycle increases continuously with time whereas the compressor power of the refrigeration cycle is almost constant. The condensation heat and cooling load rapidly increase at the beginning, and the condensation heat gradually increases whereas the cooling load is almost constant. The COP of the heat pump cycle gradually decreases with time after the rapid increase at the beginning, but the COP of the refrigeration cycle is almost constant. It can be concluded that the variation of the <b>condensing</b> <b>pressure</b> of the heat pump cycle with time has a little influences to the refrigeration cycle.

A theoretical energy balance was conducted, from which the potential of recovering refrigeration condenser heat was estimated at up to 60 % of the water heating energy requirements. Preliminary tests with heat exchangers lead {{to the use of}} a tube-in-tube, counter flow, heat exchanger with fins on the refrigerant side, and cores on the water side, to improve the heat transfer characteristics. The exchanger, designed to provide 300 litres of 60 °C water from a 2. 25 kw refrigeration system cooling 2000 litres of milk per day, had an area of 0. 84 m 2, and an overall thermal conductance of 100 W. m- 2. °C- 1. This heat exchanger was inserted between the compressor and condenser of the refrigeration plant and tested with two condenser systems (air and water), four <b>condenser</b> <b>pressures</b> (6. 5 bar, 7. 5 bar, 10 bar and 12 bar), two milk inlet temperatures(23 °C and l 8 °C), and two milk final temperatures (4 °C and 7 °C). In addition, tests on receiver pressure and suction superheat were performed to determine overall system performance. Increasing <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure</b> increased cooling times from 2 hours 32 minutes to 3 hours 17 minutes, after the completion of the 1200 litre morning milking (thus failing to comply with the 3 hour cooling regulation at high <b>condenser</b> <b>pressures.)</b> Also, C. O. P. decreased from 3. 05 to 2. 35 for the water cooled condenser system (2. 70 to 2. 00 for the air cooled condenser system due to fan power consumption). Gross heat recovery rose from 4. 2 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 8. l kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for the water cooled system, giving water outlet temperatures of 45 °C to 64 °C as <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure</b> rose. The corresponding ranges for air cooled condensers were 3. 8 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, to 6. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, and 38 °C to 55 °C. Changing milk inlet and final temperatures gave a proportional change in cooling times and total heat recovery, but had no effect on C. O. P. or heat recovery rates. Suction superheating increased total heat recovery by 15 %, and water outlet temperatures by 9 %. Increases in gross heat recovery with increasing <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure</b> were partially offset by additional compressor power, and yielded nett heat recoveries of 4. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 6. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for water cooled, and 3. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 4. 3 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for air cooled, condenser systems. The maximum gross and nett heat recoveries (at 12 bar <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure)</b> were applied to the energy requirements of a monitored 220 cow town supply dairy. This analysis showed that the gross heat recovery was 51 % of the water heating requirements, but the nett heat recovery dropped to 17 % of the total heating and refrigeration demand. Based on current electricity and equipment prices, it is estimated that the payback period for this level of recovery would be 16 - 17 years.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} installation of two temperature sensing RTD's in the BC's. Previously, the temperature sensing device used in all three cryostats consisted of a FNAL designed liquid sensing probe (see EN- 168, and drawing ME- 273505). This device was necessary because of the concern that overfilling LN 2 into the main vent line during cooldown could create an undesirable back pressure on the relief valves or rupture disks. This could possibly hinder the relieving of argon gas at the required flow rate in a safety situation. The probe was installed on the CC, and has been operating perfectly, therefore, this probe will not be changed. Figure 1 shows the location of TS 232 E, the CC liquid sensing probe. Note that the probe is located downstream of the condenser outlet valve (PV 210 N), therefore, it effectively operates under atmospheric pressure. On the BC's, however, the probe was originally installed at a different location, upstream of the condenser outlet valve (PV 110 N or PV 310 N). This resulted in the probe effectively sensing the <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure,</b> which varied from approximately 30 psia to 60 psia during cooldown. The changing pressure meant that the corresponding temperature at which liquid appeared also changed. The probe then became inaccurate, especially at higher <b>condenser</b> <b>pressures,</b> when the probe would be fail to trip at the higher liquid temperature. The solution was to replace the original probe with an RTD. This involved using the PLC to compare the temperature sensed by the RTD to the liquid saturation temperature, calculated using the measured <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure.</b> A formula was created to calculate the saturation temperature from the <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure.</b> This formula was derived by curve fitting points taken from the NBS Technical Note 129 for nitrogen. A 2 nd order equation was used to fit the points, since the accuracy was not very important for temperature comparison. The entire equation was then shifted so that the curve was above all of the actual points. This was done {{to insure that the}} formula would provide higher temperatures, so the comparison to the RTD would be conservative, switching before the temperature reached saturation. Figure 2 shows the curve used to fit the data points. The lower curve is the actual data, and the higher curve is the formula to be used. Using the formula derived, the PLC calculates a conservative saturation temperature from the <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure</b> is measured by PT 110 N or PT 310 N, on the ECN and ECS, respectively. The transmitters are Rosemount 0 - 75 psia pressure transmitters. The PLC then compares the calculated temperature to the measured temperature from the RTD's, EIl 32 E and EI 332 E, which are Omega platinum RTD probes, model PR- 14 - 2 - 100 - 1 / 4 - 12 -E. If the measured temperature drops below the calculated saturation temperature, an alarm signals on the view page, and the PLC automatically closes the two inlet condenser valves (PV 101 N and PV 102 N, or PV 301 N and PV 302 N). As a final note, there are various advantages and disadvantages to using the RTD's instead of the original probe. The advantages are that the RTD's provide constant monitoring of the temperature, whereas the probe was basically designed as a switch. The RTD's are more accurate in that they can respond over the range of the <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure.</b> The probe was designed to operate under atmospheric pressure. The only disadvantage of the RTD's is that they sense temperature, therefore, they cannot distinguish saturated GN 2 from liquid, while the probe was designed specifically to do so. Overall, however, the RTD's provide an acceptable {{solution to the problem of}} liquid sensing in the vent line. Figure 3 shows the final location of the RTD on the ECN. The ECS location is the same...|$|R

Results from two tests have been presented, for first test the average feed water temperature was maintained around 97 C under local atmospheric pressure, while for the second test the average feed water temperature was maintained around 115 C under 200 kPa absolute pressure. For both the tests the initial <b>condenser</b> <b>pressure</b> was maintained around 6 kPa absolute. The maximum power output of the turbine {{is estimated to be}} around 1330 W with an isentropic efficiency of around 25 %...|$|R
