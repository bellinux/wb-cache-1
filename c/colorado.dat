5|$|All {{registered}} <b>Colorado</b> Ranger Horses trace {{directly to}} one of two foundation sires in their pedigree. The first is Patches #1 and the second is Max #2, a son of another horse named Max born in 1918. Registered <b>Colorado</b> Rangerbreds may be bred to registered Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, Appaloosas, Arabians and AraAppaloosas, and the resulting progeny registered as purebred <b>Colorado</b> Rangerbreds. Horses with draft horse or pony blood may not be registered. <b>Colorado</b> Ranger Horses may be double-registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club, but Appaloosas may not be registered with the CRHA unless they have the proper bloodlines. Approximately 90 percent of <b>Colorado</b> Ranger horses are dual-registered.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{approximately}} 12.7million {{people lived}} in the <b>Colorado</b> River basin. Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower <b>Colorado</b> River below Davis Dam, which includes Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson, Arizona; St. George, Utah; and Grand Junction, <b>Colorado.</b> <b>Colorado</b> River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40percent.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower <b>Colorado</b> River captured this drainage and the drainage from {{much of the rest}} of the <b>Colorado</b> Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower <b>Colorado</b> probably captured the landlocked Upper <b>Colorado</b> somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E
