40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think {{can be done to}} include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind by the teachers; participation of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind, additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind. The teachers also believed that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind can be helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind, teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind can be exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind...|$|R

This {{article describes the}} use of experience books, associated with the Language Expe-rience Approach (LEA), as a motivating and linguistically ap-propriate literacy tool for young <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> DHH. The authors explain how remediation strategies enhance early liter-acy interactions with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> DHH and demonstrate how experience books {{can be used in}} a way that mitigates po-tential weaknesses of LEA. A case study is presented that demon-strates how experience books provided opportunities for implicit and explicit language and literacy teaching and learning in one family with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> DHH. Political and educational forces have converged to create a sense of urgency in regard to preventing reading disability (National Reading Panel, 2000; No Child Left Behind, 2001).

40|$|Carol Dweck's (1988) social-cognitive {{theory of}} {{achievement}} proposes that individuals {{will be most}} likely to pursue challenges and persevere {{in the face of}} obstacles if they (a) attribute failures to lack of effort, (b) possess an incremental theory of intelligence, and (c) possess high confidence in their intelligence. A recent study by Breed and Koestner (1991) showed that all 3 of these factors enhanced motivation among 5 th and 6 th grade children in regular classes.

Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the Kolozsvár ghetto in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Henry II was {{the first}} of the Angevin rulers of England, {{so-called}} because he was also the Count of Anjou in Northern France. Henry had also acquired the huge duchy of Aquitaine by marriage, and England became a key part of a loose-knit assemblage of lands spread across Western Europe, later termed the Angevin Empire. Henry reasserted royal authority and rebuilt the royal finances, intervening to claim power in Ireland and promoting the Anglo-Norman colonisation of the country. Henry strengthened England's borders with Wales and Scotland, and used the country's wealth to fund a long-running war with his rivals in France, but arrangements for his succession once again proved problematic. Several revolts broke out, led by Henry's <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> eager to acquire power and lands, sometimes backed by France, Scotland and the Welsh princes.

40|$|Studies of how <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind {{acquire and}} use {{language}} have focused less on cognitive compensations {{and more on}} delays in development. Vision {{is important in the}} establishment of early communicative patterns, and sighted children regularly use contextual visual information, such as a speaker's gestures and eye gaze, to make sense of speech that is directed at them (Mills, 1988). Some researchers have argued that, in the absence of vision, children may be expected to have more difficulty understanding concepts and the relationships between them and in acquiring generalizations about language and the way it works (Andersen, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1993).
