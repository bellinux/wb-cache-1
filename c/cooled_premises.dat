500|$|Los Angeles Times {{columnist}} Andrew Hanson {{thought the}} whole episode was [...] "disturbing, even for Fringe", and {{was pleased that}} the killers were shot rather than arrested due to the heinousness of their crimes. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall believed the episode contained some of the cast's best performances, especially praising Lance Reddick's portrayal of a [...] "very human, caring hero who has been damaged but not crippled by the tragedy that struck his family" [...] and Anna Torv's ability to subtly play both Olivias. IGN's Phil Pirrello believed [...] "the Broyles Factor padded a <b>cool</b> <b>premise</b> with a solid (if unremarkable) execution that lead to a great final five minutes." [...] In January 2013, IGN ranked it the eighth best episode of the entire series, explaining that [...] "this one holds a special place for having so many elements of what makes Fringe great...

2500|$|Christina Roberts of Culturess felt Slingshot was [...] "a <b>cool</b> <b>premise</b> for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to do. It builds off {{characters}} {{we already}} know and gives the ones less utilized a little more action. Honestly, I would have loved if {{this was just a}} standalone episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., too. While the ongoing storylines and plot threads are fun, an episode that can stand on its own is always a nice breath of fresh air... It will be fun to see if any of this carries over into the rest of the show when it returns, even if it’s just a wink and a nod between Daisy and Elena." [...] Geek Exchange's Georgia Ringelberg felt, [...] "Overall, the digital series is unnecessary because the plot doesn’t add anything to the larger series as we await the second half of season 4. But it is enjoyable to watch with quite a few nice nods to {{the first half of the}} season... It’s a fun, quick watch that’s perfect for getting through the mid-season break and hopefully gets Yo-Yo/Slingshot some well-deserved attention." [...] Additionally, Ringelberg felt the use of Rodriguez in the series would lead [...] "to more screen time for Yo-Yo and maybe even preparing viewers for the Inhumans series... If they transition her to Inhumans or give her time on both shows, she could be strategically utilized instead of mostly forgotten the way she is now." ...|$|R
40|$|What role can climatically {{appropriate}} subdivision design play in {{decreasing the}} use of energy required to <b>cool</b> <b>premises</b> by maximising access to natural ventilation? How can this design be achieved? The subdivision design stage is critical to urban and suburban sustainability outcomes, as significant changes after development are constrained by {{the configuration of the}} subdivision, and then by the construction of the dwellings. Existing Australian lot rating methodologies for energy efficiency, such as that by the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA), focus on reducing heating needs by increasing solar access, a key need in Australia’s temperate zone. A recent CRC CI project, Sustainable Subdivisions: Energy (Miller and Ambrose 2005) examined these guidelines {{to see if they could}} be adapted for use in subtropical South East Queensland (SEQ). Correlating the lot ratings with dwelling ratings, the project found that the SEDA guidelines would need to be modified for use to make allowance for natural ventilation. In SEQ, solar access for heating is less important than access to natural ventilation, and there is a need to reduce energy used to cool dwellings. In Queensland, the incidence of residential air-conditioning was predicted to reach 50 per cent by the end of 2005 (Mickel 2004). The CRC-CI, Sustainable Subdivisions: Ventilation Project (CRC-CI, in progress), aims to verify and quantify the role natural ventilation has in cooling residences in subtropical climates and develop a lot rating methodology for SEQ. This paper reviews results from an industry workshop that explored the current attitudes and methodologies used by a range of professionals involved in subdivision design and development in SEQ. Analysis of the workshop reveals that a key challenge for sustainability is that land development in subtropical SEQ is commonly a separate process from house design and siting. Finally, the paper highlights some of the issues that regulators and industry face in adopting a lot rating methodology for subdivisions offering improved ventilation access, including continuing disagreement between professionals over the desirability of rating tools...|$|R

40|$|As a {{first step}} in {{assessing}} the potential of thermal energy storage in Swedish buildings, the current situation of the Swedish building stock and different storage methods are discussed in this paper. Overall, many buildings are from the 1960 ’s or earlier having a relatively high energy demand, creating opportunities for large energy savings. The major means of heating are electricity for detached houses and district heating for multi dwelling houses and <b>premises.</b> <b>Cooling</b> needs are relatively low but steadily increasing, emphasizing the need to consider energy storage for both heat and cold. The thermal mass of a building is important for passive storage of thermal energy but this has not been considered much when constructing buildings in Sweden. Instead, common ways of storing thermal energy in Swedish buildings today is in water storage tanks or in the ground using boreholes, while latent thermal energy storage is still very uncommon.

40|$|District-heating and/or cooling {{systems are}} {{gradually}} becoming popular {{all over the}} world for heating and/or <b>cooling</b> of large <b>premises.</b> Current conventional practice for the DHC underground distribution networks is to place the supply and the return pipelines side-by-side in air-filled trencRe's. However, t present investigation has shown that by optimising the location of the pipelines, the thermal insulation provided by the air around the pipes can be maximised. This is achieved by placing the hot pipeline above the cold one, the exact position depending upon the temperatures involved. For most purposes, it is recommended that the displacement ratio for the hot pipe is to be at - 0. 7 or - 0. 08 and that of the cold pipe at 0. 05 or 0. 67 for district heating or cooling respectively [i. e. the hot and cold pipes being placed in the upper and lower halves of the trench respectively].

40|$|Modernization of {{fluorescent}} lighting with LED This report addresses {{the possibility to}} replace existing lighting solutions based on fluorescent tubes of type T 8 (diameter 26 mm), and their ancestors T 12 (diameter 38 mm) with modern retrofit-­‐style light-­‐sources where light is emitted from solid-­‐state diodes, i. e. LEDs. The report describes basic prerequisites for artificial lighting, and a description of currently common lighting techniques in domestic Swedish commercial buildings. In the description of LED-­‐retrofit light sources a summary of their usefulness and their limitations is given. The text gives some guidance in identifying existing luminaires and is aimed at a decision on possible use of retrofit-­‐tubes, and if so, which type of retrofit tube. The conclusion is that LED-­‐based retrofit tubes often are technically suitable but states that certain prerequisites must be considered: The retrofit tubes are not suitable for use in every environment, they require luminaires where serial connection of multiple tubes is not used (for EM-­‐design) or multi-­‐tube HF-­‐drivers is not used. The retrofit tubes require that light-­‐reduction (dimming) is not installed. The energy consumption is often substantially reduced by replacing incandescent lighting with LED-­‐ retrofit tubes, but the economic facts must be calculated based upon several parameters in each actual case, such as yearly time of use, the heating or possibly <b>cooling</b> of the <b>premises,</b> besides the obvious costs of acquiring, installing and maintaining {{the different types of}} lighting...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen {{people living}} {{in or near the}} city of Gloucester fell ill with Legionnaires' disease caused by Legionella pneumophila {{serogroup}} (SG) 1 between 27 August and 27 October 1986. Another patient had fallen ill on 30 May. Nine of the 15 were diagnosed retrospectively during a case finding exercise. There were three deaths. Three cases of Pontiac fever were also diagnosed. The source was probably one or more wet <b>cooling</b> towers. Nineteen <b>premises</b> in the city with such towers were identified, and three just outside Gluocester. Samples from 11 of the 22 premises grew Legionella spp.; from nine of these L. pneumophila SG 1 (Pontiac) was isolated. The efficacy of regular addition of biocide in addition to hypochlorite added at the time of disinfection in inhibiting the growth of Legionella spp. was demonstrated. A survey of patients' movements during their likely incubation period showed that there was no single building that all patients had visited, but there were two areas of the city which nearly all had visited or passed through by car. A case-control study demonstrated an association with one of these areas. Cooling towers near both areas may have been sources but the evidence is insufficient to incriminate any single one. The unexpected finding of L. pneumophila SG 1 (Pontiac) in nine towers supports the hypothesis {{that there may have been}} multiple sources. Cooling towers may have been contaminated by mains water or by drift from other towers...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy use}} in a {{workshop}} company has been examined in this work {{in order to find}} areas for energy efficiency improvement. The combined oil and electricity heating in the company were compared with other alternative heating systems including <b>cooling</b> of the <b>premises</b> in following combinations: Ground source heat pump for heating and cooling District heating and absorption cooling District heating and low temperate surface water cooling Energy use, operation costs and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for the current heating systems and the three alternatives including cooling. The ground source heat pump for heating and cooling decreases bought energy with 34 MWh annually compared to current heating only. The district heating and low temperate surface water cooling has the largest reduction of operation cost and carbon dioxide. The operation cost decreases with 42 kSEK and the carbon dioxide with 43 metric ton CO 2 annually. The differences between the alternatives were smaller concerning the operation costs. The ground source heat pump alternative had smaller reductions of carbon dioxide than the other two alternatives with district heating. An alternative heating and cooling system can also lead to alternative energy use. The choice is between electrical or heat energy. A weighting can be done to evaluate the energy use for heating on basis of how much energy is needed in order to generate the energy the end user buys. A 2. 5 factor for electrical energy entails the alternative with district heating and low temperate surface water cooling gets the lowest heating and cooling energy in comparison. An inventory of the lighting was also done. The company has already an energy effective lighting but yet another saving of 2 MWh can be done annually without replacement of armatures. Finally, the operation time of the compressor was calculated with a mean value of 11 hours per day. The compressor delivers pressure air to machines and tools. There can be a great demand for pressure air in the workshop but the operation time can also be an indication of leakage in the air net...|$|R
