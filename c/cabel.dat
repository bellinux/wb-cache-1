2500|$|Even {{with this}} {{truncated}} {{version of the}} opera, many compromises and cuts were made, some during rehearsals, and some during the run. The new second act was the Chasse [...] Royale et Orage ("Royal Hunt and Storm") , an elaborate pantomime ballet with nymphs, sylvans, and fauns and a chorus. Since the set change for this scene took nearly an hour, it was cut, despite the fact its staging had been greatly simplified with a painted waterfall, rather than one with real water. Carvalho had originally planned to divert water from the nearby Seine, but during the rehearsals, a faulty switch nearly caused a disaster. The entries of the builders, sailors, and farm-workers , were omitted because Carvalho found them dull; likewise, the scene for Anna and Narbal [...] and the second ballet [...] The sentries duet [...] was omitted, because Carvalho had found its [...] "homely style... {{out of place in}} an epic work". Iopas's stanzas [...] disappeared with Berlioz's approval, the singer De Quercy [...] "charged with the part being incapable of singing them well." [...] The duet between Dido and Aeneas [...] was cut because, as Berlioz himself realized, [...] "Madame Charton's voice was unequal to the vehemence of this scene, which took so much out of her that she would not have had the strength left to deliver the tremendous recitative 'Dieux immortels! il part!' , the final aria , and the scene on the pyre [...]" [...] The [...] "Song of Hylas" [...] , which was [...] "greatly liked at the early performances and was well sung", was cut while Berlioz was at home sick with bronchitis. The singer of the part, Edmond <b>Cabel,</b> was also performing in a revival of Félicien David's La perle du Brésil, and since his contract only required him to sing fifteen times per month, {{he would have to be}} paid an extra two hundred francs for each additional performance. Berlioz lamented: [...] "If I am able to put on an adequate performance of a work of this scale and character I must be in absolute control of the theatre, as I am of the orchestra when I rehearse a symphony." ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that flexible structures like suspension bridges or overhead power transmission lines can {{be subjected to}} oscillations due to windforces or other causes. Simple models for such oscillations are described with second- and fourth-order partial differential equations. Usually asymptotic methods {{can be used to}} construct approximations for the solutions of these wave, beam or plate equations. For a long time initial boundary value problems for weakly nonlinear wave equations have been studied. The analysis becomes more compliceted for beam equations [1], [2]. Even less is known about weakly nonlinear plate equations. However, plates of various geometries, i. e. circular, rectangular etc are extensively used in engineering applications. These plates are widely used in modern aerospace technology, aircraft structures and flexible structures like suspension bridges. The majority of the literature deals with classical boundary conditions representing clamped, simply supported or free edges, and only a small number deals with edges which are restrained against translation or/and rotation, or with other nonclassical boundary conditions [5]-[8]. A simple way to model the behavior of a suspension bridge is to describe it as a vibrating one-dimensional beam with simply supported edges [3]-[4]. However, to study wind-induced oscillations of suspension bridges one can of course use plate equations to describe the displacement of the deck of the bridge [9]. The deck of the bridge is modeled as a rectangular plate, and the <b>cabels</b> are modeled as springs. Such a model can be described by the following initially boundary value proble...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with data wiring infractructure. In the theoretical part the basic technology of the LAN networks is described {{as well as its}} parts, such as HUB and switch. Various types of transfer paths used in data wiring are briefly mentioned. They included coaxial cable, which were then replaced by shielded twisted pair and in future the fibre optics cables will be used instead. The shielded twisted pair operates on structured <b>cabelling,</b> which is guided by central principles in designing, which then can guarantee 15 years of good service. The most used cables 5 e and 6 are described. The next chapter describes the endings of cables and connectors as well as the principles of patch pannels and patch cables. The following parts focus on the fibre optics networks, because they are the networks of the future. The types of fibre optics cables are described together with networks standards, the minimal fibre radius and innovations such as WDM or micropipes. There is also a resume of the ČSN norms, which are important for this thesis, concerning issues of the ways how to lay cables, placing of the communications etc. In the practical part, the various softwares for designing data wiring infractructure are studied and compared.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{motivation for}} {{this study is to}} understand the processes in the ocean interior controlling carbon transfer across 30 &deg; S. To address this, we have developed a unified framework for understanding the interplay between physical drivers such as buoyancy fluxes and ocean mixing, and carbon-specific processes such as biology, gas exchange and carbon mixing. Given the importance of density in determining the ocean interior structure and circulation, the framework is one that is organized by density and water masses, and it makes combined use of Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. This is achieved through application to a global ice-ocean circulation model and an ocean biogeochemistry model, with both components being part of the widely-used IPSL coupled ocean/atmosphere/carbon cycle model. Our main new result is the dominance of the overturning circulation (identified by water masses) in setting the vertical distribution of carbon transport from the Southern Ocean towards the global ocean. A net contrast emerges between the role of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), associated with large northward transport and ingassing, and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), associated with a much smaller export and outgassing. The differences in their export rate reflects differences in their water mass formation processes. For SAMW, two-thirds of the surface waters are provided {{as a result of the}} densification of thermocline water (TW), and upon densification this water carries with it a substantial diapycnal flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). For AAIW, principal formatin processes include buoyancy forcing and mixing, with these serving to lighten CDW. An additional important formation pathway of AAIW is through the effect of interior processing (mixing, including <b>cabelling)</b> that serve to densify SAMW. A quantitative evaluation of the contribution of mixing, biology and gas exchange to the DIC evolution per water mass reveals that mixing and, secondarily, gas exchange, effectively nearly balance biology on annual scales (while the latter process can be dominant at seasonal scale). The distribution of DIC in the northward flowing water at 30 &deg; S is thus primarily set by the DIC values of the water masses that are involved in the formation processes...|$|R
