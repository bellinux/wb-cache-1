50|$|Polar {{winds are}} {{a driving force}} behind weather systems arising from three surface zones that {{converge}} at McMurdo Sound: the polar plateau and Transantarctic Mountains, the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Ross Sea. These surface zones create a range of dynamic weather systems. Cold, heavy air descending rapidly from the polar plateau at elevations of 3000 m or more spawns fierce katabatic winds. These dry winds can reach hurricane force {{by the time they}} reach the Antarctic coast. Wind instruments recorded Antarctica's highest wind velocity at the <b>coastal</b> <b>station</b> Dumont d'Urville in July 1972 at 320 km/h (Australian Government Antarctica Division).|$|E

5000|$|The Service Regulations, {{affixed to}} the 1912 Convention, {{established}} 500 kHz as the primary frequency for seagoing communication, and the standard ship frequency was changed from 1,000 kHz to 500 kHz, to match the <b>coastal</b> <b>station</b> standard. Communication was generally conducted in Morse code, initially using spark-gap transmitters. Most two-way radio contacts were to be initiated on this frequency, although once established the participating stations could shift to another frequency to avoid the congestion on 500 kHz. To facilitate communication between operators speaking different languages, standardized abbreviations were used including a set of [...] "Q codes" [...] specified by the 1912 Service Regulations.|$|E
50|$|On April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic station MGY, busily {{delivering}} telegram {{traffic from}} ship's passengers to the <b>coastal</b> <b>station</b> at Cape Race, Newfoundland (call sign MCE), would receive warnings of ice fields from Marconi stations aboard the M.V. Mesaba (call sign MMU) and the S.S. Californian (call sign MWL).3 Its distress call CQD CQD CQD CQD CQD CQD DE MGY MGY MGY MGY MGY MGY position 41.44N 50.24W would {{be answered by}} a station aboard the Carpathia (call sign MPA).4 Later that same year, an international conference standardised radio call signs so that the first two letters would uniquely identify a transmitter's country of origin.|$|E
5000|$|International {{standards}} {{for the use of}} 500 kHz first appeared in the second Berlin International Radiotelegraphic Convention, which was signed November 3, 1906, and became effective July 1, 1908. The second Service Regulation affixed to this Convention designated 500 kHz as one of the standard frequencies to be employed by shore stations, specifying that [...] "Two wave lengths, one of 300 meters Mc/s and the other of 600 meters, are authorized for general public service. Every <b>coastal</b> <b>station</b> opened to such service shall use {{one or the other of}} these two wave lengths." [...] (These regulations also specified that ship stations normally used 1 MHz).|$|E
40|$|The diurnal {{cycle of}} {{precipitation}} in Estonia during the warm period (from April to October) is analysed separately at continental and <b>coastal</b> <b>stations.</b> The results were obtained using hourly {{data from the}} automated gauges at 13 stations in 2003 – 2013 {{as well as from}} the pluviographic records at 10 stations in 1991 – 2003. The diurnal cycle is approximated using the second-order trigonometric polynomial. A clear diurnal cycle of precipitation with the maximum in the afternoon and evening (13 – 19  EET – East European Time), and the minimum at night and in the morning (22 – 11  EET) was revealed at the continental stations of Estonia. The daily amplitude was the highest in summer and much lower in spring and autumn. The highest monthly mean daily amplitudes up to 7  mm were observed in June and July. The diurnal cycle of precipitation was much weaker at the <b>coastal</b> <b>stations</b> without clear maxima and minima and with lower amplitudes. In autumn, the <b>coastal</b> <b>stations</b> showed clearer and bimodal maxima in the early morning and in the evening. The diurnal distribution of precipitation is quite stable, which is confirmed by the high similarity of the curves characterizing these two periods...|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Antarctic Program's <b>coastal</b> <b>station</b> {{along the}} Antarctic Peninsula, Palmer Station, {{went on a}} tsunami alert shortly after the {{earthquake}} struck Chile. To prepare for a possible tsunami, station personnel removed all Zodiac boats from the water and moved any materials from low-lying areas that waves could have swept away. Personnel also retreated to the station's highest building, GWR, while the tsunami warning was in effect, Ellis said. Palmer personnel developed a tsunami emergency plan following the 2004 earthquake in the Indian Ocean that created a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in 14 countries. While no noticeable tsunami occurred at Palmer, the station tide monitor displayed bumps of several centimeters, signifying that a small wave had indeed reached the shores of Anvers Island.|$|E

Station Kahe (termed Station 1) is used to test equipment and train new personnel before departing for Station ALOHA. Since August 2004, Station ALOHA has also been home to a surface mooring outfitted for meteorological and upper ocean measurements; this mooring, named WHOTS (also termed Station 50), is a collaborative project between Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and HOT. WHOTS provides long-term, high-quality air-sea fluxes as a coordinated part of HOT, contributing to the program’s goals of observing heat, fresh water and chemical fluxes. In 2011, the ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO) became operational. This instrumented fiber optic cabled observatory provides power and communications to the seabed (4728 m).
