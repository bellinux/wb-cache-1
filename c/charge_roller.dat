50|$|An AC {{bias voltage}} {{is applied to}} the primary <b>charge</b> <b>roller</b> to remove any {{residual}} charges left by previous images. The roller will also apply a DC bias on the drum surface to ensure a uniform negative potential.|$|E
50|$|Charging: {{cylindrical}} drum is electrostatically charged {{by a high}} voltage wire called a corona wire or a <b>charge</b> <b>roller.</b> The drum has a coating of a photoconductive material. A photoconductor is a semiconductor that becomes conductive when exposed to light.|$|E
50|$|As {{the drum}} completes a revolution, it {{is exposed to}} an {{electrically}} neutral soft plastic blade which cleans any remaining toner from the photoreceptor drum and deposits it into a waste reservoir. A <b>charge</b> <b>roller</b> then re-establishes a uniform negative charge {{on the surface of}} the now clean drum, readying it to be struck again by the laser.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective in}} digital printing is to deliver printed output that satisfies customer requirements and expectations. To achieve this objective, {{we must be}} able to control the many factors that affect print quality. This in turn requires that we be able to understand and quantify these factors. If we can do this, we can make print quality predictable. In this paper, we will describe a family of advanced computer-controlled test instruments for electrophotography that analyze these critical factors. The systems discussed evaluate photoconductors, <b>charge</b> <b>rollers,</b> development rollers, transfer rollers, fuser rollers, and toner fusing. In addition, we discuss an automated print quality analysis system that quantifies output of any printing technology. These instruments use state-of-the-art control software and integrate many functions and innovative features to test for reliability, life assessment, and reusability. We will discuss their principles of operation, design requirements, implementation, and applications. These systems are used in R&D, production quality control, and component recycling applications...|$|R
40|$|Technologies {{based on}} atmospheric-pressure microplasmas (APMs) {{have been widely}} {{developed}} due to the unique nature microplasmas being non-equilibrium {{and its ability to}} operate stably at atmospheric pressure. Electrophotographic printing, sensors, surface functionalization and plasma medicine are typical applications of APMs. However, obtaining accurate measurements and characterizing the plasma parameters are challenging due to the complicated plasma dynamics and the small spatial and temporal scales. In this thesis, results from a computational investigation of APMs are discussed with the goal of improving our fundamental understanding of the nonlinear plasma kinetics of APMs, and to provide design rules for the devices of interest. In this thesis, results will be discussed from a numerical investigation of APMs sustained in dry air in the mDBD arrays, corona discharge and conductive <b>charge</b> <b>rollers</b> (CR) used in electrophotographic (EP) printing technologies, and the charging of both stationary and moving dielectric PC surfaces. The periodic charging patterns predicted by the simulations are consistent with experiment observations. Results will then be presented from numerical investigations of a microdischarge-based pressure sensor sustained in atmospheric-pressure argon. Compared to sensors using piezoresistive and capacitive methods, a microdischarge-based pressure sensor is potentially capable of being an order of magnitude smaller, and more conducive to hostile environments at high temperature...|$|R
50|$|Paper {{is passed}} between the drum and the {{transfer}} corona, {{which has a}} polarity that {{is the opposite of}} the charge on the toner. The toner image is transferred from the drum to the paper by a combination of pressure and electrostatic attraction. On many color and high-speed machines, it is common to replace the transfer corona with one or more <b>charged</b> bias transfer <b>rollers,</b> which apply greater pressure and produce a higher quality image.|$|R
50|$|In older printers, a corona wire {{positioned}} {{parallel to}} the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary <b>charge</b> <b>roller,</b> projects an electrostatic charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photo conductor unit), a revolving photosensitive drum or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while {{it is in the}} dark.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface with}} the latent image {{is exposed to}} toner which has been applied in a 15-micron-thick layer to the {{developer}} roll. Toner consists of fine particles of dry plastic powder mixed with carbon black or coloring agents. The toner particles are given a negative charge inside the toner cartridge, and as they emerge onto the developer drum they are electrostatically attracted to the photoreceptor's latent image (the areas {{on the surface of}} the drum which had been struck by the laser). Because negative charges repel each other, the negatively charged toner particles will not adhere to the drum where the negative charge (imparted previously by the <b>charge</b> <b>roller)</b> remains.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside a}} laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair. The drum {{in particular is}} a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light {{for more than a}} few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out. Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks. If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the drum's surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution. If the <b>charge</b> <b>roller</b> becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{accordance}} with environmental sustainability {{and in order}} to optimize the recycling process of prints from indirect electrophotography with liquid toner the results of investigating the effects of changes in printing conditions on the characteristics of recycled fibres is presented. Changing of printing machine conditions, respecting of voltage variations, comprises of the reverse rollers and intermediate cylinder. Based on the results it can be concluded that the change in the voltage of the reverse rollers more affect the recycling efficiency with respect to the voltage change of the intermediate cylinder. Brightness gain is higher when the print for recycling is made on uncoated paper compared to coated, and dependent on the voltage changes. Effective residual ink concentration decreases far more on handsheets obtained from recycled samples on uncoated paper in relation to both sides coated paper. Increasing the positive voltage of intermediate cylinder and increasing the negative <b>charge</b> of reverse <b>rollers</b> increases the 3 D gamut CIE L*a*b* color cubic units. Guidelines for the size of the voltage in order to obtain optimal print reproduction are provided. The further research will include the development in area of clean technologies, advanced materials, closed loop systems; therefore the significant terms in the area of environmental sustainability...|$|R
40|$|White {{structure}} flaking (WSF) as {{a premature}} wear failure mode in steel rolling element bearings {{is caused by}} white etching cracks (WECs) and perhaps butterflies formed in the ~ 1 mm zone beneath the contact surface under rolling contact fatigue (RCF). WECs are branching crack systems typically several millimetres in length that have a microstructural change called ‘white etching area’ (WEA) associated with the crack. Butterflies are smaller cracks initiating at material defects and impurities that form WEA wings that revolve around their initiators. Hydrogen diffusion into the bearing steel during service and transient operating conditions have been suggested as drivers of white etching features (butterflies, WEA and WECs). However the initiation and propagation mechanisms {{as well as the}} thresholds for WEC formation are not well understood. This is due to the difficulties of creating WECs repeatedly under laboratory conditions and the lack of a method established for mapping WECs in detail or 3 dimensions as typically only limited metallographic analyses are conducted over several cross-sections. A series of RCF tests have been conducted in this study to investigate the formation drivers and formation mechanisms of WECs using a two-roller RCF machine. WECs were successfully created in hydrogen charged 100 Cr 6 martensitic steel rollers under low-moderate concentrations of diffusible hydrogen (~ 1 ppm) and service realistic loading conditions (Pmax 1. 5 – 2 GPa). However, only butterflies were formed under transient conditions with non-hydrogen <b>charged</b> <b>rollers.</b> One such butterfly was analysed in detail to further understanding of crack formation mechanisms and carbide dissolution as part of the WEA microstructural change. Based on the evidence obtained from the SEM, FIB tomography and STEM/TEM analysis, a void/cavity coalescence theory for initial butterfly crack formation and iron chromium carbide dissolution as part of the WEA formation mechanism is proposed. Metallography was extensively used in this project to view cross-sections of the wear zones subject to RCF. A metallographic serial sectioning technique was established to quantitatively map wear zones for the first time. Mapping WECs in their entirety and 3 D modelling revealed the 3 -dimensional morphology and orientation of WECs and maximised detection of possible WEC initiators. This study has for the first time quantitatively investigated the influence of diffusible hydrogen, load and rolling cycles on white etching feature formation and the thresholds of formation. The hydrogen charged tests showed that the formation of butterflies was independent of the concentration of diffusible hydrogen with the test parameters used, but dependent on contact pressure and number of rolling cycles up to a threshold. WEC formation thresholds were found at certain values of the concentration of diffusible hydrogen, contact pressure and number of rolling cycles. Extensive serial sectioning and 3 D modelling of WECs also demonstrated that the orientation of WECs differed depending on the sectioning direction. It was found {{that the vast majority of}} WECs were contained in the subsurface wear zone and did not make any connection with the surface, thus dismissing surface initiation. The WECs often interacted with inclusions that were judged to be crack initiators and evidence was found that butterfly cracks could propagate to form WECs. The white etching features initiated predominately at short sulfide type inclusions, small globular manganese sulfide oxide inclusions and small globular oxide inclusions. Therefore strong evidence was observed for a subsurface initiation mechanism of WECs from non-metallic inclusions. A comparison of the WEC formations in the hydrogen charged two-roller tests was made with serial sectioning investigations of WEC formation in wind turbine gearbox bearings obtained from the field and those tested on a large-scale transient test rig (non-hydrogen charged). This was performed to understand if a difference in the WEC initiation and propagation mechanism occurs under the differing conditions. The comparison showed correlation between the WEC formation mechanisms as a high number of inclusions interacted with the WECs that were judged to be crack initiators and small/short sized inclusions predominated as the crack initiators. Therefore based on the serial sectioning analysis across various test specimens and bearings it is proposed that one mechanism of WEC formation is due to multiple linking of extended butterflies or small WECs in the subsurface to form larger WEC networks that eventually propagate to the surface resulting in WSF. The data also suggests that steel cleanliness standards analysing inclusion density (as opposed to maximum inclusion lengths) are more relevant in understanding butterfly/WEC initiation. However steel cleanliness standards used should record inclusions that are only a couple of micrometer’s in length/diameter...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{electrostatic charge}} decay (ECD) technique previously introduced {{has been shown}} to be a good predictor of <b>charge</b> <b>roller</b> performance. The physical reason behind the correlation between ECD and charging performance is that both processes depend on dielectric relaxation to rearrange the charge distribution in the resistive layer. In this paper, we present experimental and theoretical studies of dielectric relaxation in resistive materials used for charge rollers. It is shown that the process can be non-ohmic, and that information on charge injection and transport parameters in addition to resistivity is required for specifying an effective <b>charge</b> <b>roller...</b>|$|E
40|$|Contact charge rollers {{are used}} {{extensively}} in electrophotographic printers and copiers to minimize ozone emission {{and to improve}} charging efficiency. It {{is well known that}} the surface electrical properties of a <b>charge</b> <b>roller</b> critically determine the effectiveness of the charging processes. For example, a low surface resistance may lead to destructive arcing to the photoreceptor, and a high surface resistance may result in under-charging or non-uniform charging of the photoreceptor. In this paper, a novel electrostatic charge decay (ECD) technique, which provides non-contact and nondestructive measurements on surface electrical properties, is examined to assess its ability to predict the performance of a <b>charge</b> <b>roller.</b> The principle behind the ECD technique and the supporting evidence for its efficacy will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|A new {{computer-controlled}} {{test system}} for mapping photoreceptor properties such as charge acceptance and discharge voltage will be described. The system allows rapid scanning of a photoreceptor to: 1) characterize its functional quality and uniformity, and 2) detect both charging and discharge defects of 50 - 100 µm in diameter or larger. The system can also perform conventional electrophotographic measurements to obtain dark decay, photo-induced discharge curves (PIDC), and fatigue properties. In addition to testing the complete photoreceptor product, a unique {{feature of the}} system is its ability to perform measurements on the sub-layers in a photoreceptor. These measurements include examining the substrate for cleanliness, and measuring the thickness and uniformity of the polymer barrier layer and the charge generation layer (CGL) in a layered organic photoconductor (OPC). The design of the system will be described, and its performance will be demonstrated with application examples. Test equipment for the <b>charge</b> <b>roller</b> and the magnetic roller in toner cartridges using similar electrostatic charge decay measurement techniques will also be discussed...|$|E
