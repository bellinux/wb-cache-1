5|$|One theory interprets Putana {{as being}} the first foe faced by Krishna (further {{numerous}} demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct faced by yogis. The legend assures a devotee liberation if they treat god as their own son. Another theory interprets Putana as an infantile disease that Krishna survived, which can be <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> forcefully suckling the child affected. Further, the theory relates to Krishna's later life when he fights a demon called Jvara (fever).|$|E

5|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was lost}} in a crash at NAS China Lake on 13 October 1944. Investigation showed that the wing structure was {{not strong enough to}} resist compressibility effects. This was <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> doubling the number of rivets in the outer wing panels. The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects.

5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E

5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E

5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child <b>cured</b> <b>by</b> Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E

In North America, hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and fruit-tree woods are commonly used for smoking.
