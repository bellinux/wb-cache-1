On 17 November 2010, the court found Syvret guilty of the data protection offences and guilty of contempt of court on account of his non-attendance and words of disrespect. The prosecuting Attorney General made two charges against Syvret for the aforementioned blogging of the Faudemer Report. The charges came under the Data Protection (Jersey) Law, Articles 55, 17, and 21. The opinion on these two charges by Assistant Magistrate Mrs B. Shaw of the Magistrate's Court was published online. Syvret refused the option of community service and was jailed for ten weeks, fined £4,200 and ordered to pay £10,000 in legal costs. He was granted bail by the Royal Court the following day, pending an appeal. On 17 June 2011, Syvret made a further <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> to the Royal Court relating to the prosecution. The application was refused by Commissioner Pitchers and an appeal to the Jersey Court of Appeal (consisting of Michael Beloff QC, Clare Montgomery QC and Christopher Nugee QC) was dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Standing, or locus standi (Latin for [...] "a {{place to}} stand"), is a {{threshold}} requirement that an applicant must satisfy before a court will permit {{him or her}} to proceed with a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> Depending on the facts of the case, the applicant has to establish one of the two categories of standing. The applicant seeks to establish private standing when he or she purports to represent his or her own interests.

Standing is a mixed question of fact and law, which the court determines based on legal principles.|$|E

2500|$|However, only {{a limited}} number of people can bring claims for {{judicial}} review. Under TFEU article 263(2), a member state, the Parliament, Council or Commission have automatic rights to seek judicial review. But under article 263(4) a [...] "natural or legal person" [...] must have a [...] "direct and individual concern" [...] about the regulatory act. [...] "Direct" [...] concern means that someone is affected by an EU act without [...] "the interposition of an autonomous will between the decision and its effect", for instance by a national government body. In Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission, a group of Greek textile businesses, who exported cotton products to France, challenged a Commission decision allow France to limit exports. The Commission argued that the exporters were not directly concerned, because France might decide not to limit exports, but the Court of Justice held this possibility was [...] "entirely theoretical". A challenge could be brought. By contrast in Municipality of Differdange v Commission a municipality wanted to challenge the Commissions decision to aid steel firms which reduced production: this would probably reduce its tax collections. But the Court of Justice held that because Luxembourg had discretion, and its decision to reduce capacity was not inevitable, the municipality had no [...] "direct" [...] concern (its complaint was with the Luxembourg government instead). [...] "Individual" [...] concern requires that someone is affected specifically, not as a member of a group. In Plaumann & Co v Commission the Court of Justice held that a clementine importer was not individually concerned when the Commission refused permission to Germany to stop import custom duties. This kept it more expensive for Mr Plaumann to import clementines, but it was equally expensive for everyone else. This decision heavily restricted the number of people who could <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> In Unión de Pequeños Agricultores, Advocate General Jacobs propose a broader test of allowing anyone to claim if there was a [...] "substantial adverse effect" [...] on the claimant's interests. Here, a group of Spanish olive oil producers challenged Council Regulation No 1638/98, which withdrew subsidies. Because Regulations are not implemented in national law, but have direct effect, they argued the requirement for individual concern would deny them effective judicial protection. The Court of Justice held that direct actions were still not allowed: if this was unsatisfactory the member states would have to change the treaties. Individual concern is not needed, however under article 263(4), if an act is not legislation, but just a [...] "regulatory act". In Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami v Parliament and Council the Court of Justice affirmed that a Regulation does not count as a [...] "regulatory act" [...] within the Treaty's meaning: it is only meant for acts of lesser importance. Here, a Canadian group representing the Inuit people wished to challenge a Regulation on seal products, but were not allowed. They would have to show both direct and individual concern as normal. Thus, without a treaty change, EU administrative law remains one of the most restrictive in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Administrative law is {{the area}} of law {{concerning}} the control of powers exercised by the government. It functions to regulate decision-making processes by public authorities with regard to maintaining basic standards of fairness and legality. Administrative law in Singapore originates from and shares many similarities with administrative law in the United Kingdom. In general, <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in administrative law fall under three broad categories– illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Instances of illegality fall under two main headings: whether the authority was empowered {{to make the decision}} in question, and whether it properly exercised its discretion to make that decision. Grounds for illegality under the first heading include simple ultra vires, and errors as to precedent facts. The second heading includes grounds of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> such as making decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence or errors of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones, making decisions for improper purposes, fettering of discretion, and failing to fulfil legitimate expectations.|$|R

40|$|The case of Bali bombing on October 12, 2002 {{forces the}} {{government}} of Indonesian Republic to apply the bill number 16, 2003 to all the suspects (masykur Abdul Kadir). In this case, the suspect <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> to the great constitution on the application of that bill since the suspects regard that the application of that bill is clearly adapt the retroactive principle (it is decreasing). This study focuses on the research problem: 1. Is the great constitution decision on the case number 13 /PUU- 1 / 2003 appropriate? 2. How is {{the implementation of a}} quo decision on the development of crime law in Indonesia? This study uses juridical-normative method in which the data collection method {{is in the form of}} the tracing process of law constitution through the related books on the problem discussed. The material and the book sources are gotten from the electronic and the printed media as well. The decision taken by the great constitution on the case number 13 /PUU- 1 / 2003 is taken as the primary data. And the data will be analyzed descriptively. In the decision, the great constitution bases its decision on the law of crime law and the bill of Indonesian of 1945 of bill number 281 verse (1). Due to today, there are still many the pros and cons on the case of Bali bombing which is considered the extra ordinary crime. In conclusion, the great constitution has launched the decision which is based on the law of crime law on the case number 13 /PUU- 1 / 2003 by canceling the implementation of bill number 16 on the 2003 year since this is clearly adapt the retroactive principle since t will position the law supremacy in danger. It s suggested that it is not necessary to be decreased since the case has already break the law number 340 of crime law and this is implemented 200 times due to the 200 death in that incident in which it can not be classified into extraordinary crime. Key words: decision, implementation, retroactive principle. ...|$|R
