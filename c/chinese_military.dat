5|$|The Southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty were a series of <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> campaigns and expeditions {{in what is now}} modern Southern China and Northern Vietnam. Military expansion to the south began under the previous Qin dynasty and continued during the Han era. Campaigns were dispatched against the Yue tribes, leading to the annexation of Minyue by the Han in 135 BCE and 111 BCE, Nanyue in 111 BCE, and Dian in 109 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he had no control over due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the morale and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned the tide {{of the war in}} favor of the Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military's</b> performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness that China should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military's</b> abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|R

5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during the Easter Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment. Weapons improvement {{was due to}} a new influx of Soviet and <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> aid. During 1973, North Vietnam received 2.8million metric tons of goods (worth $330million) from communist-bloc countries, a 50 {{percent increase over the}} previous year. In 1974 that total increased to 3.5million metric tons ($400million) (according to CIA), while the South's aid was slashed to only $965 million per year, down from $2.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital {{foothold in the}} steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E

The <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> strategist, politician, and inventor Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms era is credited with its invention, and reportedly used it during military campaigns. According to the British scientist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham, hot air balloons {{have been used in}} China since the 3rd century BC. In 1783, Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier took part in the first manned hot air balloon flight.|$|E
5|$|In 1640, {{masses of}} Chinese peasants who were starving, {{unable to pay}} their taxes, and no longer in fear of the {{frequently}} defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>military,</b> caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders {{from the north and}} huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid and unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng – now self-styled as the Prince of Shun – and deserted the capital without much of a fight. On 26 May 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were opened by rebel allies from within. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> aid meant {{for them to}} be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, {{and at the same time}} skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> campaigns {{were less}} {{successful}} than elsewhere. Like the emperors of the Sui dynasty before him, Taizong established a military campaign in 644 against {{the kingdom of}} Goguryeo in the Goguryeo-Tang War; however, this led to its withdrawal in the first campaign because they failed to overcome the successful defense led by General Yeon Gaesomun. Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom, the Chinese fought against Baekje and their Yamato Japanese allies in the Battle of Baekgang in August 663, a decisive Tang–Silla victory. The Tang dynasty navy had several different ship types at its disposal to engage in naval warfare, these ships described by Li Quan in his Taipai Yinjing (Canon of the White and Gloomy Planet of War) of 759. The Battle of Baekgang was actually a restoration movement by remnant forces of Baekje, since their kingdom was toppled in 660 by a joint Tang–Silla invasion, led by Chinese general Su Dingfang and Korean general Kim Yushin (595–673). In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander Li Shiji (594–669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.|$|E
5|$|Li Shimin's {{plan was}} successful: apart from skirmishes {{between the two}} armies' cavalry, the two armies {{maintained}} their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began {{to show signs of}} thirst and weariness. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack. When he saw that the demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley, but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines, breaking their battle order. Awaiting this opportunity, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin always led from the front—accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black-clad, black-armoured horsemen—as indeed did most of the contemporary <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> leaders, who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example, rather than stay in the rear and co-ordinate their army.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that the}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> was weaker than the {{superior}} Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E
5|$|Sino-Roman {{relations}} {{comprised the}} mostly indirect contact, flow of trade goods, information, and occasional travellers between the Roman Empire and Han Empire of China, {{as well as}} between the later Eastern Roman Empire and various Chinese dynasties. These empires inched progressively closer {{in the course of the}} Roman expansion into the ancient Near East and simultaneous Han <b>Chinese</b> <b>military</b> incursions into Central Asia. Mutual awareness remained low, and firm knowledge about each other was limited. Only a few attempts at direct contact are known from records. Intermediate empires such as the Parthians and Kushans, seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two Eurasian powers. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his envoy Gan Ying to Rome, but Gan was dissuaded by Parthians from venturing beyond the Persian Gulf. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius or his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded Byzantine embassy in 643 AD.|$|E
