5000|$|The F760X 'Compex' limiter {{was made}} up of three main parts; a compressor, limiter and a 'noise reducing' expander/gate. All of these parts could be used {{separately}} or together for well controlled sound limiting. This combination came about from client feedback. From the feedback ADR designed and built the first units, these were labelled as F760X-RS (RS meaning rack-mount stereo). Later modifications were made and another version was released with a better, ergonomically designed, front panel. This later model was labelled as the 'Compex'.The 'Compex' limiter provided peak limiting with a multi-ratio, variable threshold <b>compressor.</b> <b>Ratio</b> settings ranged from 1:1 to 20:1 and there were controls for threshold and release time. The inclusion of an expander/gate provided attenuation of the gain during pauses in the audio signal to reduce noise caused by compression; the expander/gate could also be used for special 'punchy' effects, favoured on drum and percussive sounds. Noise gates were often criticised at the time for 'hunting' around the threshold point. The 'Compex' used clever hysteresis around the gate, this was important to stop unpredictable opening and closing of the gate; the open threshold was higher than the close threshold.The gain reduction controlled by the 'Compex' was monitored from two meters located {{to the right of the}} front panel. There were two light indicators; a red light lit when the signal level reached its peak, and when in expand mode a green light was lit. There were a set of lights for each channel, depending if the unit was the stereo or mono version.There were some different models of the 'Compex' available; one of these included a smaller console module named the F760-N. This version was built without the expander/gate, it later had an expander/gate added and was then known as the F760X-N. There is also a rare version called F760X-RS/T. One of the visible differences are the VU-meters, which got the brand [...] "Audio & Design Recording LTD." [...] and if you look on the rear, there you can see the type.The [...] "T" [...] stands for transformer, which are said to add harmonics to the sound.The [...] "T" [...] version was mainly used in broadcasting stations, mainly because of its SNR and headroom. ADR also built an F760 version for the Helios mixing consoles.|$|E

However, this approach needs higher pressure values than those available with commercial micro gas turbines (mGT) : a possible but expensive solution {{could be to}} design a completely new mGT. Another option could be to use a booster with the function of re-compressor installed between the mGT compressor and the ejector (in order to increase ejector inlet pressure).

Using a web-based module described in this study, students are able to assemble on a computer screen a multistage compressor or turbine from a number of elemental building blocks or stages. The module is interactive and requires students to input data such as overall <b>compressor</b> <b>ratio,</b> stage efficiency, stage pressure ratio, and compressor inlet temperature and pressure. A computer program embedded in the module calculates total number of stages, and temperature and pressure at exit section of each stage. It also displays visual images of all stages to be assembled, and prompts students to use the clicking and dragging action of computer mouse to assemble elemental compressor stages into a multistage axial compressor. During the assembly process, a temperature-entropy diagram is generated, displaying thermodynamic state of air as it traverses through the compressor. These visual images allow students to explore relationships between overall compressor efficiency, stage efficiency and compressor pressure ratio. The module is assessed by comparing the performance of a “control ” group (no exposure to module) with an “experimental ” group (using the module) for an identical quiz administrated to both groups.

The obtained screw rotor is an envelope to the family of the gate rotor ’ s surfaces. The obtained envelope becomes the generating surface. The inverse envelope can be used to obtain the envelope to the family of generating surfaces. Then the prole of a gate rotor cutting-edge curve can be easily obtained.

A cogeneration system (Combined Heat and Power - CHP) is an alternative technique that produces heat and power consuming less of primary energy sources, especially fossil fuels. Recently trigeneration systems, also named Combined Heat, Cooling and Power (CHCP), have gained great interest for industrial and commercial applications, due to a better energetic efficiency when compared with CHP systems. CHCP is an economical and available technology, demanding a single source of primary energy, with the advantages of saving energy, money, and making a clever user {{of fossil fuels}} with benefits to the environment. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the thermodynamic performance of a trigeneration system, using a process simulation software, considering the influence of some operational variables: compression ratio in the compressor, expansion ratio and efficiency of the power cycle turbine; boiler operation pressure; and operational pressure of the absorption cycle in both sides (high and low pressure). Natural gas is used as primary energy source. In the absorption refrigeration cycle the pair solvent-refrigerant used is H 2 O-NH 3.

The paper collects {{the experience of the}} authors in developing a unique product through its conceptual design, as well as its mechanical and rotordynamic assessment, up to its complete validation with a full speed full load test in a complete unit arrangement. The main target of high pressure ratio compressors is to fulfil the required compression service with one casing less than traditional technology. The new compressor technology results in machines which run much higher in speed. To achieve a <b>compressor</b> <b>ratio</b> of ~ 30 in a single casing, the rotational speed is increase by roughly 40 % respect to a traditional compression train, and therefore it becomes the most critical parameter.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{simulating}} the cooled gas turbine is demonstrated. Based on equations and other knowledge {{found in the}} literature, a first-law thermodynamic, non-dimensional model is established and implemented in the equation-solving, programmable software IPSEpro. Increasing the water vapor or carbon dioxide contents of the gas turbine hot gas is found not {{to have an impact}} on the Stanton number, which is employed for the modeling of the heat transfer to the blade. The model is validated using experimental data from an industrial gas turbine and data found in the literature, and is found to give results easily in concordance with the case with which it is matched. Based on the validation, a reference gas turbine is established and employed for various cycle calculations. First, it is shown how gas turbine efficiency can increase with decreased coolant temperature and with a decrease in the ratio of specific heats between hot gas and coolant. Simple-cycle simulations are done to illustrate the impact of coolant pre-cooling, cooling with humid air and cooling with steam. Due to its high specific heat, steam is shown to have the best capacity for cycle performance enhancement. For the single-pressure combined cycle, it is shown how steam for cooling of the first gas turbine vane can be flashed from the water leaving the economiser in a split stream boiler. This is found to give a considerable increase in cycle thermal efficiency (more than three percentage points), but the concept needs to be further evaluated in order to establish whether it is technically feasible. For the studies of the HAT cycle, the role of the compressor modeling is emphasized. For a compressor with a given geometry, extracting a reduced amount of air for cooling will give an increase in the pressure ratio, which will have a positive impact on the HAT cycle thermal efficiency, but it will also, in practice, lead to the surge margin being approached. For cooling with humid air, there will be no significant increase in the HAT cycle thermal efficiency if the <b>compressor</b> <b>ratio</b> is maintained constant. Designing gas turbine cycles with a high thermal efficiency is not a goal in itself; also good economic performance is important. The impact of cooled blades for the profitability of the gas-turbine based power plant is illustrated briefly, with focus on heat resistance versus materials cost and on compressor washing intervals...|$|E
