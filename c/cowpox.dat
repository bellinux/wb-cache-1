5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, <b>cowpox,</b> and monkeypox. Variola virus infects only humans in nature, although primates {{and other animals}} have been infected in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, <b>cowpox,</b> and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The <b>cowpox</b> viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live <b>cowpox</b> afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of <b>cowpox</b> that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{induced by}} vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, <b>cowpox,</b> and variola (smallpox) viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine {{has been effective}} in preventing smallpox infection in 95 percent of those vaccinated. Smallpox vaccination provides {{a high level of}} immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3 percent; it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, over 400 {{cases of}} <b>cowpox</b> {{infection}} from cats to human have been described. The symptoms differ between both humans and cats. In people, local exanthema {{appears on the}} arms and face. The infection resolves on its own but those who are immunosuppressed can progress to systemic infection that closely resembles smallpox. When the infection has expanded to severe symptoms, it can be lethal. The signs of <b>cowpox</b> infection in cats can be seen as, multiple skin sores on the paws, neck, head and mouth. The cat can also develop a purulent discharge from the eyes. Necrotizing pneumonia has also been observed. Estimates that 50% of human cases of <b>cowpox</b> are due to transmission from cats in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his {{hypothesis}} by inoculating James Phipps, {{an eight-year-old}} {{boy who was}} the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from <b>cowpox</b> blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught <b>cowpox</b> from a cow called Blossom, whose hide now hangs {{on the wall of the}} St George's medical school library (now in Tooting). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Edward Jenner {{was born}} in Berkeley, England. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to apothecary Daniel Ludlow and later surgeon George Hardwick in nearby Sodbury. He {{observed}} that people who caught <b>cowpox</b> while working with cattle were known not to catch smallpox. Jenner assumed a causal connection but the idea was not taken up at that time. From 1770 to 1772 Jenner received advanced training in London at St Georges Hospital and as the private pupil of John Hunter, then returned to set up practice in Berkeley. When a smallpox epidemic occurred he advised the local cattle workers to be inoculated, but they told him that their previous <b>cowpox</b> infection would prevent smallpox. This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied <b>cowpox</b> further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a <b>cowpox</b> vaccine in humans against smallpox. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with <b>cowpox</b> in {{his wife and two}} children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774, but it was not until Jenner's work that the procedure became widely understood. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success.|$|E
25|$|The terms vaccine and {{vaccination}} {{are derived}} from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote <b>cowpox.</b> He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of <b>cowpox</b> against smallpox. In 1881, to honor Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{empirical}} days of vaccination, before Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Lister's on antisepsis and asepsis, {{there was considerable}} cross-infection. William Woodville, {{one of the early}} vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the <b>cowpox</b> matter—the vaccine—with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from <b>cowpox,</b> but from other skin eruptions of cattle. In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or iatrogenic illness.|$|E
25|$|By 1768, English {{physician}} John Fewster had realised {{that prior}} infection with <b>cowpox</b> rendered a person immune to smallpox. A similar observation {{had also been}} made in France by Jacques Antoine Rabaut-Pommier.|$|E
25|$|In later years, Edward Jenner, who was 13 {{years old}} when Lady Mary died, {{developed}} the much safer technique of vaccination using <b>cowpox</b> instead of smallpox. As vaccination gained acceptance, variolation gradually fell out of favour.|$|E
25|$|Noting {{the common}} {{observation}} that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox, Jenner postulated that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from <b>cowpox</b> (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox.|$|E
25|$|Jenner {{and others}} formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it {{met in the}} parlour of the Fleece Inn, Rodborough (in Gloucestershire), meeting to dine {{together}} and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on angina pectoris, ophthalmia, and cardiac valvular disease and commented on <b>cowpox.</b> He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.|$|E
25|$|The primary way {{to boost}} levels of {{immunity}} {{in a population}} is through vaccination. Their use is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to <b>cowpox</b> were immune to smallpox, so the practice of inoculating people with the <b>cowpox</b> virus began {{as a way to}} prevent smallpox cases. Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases they protect against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections. The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines, forming an active response to both, so immunity induced via vaccination is similar to what would have occurred from contracting and recovering from the disease. To achieve herd immunity through vaccination, vaccine manufacturers aim to produce vaccines with low failure rates and policy makers aim to encourage their use. After the successful introduction and widespread use of a vaccine, sharp declines in the incidence of diseases it protects against can be observed, necessarily decreasing the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by such diseases.|$|E
25|$|In 1796, Edward Jenner, {{a doctor}} and {{scientist}} who had practiced variolation, performed an experiment based on the folk-knowledge that infection with <b>cowpox,</b> a disease with minor symptoms which was never fatal, also conferred immunity to smallpox. The idea was not new; it had been demonstrated some years earlier by Benjamin Jesty, who had not publicized his discovery. In 1798, Jenner extended his observations by showing that <b>cowpox</b> could be passed from a lesion on one patient to others through four arm to arm transfers and that the last in the series was immune by exposing him to smallpox. Jenner described the procedure, distributed his vaccine freely, and provided information to help those hoping to establish their own vaccines. In 1798 he published his information in his famous Inquiry into the Causes and Effects...of the Cow Pox. He is credited with being the first to start detailed investigations of the subject and of bringing it {{to the attention of}} the medical profession. Despite some opposition vaccination took over from variolation.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} 1847, {{accounts}} of Semmelweis's work began to spread around Europe. Semmelweis and his students wrote letters to the directors of several prominent maternity clinics describing their recent observations. Ferdinand von Hebra, {{the editor of a}} leading Austrian medical journal, announced Semmelweis's discovery in the December 1847 and April 1848 issues of the medical journal. Hebra claimed that Semmelweis's work had a practical significance comparable to that of Edward Jenner's introduction of <b>cowpox</b> inoculations to prevent smallpox.|$|E
25|$|During {{the earlier}} days of {{empirical}} experimentation in 1758, American Calvinist Jonathan Edwards {{died from a}} smallpox inoculation. Some of the earliest statistical and epidemiological studies were performed by James Jurin in 1727 and Daniel Bernoulli in 1766. In 1768 Dr John Fewster reported that variolation induced no reaction in persons who had had <b>cowpox.</b> Fewster was a contemporary and friend of Jenner. Dr. Rolph, another Gloucestershire physician, stated that all experienced physicians of the time were aware of this.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} a weak form of a disease causing {{immunity}} to the virulent version was not new; this had been {{known for a long}} time for smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in a much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally acquired disease. Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using <b>cowpox</b> (Vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Jenner {{continued}} his research and reported {{it to the}} Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolationthe use of smallpox to induce immunityand provided vaccination using <b>cowpox</b> free of charge. (See Vaccination acts).|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the DNA may be {{encapsulated}} {{in protein}} to facilitate cell entry. If this capsid protein {{is included in}} the DNA, the resulting vaccine can combine the potency of a live vaccine without reversion risks. In 1983, Enzo Paoletti and Dennis Panicali at the New York Department of Health devised a strategy to produce recombinant DNA vaccines by using genetic engineering to transform ordinary smallpox vaccine into vaccines that may be able to prevent other diseases. They altered the DNA of <b>cowpox</b> virus by inserting a gene from other viruses (namely Herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and influenza).|$|E
25|$|A {{very early}} form of {{vaccination}} known as variolation was developed several {{thousand years ago}} in China. It involved the application of materials from smallpox sufferers in order to immunize others. In 1717 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu observed the practice in Istanbul and attempted to popularize it in Britain, but encountered considerable resistance. In 1796 Edward Jenner developed a much safer method, using <b>cowpox</b> to successfully immunize a young boy against smallpox, and this practice was widely adopted. Vaccinations against other viral diseases followed, including the successful rabies vaccination by Louis Pasteur in 1886. The nature of viruses however was not clear to these researchers.|$|E
25|$|After Edward Jenner {{introduced}} the smallpox vaccine in 1798, variolation declined and was banned in some countries. As with variolation, {{there was some}} religious opposition to vaccination, although this was balanced to some extent by support from clergymen, such as Reverend Robert Ferryman, a friend of Jenner's, and Rowland Hill, who not only preached in its favour but also performed vaccination themselves. There was also opposition from some variolators who saw {{the loss of a}} lucrative monopoly. William Rowley published illustrations of deformities allegedly produced by vaccination, lampooned in James Gillray's famous caricature depicted on this page, and Benjamin Moseley likened <b>cowpox</b> to syphilis, starting a controversy that would last into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Many viruses encode {{proteins}} that can inhibit apoptosis. Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which {{are essential for}} the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1 protein and the adenovirus E1B 19K protein. Some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and {{an example is the}} CrmA protein of <b>cowpox</b> viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example, the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response. Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. As a consequence, p53 cannot induce apoptosis, since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the hepatitis B virus HBx protein are examples of viral {{proteins that}} can perform such a function.|$|E
500|$|Lady Mary Wortley Montagu {{observed}} smallpox inoculation {{during her}} {{stay in the}} Ottoman Empire, writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters, and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in 1718. In 1721, Cotton Mather and colleagues provoked controversy in Boston by inoculating hundreds. In 1796, Edward Jenner, a doctor in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, rural England, discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a <b>cowpox</b> lesion. <b>Cowpox</b> is a poxvirus {{in the same family}} as variola. Jenner called the material used for inoculation vaccine, from the root word vacca, which is Latin for cow. The procedure was much safer than variolation, and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission. Vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world. During the 19th century, the <b>cowpox</b> virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by vaccinia virus. [...] Vaccinia is in the same family as <b>cowpox</b> and variola, but is genetically distinct from both. The origin of vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known. According to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation to neighbouring Circassia. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it [...] "these hundred years".|$|E
500|$|Edward Jenner (1749–1823), a British rural physician, was [...] as a boy. He had {{suffered}} greatly from the ordeal but survived fully protected from smallpox. Jenner knew {{of a local}} belief that dairy workers who had contracted a relatively mild infection called <b>cowpox</b> were immune to smallpox. He decided to test the theory (although he was probably {{not the first to}} do so). On 14 May 1796 he selected [...] "a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox". The boy, [...] James Phipps (1788–1853), [...] survived the experimental inoculation with <b>cowpox</b> virus and suffered only a mild fever. On 1 July 1796, Jenner took some [...] "smallpox matter" [...] (probably infected pus) and repeatedly inoculated Phipps's arms with it. Phipps survived and was subsequently inoculated with smallpox more than 20times without succumbing to the disease. Vaccination– the word is derived from the Latin vacca meaning [...] "cow"– had been invented. Jenner's method was soon shown to be safer than variolation, and by 1801 more than 100,000 people had been vaccinated.|$|E
500|$|The English {{physician}} Edward Jenner {{demonstrated the}} effectiveness of <b>cowpox</b> to protect humans from smallpox in 1796, after which various {{attempts were made to}} eliminate smallpox on a regional scale. In Russia in 1796, the first child to receive this treatment was bestowed the name [...] "Vaccinov" [...] by Catherine the Great, and was educated {{at the expense of the}} nation. The introduction of the vaccine to the New World took place in Trinity, Newfoundland in 1800 by Dr. John Clinch, boyhood friend and medical colleague of Jenner. As early as 1803, the Spanish Crown organized the Balmis expedition to transport the vaccine to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the Philippines, and establish mass vaccination programs there. The U.S. Congress passed the Vaccine Act of 1813 to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the American public. By about 1817, a very solid state vaccination program existed in the Dutch East Indies. In British India a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination, through Indian vaccinators, under the supervision of European officials. Nevertheless, British vaccination efforts in India, and in Burma in particular, were hampered by stubborn indigenous preference for inoculation and distrust of vaccination, despite tough legislation, improvements in the local efficacy of the vaccine and vaccine preservative, and education efforts. By 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans. In 1842, the United Kingdom banned inoculation, later progressing to mandatory vaccination. The British government introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination by an Act of Parliament in 1853. In the United States, from 1843 to 1855 first Massachusetts, and then other states required smallpox vaccination. Although some disliked these measures, coordinated efforts against smallpox went on, and the disease continued to diminish in the wealthy countries. In Northern Europe a number of countries had eliminated smallpox by 1900, and by 1914, the incidence in most industrialized countries had decreased to comparatively low levels. Vaccination continued in industrialized countries, until the mid to late 1970s as protection against reintroduction. Australia and New Zealand are two notable exceptions; neither experienced endemic smallpox and never vaccinated widely, relying instead on protection by distance and strict quarantines.|$|E
2500|$|... 1796. Edward Jenner pioneered {{smallpox}} inoculation with <b>cowpox</b> virus.|$|E
2500|$|In 1798, the English surgeon/scientist Edward Jenner {{published}} {{the results of}} his experiments and thus introduced the far superior and safer method of inoculation with [...] <b>cowpox</b> virus, a mild infection [...] that also induced immunity to smallpox. Jenner was not the first person to inoculate with <b>cowpox</b> nor [...] the first to realize that infection with <b>cowpox</b> gave immunity to smallpox. However, {{he was the first to}} publish evidence that it was effective and to provide advice on its production. [...] His efforts led to smallpox inoculation falling into disuse and eventually being banned in England in 1840.|$|E
2500|$|Smallpox vaccine, {{the first}} {{successful}} vaccine to be developed, was introduced by Edward Jenner in 1796. He followed up his observation that milkmaids who had previously caught <b>cowpox</b> [...] did not later catch smallpox by showing that inoculated <b>cowpox</b> protected against inoculated smallpox. The word [...] "vaccine" [...] is derived from Variolae vaccinae (i.e. smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote <b>cowpox</b> and used in the long title of his An enquiry into the causes and effects of Variolae vaccinae, known {{by the name of}} cow pox. Vaccination, the term which soon replaced <b>cowpox</b> inoculation and [...] vaccine inoculation, was first used in print by Jenner's friend, Richard Dunning in 1800. Initially, the terms vaccine/vaccination referred only to smallpox, but in 1881 Louis Pasteur proposed that to honour Jenner the terms be widened to cover the new protective inoculations being introduced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of who first tried <b>cowpox</b> inoculation/vaccination cannot be answered with certainty. Most, but still limited, information is available for Benjamin Jesty, Peter Plett and John Fewster. In 1774 Jesty, a farmer of Yetminster in Dorset, observing that the two milkmaids living with his family were immune to smallpox, inoculated his family with <b>cowpox</b> {{to protect them from}} smallpox. He attracted a certain amount of local criticism and ridicule at the time then interest waned. Attention was later drawn to Jesty, and he was brought to London in 1802 by critics jealous of Jenner's prominence {{at a time when he}} was applying to Parliament for financial reward. During 1790–92 Peter Plett, a teacher from Holstein, reported limited results of <b>cowpox</b> inoculation to the Medical Faculty of the University of Kiel. However, the Faculty favoured variolation and took no action. John Fewster, a surgeon friend of Jenner's from nearby Thornbury, discussed the possibility of <b>cowpox</b> inoculation at meetings as early as 1765. He may have done some <b>cowpox</b> inoculations in 1796 at about the same time that Jenner vaccinated Phipps. However Fewster, who had a flourishing variolation practice, may have considered this option but used smallpox instead. He thought vaccination [...] offered no advantage over variolation, but maintained friendly contact with Jenner and certainly made no claim of priority for vaccination when critics attacked Jenner's reputation. It seems clear that the idea of using <b>cowpox</b> instead of smallpox for inoculation was considered, and actually tried in the late 18th century, and not just by the medical profession. Therefore, Jenner was not the first to try <b>cowpox</b> inoculation. However, he was the first to publish his evidence and distribute vaccine freely, provide information on selection of suitable material, and maintain it by arm-to-arm transfer. The authors of the official World Health Organization (WHO) account Smallpox and its Eradication assessing Jenner's role wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Donald Hopkins has written, [...] "Jenner's unique {{contribution}} {{was not that}} he inoculated a few persons with <b>cowpox,</b> but that he then proved [...] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective <b>cowpox</b> pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle. Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Jenner, FRS ( [...] ; 17 May 1749 – 26 January 1823) was an English {{physician}} and scientist {{who was the}} pioneer of smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine. The terms [...] "vaccine" [...] and [...] "vaccination" [...] are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote <b>cowpox.</b> He used it in 1796 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of <b>cowpox</b> against smallpox.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{there was}} already an {{informal}} public understanding of some connection between disease resistance and working with cattle. The [...] "beautiful milkmaid" [...] {{seems to have been}} a frequent image in the art and literature of this period. But it is known for certain that in the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791) tested successfully the possibility of using the <b>cowpox</b> vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans. [...] In 1796, Sarah Nelmes, a local milkmaid, contracted <b>cowpox</b> and went to Jenner for treatment. Jenner took the opportunity to test his theory. He inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener, with material taken from the <b>cowpox</b> lesions on Sarah's hand. After a mild fever and the expected local lesion James recovered after a few days. About two months later Jenner inoculated James on both arms with material from a case of smallpox, with no effect; the boy was immune to smallpox.|$|E
2500|$|Jenner sent a paper {{reporting}} {{his observations}} to the Royal Society in April 1797. Its contents are unknown. It was not submitted formally {{and there is}} no mention of it in the Society's records. Jenner had sent the paper informally to Sir Joseph Banks, the Society's president, who asked Everard Home for his views. His report, published for the first time in 1999, was sceptical and called for further vaccinations. These were done and in 1798 Jenner published an analysis of 23 'cases' [...] including several individuals who had resisted natural exposure after previous <b>cowpox.</b> It is not known how many Jenner vaccinated or challenged by inoculation with smallpox virus; e.g. Case 21 included 'several children and adults'. Crucially all of at least four who Jenner deliberately inoculated with smallpox virus resisted it. These included the first and last patients in a series of arm-to-arm transfers. He concluded that <b>cowpox</b> inoculation was a safe alternative to smallpox inoculation, but rashly claimed that the protective effect was lifelong. This last proved to be incorrect. Jenner also tried to distinguish between 'True' <b>cowpox</b> which produced the desired result and 'Spurious' <b>cowpox</b> which was ineffective and/or produced severe reaction. Modern research suggests Jenner was trying to distinguish between effects caused by what would now be recognised as noninfectious vaccine, a different virus (e.g. paravaccinia/milker's nodes), or contaminating bacterial pathogens. This caused confusion at the time, but would become important criteria in vaccine development. A further source of confusion was Jenner's belief that fully effective vaccine obtained from cows originated in an equine disease, which he mistakenly referred to as grease. This was criticised at the time but vaccines derived from horsepox were soon introduced and later contributed to the complicated problem of the origin of vaccinia virus, the virus in present-day vaccine.|$|E
