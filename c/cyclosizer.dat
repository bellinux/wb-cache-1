40|$|The {{need to know}} precise {{particle}} size distributions {{for a variety of}} applications has {{led to the development of}} new particle sizing techniques. A particularly useful technique is that of forward light scattering utilised by the Malvern Laser Particle Sizer. This new technique has been used to measure the {{particle size}} distributions of three powders, (silica, latex and minusil) and the results compared with size distributions determined by the more traditional techniques (Coulter counter, Warman <b>cyclosizer</b> and Andreasen pipette). The new instrument showed good agreement with existing techniques for those samples in which the particles were spherical...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{particle}} shape on hydrocyclone classification was investigated. Classification tests using hydrocyclone and <b>cyclosizer</b> showed that coarse fractions of plate-like particles such as PTFE and glass flake used here {{were not necessarily}} recovered as underflow product, especially at relatively high inlet velocity. Settling velocity of the glass flake particles in centrifugal field was estimated using a centrifugal particle size analyzer, and {{it was revealed that}} differences in settling velocity between coarse and fine glass flake particles became smaller with increases in angular velocity. Moreover, settling test of glass plate in water or glycerin solution was conducted to know relationship between particle Reynolds number (Re) and settling velocity of the plate. At smaller Re condition, the glass plate settled straight and stably, and larger plate settled faster than smaller plate. However, oscillating motion of the plate occurred in the region of high Re, and settling velocities of the large plate became smaller than that of the small plate in such conditions. Drag coefficient (C) calculated based on the settling velocity of the glass plate {{is similar to that of}} glass spheres below Re of about 50, above which it became larger than that of glass sphere. Approximation formula of correlaton between Re and C suggests that the influence of the Re on C can be neglected in the region of high Re, and C increases with increases in the ratio of the particle diameter to thickness (D/T). The decrease of the difference in settling velocity recognized in the centrifugal settling test and the effect of the particle shape (D/T) on C at high Re region are considered to be able to affect the hydrocyclone classification. The misplacement of coarse plate-like particles in the hydrocyclone and <b>cyclosizer</b> tests could be ascribed to the particle shape effects...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems in Mineral Processing is to know how ores can be comminuted and how the minerals are distributed in the generated particles. In this work, image analysis and processing techniques were applied to support the development, calibration and validation of simulation models of mineral liberation process by particle size reduction, where the minerals exhibit discriminatory behaviour. Based on images of ore textures, simulation models of fracture lines propagation and particle growth by aggregation of a "powder" were developed. In order to calibrate these models, optimization methods were used {{to find out the}} optimal model's parameter values in sense that minimize a given objective function defined as the squared deviation between observed and simulated particle size distribution taking into account the variation of the average grade of the target mineral with particle size. This research activity was supported by an important experimental work, comprising batch ball mill grinding tests, size analysis using sieving, laser beam, <b>cyclosizer</b> and microscopy (image analysis) techniques and chemical analysis by X Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Atomic Absorption and optical and backs catering electrons (BSE) image analysisAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
