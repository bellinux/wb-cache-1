5|$|<b>Cleaning</b> {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). <b>Cleaning</b> symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by <b>cleaning</b> larger fish and other marine animals. Other <b>cleaning</b> symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Internal <b>cleaning</b> of diving {{cylinders}} may {{be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. <b>Cleaning</b> methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical <b>cleaning</b> using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|E
5|$|The role of <b>cleaning</b> symbioses {{has been}} debated by {{biologists}} for over thirty years. Some believe that <b>cleaning</b> represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure mutualism, increasing the fitness of both individuals. Others such as Robert Trivers hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, reciprocal altruism. Others again believe that <b>cleaning</b> behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, {{a form of}} parasitism.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine airflow resistance of <b>cleanings</b> removed from corn by screening and by aspiration. <b>Cleanings</b> were divided into fractions and then tested for airflow resistance in a 239 -mm-diameter column. Coefficients for the modified Ergun equation were developed to predict airflow resistance of various sizes and size combinations of <b>cleanings</b> for airflows from 0. 06 to 30. 5 m^/m^ min...|$|R

5|$|<b>Cleaning</b> {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. <b>Cleaning</b> symbioses with reptile clients include fish <b>cleaning</b> the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E

The facility was privatized in 2012, and it is currently under the management of Waste Oils Co. Ltd.|$|E

50|$|Routinely, {{only minor}} <b>cleanings</b> {{are done in}} the nest. Major nest <b>cleanings</b> take place during and right after {{excavation}} of tunnels. It also takes place after all the offspring have hatched. Pupal skins, broken cell partitions, meconia, {{and the remains of}} cells where development has stopped are thrown out. There is no need to remove defecation from adult bees because this takes place outside the entrance hole or away from the nest.|$|R

Local chapters also offered assistance. The chapter in San Antonio, Texas sent <b>cleaning</b> kits, and the chapter in Los Angeles delivered 2,000comfort kits containing hygiene supplies and crossword puzzles for children. The German Red Cross also offered assistance.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. These {{may be of}} the same species, as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in <b>cleaning</b> symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the <b>cleaning</b> stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E

The lower [...] of Cloud Gate is wiped down twice a day by hand, while the entire sculpture is cleaned twice a year with [...] of liquid detergent. The daily <b>cleanings</b> use a Windex-like solution, while the semi-annual <b>cleanings</b> use Tide. A notable February 2009 rare incident saw two names etched in letters about [...] tall on the northeast side of the curved sculpture. The graffiti was removed by the same firm that did the original polishing.|$|R
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} <b>cleaning</b> lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas <b>cleaning</b> ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a <b>cleaning</b> lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in <b>cleaning</b> and fanning eggs and larvae, <b>cleaning</b> the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|E
