5|$|Helper T cells express T <b>cell</b> receptors (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen {{bound to}} Class II MHC molecules.

Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T <b>cell</b> must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper <b>cell,</b> while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T <b>cell</b> activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting <b>cell.</b> The activation of a resting helper T <b>cell</b> causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many <b>cell</b> types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells.
