40|$|The {{valence state}} of {{chromium}} in passive films on metals is conventionally studied using surface analytical {{techniques such as}} AES and XPS. As these techniques involve electron detection, they can only be carried out ex situ in UHV after electrochemical treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy {{can be used to}} determine both valency and structural environment and, as only x-rays are involved, measurements can be carried out in air or in situ in an electrochemical cell. Recent in situ studies of passivity have used EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) to determine passive film structure [1 - 4]. In this communication, we report on an in situ XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) study of reversible changes in the valence state of chromium in passive fi!ms~ A recent ex situ XANES experiment [5] showed that an oxide film containing Cr(VI) can be formed on A 1 Cr alloys by polarization to high potentials in a borate buffer solution. This chromate was reduced to the + 3 state at a low potential and then reoxidized to the + 6 state by polarizing again to the high potential. In this communication we report similar results measured in situ which demonstrate he applicability of XANES to simultaneous valency and electrochemical measurements. As a single fixed specimen is used throughout the experiment, quantitative information on the dissolution of chromium is available. EXPERIMENTAL Around the chromium K edge (~ 6 keV), the absorption length of x-rays in water is of the order of lmm which complicates cell design. The electrochemical cell is shown in Fig. 1. It is based on that used by Kerkar et al. [1] which allows both electrochemical <b>control</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The electrode consists of a thin Mylar window (~ 6 ~m) on which has been sputtered ~ 100 A of Ta (in order to maintain electrical contact) and ~ 20 A of Al- 12 %Cr.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to use the <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to aid the design and placement of flow control devices and to develop a new and efficient method of calculating the <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> using the mesh adjoint equations. The mesh adjoint equation provides a implification of the adjoint optimisation framework which can speed up an optimisation by removing the bottleneck of needing to calculate the mesh <b>sensitivity.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{can be used as a}} design tool a designer to the most important regions on an aircraft surface. This thesis focusses on using shock <b>control</b> bumps and <b>surface</b> contour bumps in drag sensitive regions on transonic aerofoils and wings to reduce drag. Usually a designer has the surface pressure and streamlines to guide the device placement, however these can mislead as it is not clear which areas will have the most impact on drag reduction. The drag <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gives a direct link between the drag coefficient and a potential change in the wing surface in the form of a derivative. This method was proved successful for reducing drag when optimisation was localised to the drag sensitive regions on the wing. A new method for calculating the <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> using the Delaunay Graph Mapping (DGM) mesh movement has been developed. This provides an explicit and efficient mapping of the mesh <b>sensitivity</b> to the <b>surface</b> senstivity. Previously, this required the solution of a large and costly linear system using a mesh movement such as Linear Elasticity (LE) to move the mesh. The DGM method is compared against analytical solutions, finite difference and the LE mesh adjoint to show that the DGM mesh adjoint will provide an accurate calculation of the gradients on the wing surface. The DGM mesh adjoint has been shown to successfully find a minima when optimising shock bumps on a 3 D geometry showing that it is a robust and capable method for optimisation...|$|R

30|$|ZnO {{is a wide}} bandgap {{semiconductor}} material that has been attracting considerable research interest for many years. It has recently seen a renaissance due to reports of successful p-type doping [15], room-temperature ferromagnetism which could make it attractive for spintronic devices [16], and the large exciton binding energy which makes it attractive for photonics [17]. ZnO nanowire applications such as lasers, light-emitting diodes, nanogenerators, and field emitters have been reported [18 – 21]. In most of these applications, the typical <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the nanowire structure is often a disadvantage. However, ZnO nanowires are also finding use as gas sensors and UV detectors [7 – 11, 22]. These nanowire sensors {{make use of the}} known <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of ZnO which is further enhanced by the nanowire structure. The nature of this sensitivity has been controversial for over half a century [12 – 14, 23, 24].

40|$|Sensing schemes {{based on}} Rayleigh {{anomalies}} (RAs) in metal nanogratings exhibit an impressive bulk refractive-index sensitivity determined solely by the grating period. However, the <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (which {{is a key}} figure of merit for label-free chemical and biological sensing) needs to be carefully investigated to assess the actual applicability of this technological platform. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of RAs in metal nanogratings when local refractive-index changes are considered. Our studies reveal that the <b>surface</b> <b>sensitivity</b> deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude by comparison with the corresponding bulk value; interestingly, this residual sensitivity is not attributable to the wavelength shift of the RAs, which are completely insensitive to local refractive-index changes, but rather to a strictly connected plasmonic effect.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step.
