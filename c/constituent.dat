5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a <b>constituent</b> of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a <b>constituent</b> of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studied the}} physical, {{chemical}} properties {{and structure of}} phellinus igniarius polysaccharides (PIPS). PIPS is negative on iodine potassium iodide solution test, positive on α-naphthol reaction, and negative on Fehling reagent test. Viscosity of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and intracellular polysaccharides (IPS) at 25 °C was 0. 85 dL/g and 1. 20 dL/g respectively. Column chromatography analysis separated 8 <b>constituents</b> from IPS, while 2 <b>constituents</b> were separated from EPS. The monosaccharide compositions {{of some of these}} <b>constituents</b> were further investigated. Results from gel permeation chromatography showed that IPS had 9 <b>constituents</b> and EPS had 4 <b>constituents.</b> The molecular weights of the <b>constituents</b> were determined...|$|R

5|$|The crisis {{between the}} monarch {{and his former}} {{minister}} was felt immediately within the <b>Constituent</b> and Legislative General Assembly, which had been elected {{for the purpose of}} drafting a Constitution. A member of the <b>Constituent</b> Assembly, Bonifácio resorted to demagoguery, alleging the existence of a major Portuguese conspiracy against Brazilian interests—insinuating that PedroI, who had been born in Portugal, was implicated. The Emperor became outraged by the invective directed at the loyalty of citizens who were of Portuguese birth and the hints that he was himself conflicted in his allegiance to Brazil. On 12 November 1823, PedroI ordered the dissolution of the <b>Constituent</b> Assembly and called for new elections. On the following day, he placed a newly established native Council of State in charge of composing a constitutional draft. Copies of the draft were sent to all town councils, and the vast majority voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire.|$|E

To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C. Rajagopalachari, K. M. Munshi and B. R. Ambedkar as its members.|$|E
30|$|The acid-soluble <b>constituents</b> of soil HAs {{obtained}} by treatment with concentrated urea {{were characterized by}} lower degrees of humification and smaller molecular sizes and displayed FA-like fluorescence. These features indicate that the acid-soluble <b>constituents</b> of soil HAs dissociated by concentrated urea treatment expressed similar properties to FAs. This {{was supported by the}} results of infrared spectroscopy. Infrared and fluorescence spectroscopies revealed that the acid-soluble <b>constituents</b> contained proteinous moieties and the DAX- 8 -non-adsorbed fraction was rich in polysaccharide moieties. In contrast, the humification degree of the precipitated fraction increased due to the separation of acid-soluble <b>constituents.</b> The precipitated fraction still contained smaller molecular size fluorescent substances. The present findings suggest that soil HAs are composed of dark-colored acid-insoluble <b>constituents,</b> FA-like acid-soluble <b>constituents,</b> protein-like <b>constituents,</b> and polysaccharides bound by weak linkages.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{introduce}} a new algorithm that learns structure {{in the form of}} bracketed sentences using unstructured, untagged sentences. The algorithm is based on the idea of Harris [Har 51] stating that <b>constituents</b> of the same type can be replaced within a sentence. The algorithm consists of two phases. In the rst phase, called alignment learning, the algorithm learns possible <b>constituents.</b> In the second phase, the algorithm selects the best <b>constituents</b> out of the possible <b>constituents</b> that were learned. This phase is called bracket selection. The learning phase nds possible <b>constituents</b> by comparing all sentences in memory in pairs. Two sentences from memory are aligned to each other using the Edit Distance algorithm [WF 74]. This algorithm nds the parts that are similar or dissimilar in both sentences. The dissimilar parts of the sentences are assumed to be possible <b>constituents.</b> All of these possible <b>constituents</b> are stored. At some point the algorithm might ha [...] ...|$|R
