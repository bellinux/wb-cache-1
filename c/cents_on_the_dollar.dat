5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Congress used {{four main}} methods {{to cover the}} cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver). Congress made two issues of paper money—in 1775–1780 and in 1780–81. The first issue {{amounted}} to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one <b>cent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> By 1780, <b>the</b> paper money was [...] "not worth a Continental", as people said.|$|R

40|$|At Western University, {{like many}} other schools, journal package “big deals” (large, bundled {{collections}} of ejournals from the same publisher, purchased at a discount) {{have been seen as}} beneficial to <b>the</b> collection based <b>on</b> high discounts and low cost per use. When the Canadian loonie fell to 67 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U. S. <b>dollar</b> in January 2016, it created unexpected financial challenges for collections management. We now had to consider new ways to find cost savings by canceling or unbundling resources, and big deals became a potential target. In evaluating these packages, we looked beyond cost per use, building on work done by the University of Montreal. This paper summarizes the iterative process Western University developed to evaluate and potentially unbundle less valuable big deals. We outline the additional criteria we considered (overlap, current year use, perceived value by faculty members, citation analysis of where our researchers published, and impact factor) and how we made data-driven decisions for unbundling...|$|R
25|$|Also, it {{is alleged}} that The Trump Organization {{has a history}} of not paying for {{services}} rendered. Several hundred contractors or workers for the organization have filed lawsuits or liens claiming they were not paid for their work, and others say they had to settle for <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the WWF did not buy out Sting's {{contract}} with AOL Time Warner, he rejected a buyout offer of 50 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002 (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year). Borden then entered into contract {{negotiations with the}} WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.|$|E
25|$|By now Patterson {{realized}} {{he was going to}} jail and appealed his conviction, which was overturned and then the remaining charges were dropped {{in light of the fact}} that he would be able to pay back 60 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> to his creditors. Patterson's house in Corning was auctioned off to pay creditors - an early bid came in at $10,000.00. His father also had to surrender his priority claims against the bank.|$|E
25|$|The setup {{involves}} an auctioneer who volunteers {{to auction off}} a <b>dollar</b> bill with <b>the</b> following rule: the bill goes to the winner; however, the second-highest bidder also loses the amount that they bid. The winner can get a dollar for a mere 5 cents, but only {{if no one else}} enters into the bidding war. The second-highest bidder is the biggest loser by paying the top amount they bid without getting anything back. The game begins with one of the players bidding 5 cents (the minimum), hoping to make a 95-cent profit. They can be outbid by another player bidding 10 cents, as a 90-cent profit is still desirable. Similarly, another bidder may bid 15cents, making an 85-cent profit. Meanwhile, the second bidder may attempt to convert their loss of 10 cents into a gain of 80 cents by bidding 20 <b>cents,</b> and so <b>on.</b> Every player has a choice of either paying for nothing or bidding 5 <b>cents</b> more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> Any bid beyond the value of a dollar is a loss for all bidders alike. A series of rational bids will reach and ultimately surpass one <b>dollar</b> as <b>the</b> bidders seek to minimize their losses. If the first bidder bids 95 cents, and the second bidder bids one dollar (for no net gain or loss), the first bidder stands to lose ninety five cents unless he bids $1.05, in which case they rationally bid more than the value of the item for sale (<b>the</b> <b>dollar)</b> in order to reduce their losses to only five cents. Bidding continues with the second highest bidder always losing more than the highest bidder and therefore always trying to become the high bidder. Only the auctioneer gets to profit in the end.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{acceptance}} of Māori culture in wider New Zealand society, the settlements have generated controversy on both sides. Some Māori {{have complained that}} the settlements occur {{at a level of}} between 1 and 2.5 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> {{of the value of the}} confiscated lands; conversely, some non-Māori denounce the settlements and socioeconomic iniatives as amounting to race-based preferential treatment. Both of these sentiments were expressed during the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{guarantee}} of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.|$|E

Gibbons was able to raise more than $500 million in the liquidation, paying off all the railroad's creditors, {{bondholders}} and all other debts in full at face value with interest. Henry Crown was ultimately proven correct, as both he and other bondholders who had purchased Rock Island debt for <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> during the low ebb in prices did especially well.|$|E

25|$|In 1859 Gould began {{speculative}} investing {{by buying}} stock in small railways. Gould's father-in-law Daniel S. Miller {{was credited with}} introducing the younger man to the railroad industry, when he suggested that Gould help him save his investment in the Rutland and Washington Railroad in the Panic of 1857. Gould purchased stock for 10 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar,</b> which left him {{in control of the}} company. Through the Civil War era, he did more speculation on railroad stocks in New York City. In 1863 he was appointed manager of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Morris and Nicholson {{honestly}} believed that, {{if their}} cash flow problems were fixed, {{they could make}} payments on the property they owned and their shares would be returned to them. This proved incorrect. On October 23, 1807, all stock in the company was sold at 7 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> to the accountants managing the Aggregate Fund. By 1856, the company had produced just over $92,000 in income. Morris and Nicholson's heirs sued to recover the stock and {{gain access to the}} income. In 1880, each estate was awarded $9,962.49.|$|E
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of goods were in Britain or in transit when Washington suddenly and unexpectedly terminated Lend-Lease on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (around 55% GDP) and had drastically reduced its exports. The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities {{such as food}} while it {{could no longer afford}} to pay for these items using export profits. The end of lend-lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> giving an initial value of £1.075 billion.|$|E

50|$|Just {{like the}} old system, teams {{would have to pay}} a {{percentage}} of every dollar that their payroll passed this threshold. Under the 2002 and 2006 CBAs, the agreement brought about a progressive taxation system. They agreed that first time offenders would pay a fee of 17.5% <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> (later increased to 22.5%), second time offenders would pay a 30% <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar,</b> and third time offenders would have to pay 40% <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> In <b>the</b> 2012 CBA, after seeing teams go over more than three times, the agreement added a 50% taxation level when teams went over the limit four or more times.|$|R
25|$|On March 9, 1933, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, {{drafted in}} large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It {{provided}} for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6billion; depositors lost a total of $540million, and eventually received on average 85 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> of their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing back.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the {{province}}'s public health care program {{was not lost on}} the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. So, the adoption of health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals - Tommy Douglas, John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson.|$|E
25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents.

25|$|Hoover {{had already}} {{considered}} a bank holiday {{to prevent further}} bank runs, but rejected the idea because {{he was afraid to}} trip a panic. Roosevelt acted as soon as he took office; he closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation. On March 9, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, drafted in large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed.
