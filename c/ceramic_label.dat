2500|$|Sometimes {{container}} factories {{will offer}} {{services such as}} labelling. Several labelling technologies are available. Unique to glass is the Applied <b>Ceramic</b> <b>Labelling</b> process (ACL). This is screen-printing of the decoration onto the container with a vitreous enamel paint, which is then baked on. An {{example of this is}} the original Coca-Cola bottle. Absolut Vodka Bottles have various added services such as: Etching ( [...] Absolut Citron/) Coating (Absolut Raspberry/Ruby Red)and Applied <b>Ceramic</b> <b>Labelling</b> ( [...] Absolut Blue/Pears/Red/Black) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{evaluation of}} a modified cryocooler with various regenerator matrices is reported. The matrices examined are 0. 015 in. diam. Pb spheres and 0. 008, 0. 015, and 0. 030 in. diam. rods of a 0. 2 % SnCl 2 doped <b>ceramic</b> <b>labelled</b> LS- 8 A. Specific heat and thermal conductivity data on these rod materials are also reported. The chronic pulverization/dusting problem common to Pb spheres was investigated. During a 1000 hr life test with 0. 0008 in. diam. rods there was no degradation of the refrigerator performance, and a subsequent examination of the rods themselves revealed no evidence of breakage or pulverization. The load temperature characteristics for the rod packed regenerators were inferior to that for the Pb spheres, the effect being to shift the Pb spheres load curve up in temperature. This temperature shift was 5. 0, 7. 4, and 11. 6 K for the 0. 0008, 0. 015, and 0. 030 in. diam. rods, respectively...|$|R
