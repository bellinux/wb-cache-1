40|$|Abstract — Standardization of <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design {{procedures}} enables {{designers to}} develop their own <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> automation modules for entire <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design applications. Since main effort and time for implementation of the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures are generally spent for interpretation and explanation of the available <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design standards, a computer-automated access by using parametric modeling to the available standards may improve speed, reliability and quality of the design procedures. Starting from the fact that components of <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> are generally composed of similar mechanical and electrical sub-components independent of the crane type, a general component tree of <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is developed for automation purpose. Design Modules of cranes are defined from the developed component tree of the cranes based on the available design procedures. Independent Design Procedures are defined as atomic design modules of the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures by considering computational approaches and rules in the "F. E. M. Rules " for each <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> component. The "F. E. M. rules " is selected for this purpose because of its widespread use and established popularity among the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> manufacturers. Access to the "F. E. M. Rules " from any design procedure is fully automated by using a systematic approach of parametric modeling. The parametric model can be used for various <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design cases as well as further for optimization. “Ref. [6]...|$|R

40|$|A 2, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> {{is needed}} to replace an {{existing}} 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> in the Chemical Lab (Building MO- 733). The existing 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> (to be replaced) has a 174 boom (I-beam). The crane {{is attached to the}} wall through two brackets (about 8 1 / 2 -ft apart).

After preliminary studies and discussions, it was decided to construct the new <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> from two perpendicular I-beams (L-shape) without a supporting rod. The crane is to be supported on the wall through the two lower existing brackets (about 5 -ft apart). The boom is to be 20 -ft long cantilever (the horizontal I-beam).

50|$|Murphy learns {{how to fly}} the {{aircraft}} in the most daring way, getting {{it out on the}} choppy waters of the river and discovering how the controls work by trial and error. Murphy soon finds the U-boat's hiding place and attempts to bomb it using home-made Molotov cocktail bombs, which fails. Meanwhile, word has come that Germany has surrendered, but Murphy is obsessed with revenge and makes plans to ram the U-boat with a floating crane owned by the friendly Frenchman Louis (Philippe Noiret). This also fails as the U-boat dives under him. However, the submerged U-boat becomes stuck in a mud bank. Murphy uses the crane to recover an unexploded torpedo fired earlier from the U-boat and drops it on the trapped crew, killing them. Murphy is also killed, as the explosion from the torpedo causes the <b>crane</b> <b>jib</b> to pin him to the deck as the floating crane sinks to the river bed.|$|E

This load cases can be obtained from normal and extreme operation of the crane, and there have been taken into account current regulations and previous experience. It has been also necessary to define the methodology to simulate non structural elements, contacts, materials, etc. Concerning regulations, it has been necessary to make an adaptation of the regulation UNE- 58536, because the specific regulation affecting these <b>crane</b> <b>jibs</b> (UNE 1726), was not enough restrictive. Moreover it has been necessary to estimate some translational and rotational velocities to apply the regulation. Furthermore, the welding of some parts has been simulated and analyzed, and it has been carried out a comparative analysis between the experimental results and the numerical results for some load cases. Once this correlation has been obtained the methodology of calculation and the numerical results are validated. Index Terms — jib, F. E. M., strength, crane, forklift truck I...|$|R
40|$|Tower cranes are {{amongst the}} most {{important}} machines used in industrial activities; therefore, understanding the natural frequency of these structures for optimal performance remains an essential field of study. Vibration, from an origin such as ‘Swing of the payload’, creates a dynamic load on the tower crane structure which may result in fatigue, weakness and ultimately collapse of the crane. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the dynamic behavior of planar model tower cranes under the pendulum motions of the payload. By doing this, hypotheses will be generated that may aid in improving the performance and safety of the crane. In this thesis, Pendulation motion equations, after adjusting for cable stiffness along the <b>crane’s</b> <b>jib,</b> will be defined based on the Lagrange Equations and solved using the numerical method based on the Runge-Kutta fifth order. The crane will be modeled and analysed using finite element software (FEM), and the first few natural frequencies of the complex planar model will be compared by analytical methods in order to verify the data. Continued load effects {{will be determined by}} the numerical solution of differential equations, and these will be entered into the finite element software for the purpose of analysis.

40|$|The {{catastrophic failure}} of a <b>crane</b> <b>jib</b> is {{discussed}} in the paper. The final failure was determined by an existing crack, which had propagated up to a considerable part of the cross section {{of one of the}} main tubular elements, which constituted the jib frame. The crack originated from a seam weld, which was used to join a stiffener on top of the tubular element where some cracks were found few years before the failure and that, actually, resulted to be a misguided attempt to strengthen the jib structure at that point. A stress analysis of the <b>crane</b> <b>jib</b> is firstly carried out, in order to analyse the stress levels nearby the failure region and to discuss the fatigue design with reference to current standards. In {{the second part of the}} paper, a crack-growth model is developed in order to achieve an estimate of the propagation period and a simple collapse model, based on beam theory, is used together with the material properties determined by experimental tests, to determine whether the final failure was determined by fracture or by plastic collapse. The analyses conclude that the fatigue design requirements were not satisfied and that the final failure was determined by plastic collapse of the critical cross section, after a relatively long stable propagation period. Some considerations about the necessity of scheduled and qualified inspections are also drawn...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Jib</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are widely}} used to {{transport}} objects in many factories and work places. Crane motions induce undesirable vibrations of the payload. Therefore, a <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> designer should seek a satisfactory control method to suppress load vibrations during transportation. The aim of this work is to derive a nonlinear model of a <b>jib</b> <b>crane,</b> which {{takes into account the}} simultaneous rotational motions of the boom and the post. These motions induce not only load sway in the plane of motion, but also oscillations of the plane determined by the ropes and the vertical axis through the suspension point. An active vibration control, based on a stability study, has been developed to transport an object along a specified route {{in such a way that}} the aforementioned sway and oscillations of the object are suppressed quickly. The crane nonlinear model and the developed feedback control scheme are simulated using the data of an actual <b>jib</b> <b>crane.</b> The simulation results show the usefulness of the derived model and the proposed control scheme, in suppressing the payload vibration.
