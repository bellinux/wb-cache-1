50|$|The Hispaniolan <b>Giant</b> <b>Tarantula</b> (Phormictopus cancerides) is a {{tarantula}} {{native to}} the Dominican Republic, where it is called Cacata; Haiti, where it is called Araignée-crab; and Cuba, where it is rare. It occurs from the West Indies to Brazil. During the day they hide under rocks and debris and come out at night to look for prey. Their fangs are quite formidable at more than 2 centimeters long, and when they pierce {{the body of a}} victim, venom is injected which paralyzes and breaks down the body tissue of the prey, allowing the tarantula to suck up the liquified insides. Its bite is not harmful to humans but can cause irritation and swelling.|$|R

50|$|Lee Jordan is a Gryffindor student {{two years}} ahead of Harry, and {{a close friend of}} Fred and George; he is as witty and fun-loving as the twins and a fellow Quidditch enthusiast. Lee wears his hair in dreadlocks and serves as Hogwarts' Quidditch commentator. Harry first {{encounters}} him at King's Cross as he attempts to smuggle a <b>giant</b> <b>tarantula</b> onto the train. Though Lee is a lively and astute commentator, he has a tendency to discuss off-topic subjects such as Harry's Firebolt or his own attraction to Angelina Johnson, his commentary is clearly biased in favour of his house, and his jovial tone often turns sarcastic whenever he talks about the Slytherin team. Lee also habitually swears in frustration whenever an opponent commits an infraction or scores against Gryffindor, often to the point where a frustrated Professor McGonagall attempts (unsuccessfully) to take away his megaphone.|$|R
5000|$|The only shaman that I know of, and {{certainly}} the only one I know personally. Sy, as shamans do, roves the earth relentlessly: there have been sightings of her from the Caribbean to Sunderbans (a non-mythical place, which hovers somewhere between India and Bangladesh, and where non-mythical tigers regularly hunt non-mythical humans) with lengthy touch-downs also in Cambodia, the Amazon, Tahiti, New Guinea, Mongolia, and Manitoba. On her journeys she communes at length with birds, mammals, and sea creatures — surreal ones such as pink dolphins, ground-dwelling Kakapo parrots, golden moon bears, <b>giant</b> <b>tarantulas,</b> white sharks, tree kangaroos, snow leopards, and the giant Cassowary bird, and … octopuses (not octopii), but she is equally tight with domestic animals such as pigs, chickens, and cockatoos.-- Phil Pochoda, retired publishing veteran (Simon & Schuster, Prentice Hall Press, Pantheon Books, University of Michigan Press, and the University Press of New England) ...|$|R
50|$|The exhibit {{features}} over 300 live {{insects and}} arthropods, including <b>giant</b> cockroaches, <b>tarantulas,</b> tailless whip scorpions and walking sticks.

Included in the habitat displays are mangrove swamps, a living bee tree, a desert diorama and a tropical rain forest.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} there, {{he drives}} to the Deemer mansion, where he finds Deemer, severe acromegalic deformities rapidly setting in, resignedly {{under the care}} of Steve as he knows he is nearing death. He divulges all he knows about the nutrient's effects on humans and animals and tells of Lund's death. Matt then returns to town to brief the sheriff on what he has learned from Dr. Townsend and at the mansion. As night falls, the tarantula comes to the mansion. Deemer is killed but Steve escapes when Hastings returns by car. The tarantula pursues them down the highway toward the town. The sheriff and his men intercept the pursuit, but their guns do not faze the tarantula. Hastening to town, they gather dynamite, but a blast big enough to blow up the highway does not faze the monster either. As they complete a hasty evacuation of the town, the air force, summoned by the sheriff, arrives {{in the form of a}} jet squadron which launches a napalm attack, successfully incinerating the <b>giant</b> <b>tarantula</b> at the town's edge.|$|R

Mr. Prickle appears, loudly demanding that the ship sink faster. He leaves, declaring his intention to die the fastest, heading for {{the low end of}} the Thumbtanic. The captain consuls the ship's designer, who calmly suggests such solutions as a [...] "heating fan the size of Africa" [...] to dry up the ocean. He brings out a blueprint and begins discussing it, but the captain interrupts [...] "This isn't useful; this is a monkey." [...] The designer realizes it is, but then notes there is an escape portal in the tail of the monkey. The captain panics again, running off screaming, while the designer continues to study the monkey. On deck, a man sells babies, then sex changes (with an axe) to male passengers. A <b>giant</b> <b>tarantula</b> crawls on the ship, but Jake shoots it back into the sea with a laser from [...] "Thumb Wars." [...] The ship then goes up to a 45 degree angle and then goes backwards and has the bow stick in the air, then it goes back to the stern in the air.|$|R

50|$|Ben and Norah, whose {{relationship}} is floundering, tour {{an island in}} Asia. However, they find that mutant giant animals are wreaking havoc, and they are desperate to escape. At {{the beginning of the}} tour, Ben appears nervous, while Norah attempts to calm him down. One of their guides is killed by a large tarantula, terrifying the both of them. They are then given FN FAL assault rifles with which to defend themselves against the spider swarms. Eventually, their vehicle crashes; however, before they can ask the driver what happened, the driver exits the vehicle and runs away in panic. They immediately discover why; a <b>giant,</b> purple <b>tarantula</b> has found them. They manage to escape it by driving their vehicle over a broken bridge, jumping over a cliffside in the process. Ben's map shows them that they have two options where to go next: a cave or a river.|$|R
2500|$|Reaction and {{the degree}} of {{irritation}} to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. [...] Some, such as those of the Chilean rose tarantula (Grammastola rosea) and the Pinktoe tarantula (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian <b>giant</b> white knee <b>tarantula</b> (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Giant</b> Otter (1990), <b>Tarantula!</b> (1991), Creatures of the Magic Water (1995), Jaguar - Eater of Souls (2001)Nick Gordon was a film-making explorer, dubbed an Indiana Jones for his {{exploits}} in {{the demanding}} and often dangerous {{environment of the}} Amazon rainforest. [...] He spent 15 years shooting films for Survival, in Africa as well as South America, culminating in a definitive portrait of the jaguar that was seven years in the making. His first Survival one-hour focused on the giant otter, and the sanctuary afforded the animal in Guyana by conservationist Dianne McTurk. Gordon went to Venezuela to film the dinner-plate-sized Goliath birdeater spider that {{became the subject of}} his film Tarantula!, along with the nativePiaroa people who both worship and eat the spiders. He first explored the almost mystical story of the jaguar and its place in the culture and folklore of the native peoples in Creatures of the Magic Water, and completed his study of the shy and elusive big cats by working closely with the Yanamamo and Matis peoples. The title, Jaguar - Eater of Souls, reflected the tribal belief that a jaguar spirit devours the souls of the departed. The Matis formed {{an integral part of the}} film because of the way the jaguar dominates their culture and rituals. Gordon travelled the rainforest by dugout canoe and imported scaffolding into the heart of the forest to build 150-foot filming towers. He had a camp where he looked after orphaned animals, including two jaguars, and shared in some of the rainforest people's unusual rituals during the course of his filming. The debilitating tropical environment took a toll on his health and he resolved to spend time in the UK. He returned to the Amazon to shoot more films for a production company he had set up, and died there from a heart attack aged 51 in 2004.|$|R
