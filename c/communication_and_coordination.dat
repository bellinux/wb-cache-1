25|$|In March 2006, the State Council of the People's Republic of China officially {{announced}} the first legislation directly aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS: the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations.

Although considered bold, these regulations were passed more than 20 years after the first case of HIV infection was identified, which was recently proven.

25|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), formed {{in the fall of}} 1940, was to re-establish Lithuania's independence. Commanded by Kazys Škirpa in Berlin, the LAF sought to unify Lithuanian resistance, and organize and conserve resources for the planned uprising against the Soviets. It acted as an umbrella organization and many groups used the name of LAF even though they were not connected with the LAF in Berlin. The LAF established its military–political headquarters in Vilnius and organizational headquarters in Kaunas. The <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> between these centers in Berlin, Kaunas, and Vilnius was rather poor. The headquarters in Vilnius suffered heavily from Soviet arrests, especially in early June 1941, and became largely defunct. Most of those arrested activists were executed in December 1941, in Russia.|$|E
25|$|The {{commander}} of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General Rydz-Śmigły, decided to break through toward the northwest {{and the town of}} Korosteń, thus avoiding a direct confrontation with the bulk of Soviet 1st Cavalry Army near Koziatyń. Soviet forces were plagued by <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> difficulties, and Polish forces managed to withdraw in orderly fashion and relatively unscathed, they were tied down in Ukraine and lacked sufficient strength to support Poland's Northern Front and reinforce the defenses at the Auta River for the decisive battle that was soon to take place there. Polish 3rd Army and newly formed 2nd Army regrouped near Słucza and started a series of their own counterattacks. However, Polish counterattacks in June and July all failed after initial successes. In the battles (19 June at Usza, 1 July at Horyń, 8 July at Równe) Bolsheviks were delayed but eventually Budionny's forces advanced east. When eventually in mid July Bolsheviks forces in Ukraine appeared to have been stopped by Polish forces, a new Soviet offensive north would prove even more devastating for the Polish forces.|$|E

500|$|The {{unexpected}} {{advance of}} the Indian forces under Brigadier Noronha into Jadotville on 3 January had created considerable international controversy and embarrassed Secretary-General Thant. Noronha had clearly exceeded his initial orders by seizing a bridge and crossing over the Lufira River. Thant had guaranteed the British and the Belgians that such an advance would not occur (both feared Tshombe would have UMHK property destroyed in retaliation). Ralphe Bunche had also given United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson II the impression that UN troops weren't to undertake further action in Katanga without specific authorisation from Thant. ONUC commanders were apparently never informed of such assurances. Bunche had {{sent a message to}} Gardiner, directing him to delay the UN advance until Tshombe's intentions could be clarified, but orders failed to reach Prem Chand or Noronha through ONUC's out-dated communications system. Gardiner trepidly responded by reporting the advance. Bunche then demanded an explanation as to why UN troops had supposedly disregarded Thant's orders. A UN spokesperson acknowledged that from a military perspective the operation had been [...] "brilliantly executed" [...] but stated that the UN regretted the [...] "serious breakdown in effective <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> between United Nations Headquarters and the Léopoldville office." ...|$|E
500|$|Deny Flight {{also helped}} set the path for future UN-NATO relations. [...] Throughout the operation, NATO [...] "felt the {{frustration}} of having its wings clipped by a parallel UN authority", while United Nations officials worried about the effect that NATO air strikes {{would have on the}} perceived neutrality of the United Nations. [...] Frustration with the [...] "dual key" [...] procedure of authorization for NATO action also led NATO officers to reject such an arrangement in the future. [...] Admiral Leighton Smith, the commander of NATO's forces during Deny Flight, expressed this sentiment quite bluntly, saying [...] "Don't ever have another dual key." [...] These difficulties in negotiating the UN-NATO relationship during Deny Flight were {{a major factor in the}} decision to place later NATO forces in the Balkans under the sole control of the NATO chain of command. [...] While many of these effects on UN-NATO relations were negative, Deny Flight also had positive implications. [...] During the operation, NATO and the UN exchanged liaison officers for the first time in their respective histories, establishing a precedent for military cooperation between the two. The <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> failures during Deny Flight also instilled [...] "a desire for mutual understanding and common solutions" [...] between the two organizations. This desire for cooperation was crucial to the establishment of IFOR, and later UN-NATO cooperation in Bosnia and elsewhere.|$|E
