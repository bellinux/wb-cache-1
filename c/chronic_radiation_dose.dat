This study relates to deterministic effects (respiratory system dysfunction) in Mayak workers after relatively small <b>chronic</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> (alpha plus gamma). Because cigarette smoke is a confounding factor, we also account for smoking effects. Here we present a new empirical mathematical model that was introduced for simultaneous assessment of radiation and cigarette-smoking-related damage to the respiratory system. The model incorporates absolute thresholds for smoking- and radiation-induced respiratory system dysfunction. As the alpha <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> to the lung increased from 0 to 4. 36 Gy, respiratory function indices studied decreased, although remaining in the normal range. The data {{were consistent with the}} view that alpha <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> to the lung above a relatively small threshold (0. 15 to 0. 39 Gy) cause some respiratory system dysfunction. Respiratory function indices were not found to be influenced by total-body gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> in the range 0 - 3. 8 Gy when delivered at low rates over years. However, significant decreases in airway conductance were found to be associated with cigarette smoking.

Validation of 30 differentially expressed genes was carried out using fluorescent based universal probe library. Abundance of DDR and DNA repair genes along with pathways such as MAPK, p 53 and JNK in higher background dose groups (> 5. 0 mGy/year) indicated a possible threshold dose for DDR signaling and are plausible reason of observing in vivo radio-adaptive response and non-carcinogenesis in HLNRA population.

At 417 mGy h 21 (illustrative of the most contaminated areas at Chernobyl), generation of radiolysis products did not significantly impact cellular concentrations of reactive oxygen species, or cellular redox potential.

40|$|On 26 April 1986, {{the worst}} nuclear {{accident}} {{in the history of}} the nuclear industry occurred at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) in the Ukraine (at that time a Republic of the Soviet Union) resulting a large amount of radioactive nuclides released into the environment in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other European countries. The <b>chronic</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> from radioactive nuclides released from the accident are still significant in the freshwater aquatic environment of the 30 km Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl. In this study, current methods of estimating <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> have been further developed by model inter-comparison and testing against empirical data. This research also supports previous work on the effects of radiation on aquatic biota by accurately measuring the external <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> in the littoral zone of Svyatoye and Perstok lakes in Belarus. The testing and critical analysis of five dose assessment models (RESRAD, FASSET, ERICA, R&D 128 and the D-Max model) was carried out in order to understand the key factors which influence predictions of both internal and external doses. For the internal dose, studies of the relationship between modelled dose and organism mass showed that mass is a more important factor than organism shape. The predictions of external dose were generally more variable than those for internal dose. The most important factor causing variation in external dose was the assumed habitat of the organism and the occupancy factor. The Monte Carlo method was used to estimate the uncertainty in internal dose rate caused by the variability of fish mass and fish concentration in real environments. It was found that the variability in Cs- 137 activity concentration in different fish was the most important factor contributing to the uncertainty of predictions of internal dose rate. Organism size at different life stages also has a large influence on dose. For young, small, fish, the internal dose is lower than the range of internal doses estimated by the different models, whilst the external dose could be greater than that estimated by models, especially in cases where part of the life cycle is spent on the sediment surface. Using measured values of tissue activity concentration, the model predictions of doses in Svyatoye and Perstok lakes, show good agreement with each other. In cases when tissue activity concentration data are not available, these have to be estimated from the tissue-water Concentration Ratio (CR). In this case, the predicted internal dose rates (using radionuclide concentration in the water) are more uncertain because of the variation of CR in the models. The model where CR is estimated depending on water chemistry gives the best prediction in this case. Measurements were made of the beta- and gamma- dose rate in three lakes (Perstok, Svyatoye and Dvorishche) giving profiles of dose as a function of depth. The method for gamma dose rate measurement worked well and a simple model for external gamma dose rate with depth above and below the sediment surface was found to give reasonable agreement with measured values. The beta in situ measurement was not successful and the method would need further investigation. The modelling studies carried out showed that internal dose rates to fish in Svyatoye and Perstok lakes are lower than or close to the 40 μGy hr- 1 recommended limit for possible impacts from <b>radiation.</b> The external <b>dose</b> rate to insect larvae and benthic fish is much higher than to pelagic fish because the former live in or on the sediment which has a much higher activity concentration than the water. None of the estimated external dose rates in these lakes was higher than 10 μGy hr- 1. It is concluded that the external dose rates to benthic biota and large fish in these closed lakes are still significant at this long time after the Chernobyl accident. But, radiation effects on these organisms may not be clearly seen, since the dose rates are below or close to guideline limits. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) examinations has increased rapidly since CT became commercially available. This resulted in growing concerns regarding {{the risk of}} malignancies induced by application of medical ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Therefore, <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction strategies are needed and being developed. This {{is especially important for}} patients who get many CT scans (e. g. chest CT for follow up of lung nodules), CT scans with high <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> (e. g. scans of the heart) and for children who are more sensitive to <b>radiation.</b> A recent <b>dose</b> reduction strategy focuses on optimization of image reconstruction. With current reconstruction methods, <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction results in noisy images, which are susceptible to artefacts. Iterative reconstruction (IR) is an alternative image reconstruction method that allows for image quality improvement at similar <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> or imaging at lower <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> without compromising image quality compared to current methods. Improved computational power of CT reconstruction workstations has permitted the recent introduction of IR for CT. Purpose The aim of this thesis was to evaluate both potential applications of IR: improving image quality and reducing <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> of CT scans of the heart and the lungs. First, in-vitro and ex-vivo preclinical research was performed to globally assess the potentials of IR for both applications. Second, image acquisition of cardiopulmonary CT examinations was optimized in-vivo with IR. Finally, IR was applied to reduce the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> in the clinical setting and explore novel indications for CT. Results With the current thesis, we showed that IR can be used to improve image quality in routine dose CT, to reduce the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> without loss of image quality, or with a combination of both strategies. We conclude that <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> for CCTA, calcium scoring CT, contrast-enhanced chest CT and plain chest CT can be reduced substantially by using IR. For calcium scoring CT scans of the heart, we first performed a phantom study, then an ex-vivo study and finally a pilot study in 30 individuals evaluating the maximally achievable <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction.

40|$|The of {{the hybrid}} Operation room (an {{operation}} room combined with advanced radiological X-ray equipment) is gaining popularity, {{as it is}} now the preferred room to perform (complex) endovascular aortic procedures. The fixed C-arms equipped in these rooms make it possible to gain very high image quality, add the use of advanced 3 D imaging techniques to the procedure, while the room is optimized for the use of X-ray radiation. Moreover, with a hybrid OR, including these advanced imaging options, combined with evolving stent graft designs, more patients with an aortic aneurysm become eligible for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), resulting in the fact that both more EVARS, as well as that more complex EVARs, are nowadays performed. Unfortunately, the transition from a standard operation room with a mobile C-arm towards a Hybrid OR with a fixed C-arm is also complicated by the much higher <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> rates as a result of using fixed C-arms. When the operating team does not adapt their working habits, they will be at risk to absorb much high <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> per procedure, and they are at risk to reach their yearly dose limits when working in a hybrid operating environment. In this thesis, we studied the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> outcomes at three different levels, and for each level, we studied both the effects of radiation exposure to the patient, as well as the effects of the absorbed <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> to the surgical staff. The first level included the cumulative <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> outcomes per type of procedure. Using the cumulative <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> outcomes, we were able to analyse the efficiently for new radiation and imaging techniques on reducing the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> rate. We have shown that for noncomplex (for example bifurcated EVARs) <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> can double when a similar process is performed in a Hybrid OR vs. a standard OR. Additionally, we studied the efficacy of new techniques which may be able to reduce the intraoperative dose, for example, an advanced image processing upgrade which can reduce the radiation in the Hybrid OR or the use of new imaging strategies such as 3 D road mapping using contrast-enhanced Cone beam CT. In the second level,we studied which procedural steps during the variety of EVAR procedures accords for very high <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> and which EVAR steps are relatively safe. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} analyse <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> fluctuations during the procedure and to extract the procedural steps that accord to relatively high <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> exposure and analyse which EVAR procedural steps are relatively safe.

The increase in vehicle weight would be insignificant (7150 kg to a vehicle gross weight of 0. 94 million kg) ...|$|R
