40|$|Reproductive {{costs are}} {{important}} determinants of reproductive effort in squamate reptiles. Consequently, differences in costs of reproduction between populations of geographically or climatically widespread species {{are likely to}} result in different patterns of reproductive effort. In the present study, the effect of pregnancy on sprint speed was examined in a small viviparous skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus (Gray 1845), from two populations at the climatic extremes of its distribution. Decreased sprint speed {{has the potential to be}} an important cost of reproduction in this species, through a reduced ability to avoid predation and/or decreased foraging efficiency. Lizards inhabiting the colder site were larger than those from the warmer site and, contrary to predictions from life history theory, had a higher reproductive effort. In both populations, sprint speed was lower in pregnant lizards than in either the same individuals after birth or non-pregnant control lizards. Within each population, sprint speed was unrelated to the level of reproductive effort of the female in terms of either absolute mass of the reproductive burden or the burden relative to her post-partum body mass. However, within each population, the mass of the clutch that an individual female was carrying relative to snout–vent length was an important determinant of her sprint speed while pregnant. Thus, within each population, a relatively high reproductive burden may potentially increase costs of reproduction in this species. Despite this relationship and predictions from life history theory suggesting that annual reproductive effort will be lower in populations with a large body size and delayed maturity, it is suggested that a higher reproductive effort at the <b>cold</b> <b>site</b> is possible because they have a higher absolute sprint speed because of their larger size and a relatively higher abundance of cover at the <b>cold</b> <b>site,</b> and differences in predation pressure may alter selective pressures on reproductive investment...|$|E

In this study, we focus on the impact of environmental temperature on growth, age at sexual maturity, and life-span of the Patagonian gecko Homonota darwini. Skeletochronological methods were used to assess the bone growth rates Of individuals from three populations at different geographic and temporal scales: two populations from Chubut (warm site; 1941 and 2010) and one population from Rio Negro (cold site; 1997 - 1998). Populations displayed similar bone arrangement and the growth patterns fit a von Bertalanffy curve. Three populations attained reproductive size at a minimum age of 3 yr, but at the <b>cold</b> <b>site</b> two specimens were shown to mature in 4 yr. We found no differences in juvenile growth rates in body size or bone zone width between juveniles of 1 to 3 yr of age from the 1941 warm site and the 2010 warm site. However, these traits appeared to be higher at these two warm sites than at the <b>cold</b> <b>site,</b> which is consistent with the climatic differences among the three localities. Our results suggest that higher temperatures positively affect growth, denoting that global warming might benefit H. darwini, especially the southern populations.

40|$|Drilling durin Deep Sea Drilling Project Legs 68, 69, and 70 on the {{southern}} limb of the Costa Rica Rift was used to study geothermal processes in the ocean crust. Two areas were drilled. One was a geothermally hot site on 6. 2 -m. y. -old crust, where topography is smooth, heat flow is close to that predicted by conductive cooling of the lithosphere (200 mWm**- 2), and hydrothermal circulation may be sealed within the crust. The other was on 3. 9 -m. y. -old crust, where rough topography is associated with low heat flow (15 to 50 mWm**- 2) and possible open convection of sea water. At both sites, about 250 m of siliceous-calcareous sediments overlies igneous basement. In the hot area, it blankets the topography, whereas in the cold area, basement outcrops still occur. Operations included numerous down-hole experiments in both areas and hydraulic piston coring of a 230 -m sediment section in the hot area. Diagenesis of the sediments appears closely related to temperature. At the hot site, chert was found near basement, and the chemistry of pore fluids, sampled from both sediments and basement, is strongly influenced by reactions within the basement. Strong lateral gradients {{in the composition of}} pore fluids occur in the sediments. At the <b>cold</b> <b>site,</b> no chert was found, and bacterial processes within the sediment dominated the chemistry of the pore fluids. Basaltic basement in both areas consists mainly of pillow lavas and thin flows, with occasional more massive units. The basalt is relatively magnesian. The degree of alteration is very small in the cold area, but much more extensive in the hot area. Ease of drilling also shows a strong contrast. Basement penetration reached 562 m in the hot area and was halted because of lack of time; at the <b>cold</b> <b>site,</b> 43 m of basement was cored only with difficulty. The most intensive in-hole experiments were conducted in the hot area. Successful runs with the borehole televiewer allowed basement lithology to be determined and showed the presence of more and less fractured zones. Pulse tests using a single borehole packer gave values of basement permeability of about 2 to 40 millidarcies. Numerous temperature logs established a broadly conductive in situ temperature gradient, with temperatures reaching 120 °C at 562 m into the basement. However, anomalously low temperatures in {{the upper part of the}} hole, which persisted after drilling disturbance had decayed away, showed that cold ocean water was flowing down the hole and into the basement at about 90 m below the base of the sediments, at rates of about 80 to 100 m/hr.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{reproductive}} cycle of two {{populations of the}} spotted snow skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus, over a three-year period. This species is widespread in Tasmania and its distribution overlaps those of other species in the genus that show two distinct reproductive strategies: annual reproduction that is completed within one season, and biennial reproduction in which females carry advanced embryos throughout winter hibernation. We chose populations representative of the climatic extremes of the species' distribution, within these areas of overlap. Niveoscincus ocellatus maintains the same basic reproductive strategy in both populations: summer gestation, primary autumn mating with obligate sperm storage by females, secondary mating in spring, and predominantly spring vitellogenesis and ovulation. In both populations all females reproduce annually, suggesting that reproductive frequency is not constrained by availability of energy. However, we found distinct differences in the timing of ovulation and parturition. Females from our subalpine site ovulated approximately one month later than those from our warmer, lowland site; parturition was delayed by the same period so gestation length was unchanged. The delay in ovulation results in gestation proceeding over the warmest months at the <b>cold</b> <b>site.</b> The annual reproductive cycle of this species appears to constrain its distribution to the lower altitudinal/climatic range of alpine Niveoscincus species. There were minor annual differences in the timing of reproductive events at each site, which we attribute to variation in thermal conditions {{and the amount of}} precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Winter air {{temperatures}} {{are projected to}} increase in the temperate zone, whereas snow cover is projected to decrease, leading to increased soil temperature variability, and potentially to changes in nutrient cycling. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of increased winter soil temperature variability on selected aspects of the N-cycle in mesocosms containing different plant community compositions. The experiment was replicated at two sites, a colder mountainous upland site with high snow accumulation and a warmer and drier lowland site. Increased soil temperature variability enhanced soil biotic activity for both sites during winter, as indicated by 35 % higher nitrogen (N) availability in the soil solution, 40 % higher belowground decomposition and a 25 % increase in the potential activity of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase. The mobilization of N differed between sites, and the 15 N signal in leaves was reduced by 31 % in response to winter warming pulses, but only at the <b>cold</b> <b>site,</b> with significant reductions occurring for three of four tested plant species at this site. Furthermore, there was a trend of increased N leaching {{in response to the}} recurrent winter warming pulses. Overall, projected winter climate change in the temperate zone, with less snow and more variable soil temperatures, appears important for shifts in ecosystem functioning (i. e. nutrient cycling). While the effects of warming pulses on plant N mobilization did not differ among sites, reduced plant 15 N incorporation at the colder temperate site suggests that frost damage may reduce plant N uptake in a warmer world, with important implications for nitrogen cycling and nitrogen losses from ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen oxides (NO x  = NO + NO 2) {{emissions}} from nitrate (NO 3 −) photolysis in snow affect the oxidising {{capacity of the}} lower troposphere especially in remote regions of the high latitudes with low pollution levels. The porous structure of snowpack allows the exchange of gases with the atmosphere driven by physicochemical processes, and hence, snow can act as both source and sink of atmospheric chemical trace gases. Current models are limited by poor process understanding and often require tuning parameters, for example the recently developed air-snow exchange model by Bock et al. (2016) requires an unrealistically large growth rate of snow grains to explain the NO 3 − peak in surface snow at Dome C in the summer. Here, two multi-phase physical models were developed from first principles constrained by observed atmospheric nitrate, HNO 3, to describe the air-snow interaction of nitrate. Similar {{to most of the}} previous approaches, the first model assumes that below a threshold temperature, T o, the air-snow grain interface is pure ice and above T o, a disordered interface (DI) emerges assumed to be covering the entire grain surface. The second model assumes that Air-Ice interactions dominate over the entire temperature range below melting and that only above the eutectic temperature, liquid is present in the form of micropockets in grooves. The models are validated with available year-round observations of nitrate in snow and air at a <b>cold</b> <b>site</b> on the Antarctica Plateau (Dome C, 75 ° 06 ′ S, 123 ° 33 ′ E, 3233  m a. s. l.) and at a relatively warm site on the Antarctica coast (Halley, 75 ° 35 ′ S, 26 ° 39 ′ E, 35  m a. s. l). The first model agrees reasonably well with observations at Dome C (C v (RMSE)  =  1. 34), but performs poorly at Halley (C v (RMSE)  =  89. 28) while the second model reproduces with good agreement observations at both sites without any tuning (C v (RMSE)  =  0. 84 at both sites). It is therefore suggested that air-snow interactions of nitrate in the winter are determined by non-equilibrium surface adsorption and co-condensation on ice coupled with solid-state diffusion inside the grain, similar to Bock et al. (2016). In summer, however, the air-snow exchange of nitrate is mainly driven by solvation into liquid micropockets following Henry’s law with contributions to total NO 3 − concentrations of 75  % and 80  % at Dome C and Halley respectively. It is also found that liquid volume of the snow grain and air-micropocket partitioning of HNO 3 are sensitive to total solute concentration and pH. In conclusion, the second model can be used to predict nitrate concentration in surface snow over the entire range of environ- mental conditions typical for Antarctica and forms a basis for parameterisations in regional or global atmospheric chemistry models...|$|E
