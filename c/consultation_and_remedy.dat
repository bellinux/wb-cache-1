40|$|Background Effective {{management}} of acne vulgaris {{in primary care}} involves support (usually provided {{over a number of}} <b>consultations)</b> <b>and</b> prescribing effective treatments. However, consulting and prescribing patterns for acne in primary care are not well described. Objective To describe the rate of primary care <b>consultations</b> <b>and</b> follow-up consultations; prescribing patterns, including overall use of acne related medications (ARM) and initial and follow-up prescribing, for acne vulgaris in the UK. Methods UK primary care acne <b>consultations</b> <b>and</b> prescriptions for ARMs were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to reframe the {{conceptual}} division between rights <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> by identifying those issues that are generally raised in the legal discourse when dealing with the two perspectives. The focus will be particularly on: policies that govern rights <b>and</b> <b>remedies,</b> judicial discretion, <b>and</b> judicial interpretation. While the traditional account based on a sharp opposition of rights <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> proved to be untrustworthy, the proposed conceptualization helps to outline the distinction in a more realistic way...|$|R
40|$|Many people seek individualised homeopathic treatment, however its use remains controversial. There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that any {{improvement of the}} symptoms of those seeking individualised homeopathic treatment is solely down to the time and attention given to the patient by the homeopath. This aim of this thesis is to explore the question “is homeopathic treatment involving a homeopathic <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> a homeopathic <b>remedy</b> any different to spending time with an empathetic practitioner, {{in the treatment of}} irritable bowel syndrome?” This study involved a systematic review of homeopathic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome and a randomised controlled trial comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening and usual care. The primary outcome measure was the change in irritable bowel symptom severity score at 26 weeks. Differences between the three arms were assessed using independent t-tests and ANCOVA. A qualitative study nested within the randomised controlled trial involved qualitative interviews with a proportion of the participants in both the homeopathic treatment and supportive listening arms. This was to explore participants’ experiences of the treatment they received, and what, if anything about the treatment they felt led to any improvements. The systematic review of homeopathic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome identified two eligible RCTs, a meta-analysis of the results of these trials indicated a benefit of homeopathic treatment over placebo. However the results of this review should be viewed with caution as it is possible that there was a degree of bias associated with these two trials. In the randomised controlled trial, {{no significant differences were found}} between homeopathic treatment and supportive listening, when using t-tests or ANCOVA to compare mean change in IBS-SSS between baseline and 26 weeks. The qualitative interviews identified four different typologies that explained what patients believed to have led to changes in their general health and/or irritable bowel symptoms...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{for the establishment}} of a public procurement complaints review <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> system is to enforce the practical application of substantive public procurement legislation. Such a system gives this legislation its “teeth”: the possibility of review <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> serves as a deterrent to breaking the law and thus encourages compliance. Moreover, violations of the law and genuine mistakes can be corrected. Therefore, a functioning public procurement review <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> system may ultimately contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the substantive rules, such as non-discrimination and equal treatment, transparency, and value for money. The public procurement review <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> systems of EU Member States need to comply with the requirements of European Community law: the EC Treaty, the EC Public Sector Remedies Directive 89 / 665 /EEC and the EC Utilities Remedies Directive 92 / 13 /EEC [...] . ...|$|R
