40|$|In this study, AlCrN {{coatings}} were deposited using modulated {{pulsed power}} magnetron sputtering (MPPMS) with different power pulse parameters by varying modulated pulsed power (MPP) <b>charge</b> <b>voltages</b> (350 to 550 V). The influence of power pulse parameters on the microstructure, mechanical properties and thermal {{stability of the}} coatings was investigated. The results indicated that all the AlCrN coatings exhibited a dense columnar microstructure. Higher <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> could facilitate a denser coating microstructure. As the <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> increased up to 450 V or higher, the microvoids along the column boundaries disappeared and the coatings became fully dense. The main phase in the AlCrN coatings was the c-(Al, Cr) N solid solution phase with NaCl-type phase structure. A diffraction peak of the h-AlN phase was detected at a 2 θ of around 33 °, when the <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> was higher than 500 V. The hardness of the AlCrN coatings varied {{as a function of}} <b>charge</b> <b>voltage.</b> The maximum value of the hardness (30. 8 GPa) was obtained at 450 V. All the coatings showed good thermal stability and maintained their structure and mechanical properties unchanged up to 800 °C during vacuum annealing. However, further increasing the annealing temperature to 1000 °C resulted in apparent change in the microstructure and decrease in the hardness. The <b>charge</b> <b>voltages</b> also showed a significant influence on the high-temperature tribological behavior of the coatings.

40|$|Solar energy, {{despite being}} inexhaustible, {{has a major}} shortcoming; it is intermittent. As a result, there's a need {{for it to be}} stored for later use. The widely used energy storage in {{photovoltaic}} system applications is the lead-acid battery and the knowledge of its state-of-charge (SOC) is important in effecting efficient control and energy management. However, SOC cannot be measured while the battery is connected to the system. This study adjusts and validates two estimation models: battery state-of-charge model using ampere-hour counting method and battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> model. For the battery state-of-charge model, the SOC is estimated by integrating the charge/discharge current over time while the battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristic response is modelled by using the equation-fit method which expresses the battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> variations by a 5 th order polynomial in terms of the state-of-charge and current. These models are realized using the MATLAB program. The battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> model is corrected for errors which may result from reduced <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> due to variation of solar radiation using the battery state-of-charge model. Moreover, the starting SOC needed in the state-of-charge model is estimated using the <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> model.

The results indicate that rated capacitance of a packed EDLC is valid only at frequencies lower than 0. 01 Hz at the rated <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> but the capacitance is lower for frequencies higher than 0. 01 Hz and for lower <b>charge</b> <b>voltages.</b> A conventional simple RC-equivalent circuit, consisting of a capacitor and a resistance in series, is inadequate for expressing EDLC frequency characteristics; therefore, a second-order RC equivalent circuit is used as a model for a packed EDLC. The <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> dependency in the frequency characteristics of packed EDLC is evaluated, based on this equivalent circuit. The parameters of the equivalent circuit and their <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> dependencies are evaluated from the results. The proposed packed EDLC model is validated by charge and discharge operations in an experimental circuit.

40|$|HPPMS {{has been}} used to sputter an ITO target under various conditions. The impact of <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> on target {{material}} ionization was studied in detail by time- and spatially-resolved optical emission spectroscopy. The ionization was found to increase dramatically with <b>charge</b> <b>voltage,</b> which also defines the maximum current density at the target. The ions are strongly focussed in the racetracks of the target while neutral species exhibit a broader distribution. By shortening the duration of the discharge pulses the transition of the glow discharge to an arc could be prevented. This effect was used to further increase the ionization effect. The higher <b>charge</b> <b>voltages</b> used also resulted in a faster ignition and ionization onset. When examining the time evolution of the emission of the individual species a saturation was observed during the individual pulse for neutral indium, despite the target current changing dramatically during the pulse. This effect is still not understood. In order to study the effect on film growth, ITO films were deposited on unheated substrates at various <b>charge</b> <b>voltages.</b> The film growth was found to be more oxygen dominated at higher <b>charge</b> <b>voltages</b> due to the ionization affecting mainly indium...|$|R

Applications that once were thought to require higher voltages, such as electrical power steering, have now been achieved with 12 volt systems. [...] 42-volt electrical components are now used in only a few automotive applications, since incandescent light bulbs work well at 12 volts and switching of a 42-volt circuit is more difficult.|$|E

40|$|The AMRL flyer {{sensitivity}} test apparatus (FSTA) uses the electric gun technique to accelerate 50 pm thick plastic flyer plates of about 3. 5 mm in diameter to high velocity.

5000|$|The circuit {{generates a}} {{high-voltage}} pulse by charging {{a number of}} capacitors in parallel, then suddenly connecting them in series. See the circuit above. At first, n capacitors (C) are charged in parallel to a voltage VC by a high-voltage DC power supply through the resistors (RC). The spark gaps used as switches have the voltage VC across them, but the gaps have a breakdown voltage greater than VC, so they all behave as open circuits while the capacitors charge. The last gap isolates {{the output of the}} generator from the load; without that gap, the load would prevent the capacitors from charging. To create the output pulse, the first spark gap is caused to break down (triggered); the breakdown effectively shorts the gap, placing the first two capacitors in series, applying a voltage of about 2VC across the second spark gap. [...] Consequently, the second gap breaks down to add the third capacitor to the [...] "stack", and the process continues to sequentially break down all of the gaps. The last gap connects the output of the series [...] "stack" [...] of capacitors to the load. Ideally, the output voltage will be nVC, the number of capacitors times the <b>charging</b> <b>voltage,</b> but in practice the value is less. Note that none of the charging resistors Rc are subjected to more than the <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> even when the capacitors have been erected. The charge available is limited to the charge on the capacitors, so the output is a brief pulse as the capacitors discharge through the load (and charging resistors). At some point, the spark gaps stop conducting, and the high-voltage supply begins charging the capacitors again.|$|E
50|$|IUoU battery {{charging}} is a three-stage charging procedure for lead-acid batteries. A lead-acid battery's theoretical voltage is 2 V for one cell. For a single cell, the voltage {{can range from}} 1.8 V loaded at full discharge, to 2.10 V in an open circuit at full charge. Float voltage varies depending on battery type, i.e. flooded cells, gelled electrolyte, absorbed glass mat (AGM), and ranges from 1.8 V to 2.27 V. Equalization voltage, and <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> for sulfated cells, can range from 2.67 V to almost 3 V. (only until a charge current is flowing) Specific values for a given battery depend on the design and manufacturer recommendations, and are usually given at a baseline temperature of 20 C, requiring adjustment for ambient conditions.|$|E
50|$|In these DC-to-DC converters, {{energy is}} {{periodically}} stored within and {{released from a}} magnetic field in an inductor or a transformer, typically within a frequency range of 300 kHz to 10 MHz. By adjusting the duty cycle of the <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> (that is, {{the ratio of the}} on/off times), the amount of power transferred to a load can be more easily controlled, though this control can also be applied to the input current, the output current, or to maintain constant power. Transformer-based converters may provide isolation between input and output. In general, the term DC-to-DC converter refers to one of these switching converters. These circuits are the heart of a switched-mode power supply. Many topologies exist. This table shows the most common ones.|$|E

At 300 °C state-of-the-art ITO films are obtained by DC sputtering for-optimized oxygen flow using a shielding.

50|$|This {{has become}} popular {{even in the}} {{cheapest}} UPSs because it takes advantage of components already included. The main 50/60 Hz transformer used to convert between line voltage and battery voltage needs to provide two slightly different turns ratios: One to convert the battery output voltage (typically a multiple of 12 V) to line voltage, and a second one to convert the line voltage to a slightly higher battery <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> (such as a multiple of 14 V). The {{difference between the two}} voltages is because charging a battery requires a delta voltage (up to 13-14 V for charging a 12 V battery). Furthermore, it is easier to do the switching on the line-voltage side of the transformer because of the lower currents on that side.|$|E
5000|$|Motorists {{and service}} garages often have {{portable}} battery chargers operated from AC power.

Battery chargers may be strictly manual, or may include controls for time and <b>charging</b> <b>voltage.</b> Battery chargers that apply high voltage (for example, more than 14.4 volts on a 12 volt nominal system) will result in emission of hydrogen gas from the battery, which may damage it or create an explosion risk.

50|$|The temperature-change {{method is}} similar in {{principle}} to the ΔV method. Because the <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> is nearly constant, constant-current charging delivers energy at a near-constant rate. When the cell is not fully charged, most of this energy is converted to chemical energy. However, when the cell reaches full charge, most of the charging energy is converted to heat. This increases {{the rate of change}} of battery temperature, which can be detected by a sensor such as a thermistor. Both Panasonic and Duracell suggest a maximal rate of temperature increase of 1 °C per minute. Using a temperature sensor allows an absolute temperature cutoff, which Duracell suggests at 60 °C. With both the ΔT and the ΔV charging methods, both manufacturers recommend a further period of trickle charging to follow the initial rapid charge.|$|E

5000|$|Consider {{a battery}} {{that has been}} {{completely}} discharged (such as occurs when leaving the car lights on overnight, a current draw of about 6 amps). If it then is given a fast charge {{for only a few}} minutes, the battery plates charge only near the interface between the plates and the electrolyte. In this case the battery voltage might rise to a value near that of the charger voltage; this causes the charging current to decrease significantly. After a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte; this leads to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start the car. [...] As long as the <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> stays below the gassing voltage (about 14.4 volts in a normal lead-acid battery), battery damage is unlikely, and in time the battery should return to a nominally charged state.|$|E
