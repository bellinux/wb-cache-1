5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{estimation}} method for ships on <b>collision</b> <b>courses</b> taking crash astern maneuvers {{based on a}} new potential area of water (PAW) for maneuvering. A crash astern maneuver is an emergency option a ship can take when exposed {{to the risk of}} a collision with other ships that have lost control. However, lateral forces and yaw moments exerted by the reversing propeller, as well as the uncertainty of the initial speed and initial yaw rate, will move the ship out of the intended stopping position landing it in a dangerous area. A new PAW for crash astern maneuvers is thus introduced. The PAW is developed based on a probability density function of the initial yaw rate. Distributions of the yaw rates and speeds are analyzed from automatic identification system (AIS) data in Madura Strait, and estimated paths of the maneuvers are simulated using a mathematical maneuvering group model...|$|R
5|$|Warning from Space {{influenced}} Toho's Gorath, a 1963 film which {{depicts a}} rogue planet on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Earth. The planet Paira in Warning from Space {{may have been}} an influence in the later Daiei film Gamera vs. Guiron, which features the planet Terra, another planet on the opposite of Earth's orbit. Critics have also noted plot similarities to the later Toho film Invasion of Astro-Monster, in that a friendly planet warns Japan of the atom bomb and subsequently assists in celestial defense.

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when they saw that {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it {{as the beginning of}} a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E

A mix of seven intruder aircraft, ranging from a sailplane to a high-speed jet, flew 20 scenarios over a four-day period, one or two aircraft at a time. In each case, the radar picked up the intruding aircraft at ranges from 2.5 to 6.5 mi, depending on the intruder's radar signature.

As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics.

5|$|In {{the year}} 2001, {{the space station}} Silicon Valley was launched, housing {{numerous}} animals. Seven minutes after its launch, it vanished. Believed to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation. Following this, the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station's technology, resulting in animals such as an electronically-powered fox with motorised wheels, and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Evo sets out to fix the control station, which is on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> with Earth. Upon arriving at the control room, Evo confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals. The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth, but is quickly defeated by Evo. Despite this, Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control; it collides with Earth, landing in New York Harbor. The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City, and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet.|$|E

40|$|Surrogate safety {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of diagnosing road safety indirectly from measures of ordinary (non-collision) road user behaviour, such as absolute speed and time-to-collision. While absolute speed has enjoyed much popularity in the literature, other measures such as time-to-collision are currently under developed. Before conflict measures such as time-to-collision can be adopted, several challenges need to be overcome, notably the problem of accurately modeling <b>collision</b> <b>courses</b> and <b>collision</b> probability from normal road user behaviour. This paper describes and explores the feasibility of implementing discretized motion pattern maps for the purpose of predicting potential collisions between road users and their measures based on an empirical naturalistic behaviour model calibrated from site-specific data for use in surrogate {{safety analysis}}. The methodology is applied to a pre-existing framework which extracts road user trajectory data from video data of a traffic scene, and then predicts and estimates potential collisions. To this end, this paper examines the motion pattern model discretization process, the probabilistic framework, the resulting indicators, and then compares the motion prediction methodology with that of th...|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance.

A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a <b>collision</b> <b>course,</b> which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E
