40|$|The 2008 {{version of}} the SNA has {{recommended}} <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> R&D <b>expenditures.</b> To implement this recommendation, we need to determine the depreciation rate of R&D capital. In this paper, we develop a simple model, based on a production function method that allows for monopolistic competition, to estimate the annual depreciation rate of R&D capital. We treat R&D capital as a technology shifter instead of as an explicit input factor. Both the R&D stock and the time variable are used to capture technological progress. Estimated R&D depreciation rates and markup factors are presented for the U. S. manufacturing sector and four U. S. knowledge-intensive industries. ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{accounting}} {{measurement and}} reporting system is ill-equipped to provide intangible investment {{information that is}} decision useful for stakeholders in the information economy. Potentially relevant intangible items are not reported on the balance sheet, since current standards mandate the immediate expensing of these intangible items. Presumably FASB 2 ̆ 7 s uncertainty with the fundamental issues of extent and timing of future benefits to the firm has led to concerns with relevance, reliability, and objectivity of capitalizing some intangibles, which results in potential long term value generating expenditures being immediately expensed on the income statement. Prior research has demonstrated extent and timing of some income statement intangibles, such as advertising and research and development, however the potential value of IT intangibles as an asset has not been investigated. This dissertation addresses issues on the accounting treatment for information technology (IT) expenditures and includes two parts. The first part contains an essay discussing the business value <b>of</b> IT <b>expenditures</b> using a rational economic argument to propose the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> IT <b>expenditures</b> as an appropriate accounting treatment. The second part is composed of an essay that proposes statistically reliable amortization rates for intangible IT expenditures followed by a value analysis of the proposed accounting treatment. This dissertation provides information about the business value of capitalized information technology.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} a firm’s information disclosure decision and three markets: the product market, the takeover market, and the labor market, and the impact on firms’ real decisions. Chapter 1 provides an introduction and overview of this thesis. Chapter 2 considers a product-market competition setting through which to examine firms’ investments in explorative initiatives and their choices <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> method regarding exploration related <b>expenditures.</b> The <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> exploration <b>expenditures</b> may contain information on whether a firm’s exploration investment is successful, which may then incur imitative behavior from competitors (the information spillover effect), or intimidate competitors from investing (the pre-empting effect). These two effects are driving forces that induce firms to choose different capitalization methods. I find that if regulators require firms to capitalize only <b>expenditures</b> <b>of</b> successful explorations, firms may increase innovation. This study sheds light on the real effect that recognition of exploratory success has on firms’ exploration investments. Chapter 3 considers a setup in which the takeover market plays a disciplinary role in replacing an inefficient incumbent manager to increase firm value. We show that increasing the information quality improves takeover efficiency, but more precise information induces frequent managerial turnover and discourages the manager from working hard. We find that a perfectly informative accounting system is never optimal. Moreover, current shareholders prefer even higher information quality {{in the presence of}} antitakeover laws or provisions, since in such cases, motivating a raider to bid is particularly important for current shareholders. Chapter 4 examines shareholder decisions on innovative investments and information quality in the presence of managerial career concerns. Managers’ reputation concerns are costly to shareholders because managers must be compensated for taking career risks. I show that shareholders face a tradeoff when determining the information quality: lowering the information quality can mitigate a manager’s career risk; however, it also hinders motivating managerial effort. I find that for higher managerial career concerns, shareholders with intense innovation urgency invest more in innovation and lower the information quality to protect the manager from exposure. In contrast, shareholders with lower levels of innovation urgency invest less to mitigate managerial career risk while increasing the compensation incentive to motivate higher managerial effort. My results shed light on the effects of career concerns on innovative investment, disclosure policy, and compensation incentives...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{financial}} disclosure vis-á-vis economic reality of research and development (R&D) expensed by Australian firms under the pre- 2005 Australian generally accepted accounting principles (A-GAAP) regime via the lens of market-to-book. Design/methodology/approach – The authors estimated firms' R&D profit rate, measured R&D revenue intensity and modelled the impacts of these and related economic factors, via economic and financial disclosure channels, on market-to-book using data for 1988 - 2004. Findings – R&D, on average, was profit neutral and had undetectable impacts on market-to-book whether via equity valuation or financial disclosure. Research limitations/implications – Market-to-book's information content is best viewed as conditional on the reference disclosure regime. Australian firms' typically at best minimal R&D profitability is an international anomaly. Data limitations in terms of the generating process and availability mean that R&D's impact on market-to-book via financial reporting is not definitively determined. Practical implications – Restrictive rules on the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> intangible asset-related <b>expenditures</b> under A-GAAP apparently did not adversely impact market-to-book's economic information. AIFRS's more permissive rule risks compromising market-to-book's reliability in such a role. Originality/value – For Australia, the paper is anticipated to be the first to estimate the profit rate of R&D, measure the intensity of R&D, and model R&D's influence on the market-to-book ratio. It develops a framework for the economic and financial reporting impacts of investments on a key indicator of firms' financial standing and contributes to the debate on identifiable intangibles' disclosure.
