5|$|In mathematics, {{the polar}} <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is a {{two-dimensional}} <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> {{in which each}} point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.|$|E
5|$|In On Spirals, Archimedes {{describes}} the Archimedean spiral, a function whose radius {{depends on the}} angle. The Greek work, however, did not extend to a full <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> (The <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E

We use maximal Abelian subgroups to generate <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> with a maximal number of ignorable variables. The results are presented (also graphically) in terms of subgroup chains. Finally, the explicit solutions of the Schrődinger equation in the separable <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> are computed. ...|$|R
50|$|In geodesy, {{conversion}} {{among different}} geographic <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> is made necessary by the different geographic <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> in use {{across the world}} and over time. Coordinate conversion comprises {{a number of different}} types of conversion: format change of geographic coordinates, conversion of <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems,</b> or transformation to different geodetic datums. Geographic coordinate conversion has applications in cartography, surveying, navigation and geographic information systems.|$|R
5|$|There are, in addition, {{matrices}} {{that effect}} Lorentz boosts. These {{can be thought}} of, in the passive view, as (instantly!) giving the <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> (and with it the observer) a velocity in a chosen direction.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this <b>coordinate</b> <b>system,</b> the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E

5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a Cartesian <b>coordinate</b> <b>system)</b> is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{longitudinal}} {{coordinate systems}} in use for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> in 1997 based on Hubble photos, {{with the prime}} meridian running {{through the center of}} Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a <b>coordinate</b> <b>system,</b> correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the <b>{{coordinate}}</b> <b>system</b> in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E

5|$|On 11 July 2011, Neptune {{completed}} its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, {{although it did}} not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because of {{the motion of the}} Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.|$|E
5|$|With dive tables, it is {{generally}} assumed that the dive profile is a square dive, meaning that the diver descends to maximum depth immediately and stays at the same depth until resurfacing (approximating a rectangular outline when drawn in a <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> where one axis is depth {{and the other is}} duration). Some dive tables also assume physical condition or acceptance of a specific level of risk from the diver. Some recreational tables only provide for no-stop dives at sea level sites, but the more complete tables can take into account staged decompression dives and dives performed at altitude.|$|E
5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Celestial <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> most {{commonly}} used in astronomy are equatorial coordinates and ecliptic coordinates. These are defined relative to the (moving) vernal equinox position, which itself {{is determined by the}} orientations of the Earth's rotation axis and orbit around the Sun. Their orientations vary (though slowly, e.g. due to precession), and there is an infinity of such <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> possible. Thus the <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> most used in astronomy need their own date-reference because the <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> of that type are themselves in motion, e.g. by the precession of the equinoxes, nowadays often resolved into precessional components, separate precessions of the equator and of the ecliptic.|$|R

5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar coordinates {{as part of a}} formal <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar Coordinates. Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{universality}} of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion {{under the influence of}} the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry. However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> In this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

Just as the two-dimensional Cartesian <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional spherical <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is useful {{on the surface of}} a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored.
