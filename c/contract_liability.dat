40|$|In Holding Health Care Accountable, E.

This difficulty is compounded by political arrangements that foist under-funded mandates for disaster services on healthcare providers.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe that}} notions of fault should and do pervade contract doctrine. Notwithstanding the normative and positive arguments {{in favor of}} a fault-based analysis of particular contract doctrines, I argue that <b>contract</b> <b>liability</b> is strict liability at its core.

I offer two complementary normative justifications for contract law 2 ̆ 7 s stubborn resistance to consider fault in either of these instances. First, I argue that there are unappreciated ways in which courts 2 ̆ 7 adherence to strict liability doctrine at the core of contract reduces contracting costs. In addition, I argue that a strict liability core best supports parties 2 ̆ 7 efforts to access informal or relational modes of contracting, especially where key information is unverifiable...|$|E

40|$|Contractual {{liability}} proponents {{claim that}} states can best reform malpractice liability by allowing patients to contract over, and out of, liability. Proponents assert that informed patients {{would be better}} off if allowed to <b>contract</b> over <b>liability</b> than they would if states reformed malpractice liability directly because informed patients would contract for the rules that maximize their welfare. Proponents also claim states reforming malpractice liability could only benefit patients by including a right to <b>contract</b> out of <b>liability.</b> This article demonstrates that these claims are incorrect. Proponents’ faith in informed contracting rests on the incorrect premise that patients obtain the same net benefit from <b>liability</b> imposed by <b>contract</b> as from malpractice liability imposed by the state. Patients who benefit from the deterrence that malpractice liability provides are worse off if required to <b>contract</b> over <b>liability</b> because contractual liability is a fundamentally different, less beneficial, form of liability. Contractual liability is less beneficial and more costly than state-imposed malpractice liability because it is plagued by four inefficiencies: Collective goods, time inconsistency, adverse selection, and network externality problems. Thus, far from expanding choices, the move to contractual liability could hurt patients by forcing them into a form of liability that is both less valuable and more expensive, thereby creating inefficient, welfare-reducing, incentives to waive the right to impose <b>liability</b> by <b>contract</b> for patients who would have benefited from state-imposed liability. This conclusion holds whether patients negotiate <b>liability</b> <b>contracts</b> directly with individual physicians or accept standard form <b>contracts</b> governing malpractice <b>liability</b> offered by their health insurers...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{describes}} a jurisprudential puzzle—what I call {{the puzzle of}} the beneficiary’s bargain—and contends that adequately resolving this puzzle will require significant revisions to basic premises of contract law. The puzzle arises when one party enters into two contracts requiring the same performance, and the promisee of the second contract is the third-party beneficiary of the first. For example, a taxi driver contracts with a woman to transport her parents from the airport next week, and then the driver separately enters {{a contract with the}} parents to transport them when the time comes. Is the second contract valid and enforceable, or does it fail for lack of consideration? This specific question—on which courts have split—implicates several important contract law doctrines. Moreover, it highlights a deep tension in our modern understanding of contractual obligation. This Article argues that adequately resolving the puzzle necessitates a general reconsideration of the relationship between rights and liability in contract law. Surprisingly, the best solution requires abandoning the foundational understanding that <b>contract</b> <b>liability</b> arises out of breach of a promisee’s right to performance. The puzzle thus offers a lens through which to examine—and even revise—the central concepts of modern contract law...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reconsider the {{theoretical}} foundations of the liability of a principal to third parties in contract. In order to reconcile the extended liability of the principal for unpermitted contracts of his agent beyond traditional apparent authority, the treatise writers have created new generalized concepts. The conclusion of this study is that new conceptual generalizations to advance the theoretical framework of the law of principal 2 ̆ 7 s liability in contract are not only unnecessary but misleading. The basis of this conclusion is that new concepts with more general and indeterminate content than the older ones seem to be created to rationalize the imposition of <b>contract</b> <b>liability</b> with little or no recognition of the primary rule that both contract and estoppel to deny contract in agency are based on manifestations of consent by the principal. A valid operational or functional analysis of the principal 2 ̆ 7 s liability in contract in each case can be made by utilizing the traditional concepts of authority and estoppel. The structural elements of such a functional theory of agency contracts are suggested in this review of leading English and American decisions...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has provided}} an attractive model for business service delivery. However, accountability aspects, mainly the {{monitoring of the}} execution of a service <b>contract,</b> <b>liability</b> assignment and dispute arbitration are still lacking. On the one hand, the traditional centralized monitoring and the trusted-third party (TTP) based arbitration solutions are not suitable for the distributed cloud environment. On the other hand, a decentralized solution also faces challenges in guaranteeing fairness, accuracy and sustainability. To address this issue, this paper firstly proposes an innovative service contract management scheme that facilitates the monitoring of the execution of a service contract in a peer-to-peer environment, inspired by the concept of blockchain in Bitcoin. Secondly, {{on top of the}} scheme it presents a novel dispute resolution protocol based on the Byzantine agreement and the commitment scheme. Thirdly, it identifies the optimal settings of the key parameters of the protocol through a set of experiments and scenario analysis, aiming to strike the balance of fairness, accuracy, incentive maximization for the honest arbiters and cost minimization for the overall arbitration process. With this approach, service participants can be held accountable in a truly distributed environment without the presence of a central authority, which increases businesses confidence on adopting cloud services. 8 page(s...|$|E

In contrast to laissez-faire, which by the 1930s had been observed to give rise to cartels and an undue concentration of power, ordoliberalism aims to put limits on the economic power of individuals, companies and associations. This is achieved through a legal and institutional framework, including maintenance of private property, enforcement of private <b>contracts,</b> <b>liability,</b> free entry to markets, and monetary stabilization. In this, the state should refrain from directing or intervening in the economic processes of daily practices, as in a centrally planned economy, but rather provide a well-functioning competitive Ordnung (order) in which private agents can act without frequent discretionary influence from the state.|$|R

In few other fields of law has Corbin 2 ̆ 7 s advice to treat rules of law as 2 ̆ 2 tentative working rules 2 ̆ 2 been more heeded. Continuously and relentlessly our law has expanded contract and tort liability so as to satisfy public needs. Classical contract theory has undergone profound modifications in response to drastic changes {{in the structure of the}} distribution process. Our sales law and particularly the law of warranties likewise has changed. Where <b>contract</b> <b>liability</b> has been regarded as inadequate, it has been supplemented by tort law. There is an ever increasing tendency to permit the consumer injured by defective goods or services to reach the producer directly, if not with the help of contract law, then with the help of a revised law of torts. Not only has the decline of the rules of privity permitted the consumer to reach the producer, but product liability, in contrast to the tenets of classical tort law, is straining away from negligence. In a fascinating blending of tort and contract law, product liability increasingly is becoming strict liability. A theory of enterprise liability has emerged, frequently based on vague and unanalyzed notions of public policy and economics...|$|E

40|$|Commissioned by the European Parliament’s Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs at {{the request}} of the JURI committee, this study {{provides}} an analysis of the potential legal impact of the introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles on rules of private international law determining jurisdiction and applicable law in the EU Member States in the event of a cross-border traffic accident. Following a case-studies approach, it makes a number of recommendations to improve the legal framework. In line with recent EU law trends towards enhanced protection for the victims and given that products liability is likely to gain more importance in the area, the study suggests the introduction of a duty for car manufacturers to <b>contract</b> <b>liability</b> insurance covering traffic accidents victims; the possibility of a direct action against a manufacturer’s liability insurer and the establishment of a forum at the domicile of the victim for claims against manufacturers of cars using new technologies. In order to increase legal certainty, the study recommends to redefine the respective scopes of application of the two systems of private international law currently coexisting in the EU to determine the law applicable (the Rome II Regulation and the 1971 and 1973 Hague Conventions), and to apply Rome II in cases in which both the claimant and the defendant are domiciled in EU Member States. Finally, autonomous technologies may increase the difficulty to initiate extra-contractual liability claims therefore the study proposes that limitation periods be extended at the substantive law level or that a cumulative connecting mechanism be introduced at private international level for the benefit of the victims...|$|E
