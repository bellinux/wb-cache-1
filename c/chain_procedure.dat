These moves must only satisfy a basic condition ofbalance in order equilibrium be properly described, but detailed balance, a stronger condition,is usually imposed when designing new algorithms. An additional advantage is that some systems, such as the Ising model, lack a dynamical description and are only defined by an energy prescription; for these the Monte Carlo approach is the only one feasible.|$|E

Recent research {{has examined the}} possibility that ARBs {{may be the result}} of neurological change, brought about by environmentally induced, chronic under stimulation. The studies have typically correlated behavioural data from affected species with existing lesion studies and neuropsychological data. Results from these studies have shown that ARB animals appear to show signs of reduced response inhibition and perseveration, similar to animals with lesions on the striatum (putamen and caudate nucleus of basal ganglia). Many of the studies supporting this have used extinction procedures as measures of perseveration. However, many are methodologically weak. In view of this we are currently exploring ARB horses using concurrent chain schedules.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} Markov chain Monte Carlo search procedures, leading to more powerful optimization methods than simulated annealing. The main idea is to embed deterministic local search techniques into stochastic algorithms.

We test these procedures {{in the case of the}} Traveling Salesman Problem. The embedded local searches we use are 3 -opt and Lin-Kernighan. The large change or step consists of a special kind of 4 -change followed by local-opt minimization. We test this algorithm on a number of instances.

40|$|The resource-constrained project {{scheduling}} problem with minimum and maximum time lags (RCPSP/max) {{is a general}} model for resource scheduling in many real-world problems (such as manufacturing and construction engineering). We consider RCPSP/max problems where the durations of activities are stochastic and resources can have unforeseen breakdowns. Given a level of allowable risk, (Formula presented.), our mechanisms aim to compute the minimum robust makespan execution strategy. Robust makespan for an execution strategy is any makespan value that has a risk less than (Formula presented.). The risk for a makespan value, (Formula presented.) given an execution strategy, is {{the probability that a}} schedule instantiated from the execution strategy will not finish before (Formula presented.) given the uncertainty over durations and resources. We make three key contributions: (a) firstly, we provide an analytical evaluation of resource breakdowns and repairs on executions of activities; (b) we then incorporate such information into a local search framework and generate execution strategies that can absorb resource and durational uncertainties; and (c) finally, to improve robustness of resulting strategies, we propose resource breakdown aware <b>chaining</b> <b>procedure</b> with three different metrics. This <b>chaining</b> <b>procedure</b> computes resource allocations by predicting the effect of breakdowns on robustness of generated strategies.

In this thesis we research robustness in Partial Order Schedules, which represent sets of solutions for instances of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem.

We use an empirical method to gain understanding of robustness and how the <b>chaining</b> <b>procedure</b> adds to this.

The present study investigated the social mechanism of the transmission of superstitious behavior in an experiment that utilized participant replacement. The sample was composed {{of a total of}} 38 participants. Participants performed a task on a computer: they could click a colored rectangle using the mouse. When the rectangle was in a particular color, the participants received points independently of their behavior (variable time schedule). When the color of the rectangle was changed, no points were presented (extinction). Under an Individual Exposure condition, ten participants worked alone on the task. Other participants were exposed to the same experimental task under a Social Exposure condition, in which each participant first learned by observation and then worked on the task in a participant replacement (<b>chain)</b> <b>procedure.</b> The first participant in each chain in the Social Exposure condition was a confederate who worked on the task “superstitiously,” clicking the rectangle when points were presented. Superstitious responding was transmitted because of the behavior of the confederate. This also influenced estimates of personal control. These findings suggest that social learning can facilitate the acquisition and maintenance of superstitious behavior and the illusion of control. Our data also suggest that superstitious behavior and the illusion of control may involve similar learning principles.|$|E

Our main motivation is the construction of estimation framework and algorithm which can be applied to short sequences of complex and highly-dimensional images.
