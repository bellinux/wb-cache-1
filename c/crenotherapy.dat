40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} <b>crenotherapy</b> on major mucosal markers of inflammation, TNF alpha, human beta-defensins 2 (hBD- 2), and calprotectin, are largely {{unexplored}} in pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of <b>crenotherapy</b> with sulfate-sodium-chloride water on mucosal markers of inflammation in children with CRS. Methods: Children with CRS received 15 -day <b>crenotherapy</b> consisting of sulfate-sodium-chloride thermal water inhalations by nasal aerosol (15 minutes/day). Concentrations of nasal mucosal markers of inflammation (TNF alpha, hBD- 2, and calprotectin) were measured before and after <b>crenotherapy.</b> Presence of specific symptoms (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain, sense of smell, and cough), value of symptoms score sino-nasal 5 (SN 5), quality of life (QoL) score (1 [worse] to 10 [optimal]) were also assessed. Results: After <b>crenotherapy</b> a significant reduction was observed in TNF alpha (from 0. 14 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 08 +/- 0. 01; p < 0. 001), calprotectin (from 2. 9 +/- 1. 0 to 1. 9 +/- 0. 5; p < 9. 001), and hBD- 2 (from 2. 0 +/- 0. 1 to 0. 9 +/- 0. 6; p < 0. 001) concentrations. A significant (p < 0. 05) reduction in number of subjects presenting symptoms of nasal obstruction (100 % versus 40 %), nasal discharge (33 % versus 13 %), facial pain (30 % versus 10 %), and sense of smell (60 % versus 20 %) was observed. A significant improvement of SN 5 (from 3. 07 +/- 0. 76 to 2. 08 +/- 0. 42; p < 0. 001) was observed after the <b>crenotherapy.</b> QoL also improved after <b>crenotherapy</b> (from 4. 2 +/- 1. 1 to 6. 6 +/- 1. 0; p < 0. 001). Conclusion: <b>Crenotherapy</b> induced a down-regulation of nasal mucosal inflammatory mediators in children with CRS.

40|$|Muscular {{architecture}} {{involves the}} organization of fibres in the muscle {{and is one of}} the most important factors of muscular function. Studies have demonstrated an association with muscular architecture and contraction, with an increase of the pen nation angle in muscles. The aim of the study was to evaluate the change of muscular pennation angle after therapy with warm thermal water (<b>crenotherapy).</b> Participants: 45 amateur athletes undertaking different sporting activities; Group A: 30 runners; Group B: 15 swimmers. All the athletes underwent muscular ultrasound and clinical examination before and after the 10 sessions of the thermal protocol. At baseline the groups showed different values of pen nation angle (group A = 19. 1 ° ± 3. 8 ° vs group B = 16. 7 ° ± 2. 4 °; p= 0. 05). Following the thermal therapy protocol, significant variation of pennation angle was detected at rest in Group A which had significantly lower values than before the treatment (17. 5 ° ± 2. 9 °; p= 0. 01). No differences were detected in group B. Conclusions: thermal therapy induced the greatest effect on runners (Group A) as pen nation angle at rest was significantly lower after the period of <b>crenotherapy</b> and this variation may be as a result of a smaller muscular contracture...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Aim of the {{research}} was the demonstration of the efficacy of thermal water vs saline in the recurrent and chronic nasosinusal pathologies treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 patients randomized into 2 groups of 60 subjects each, all affected by recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis with/without I degree nasal polyposis. At the beginning {{and at the end}} of the study, in all the subjects the clinical history, objective examination and the instrumental analysis of nasal functions by active anterior rhinometry, acustic rhinometry, nasal mucociliary transport time determination and nasal mucosa scraping were performed. Patients of the study group underwent <b>crenotherapy</b> treatment (vapour inhalation, aerosol and nasal douching) with thermal water for 14 days at Salsomaggiore Thermal baths. Other patients underwent nasal douching and aerosol with saline twice a day for 14 days at the Rhinologic Centre of the ENT Clinic of Siena University. RESULTS: At the end of the study, only the patients undergone to crenothrapic treatment with salt-bromine-iodic water showed a significant improvement of nasal obstruction, rinorrea and number of nocturnal arousals. The improvement, even if present, was not significant in the control group. Same positive variations were observed concerning nasal mucosa congestion, nasal secretion and mucociliary transport time reaching the significance in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Crenotherapy</b> with salt-bromine-iodic water should be considered as efficacious therapeutic tool in the management of chronic and recurrent rhinosinusitis...|$|E
40|$|Thermalism in Italy is {{widespread}} and very popular, {{due to the}} hydro geological features of its territory rich in thermal springs and with a long historical tradition. However, it has not achieved a well-deserved placement in medical treatment, according to evidence-based medicine. A rational scientific intervention, based on guidelines, should be applied. One that, on the one hand, can assign this medical aid its right placement in medicine and, on the other hand, can identify pathologies, other than those already covered by the national health service, that may obtain long lasting benefits.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} in order to evaluate: (1) {{the influence of a}} bicarbonate-alkaline mineral water (Uliveto) on digestive symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia; (2) the effects of Uliveto on preclinical models of gastric functions. Selected patients complained of dyspeptic symptoms in the absence of digestive lesions or Helicobacter pylori infection within the previous 3 months. They were treated with Uliveto water (1. 5 l day(- 1)) for 30 days. Frequency and severity of symptoms were assessed at baseline and day 30 by a score system. Preclinical experiments were carried out on rats, allowed to drink Uliveto or oligomineral water for 30 days. Animals then underwent pylorus ligation to evaluate gastric secretion of acid, pepsinogen, and mucus. In separate experiments, gastric emptying was assessed. <b>Crenotherapy</b> was associated with a relief of epigastric pain, retrosternal pyrosis, postprandial fullness and gastric distention. At preclinical level, Uliveto water increased acid and pepsinogen secretions as well as gastric emptying, without changes in bound mucus. The enhancing actions of Uliveto on gastric secretions and emptying were prevented by L- 365, 260, an antagonist of gastrin/CCK- 2 receptors. These findings indicate that a regular intake of Uliveto favors an improvement of dyspeptic symptoms. The preclinical study suggests that the clinical actions of Uliveto water depend mainly on its ability to enhance gastric motor and secretory functions...|$|E

40|$|The Băile Boghiş {{resort in}} Sălaj county is {{situated}} in the Barcău depression, at 15 km distance from Şimleu Silvaniei, in a sedative-indifferent climate of hills, {{at an altitude of}} 300 m, without excessive temperatures, with a mean annual rainfall of 650 mm. The first evidence of the climate and thermal mineral waters of the resort dates back to the 18 th century. The Nuşfalău-Boghiş thermal mineral water reservoir is confined to deep permeable aquiferous layers that correspond to the altered zone of crystalline basement and sedimentary formations of Miocene and Pliocene age. It is an all-season spa and climatic resort; the bicarbonate, sodium, sulfur, iodine hypotonic hyperthermal mineral springs (with a total mineralization of 1016. 2 - 1432. 8 mg/l) come from hydrogeological wells, producing over 1900 m 3 /day waters with a temperature of 40 - 42 ˚C. The spa has 2 outdoor pools (in summer time), bathtubs (in the process of being rehabilitated) and an indoor pool. The peat mud from Stoboru (Cuzăplac commune) is another therapeutic factor used in the resort. Therapeutic indications are related to the following disorders: osteoarticular system diseases, abarticular and degenerative rheumatic diseases, posttraumatic, peripheral neurological, gynecological, endocrine, nutrition and metabolic disorders, treated by external use (pool or bathtubs), while cooled water is used for <b>crenotherapy.</b> A specific feature is that thermal water, which has a temperature of 40 - 42 ˚C, can be used without being successively cooled or heated in pools or bathtubs, which allows to maintain its initial qualities. This paper includes early and recent data on a resort that is progressing from a local level to the national circuit, having an important extension potential...|$|E
40|$|Passage from classic {{myths of}} the {{creation}} to rationality doesn’t exclude the persistence of consecrated aspects coexisting with the observation medicine. At least until XIX century, medicine was not always able to assure a safe recovery and therefore people looked for miraculous beliefs linked to the environment as the right link between patients and preternatural world where medicine had failed. Among environmental factors, {{the most important is}} undoubtedly water, the historical miraculous source. Search of health has always been linked to presence of water, as thermal baths, which became since the XIX century spas for treatments and regulation of functions of human organism. To tell the truth, however, in spite of the historical importance of water as an efficacious health remedy (see Hippocrates work), the discussion about environment and health started only from the middle of last century thanks to the remarkable contribution of some International or Research institutions (OMS, Schools of Public Health of London, Boston and Baltimore). They nourished a strong collation between ancient and modern consideration of relations between natural elements and diseases, superstitions and scientific progress, official political institutions and individual researchers (Angeletti, 1995). In such a discussion water has always represented the hauling and main element. From a historical point of view, water has played a fundamental role both for human and productive settling down (mouths, nomadism) (Cancellieri, 1995) and for popular religiousness. The first version was linked to everyday survival much more than alimentary needs coming from hunting, stock-raising and agriculture. Popular religiousness has instead covered all water places with guardian Divinities and ritual immersion has always represented a twofold function: sacral and social, a sort of rebirth through the purification of the body. From a technical and functional point of view, {{there is no doubt that}} water actually represents the most effective and symptomatic informer of environmental emergency and particularly of the physiological balance requested between activity of people and activity of the surrounding nature. In fact the most risky pathological events of mankind (ruinous floods, climatic changes, pollution of water-bearing strata, harvest destruction, drought, etc.) depend on presence or lack of water, on protection or carelessness (Vegetti, 1995). The curative use of thermal water is mentioned for the first time by Philostratus (Hersicus, 3, 35) in relation with injured Achaean warriors who, coming back from Troy, dipped as therapy in the thermal sources in Smirne, which were later called “Agamemnon’s BathsÓ. Therefore the connection between thermal and curative water sources and volcanic phenomena has always been clear. It means that quality of water and its temperature are exclusively connected to the geological structure of the soil where it flows, and that ancient people attributed a mythical link between health and volcanism. Therefore in the ancient Greece, the most important spas are those of Asclepiae (in Kos and in G˜rtina in Arcady) and those of Heracles (in Termopili and in Adepso in Eubea) which were situated near medicinal water sources where patients were subjected to a purification rite even with therapeutical effects. In Gadara in Judea (present Ain Gader) there are important spas to treat leprosy, second only to Baia and still famous in the first centuries a. D. Even the Etruscans and the ancient Italic peoples gave a great importance to the therapeutical use of water. To mention are “Thermae Ceretanae” (present Bagno del Sasso in Cerveteri), and the famous “Fontes Clusini” (Chianciano), “Acque Populoniae” (Bagni di Caldana) and “Thermae tauri (Bagni di Ferrata near Civitavecchia). Some of them have been working until the Roman Empire and some still work today. 306 Hydrotherapy knew its maximum level with Romans who were able to give it a collective and public aspect. The coming of the Principality brought big water works, as aqueducts, which let thermalism develop not only near the water sources but also in the city. This represented a Copernican revolution for thermalism which assumed a twofold function: therapeutical with medical and control centres and social with special areas for men and for women where they could relax and have contacts with other people. In this way the original Greek spas began to change and to loose the mystic and religious pregnancy typical of Greek spas of Asclepio and Eracle which were placed near water sources. The biggest Roman spas were directly financed by emperors: Spas of Nero, Titus, Tiberius, Trajan, Caracalla, Domitian such as the many imperial villas with complete thermal system as Heliocaminus in the Hadrian’s Villa in Tivoli, or the thermal system of the Villa in Piazza Armerina in Sicily (beginning IV century a. C.). Both spas and villas were all equipped with an efficient and rational system for water thermoregulation - from very hot to very cold. Among the many authors who have always exalted the therapeutical use of thermal water, we would like to mention Asclepiad from Prusa (I century a. C.), Cicero’s friend, Virgil (Aeneid IX), Seneca, Vituvius (v. VIII of De Architectura), Antonio Musa who healed Augustus with cold baths, Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia), Galen and, above all, Celso who explicitly exalted the spas of Baia and water as healing mean for the body (Melillo, 1995). In this way, the development of thermalism started by Romans with waterworks in the cities, went on with the exaltation of spas in Baia and in Campi Flegrei for a wide range of pathologies both for hydrotherapy and for <b>crenotherapy</b> thanks to the volcanic origin of water and its diversified physical-chemical and thermic composition. Thanks to its genetic features, thermalism succeeded in keeping its value also after the end of the Empire when the crisis of the city, destruction of part of aqueducts and the downfall of big thermal systems irreversibly quickened the crisis of hydrotherapy in the artificial spas of the big towns but not in the natural ones (as Campi Flegrei) which continued to be attraction poles for many pilgrimspatients during Middle Ages and Renaissance. Thermal sources were also exploited in many other European countries although people were still linked to local healthy Gods. To mention are: Badenweiler spas in the Black Forest (80 a. C.), famous Aquae spas (today’s Baden Baden) which became later “Aquae Aureliae”. In France spas were appreciated by people who had already tested abroad the effectiveness of water treatment. In Britain it is to mention the spa in Bath which is still operative...|$|E
