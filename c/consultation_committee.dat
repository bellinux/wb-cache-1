As an overview to consumption related to chronic disease and obesity, the World Health Organization's independent meta-studies specifically distinguish free sugars ("all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices") from sugars occurring naturally in food. The reports prior to 2000 set the limits for free sugars at a maximum of 10% of carbohydrate intake, measured by energy, rather than mass, and since 2002 have aimed for a level across the entire population of less than 10%. The <b>consultation</b> <b>committee</b> recognized that this goal is [...] "controversial. However, the Consultation considered that the studies showing no effect of free sugars on excess weight have limitations". A 2015 New York Times report noted that [...] "a review of beverage studies, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, found that those funded by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association and the sugar industry were five times more likely to find no link between sugary drinks and weight gain than studies whose authors reported no financial conflicts." ...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the use and {{character}} of employee voice mechanisms of foreign-owned multinational enterprises operating in Australia, {{as well as the}} influence of a strategic human resource management approach and union presence. Findings indicate that foreign-owned multinational enterprises are high-level users of the full range of employee voice mechanisms, with the exceptions of use of employee suggestion schemes, trade union recognition and the use of joint <b>consultation</b> <b>committees</b> across all sites. Using logistic regression analysis, findings show that trade union presence, a strategic human resource management approach, greenfield site and country of origin impact the employee voice approach adopted. High trade union presence is associated with an indirect employee voice approach. A low trade union presence is associated with a direct or a minimalist approach to employee voice. Moreover, a strategic human resource management approach is associated with both direct and dualistic approaches to employee voice. Implications are drawn for theory and practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{makers in}} the US federal {{government}} regularly consult advisory committees, {{but there is}} little systematic research on how committee advice influences executive branch policy making. We investigate the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) use of advisory committees when deciding whether or not to approve pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices for marketing. Specifically, using 1997 – 2006 drug and device approval data, we estimate the influence of committee advice on FDA decision making. We find that an increase in the proportion of committee members voting for drug approval increases the probability of FDA approval and that an increase in the proportion of committee members voting for approval reduces the time it takes for the FDA to approve a drug or device application after <b>committee</b> <b>consultation.</b> Additionally, for theoretical and empirical reasons, our analysis explores the FDA’s decision to consult advisory committees and its concern about the delay that <b>committee</b> <b>consultation</b> might introduce. Although data limitations enable us to explore these latter issues with respect to approved applications only, our study has some implications for scholarship on <b>committee</b> <b>consultation,</b> bureaucratic delay, an...|$|R
