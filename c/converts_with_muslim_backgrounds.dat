40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether {{religious}} behavior or religious identity changes when a person <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> moves to a Christian country and also very secular such as Sweden.   I have interviewed five people <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> that have moved from Turkey to Sweden. In this study I have applied Anthony Giddens and Thomas Ziehe's theories about building up an identity but also Nader Ahmadis theory of migration and identity. The results of this study show that there is a change in the practice of religion but also that this differs between these five people who came from the same country. Nevertheless, a change in the practice of religion can on one hand be as a result of modernity and on the other hand, exclusion of family. It also proves that it is not possible to draw general conclusions on this issue instead it should be looked at from an individual perspective...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years or so, {{migrants}} to Europe who used to be labelled as Moroccans, Turks, Algerians, Pakistani, and so on, have increasingly come to be labelled in religious terms. This article provides a brief analysis of how and why this transformation of public discourse in European contexts has taken place, and discusses the consequences of defining immigrants <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> in terms of an essentialized religious identity. The current text is based on the workshop “Public Debates about Islam in Europe” held in March 2006 in Montecatini. Details about this workshop can be found on page 56...|$|R
40|$|This aim of {{this article}} is to {{critically}} examine how the concept of culture is used in Sweden to explain the “failure” or the difficulties that Muslim immigrant families are experiencing with regards to their integration into the dominant society. Whereas, the Swedish society is often represented as ‘modern’, ‘progressive’, and ‘democratic’, immigrants <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are predominately described as ‘traditional’, ‘authoritarian’ and ‘pre-modern’. There is a widely held idea within Swedish social work research that immigrant families and the white mainstream Swedish society are situated within two different value systems with different world-views regarding family and gender relations. Due to this entrenched binary opposition, Orientalism becomes constitutive to social work research and practices...|$|R

40|$|When the Swedish society {{becomes more}} {{multicultural}} {{and we have}} a more multicultural school, it is important that educators have an understanding and awareness of the cultural differences that may occur in teaching situations. We have chosen to focus our study on girls <b>with</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> and how they experience physical education in school. The subject physical education contains many different elements that can be seen as new and foreign to these students. We have also interviewed educators to see how they work with integration and how they handle any absence from PE classes. Our study contains both a qualitative and a quantitative part. The study is based on the socio-cultural theory, as it is about interaction between people with regard to one's background and language. The result from our study shows differences of the experiences that students and teachers have about PE. The study also shows that the schools have a development of work with integration, but are still lacking resources to integrate today’s students with a foreign background. The discussion in the study shows conclusions from the questionnaire and the interview survey which shows that there are difficulties for girls <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> to participate in all different element that PE have. The educators, however, can not see such difficulties and they may let the student complete the course even though they have not completed the standards for it.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to analyse the stories of four {{homosexual}} women <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>backgrounds</b> about coming out as homosexuals, from an intersectional perspective. The experience of coming out as lesbian and the intersectionality are related to different social contexts. The homosexuality becomes a problem in connection to family and countrymen while the <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> becomes more of a problem in relationships. Heteronormativity and gender system appear to be cooperating systems of oppression. These women don’t describe themselves as oppressed, but potential oppression is still something that influences their lives. They strive for freedom to be themselves in all everyday situations. The quest for freedom to be able to express their sexuality risks relationships with families and girlfriends. But freedom and symbiosis don’t have to be in opposition. These women have found contexts, for example among friends, where none of the social categories are problematic and where they can experience symbiosis. They can choose certain contexts where they are allowed to express their sexuality. The experiences of coming out is analysed as linked to development in late modernity...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of contemporary research publications acknowledge the influence of religion and culture on sexual and reproductive behavior and health-care utilization. It is currently hypothesized that religious influences can partly explain disparities in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. In this paper, we will {{pay particular attention to}} Muslims in sexual and reproductive health care. This review reveals that knowledge about devout Muslims' own experience of sexual and reproductive health-care matters is limited, thus providing weak evidence for modeling of efficient practical guidelines for sexual and reproductive health care directed at Muslim patients. Successful outcomes in sexual and reproductive health of Muslims require both researchers and practitioners to acknowledge religious heterogeneity and variability, and individuals' possibilities to negotiate Islamic edicts. Failure to do so could lead to inadequate health-care provision and, in the worst case, to suboptimal encounters between migrants <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> and the health-care providers in the receiving country...|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{also shows}} {{that for the most}} recent time period and at the group level religious distinctiveness is positively related with immigrant protest. Hence, this result also replicates the analysis of the time-series cross sectional analysis with the difference that in this model the relationship is also statistically significant. The difference between the two results can probably be attributed to the fact that only in recent time periods migrants <b>with</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> make up a relevant share of all migrants. The result reveals that cultural distance does {{have a positive impact on}} migrant protest if culture is conceptualized in close relation with religion. In contrast, both linguistic distance and colonial history are not related to the propensity to protest. While the former result is in line with all models of the time-series cross-sectional analysis (see Table  2), the latter result is only in line with the more conservative models in which the coefficient did appear to be insignificant, which suggests that the statistical relationship shown in the other models is spurious.|$|R

40|$|Aim and {{questions}} Aim: To investigate participation of muslim women in swimming education in secondary school subject sports and health. Questions: Which experiences do women <b>with</b> a <b>muslim</b> <b>background</b> have of swimming education? What obstacles or possibilities do women <b>with</b> a <b>muslim</b> <b>background</b> have {{for participation in}} swimming education? Method The {{study was conducted with}} semi-structured interviews. The interviews where conducted on acquaintances of acquaintances, whom all where women <b>with</b> a <b>muslim</b> <b>background.</b> Subsequently, the interviews were transcribed and analyzed based on a theoretical model consisting of categories related to the two issues in this study. Previous research where also used in the same way, which highlighted the area of this study. Results The result indicated that our participants had a positive experience of their swimming classes. The biggest factor to this positive experience however where the schools ability to organize separate classes to those who could not participate in the common ones. When a school did not organize separate classes, our participants generally face two options. Either not to participate and risk not getting a grade, or to challenge their principles and participate anyway, which could lead to bad experiences. Conclusions Separate classes where the key to participation amongst the participants in our study. There where both obstacles and possibilities affecting the degree of which separate classes where necessary and the participants were divided on the topic of who were responsible to adapt in the situation. Syfte och frågeställningar Syftet: Är att undersöka muslimska kvinnors deltagande i simundervisning i gymnasieskolans ämne idrott och hälsa. Frågeställningar: Vilka erfarenheter har kvinnor med muslimsk bakgrund av simundervisningen? Vilka hinder eller möjligheter har kvinnor med muslimsk bakgrund att delta i simundervisningen? Metod Studien har genomförts med semi-strukturerade kvalitativa intervjuer. Vi har intervjuat bekantas bekanta, där samtliga var kvinnor med muslimsk bakgrund. Intervjuerna har transkriberats och analyserats utifrån en teoretisk modell bestående av kategorier som relaterar till studiens frågeställningar samt tidigare forskning som även belyser undersökningsområdet. Resultat Resultatet visade att studiens deltagare hade en övervägande positiv erfarenhet av simundervisningen i ämnet idrott och hälsa. Den största bidragande faktorn till detta var skolans förmåga att anordna separat undervisning för de elever som inte kunde delta i en gemensam undervisning. De deltagare vars skolor inte anordnade separat undervisning ställdes inför valet att inte delta och bli utan betyg, eller att gå emot sina principer, vilket kunde leda till obekväma situationer. Slutsats Särundervisning var nyckeln till deltagande hos denna studies deltagare. Det fanns både möjligheter och hinder som påverkade i vilken grad separat undervisning v...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} review ’s aim is {{to explore}} what international research highlights as the important factors and components regarding  identity negotiation among adolescents <b>with</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background.</b> The paper concludes  that these adolescents negotiate in response to islamophobic discourses and a demand for assimilation into the dominating society. This causes individuals of Muslim  background to use their religion as an  anchor to operate in a process of  acculturation between different cultures. Within this process strategies of negotiation such as proclamation and masking of  religious identification were evident. These findings are of importance due to the school’s role as a fostering institution in Swedish society and therefore these {{will be discussed in}} light of their implications for religious education in Sweden...|$|R

The National Center for Prevention of Sexual Assault also praised the portrayal, adding that they wish for the series to become a syllabus in schools. In the third season, Martine Lunder Brenne of Verdens Gang praised the theme of homosexuality and wrote that [...] "I praise it first and foremost because young homosexual people, both in and outside the closet, finally get some long-awaited and modern role models.

After World War II, relatively large numbers of immigrants moved to Europe and brought with them outside cultural customs and religions.

Attitudes in relation to migrants, particularly those <b>with</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background,</b> have become more wary and critical.

40|$|The {{integration}} of migrants has been exercising {{minds in the}} Netherlands for several decades now. The tone of the debate in both the political and public arena has frequently been sombre, reflecting the widespread feeling that large sections of the migrant population, and especially migrants <b>with</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background,</b> had little connection with Dutch society. This report describes the position regarding the {{integration of}} migrant groups in the Netherlands and looks in depth at trends in the integration process. Integration is broken down into several dimensions in this report. This means that attention is devoted among other things to trends in education and on the labour market, but also to trends in spatial segregation, crime, interethnic contact, religious behaviour and command of the Dutch language. The picture that emerges is a mixed one. Migrants still lag behind considerably in many areas; at the same time, however, they are making up ground fast on several fronts.

40|$|Maintaining false hope {{may result}} in {{prolonged}} curative aggressive treatments until the very last stage of life. In this study, we sought to explore how people think that realistic and hopeful information should best be combined in physician–patient communications {{at the end of}} life. During a period of 15 days, participants of five online focus groups (OFGs) could log in onto a closed discussion site and offer responses to several topics. A variety of people participated: patients, older people, relatives, and healthcare professionals with and without a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background.</b> Participants <b>with</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> constituted a separate group, because previous research indicated that they might have distinct views on good end-of-life care and communication. Transcripts were analyzed following the principles of thematic analysis. Participants from all focus groups preferred that physicians provide realistic information in an empathic way, stating that the patient would never be left on his own and that withholding curative treatment was not equal to withholding care, explicitly asking how the patient could be helped during the time remaining, and involving other professionals in the care process and communications. As such, physicians could support patients' transition from “hope for a cure” to “hope for a good death. ” Muslims specified the way they wished to receive realistic information: first from a relative, and not by using the term “incurable illness,” but rather by informing the patient that they had no remaining curative treatments available. Realism and hope are not necessarily mutually exclusive and can be combined when providing realistic information in a delicate and culturally sensitive way. This study provides suggestions on how physicians can do so. Communication skills training as well as anchoring knowledge of the diversity of cultural and religious views into physicians' education could improve end-of-life communication. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
