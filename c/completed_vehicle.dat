500|$|The first {{prototype}} was {{manufactured in}} 1926.

[...] In 1931, a second prototype was completed, while the final two were completed in 1934. [...] The original prototype was returned to the factory in 1935, to integrate a number of modernizations and to repair any damage which was done to the vehicle during the testing process.

Propulsion systems were also redundant, having six thrusters and two equivalent battery stacks. It was outfitted with a variable buoyancy system, and finally with the science payload that included {{the ability to take}} in water and solid core samples for later analysis, as well as an onboard microscope to analyze water samples in real time.|$|E

5000|$|Edinburgh Street Tramways No. 23 {{has been}} preserved. Owned by the Edinburgh Horse Tram Trust, it's {{housed in the}} Scottish Vintage Bus Museum at Lathalmond in Fife. Built in 1885/6 by the company in Shrubhill Depot, it's an open top double-decker, {{which would have been}} drawn by a pair of horses. It cost £140, seated 36 (14/14) in {{longitudinal}} seats, and featured [...] "decency boards" [...] to hide ladies ankles when sitting on the top deck. It was fitted out to a high quality, with brass fittings, gold leaf and 14 blue etched windows each with a different design. Having been transferred to the Edinburgh and District Tramways in 1896, by 1900 it was withdrawn and ended up being used as a workmen's bothy building a house in Newtown St Boswells in the Scottish Borders, and then as a garden summer house/shed for the house. Local accounts also suggested it was a meeting place of the Wee Free congregation. It remained there for the next 100 years, its condition remained good thanks to several layers of paint, a ventilated brick plinth, and a corrugated iron roof. It was rediscovered after the owners investigated its origins. The Edinburgh Horse Tram Trust was established to restore it, and after being moved to one of Lothian Buses premises, restoration began in 2007, and after being moved to the museum in May 2011 for finishing work and painting into Royal Blue livery, the completed project was unveiled in August 2012. The restoration required substitution wheelsets and brakegear from an ex-Douglas IOM Horse tram to be used (the original wheels having been cast by local firm, Miller’s Foundry on London Road). Recreation of the original fleetname was made possible as it had survived underneath later layers of paint. Since it has the same gauge as the new tram system, it was speculated the <b>completed</b> <b>vehicle</b> could once again run in its original home.|$|E
