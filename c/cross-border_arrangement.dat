40|$|The {{recognition}} of the foreign parent-child relationship is the most controversial issue arising out of International Surrogacy Arrangements (ISAs). The existing legal framework on the matter is highly fragmented {{at the national level}} and the number of <b>cross-border</b> <b>arrangements</b> that are entered into in surrogacy-friendly jurisdictions is constantly increasing. The paper examines, first, the recent ECtHR jurisprudence over the interplay between Article 8 of the ECHR (right to family and private life) and <b>cross-border</b> surrogacy <b>arrangements,</b> which is considerably affecting the functioning of national PIL rules on {{recognition of}} foreign civil status lawfully established abroad following ISAs.

This study researches what kind of human right violations do <b>cross-border</b> surrogacy <b>arrangements</b> entail {{from the point of view}} of the children, the intended parents and the surrogate mother. I will try to examine which rights they possibly breach and how these rights are violated. A detailed study of the private international law rules of different states has been left out of the study. These regulations have been viewed in the scope that is necessary in order to proceed with the study. This thesis incorporates case study, comparative analysis and juridical analysis in order to research the topic. A legal dogmatic method has been applied in this thesis. The research questions will be examined in the current legal landscape of international law and human rights law with the help of literature, international human right treaties, different domestic laws and domestic soft law instruments, decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and decisions of domestic courts. In order to create a general view of the topic I will research different worldwide approaches to surrogacy. After establishing an overview of the field, I study the possible violations these differences in approaches may cause. The situation will be studied from the perspective of the children that are being born and from the perspective of the adults that are involved. As a concluding thought I will briefly address the theme regarding the lack of international regulation. The study states that there is no univocal answer to the question asking whether international surrogacy arrangements lead to human right violations. In <b>cross-border</b> <b>arrangements</b> especially the children’s rights are in danger. The biggest human right problems are related to the recognition of the children in the receiving countries. Whether international surrogacy arrangements lead to human right violations is dependent on the individual aspects of each arrangement. When it comes to the adults involved in surrogacy arrangements, it is clear that international surrogacy arrangements entail exploitative elements towards the surrogate mothers. Concern about exploitation is bigger when the arrangements are performed in low-income countries. This study furthermore states that prohibiting surrogacy arrangements does not violate the rights of the intending parents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Globalisation induces {{nation states}} to build marketplaces that span various {{countries}} {{with the objective}} of facilitating trade and improving economic competitiveness. International experiences gained from three common markets, the European Union (EU), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Common Southern Market (MERCOSUR) allow for drawing some general conclusions that might be helpful for guiding similar processes in other regions and preparing them better for the challenges of human and social rights in open economies. Analysis of existing trade agreements shows that even relevant differences in design, structure, financing, coverage and regulation of health systems in member states do not necessarily prevent them from implementing common block-wide social protection and health service arrangements. Public health activities, epidemiologic surveillance and disease prevention have the potential of being starting points for shared activities of member states in the health field. Bi- or multi-national enterprises are eligible to become focal points of <b>cross-border</b> <b>arrangements</b> and regulations, especially if they are public or publicly administered. In general, coordination and cooperation between countries can be tried out or applied first in border regions where there is a high flow of goods, services and persons. When it comes to implementing the social dimension in the policy and priority setting of trade agreements, motivating spirit, driving forces and the concordance of value-sets in member states are crucial conditions. National governments planning to set up or join regional trade agreements have a broad decision margin regarding the extent to which the...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{conditions}} under which local and regional governments will establish and sustain cross-border co-operation in the fields of police, fire fighting and emergency health services. It argues that understanding this type of cross-border co-operation requires a focus on the way in which professionals define and apply their professional standards in cross-border contexts. Moreover, it requires a focus on individual organizations and professionals working in them, rather than ‘government’ or ‘the state’ as a whole, since cross-border co-operation in these areas typically develops as a result of disparate and unconnected initiatives taken by governmental actors in a given border region. Based on four studies of cross-border co-operation in Dutch border regions, we argue that differences in legal, organizational and cultural backgrounds between the participating countries can be and are overcome by street-level professionals and their organizations, who act as ‘regionauts’ in exploring opportunities for cross-border co-operation. In this type of ‘bottom-up’ cross-border co-operation, motivation among participants is the key to establishing co- operation, and solutions to differences between work routines will be developed along the way. As a result, the establishment of cross-border co-operation often is an experimental, pragmatic enterprise, which is greatly affected by local intra- and inter-organizational dynamics. This opens the potential for pragmatic, flexible and creative solutions. Yet, {{at the same time it}} also runs the risk of producing unaccountable <b>cross-border</b> <b>arrangements</b> that are insufficiently embedded in legal and professional safeguards against error and abuse.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is funded by}} the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) Adaptation Research Grants Program (ARGP) 2011 - 2013. The focus is on what can be learnt from existing cross-border regulatory mechanisms {{with a view to}} strengthening and improving cross-border climate change adaptation practices in Australia. There is currently little understanding of the range of cross-border mechanisms and regulatory innovations, the efficacy of how they work, nor the key lessons that could be gleaned and adapted from existing initiatives for the purposes of climate change adaptation. The emphasis of this three-stage project therefore, is on identifying and collating the lessons learnt from existing Australian examples of regulatory reform models, authorities and mechanisms that have emerged to address cross-border issues at the national, state and local level. Using an institutional learning framework, the research offers key insights into the evolution, challenges and potentialities of cross- border governance for Australian-based climate change adaptation. The cross-border governance ‘problematique’ focuses primarily around two key agendas: [i] the novel re-articulations of power that cross-border innovations pose, involving diverse groups of actors and networks; and [ii] the benefits and dis-benefits of informal collaborative transboundary arrangements as compared to more formalised regulatory state mechanisms. To this end, conceptual and practical understandings of cross-border governance and regulation can be seen to converge in their focus on the political and institutional processes of re-territorialisation. This monograph focuses specifically on Stage 1 of the project. This has involved a detailed literature review and desktop analysis of four Australian cross-border cases that operate at different levels of scale and complexity including: the Murray Darling Basin Agreement; the Australian Alps Cooperative Management Agreement; the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales Regional Collaboration; and the Cross Border Sub-Plan 2010 between the Gold Coast City, Queensland, and Tweed Shire, New South Wales. Key findings from Stage 1 include an emphasis on (1) the arrangement, development or formation process which results in (2) the adoption of particular arrangement leading to (3) implementation outcomes and (4) ‘on the ground’ effects. Further to this was the need for <b>cross-border</b> <b>arrangements</b> to re-imagine what was once separate as whole through a re-configuration of geographic (place), administrative (space) and political (territory) fragmentation; that with respect to <b>cross-border</b> governance <b>arrangements</b> there is no ‘one-size fits all’; and the recognition of mutual inter-dependencies and cross-border economies of scale. The implications for climate change adaptation regulatory reform will be further expanded in Stages 2 and 3 of this nationally funded research project.

40|$|Trade in {{technology}} and related services has assumed a major role both {{on the world trade}} agenda and within the NAFTA block. The success of such cross-border trade is dependent upon three factors: protection of intellectual property, 2 ̆ 7 access to foreign markets by service providers, and a minimized risk of double taxation. Each of these factors is impacted by national laws, multinational conventions, and bilateral tax treaties. The last decade has witnessed an explosion of such legislation and agreements. This article focuses on Canada, Mexico and the United States, and explores the World Trade Organization Agreement (2 ̆ 2 WTO Agreement 2 ̆ 2), the North American Free Trade Agreement (2 ̆ 2 NAFTA 2 ̆ 2), and the bilateral tax treaties entered into by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the three NAFTA signatories, and analyzes both their impact and interaction on cross-border trade {{in technology}} and related services.

An increasing number of Australians exploit this difference by entering into commercial surrogacy agreements overseas, raising the question of the effect of such agreements in Australia.

However, there is still a large knowledge gap on the possibilities and effects of balancing market integration.

We evaluate the impact of seven main <b>cross-border</b> balancing <b>arrangements</b> {{on the basis of a}} set of ten high-level performance criteria. The analysis shows that although the net impact of the arrangements of ACE netting and a common merit order list can be expected to be positive, there are major uncertainties in impact related to the dependency on detailed balancing market design choices and power system and market conditions. The uncertainties and dependencies regarding the impact of balancing market integration call for a detailed analysis in each individual integration case.

40|$|Broadly speaking, {{medical tourism}} {{involves}} patients intentionally going abroad to pursue medical services outside of formal <b>cross-border</b> care <b>arrangements</b> that are typically paid for out-of-pocket. Orthopedic, dental, cosmetic, transplant, and other surgeries are offered by hospitals {{around the world}} looking to attract international patients, with such procedures often available for purchase as part of “package deals” that include recovery stays at affiliated tourist resorts or hotels. In this commentary we synthesize what we believe are the 10 most important issues of concern for Canadian family physicians regarding Canadian patients’ involvement in medical tourism.

Given the complex social, ethical and legal issues involved, surrogacy continues to raise debate worldwide and fuel calls for increased domestic provision in developed countries. However, little is known about how recent changes have affected HFEA licensed clinics. A 24 -item online survey was undertaken between August and October 2013, designed to improve understanding of recent trends and current practices associated with UK-based surrogacy, and consider the implications for future policy and practice in UK and <b>cross-border</b> surrogacy <b>arrangements.</b> The response rate was 51. 4 %, comprising 54 clinics. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and open-ended qualitative responses analysed for extending understanding. Of the participating clinics, 42. 6 % offered surrogacy (mostly gestational surrogacy). Heterosexual couples using gestational surrogacy were the largest group currently using services followed by male same-sex couples. Most clinics reported having encountered problems with surrogacy treatments, suggesting barriers still exist to expanding the UK provision of surrogacy arrangements.

40|$|This Thesis {{seeks to}} shed light on the issue of how far secured {{creditor}} rights are protected in EU cross-border insolvencies by focusing on the perspective and position of English lenders. The main thread throughout is the legal concerns faced by lenders when lending to a company incorporated in England and Wales which operates across the European Union and has assets and creditors spread across various Member States. The initial stages of the structuring of a <b>cross-border</b> security <b>arrangement</b> in terms of the enforceability of the lending transaction and underlying security interest under the ordinary civil/commercial law outside of bankruptcy are considered. The potential contractual and proprietary issues faced by lenders are discussed through the lens of English domestic law which for the present purposes includes EU law such as the Brussels I and Rome I Regulations. After ascertaining how lenders can ensure their lending transactions and underlying security interests are valid and enforceable prebankruptcy, the thesis explores the position of lenders in the face of insolvency proceedings and the issue of 'insolvency effects'. The thesis then goes on to analyze the impact of the EC Regulation on insolvency proceedings (the EIR) having regard to jurisdiction, recognition, applicable law and provisions which create exceptions to the application of the lex concursus and have particular impact on the enforcement of lenders' rights in the event of default and formal insolvency...|$|R

Contrary to prevailing understandings in public policy literature, such meta-governance initiatives are mostly run by nongovernmental rather than governmental actors.

We aim to assess their current level, and the factors associated with their implementation. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 315 hospitals and cardiology departments in the Czech Republic, France, Poland and Spain. Employing bi-variate statistics and logistic regression analysis, we assess quality and safety requirements for cross-border patients and their association with hospital characteristics, <b>cross-border</b> care <b>arrangements,</b> proximity to EU borders, the hospital's quality improvement system, and country. Results Certain quality and safety requirements are frequently met (administrative support or informed consent using forms in various EU languages) while others are widely absent (case-managers, contacts to patients' general practitioners). Due to communication problems, it is often not possible to inform patients about their condition and treatment. Discharge summaries are rarely available in other than the vernacular languages, and medication upon discharge and arranging back-transfer occur occasionally only. Logistic regression analysis suggests a strong effect of country-level covariates (followed by type of hospital, hospital size and hospital's quality improvement system), but covariates are not consistently associated with higher rates of implementation. Hospitals with existing cross-border care collaboration do not differ substantially from hospitals without such <b>arrangements.</b> Conclusion <b>Cross-border</b> {{patients have}} specific quality and safety requirements that are not always met.

40|$|Privatization {{has been}} a popular {{strategy}} for improving efficiency in both market and transition economies. The literature on privatization includes broad discussions of pricing techniques but overlooks tax issues. In reality, a state-owned company loses its privilege of paying no taxes once it is privatized. This change in tax status would certainly complicate the financial transaction of a newly privatized company, affect industry-wide economic efficiency, and change the revenue pattern of governments. Using Ontario Hydro and the Canadian tax regime as examples, the authors provide policymakers with a checklist on tax issues under privatization. Their main observations: 1) The tax status of the company to be privatized {{must be considered in}} analyzing the firm's financial transition. 2) The economic efficiency targeted by privatization may depend partly on the tax regime for a particular industry. 3) Privatization affects government revenue through the revenue-sharing structure determined by intergovernmental fiscal relationships and <b>cross-border</b> tax <b>arrangements.</b> Time is a factor in tax and transition issues. At the time of privatization, for example, how are assets to be valued for calculatingcapital gains and cost deductions, for tax purposes? Are the assets transferred to the new owners at fair market value, book value, or at cost, for tax purposes? How should heavy debt loads be treated? Ontario Hydro will not be privatized but it will become taxable. How the taxes will be paid will depend on how the transition is treated. Tax policy will be a key determinant of the industry's future development.

40|$|The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is {{expected}} {{to benefit from the}} significant growth in the Asia-Pacific payments market. Growth in economic activity would increase the size, scale, and scope of payment transactions. Enabling the scale and scope of payments would in turn increase economic activity. This would also require national payment systems to be regionalized and operate with cross-border and multi-currency capabilities. As existing regional payment arrangements have illustrated how they can be successfully established, ASEAN can itself leverage on its current cooperative forums in creating a more regionalized payment system. In doing so, it faces the following challenges. First, promoting the use of cashless payments would require increased private sector involvement in improving accessibility to basic payment infrastructure, increasing their interoperability, and creating a competitive cross-border retail payment scheme. Second, creating cross-border and multi-currency payment systems could possibly proceed with the interlinking of existing real-time gross settlement systems within the region, and later enlarged, but this would need to be supportive of the broader goals of sequencing financial services liberalization. Third, legal harmonization would need to keep pace with rapid technological and regulatory changes where the introduction of settlement finality legislation is seen as an important precondition to support cross-border payments. Fourth, managing foreign exchange settlement risk would need to be addressed with the growth in global foreign exchange market activities and this would involve the development of risk-reduction features in payment systems.

If the co-operation body does have legal personality, the latter is defined in the law of the country in which its headquarters are located. As stated in art. 4, the co-operation body cannot be empowered to take measures which apply generally or which might affect the rights and freedoms of individuals. It must be specified whether the body is to be considered a public or private law entity within the respective national legal systems.However, the protocol gives the signatory states the option to extend the powers of such co-operation bodies (art. 5). They can be established as public law entities whose decisions have the same legal force as if they had been taken by the participating authorities themselves. Such bodies can therefore make decisions which are legally binding not only for the participating authorities but also for any individuals affected. In view of the far-reaching implications of such a transnational public authority, Germany, France and Sweden chose to sign the protocol without art. 5. The Additional Protocol significantly extends the provisions made by the Madrid Convention. However, the Convention still does not contain any regulations that override national law. This is why all initiatives have to conform to the national legal systems of the respective countries. Thus, no public law CBC initiative can be based on the CoE Convention and its additional protocols, but must be grounded either in inter-state treaties or at least unilaterally in national law.|$|R
40|$|Solutions for {{regional}} development questions are increasingly sought in <b>cross-border</b> cooperative <b>arrangements.</b> The tourism sector is often assigned {{with a high}} potential in this regard due to the sector’s alleged contributions to the economic viability {{and quality of life}} in rural destinations, and the assumed ease with which cross-border tourism projects can be initiated. However, the underlying mechanisms behind tourism-related regional development processes in cross-border settings remain poorly understood. Combining tourism geographies, border studies and regional science, we I aim to fully understand the structural delivery mechanisms for tourism-induced regional development in European borderland contexts. First, we I conceptually and empirically explored the interactions between (holistic) landscapes, tourism landscapes, and regional development in rural destinations. Our findings indicate that tourism-related regional development depends not so much on optimizing individual activities and actions. Rather, regional development processes depend on interconnecting all emplaced tourism-related stakeholders, resources and activities within the wider regional system through multi-level governance. Destination-wide provision of institutional support for, and coordination with, local networking agencies such as community and entrepreneurial organizations provide a practical strategy to increase the socially and spatially integrative position of tourism in region-building processes. Second, we I applied and refined these insights to European borderland contexts. Building on empirical research in transnational and within-country borderlands in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, we I found that even though cross-border tourism project development shows to be relatively straightforward in most regions, there is no automatic one-to-one relation between tourism development and regional development. In absence of integrative institutional structures and inability of institutional brokers, uncoordinated cross-border tourism project development may even lead to asymmetrical development between borderlands. Establishing cross-border tourism governance and coordination mechanisms to avoid these outcomes is complicated by both sector-specific and more general border-related complexities. Potential facilitators for cross-border tourism cooperation, such as the presence of cross-border identity and historical connections, may indeed ease this process but cannot work miracles when administrative borders are institutionally hard. To summarize, borderlands tourism can indeed function as a tool for transnational and within-country cross-border regional development, but its complexity can be easily underestimated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining a {{continuous}} balance between generation and load {{is crucial for}} the safeguarding of the power systems. In order to effectively deal with the various uncertainties {{that contribute to the}} real-time imbalance in liberalised power systems, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) procure and employ the so-called balancing services through balancing markets. In Europe, though such mechanisms are well in place at the national level, the potential of multinational balancing markets has not been fully exploited (with the exception of the Nordic system and various pilot projects). This thesis analyses the potential for integrating the balancing power markets in northern Europe, including the Nordic system, Germany and the Netherlands. It addresses the twin issues of the procurement and employment of cross-border balancing services by using mathematical models. Beginning with an outline of the role of balancing markets in Europe, an overview of existing balancing markets in the northern European system is presented. A discussion on the <b>cross-border</b> balancing <b>arrangements</b> is then carried out, paving the way for quantitative analysis. A quantitative analyses of the multinational balancing markets are carried out, both in terms of attainable socio-economic cost savings, and their effect on the exchange of regional balancing services and generation dispatch. In this respect, two cases of balancing market integration are analysed: the current state with separate balancing markets, and the anticipated state of full integration of these markets. In the proposed modelling approach a two-step model is used, representing the day-ahead and balancing markets, respectively. First, the day-ahead market is modelled as a common market for the whole European continent. Simultaneously, reserve procurement for northern Europe is modelled. Available transmission capacity is allocated implicitly to the balancing services exchange, based on the trade-off between day-ahead energy and balancing capacity exchange. Next, the balancing energy market is modelled as a real-time power dispatch {{on the basis of the}} day-ahead market clearing results and simulated imbalances. Detailed results illustrate the consequences of market integration between two synchronous areas on procured and activated reserves, dispatch of generators, and power flows. The profitability of balancing market integration is quantified by the observed cost savings obtained due to the use of cheaper balancing resources and less activation of reserves caused by imbalance netting. The implementation of cross-border balancing entails both qualitative and quantitative analyses of different balancing exchange scenarios. This thesis focuses on the qualitative studies of <b>cross-border</b> balancing <b>arrangements</b> together with the quantitative analysis of cross-border balancing. The methodology developed in the thesis enables the study of the benefits of integrating the northern European balancing markets, and the resulting exchange of balancing services among the Nordic countries, Germany and the Netherlands. The multinational balancing market can be adapted to capture the effect of different market integration scenarios. The presented modelling approach includes a flow-based  market model, which takes into account physical power flows and loop flows, especially suitable for the European systems with highly meshed transmission grids. A four tiered sequential approach is used to organize the primary contributions of the research work, as highlighted by the four distinct publications arising out of it. Tier 1 : An optimal methodology for reserve activation in the Nordic system is established. Tier 2 : Using the first tier as the basis, a cross-border reserves procurement algorithm is proposed for an integrated European system. Superimposing Tier 2 on Tier 1 results in a bottom-up approach of capturing the full spectrum of reserve procurement and activation for integrated balancing markets. Tier 3 : The profitability of balancing market integration is brought forward through both weekly and yearly analysis on the basis of mathematical models developed in Tier 1 and 2. Tier 4 : It is shown that the flexibility concerns warranted by penetration of renewable energy resources can be well addressed by using the developed framework of cross-border balancing market integration. A case study of a future power system (in 2030) with wind energy penetration has been employed in this regard. The results include the optimal distribution of balancing reserve capacity allocations for procurement among the constituent countries, and the optimal exchange of balancing energy that ensues upon activating these capacity reserves. An annual analysis of the post-integration scenario results demonstrates the significant cost savings that are achievable under the framework of multinational balancing markets. The results also demonstrate the potential for increased production flexibility, in light of increased wind energy penetration in the future operation of power systems through the mechanism of multinational balancing markets.   PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the social security status of non-citizens in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), describes measures and efforts to support labor mobility through enhanced social security protection of non-citizens in SADC, and makes recommendations as to how to improve the social security status of the said non-citizens, including through the portability of acquired benefits and other cross-country co-ordination arrangements. After dealing with the relevant conceptual framework, the report commences with a section highlighting the current diversity of social security systems in SADC countries and the problems this diversity creates for the mobility of people in SADC and their social security status. Restrictions contained in the legal system are in particular emphasized. The next section gives a high-level overview of those developments, initiatives and measures at a national, regional and international level which enhance the social security status of non-citizens in SADC. Finally, based on this descriptive and analytical section, the report proceeds with an analysis of how the problems experienced by non-citizens in SADC in social security terms, might be solved, where the shortcomings of the current initiatives are, and how to overcome these shortcomings. In this regard this final part also considers the potential to introduce <b>cross-border</b> social security <b>arrangements,</b> with particular reference to the maintenance of acquired social security rights, the aggregation of insurance periods, and the portability of social security benefits. It furthermore reflects on a range of other measures which need to be introduced in order to enhance and standardize the social security position of intra-SADC migrants.
