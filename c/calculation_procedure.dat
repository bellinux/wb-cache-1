25|$|In January 1999, FIFA {{introduced}} a revised system of ranking calculation, incorporating many changes {{in response to}} criticism of inappropriate rankings. For the ranking all matches, their scores and importance were all recorded, and {{were used in the}} <b>calculation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Only matches for the senior men's national team were included. Separate ranking systems were used for other representative national sides such as women's and junior teams, for example the FIFA Women's World Rankings. The women's rankings were, and still are, based on a procedure which is a simplified version of the Football Elo Ratings.|$|E
25|$|After the 2006 FIFA World Cup, {{a revised}} <b>calculation</b> <b>procedure</b> for the FIFA rankings was introduced, with a {{significantly}} simplified procedure. The new rankings were compiled {{in response to}} criticism from the media. Meetings were attended by FIFA staff and external experts and {{a large amount of}} research was conducted by this group, resulting in the new ranking system. The new system was confirmed in Leipzig on 7 December 2005 by a committee of FIFA executives. Notable changes include the dropping of the home or away advantage and number of goals from the calculation, and the simplification of many aspects of the system.|$|E

25|$|An exergoeconomic {{assessment}} {{accounting for}} the total and non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions of Brazilian electricity is performed by Flórez-Orrego et al. (2014), comprising thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind farms and biomass-fired power plants. The analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction, fuel transportation and processing, operation and decommissioning of the plant, with electricity generation as the desired output. This approach allows the calculation of direct CO2 emissions {{as well as the}} upstream and downstream emissions, which {{play an important role in}} some technologies. In this way, a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved. An iterative <b>calculation</b> <b>procedure</b> is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels, since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 1992, the FIFA World Rankings {{have been}} the subject of much debate, particularly regarding the <b>calculation</b> <b>procedure</b> and the resulting disparity between generally perceived quality and world ranking of some teams. For example, Norway was ranked second in October 1993 and July–August 1995, and the United States reached fourth in 2006, to the surprise of even their own players. However, criticism regarding the unrealistic ranking continued even after the introduction of the new formula. Israel's climb to 15th in November 2008 raised a few eyebrows even in the Israeli press, with the team missing a huge opportunity to break into the top 10 after conceding a last gasp equaliser against Latvia. Similarly, Belgium's rank of world number 1 in November 2015 was met with skepticism in the press, given that Belgium had only played in one tournament final stage in the past 13 years.|$|E
2500|$|The Second Housing Allowance Law of December 1970 {{simplified}} {{the administration}} of housing allowances and extended entitlements, increased the income limit to 9,600 DM per year plus 2,400 DM for each family member, raised the general deduction on income to determine reckonable income from 15% to 20%, allowance rates listed in tables replacing complicated <b>calculation</b> <b>procedure</b> based on [...] "bearable rent burdens." [...] The Housing Construction Modification Law (1971) increased the income-limit for access to low rent apartments under the social housing programme from 9,000 DM to 12,000 DM per annum plus 3,000 DM (instead of 2,400) for each family member. The law also introduced special subsidies to reduce the debt burden for builders not surpassing the regular income-limit by more than 40%. Under a 1973 law, the limits were increased to 1,000 DM plus 9,000 DM and 4,200 DM for additional family members. The Rent Improvement Law (1971) strengthened the position of tenants. Under this legislation, notice was to be ruled illegal [...] "where appropriate substitute accommodation not available; landlords obliged to specify reasons for notice," [...] whilst the Eviction Protection Law (1971) established tenant protection against rent rises and notice. The notice was only lawful if in the [...] "justified interest of the landlord." [...] Under this law, higher rents were not recognised as [...] "justified interest." [...] The Second Eviction Protection Law (1972) made the tenant protection introduced under the Eviction Protection Law of 1971 permanent. Under this new law, the notice was only lawful where the landlord proved justified personal interest in the apartment. In addition, rent increases were only lawful if not above normal comparable rents in the same area.|$|E
