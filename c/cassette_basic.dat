5|$|Microsoft's early {{products}} were different variants of Microsoft BASIC {{which was the}} dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as Apple II (Applesoft BASIC) and Commodore 64 (Commodore BASIC), and were also provided with early versions of the IBM PC as the IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the IBM PC was introduced, IBM {{sold its}} {{operating}} system as an unbundled option. One {{of the operating}} system options was PCDOS, priced at US$40. PCDOS {{was seen as a}} practically necessary option; most software titles required it and without it the IBM PC was limited to its built-in <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b> CP/M-86 shipped a few months later six times more expensive at $240, but sold poorly against DOS and enjoyed far less software support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first version}} of DONKEY.BAS was {{released}} in 1981, followed by version 1.10 in 1982. The operating systems with which the game was first distributed still work on modern computers with compatible BIOS and 5.25-inch floppy drives, however IBM BASICA which ran the program under PC DOS 1.x requires ROM-based IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC,</b> which modern computers do not have. The source code is still available. The game may be played with the GW-BASIC (original code) or QBasic (adapted code) interpreters or in compiled form (see [...] "external links" [...] below).|$|E
40|$|Audio Bombing is an {{alternative}} form of graffiti that uses magnetic audiotape as its medium. Drawing from hip hop and graffiti culture Audio Bombing starts with a <b>basic</b> <b>cassette</b> tape. Using a tape recorder you can record any information you want on to a cassette (music, poems, philosophy, subversive literature, etc.). After recording you remove the tape and cut out the segments {{that you want to}} use. Then take your tape segments and go tag whatever you want (buildings, benches, posters, buses, etc.). Using the augmented playhead spray can you can listen to the tags by running the playhead over the tape...|$|R
2500|$|In 2000, a rough mix {{version of}} Head First (taken from an open-reel tape {{prepared}} by Apple engineer Phil McDonald in December 1974) {{was released on}} CD. (According to Dan Matovina, Warner Brothers could not locate the original master tapes for remixing at that time, but they were eventually found about 10 years later.) [...] In 2002, Gibbins released a two-disk set of a Badfinger performance recorded in Indiana, on 19 October 1982, which had been captured on a <b>basic</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder, which was initially (and inaccurately) titled Live 83 – DBA-BFR. The band at that time had consisted of Evans, Gibbins, Jackson, Kailing and Dacus.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} main {{lines in the}} KC 85 series, the KC 85/2 (project name HC 900) to /4 and the KC 85/1 (project name Z 9001) by Robotron, which was a {{different}} system (only the CPU and the name were the same, but later the format of saving the programs on tape <b>cassettes</b> and the <b>BASIC</b> were also made compatible). In 1989, VEB Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen {{came up with the}} KC compact, but due to the GDR collapse very few units got actually produced and sold and—being a CPC clone—it was a KC in name only; thus it is usually not counted among the KC family.|$|R
50|$|GW-BASIC is {{identical}} to BASICA, {{with the exception of}} including the <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> code in the program, thus allowing it to run on non-IBM computers and later IBM models that lack <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> in ROM.|$|E
50|$|IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> came in 32 {{kilobytes}} (KB) of {{read-only memory}} (ROM), {{separate from the}} 8 KB BIOS ROM of the original IBM PC, and did not require an operating system to run. <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> provided the default user interface {{if there was no}} floppy disk drive installed, or if the boot code did not find a bootable floppy disk at power up. The name <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> came from its use of cassette tapes rather than floppy disks to store programs and data. <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> was built into the ROMs of the original PC and XT, and early models in the PS/2 line. It only supported loading and saving programs to the IBM cassette tape interface, which was unavailable on models after the original Model 5150. The entry-level version of the 5150 came with just 16 KB of random-access memory (RAM), which was sufficient to run <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b> However, <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> was rarely used because few PCs were sold without a disk drive, and most were sold with PC DOS and sufficient RAM to at least run Disk BASIC—many could run Advanced BASIC as well. There were three versions of Cassette BASIC: C1.00 (found on the early IBM PCs with 16k-64k motherboards), C1.10 (found on all later IBM PCs, XTs, ATs, and PS/2s), and C1.20 (found on the PCjr).|$|E
5000|$|Operating system: IBM PC DOS 2.10, (Boots to <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> without {{cartridge}} or DOS) ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "GL" [...] was {{the most}} popular model. It {{featured}} the same silver-painted 13" [...] steel wheels as the [...] "L" [...] but with satin chrome half-width centre caps (only covering the centre of the wheel), a digital clock {{on the top of the}} dashboard, cloth interior trim, grey body side mouldings, a rear windscreen wiper, grey tailgate and beaver panel garnishes and 50/50 split-fold rear seat. The stereo was an analogue-tuned AM/FM unit with a <b>basic</b> <b>cassette</b> player. Air conditioning was optional as a dealer-fit accessory. Power was provided by a 1.6-litre engine, with 4-speed manual transmission (5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic was optional). Sedan and wagon came standard with five-speed transmission.|$|R
5000|$|The game is {{controlled}} by three of the keyboard cursor control keys (left, forward and right, respectively 5, 7 and 8 on the ZX81 keyboard). The game speed can also be controlled — according to the original <b>cassette</b> inlay, the <b>BASIC</b> line 370 has a hardwired constant determining a busy waiting loop delay. The constant initially is set to 5; by varying it from 0 to 9 the game can be adjusted from faster to slower tempo. The 6 frame/s figure corresponds to the delay set to zero, while holding the [...] "forward" [...] key to run straight. A somewhat jerky motion is perceived at this slow framerate which gives {{a feeling of being}} jerked along with each step of a desperate heavy run.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{engineering}} of fusion proteins {{has become}} increasingly important and most recently has {{formed the basis of}} many biosensors, protein purification systems, and classes of new drugs. Currently, most fusion proteins consist of three or fewer domains, however, more sophisticated designs could easily involve three or more domains. Using traditional subcloning strategies, this requires micromanagement of restriction enzymes sites that results in complex workaround solutions, if any at all. Results Therefore, to aid in the efficient construction of fusion proteins involving multiple domains, we have created a new expression vector that allows us to rapidly generate a library of cassettes. Cassettes have a standard vector structure based on four specific restriction endonuclease sites and using a subtle property of blunt or compatible cohesive end restriction enzymes, they can be fused in any order and number of times. Furthermore, the insertion of PCR products into our expression vector or the recombination of cassettes can be dramatically simplified by screening for {{the presence or absence of}} fluorescence. Conclusions Finally, the utility of this new strategy was demonstrated by the creation of <b>basic</b> <b>cassettes</b> for protein targeting to subcellular organelles and for protein purification using multiple affinity tags. </p...|$|R

50|$|GW-BASIC, {{launched}} in 1983, was a disk-based Microsoft product distributed with non-IBM MS-DOS computers, and supported all the graphics modes and features of BASICA on computers {{that did not}} have the IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tarbell {{also sold}} other products, {{including}} TARBELL <b>CASSETTE</b> <b>BASIC</b> in 1978 and a Shugart Associates-compatible dual disk drive subsystem. The latter includes a Tarbell floppy disk interface, said to plug into any S-100 bus computer, introduced in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The first Portables used Compaq DOS 1.13, {{essentially}} {{identical to}} PC DOS 1.10 except {{for having a}} standalone BASIC that did not require the IBM PC's ROM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC,</b> but this was superseded {{in a few months}} by DOS 2.00 which added hard disk support and other advanced features.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft's early {{products}} were different variants of Microsoft BASIC {{which was the}} dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as Apple II (Applesoft BASIC) and Commodore 64 (Commodore BASIC), and were also provided with early versions of the IBM PC as the IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "IBM Personal Computer XT", IBM model 5160, was {{introduced}} {{two years after}} the PC and featured a 10 megabyte hard drive. It had eight expansion slots but the same processor and clock speed as the PC. The XT had no cassette jack, but still had the <b>Cassette</b> <b>Basic</b> interpreter in ROMs.|$|E
50|$|Compaq BASIC 1.13 was {{the first}} {{standalone}} BASIC for the PC (that did not require <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> to run) {{as well as the}} only version of BASIC besides IBM BASICA 1.00 and 1.10 to use FCBs and include the original LINE statement with intersecting lines (the PAINT statement in Compaq BASIC 1.13 worked like in all later versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC, using the new fill algorithm and no stack).|$|E
50|$|IBM Disk BASIC (BASIC.COM) was {{included}} in the original IBM PC DOS and required 32 KB of RAM. Because it uses the 32 KB <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> ROM, BASIC.COM did not run on even highly compatible PC clones such as the Compaq Portable. The name Disk BASIC came from its use of floppy disks rather than cassette tapes to store programs and data. Disk-based code corrected errata in the ROM-resident code and added floppy disk and serial port support.|$|E
5000|$|Disk BASIC {{could be}} {{identified}} by its use of the letter D preceding the version number. It added disk support and some features lacking in <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC,</b> but {{did not include the}} extended sound/graphics functions of BASICA. The primary purpose of Disk BASIC was as a [...] "lite" [...] version for IBM PCs with only 64k of memory. By 1986, all new PCs shipped with at least 256k and DOS versions after 3.00 reduced Disk BASIC to only a small stub that called BASICA.COM for compatibility with batch files.|$|E
5000|$|IBM Advanced BASIC (BASICA.COM) {{was also}} {{included}} in the original IBM PC DOS, and required 48 KB of RAM and the ROM-resident code of <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b> It added functions such as diskette file access, storing programs on disk, monophonic sound using the PC's built-in speaker, graphics functions to set and clear pixels, draw lines and circles, and set colors, and event handling for communications and joystick presses. BASICA would not run on non-IBM computers (even so-called [...] "100% compatible" [...] machines) or later IBM models, since those lack the needed ROM BASIC.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first version}} of DONKEY.BAS was {{released}} in 1981, followed by version 1.10 in 1982. The operating systems with which the game was first distributed still work on modern computers with compatible BIOS and 5.25-inch floppy drives, however IBM BASICA which ran the program under PC DOS 1.x requires ROM-based IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC,</b> which modern computers do not have. The source code is still available. The game may be played with the GW-BASIC (original code) or QBasic (adapted code) interpreters or in compiled form (see [...] "external links" [...] below).|$|E
50|$|IBM's PS/2 was {{designed}} to remain software compatible with their PC/AT/XT line of computers upon which the large PC clone market was built, but the hardware was quite different. PS/2 had two BIOSes; one was named ABIOS (Advanced BIOS) which provided a new protected mode interface and was used by OS/2, {{and the other was}} named CBIOS (Compatible BIOS) which was included in order for the PS/2 to be software compatible with the PC/AT/XT. CBIOS was so compatible that it even included <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b> While IBM did not publish the BIOS source code, it did promise to publish BIOS entry points.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{memory area}} (UMA) {{refers to the}} address space between 640 KiB and 1024 KiB (0xA0000-0xFFFFF). Three 128 KiB regions were defined in this area. The 128 KiB region between 0xA0000 and 0xBFFFF was {{reserved}} for video adapter screen memory. The physical address space between 0xC0000 and 0xDFFFF was reserved for device BIOS ROMs, and special RAM usually shared with physical devices (for example, shared memory for a network adapter). The IBM PC reserved the uppermost 128 KiB of the address space from 0xE0000 to 0xFFFFF for the ROM BIOS and <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> read-only memory (ROM).|$|E
5000|$|The system {{operated}} PC DOS 2.11 {{as well as}} Microsoft Disk BASIC and Microsoft Advanced BASIC. Like the PC, if {{the system}} was left to boot without inserting a diskette {{into one of the}} drives the Microsoft <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> interpreter would be loaded, which was compatible with IBM PCjr BASIC, including Cartridge BASIC. PC DOS 2.11 could only use half of the tracks of a 3.5" [...] drive, however, since it didn't really understand what a 3.5" [...] drive even was. The PCjx's BIOS could only address the first 40 tracks, like a 5.25" [...] drive.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} IBM PC BIOS (and <b>cassette</b> <b>BASIC)</b> was {{stored on}} mask-programmed read-only memory (ROM) chips in sockets on the motherboard. ROMs could be replaced, but not altered, by users. To allow for updates, many compatible computers used re-programmable memory {{devices such as}} EPROM and later flash memory devices. According to Robert Braver, {{the president of the}} BIOS manufacturer Micro Firmware, Flash BIOS chips became common around 1995 because the electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) chips are cheaper and easier to program than standard ultraviolet erasable PROM (EPROM) chips. Flash chips are programmed (and re-programmed) in-circuit, while EPROM chips need to be removed from the motherboard for re-programming. BIOS versions are upgraded to take advantage of newer versions of hardware and to correct bugs in previous revisions of BIOSes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{behavior}} if the BIOS {{does not}} find a bootable device has varied as personal computers developed. The original IBM PC and XT had Microsoft <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> in ROM, and if no bootable device was found, ROM BASIC was started by calling INT 18h. Therefore, barring a hardware failure, an original IBM PC or XT would never fail to boot, either into BASIC or from disk (or through an option ROM). One model of the original IBM PC was available with no disk drive; a cassette recorder could be attached via the cassette port on the rear, for loading and saving BASIC programs to tape. Since few programs used BASIC in ROM, clone PC makers left it out; then a computer that failed to boot from a disk would display [...] "No ROM BASIC" [...] and halt (in response to INT 18h).|$|E
50|$|The IBM Personal Computer Basic, {{commonly}} shortened to IBM BASIC, is a {{programming language}} first released by IBM with the IBM Personal Computer (model 5150) in 1981. IBM released four {{different versions of the}} Microsoft BASIC interpreter, licensed from Microsoft for the PC and PCjr. They are known as <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC,</b> Disk BASIC, Advanced BASIC (BASICA), and Cartridge BASIC. Versions of Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC were included with IBM PC DOS up to PC DOS 4. In addition to the features of an ANSI standard BASIC, the IBM versions offered support for the graphics and sound hardware of the IBM PC line. Source code could be typed in with a full screen editor, and very limited facilities were provided for rudimentary program debugging. IBM also released a version of the Microsoft BASIC compiler for the PC, concurrently with the release of PC DOS 1.10 in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Motherboards {{contain some}} {{non-volatile}} memory to initialize {{the system and}} load some startup software, usually an operating system, from some external peripheral device. Microcomputers such as the Apple II and IBM PC used ROM chips mounted in sockets on the motherboard. At power-up, the central processor would load its program counter with {{the address of the}} boot ROM and start executing instructions from the ROM. These instructions initialized and tested the system hardware, displayed system information on the screen, performed RAM checks, and then loaded an initial program from an external or peripheral device. If none was available, then the computer would perform tasks from other memory stores or display an error message, depending on the model and design of the computer and the ROM version. For example, both the Apple II and the original IBM PC had Microsoft <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> in ROM and would start that if no program could be loaded from disk.|$|E
50|$|Kildall {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} PC DOS, examined it, and concluded that it infringed on CP/M. When he asked Gerry Davis what legal options were available, Davis told him that intellectual property law for software was not clear enough to sue.Instead Kildall only threatened IBM with legal action, and IBM responded with a proposal to offer CP/M-86 as an option for the PC {{in return for a}} release of liability.Kildall accepted, believing that IBM's new system (like its previous personal computers) would not be a significant commercial success.When the IBM PC was introduced, IBM sold its operating system as an unbundled option. One of the operating system options was PC DOS, priced at US$40. PC DOS was seen as a practically necessary option; most software titles required it and without it the IBM PC was limited to its built-in <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC.</b> CP/M-86 shipped a few months later six times more expensive at $240, but sold poorly against DOS and enjoyed far less software support.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} the {{original}} IBM PC (IBM machine type 5150) was released in 1981, the BASIC in ROM was a key feature. Contemporary popular personal computers such as the Commodore 64 and the Apple II line also had Microsoft <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> in ROM (though Commodore renamed their licensed version Commodore BASIC), so in {{a substantial portion of}} its intended market, the IBM PC needed BASIC to compete. As on those other systems, the IBM PC's ROM BASIC served as a primitive diskless operating system, allowing the user to load, save, and run programs, as well as to write and refine them. (The original IBM PC was also the only PC model from IBM that, like its aforementioned two competitors, included cassette interface hardware. A base model IBM PC had only 16 KiB of RAM and no disk drives of any kind, so the cassette interface and BASIC in ROM were essential to make the base model usable. Of the five 8 KiB ROM chips in an original IBM PC, totaling 40 KiB, four contain BASIC and only one contains the BIOS; the ROM BASIC accounts for over half of the total system memory to be precise.) ...|$|E
5000|$|When IBM was {{designing}} the IBM PC {{they followed the}} paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft - IBM <b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> - but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for MS-DOS/PC DOS including IBM Disk BASIC (BASIC D), IBM BASICA (BASIC A), GW-BASIC (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and QBasic, all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo Pascal-publisher Borland published Turbo Basic 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name PowerBASIC). Microsoft wrote the windowed AmigaBASIC that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks. These languages introduced many extensions to the original home-computer BASIC, such as improved string manipulation and graphics support, access to the file system and additional data types. More important were the facilities for structured programming, including additional control structures and proper subroutines supporting local variables. However, by {{the latter half of}} the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others, rather than learning programming themselves, while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers. C and later C++ became the languages of choice for professional [...] "shrink wrap" [...] application development.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cassette</b> <b>BASIC</b> loads when a PC or PCjr is booted {{without a}} {{bootable}} disk or cartridge. Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC load when their command name (BASIC and BASICA respectively) is typed at a DOS command prompt (except PCjr, which activates Cartridge BASIC instead), with some optional parameters to control allocation of memory. When loaded, a sign-on identification message displays the program version number, and a full-screen text editor starts (see images, right). The function keys are assigned common commands, which {{display at the}} bottom of the screen. Commands may be typed in to load or save programs, and expressions can be typed in and executed in direct (immediate) mode. If a line of input starts with a number, the language system stores the following line of text as part of program source, allowing a programmer to enter in an entire program line by line, entering line numbers before each statement. When listed on screen, lines are displayed in order of increasing line number. Changes can be made to a displayed line of program source code by moving the cursor to the line with the cursor keys, and typing over the on-screen text. Program source is stored internally in a tokenized form, where keywords are replaced with a single byte token, to save space and execution time. Programs may be saved in compact tokenized form, or optionally saved as DOS text ASCII files that can be viewed and edited with other programs. Like most other DOS applications, IBM BASIC is a text-mode program and has no features for windows, icons, mouse support, or cut and paste editing.|$|E
