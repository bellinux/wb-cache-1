5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food.

These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E

The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical cyclones, {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather {{over much of the}} Earth. Extratropical cyclones are <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of cyclones are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the Earth. In contrast with tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E
