40|$|For {{structures}} {{that can be}} treated as networks of rigid, corner-connected polyhedra, the dominant distortion modes can be described by so-called rigid <b>unit</b> <b>modes</b> that are close to zero frequency. This type of behaviour is common in zeolitic/zeotypic materials such as the AlPO 4 family of compounds and has been suggested by some authors to {{play a significant role}} in molecular diffusion within the pores of such compounds. We explore the energy and temperature dependence of these modes in AlPO 4 - 5 using inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements.

They do not however reach a conclusion concerning heat conduction. To determine {{the nature of the}} heat carriers in the amorphous phase, we carry out an ultrashort timescale analysis of heat transfer in béta-cristobalite; the behaviour is comparable to that of amorphous silica, as shown by our density of states and heat flux autocorrelation function calculations. We prove that rigid <b>unit</b> <b>modes</b> can be identified as the heat carriers by showing that the thermal relaxation time is in very good agreement with the rigid <b>unit</b> <b>mode</b> relaxation time predicted in the literature.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a model for}} framework silicates in which the SiO 4 (and AIO 4) tetrahedra re treated as perfectly rigid and freely jointed. From this model {{we are able to}} identify low-energy modes of distortion of the structure, which we call Rigid <b>unit</b> <b>modes.</b> These modes can act as soft modes to allow easy distortions at phase transition. We discuss three forces that will operate at a phase transition in conjunction with the candidate soft modes to determine which of the rigid <b>unit</b> <b>modes</b> will actually precipitate a phase transition, and illustrate these ideas by detailed iscussions of the phase transitions in quartz, leucite and cristobalite. The model {{can also be used to}} estimate the transition temperature, and the theory highlights an important role for the stiffness of the tetrahedra.
