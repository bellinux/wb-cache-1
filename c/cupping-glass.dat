He then fomented the parts which had sustained injury, never failing to murmur prayers or spells, {{which of the two}} Waverley could not distinguish, as his ear only caught the words Gaspar-Melchior-Balthazar-max-prax-fax, and similar gibberish. The fomentation had a speedy effect in alleviating the pain and swelling, which our hero imputed to the virtue of the herbs or the effect of the chafing, but which was by the bystanders unanimously ascribed to the spells with which the operation had been accompanied. Edward was given to understand that not one of the ingredients had been gathered except during the full moon, and that the herbalist had, while collecting them, uniformly recited a charm, which in English ran thus:-- ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Sisters Olga and Yevgenia, in 1995 in {{a letter}} {{addressed}} to the senior priest of the Buchyn’s temple of that time, told the story about healing of their brother Vasyl. Sisters live in Pinsk now. [...] "Once a time our mother took our brother Vasylko to the forest. He was one year old that time {{and he was just}} making his first steps to kick some bark for weaving. Vasyl began crying loudly and no one was able to calm him. He had been staying in bed for two weeks, even when he was able to go by his own. Our mother was cried because of that grief every day. Three years had passed since that accident, but he didn’t begin to go. Once a time our inconsolable mother saw an old man in slumber, who advised her to make the round of 9 yards, to ask wax, to make a candle and take it to Buchyn icon of Mother of God. The women made everything as the old man had ordered. Our mother tearfully asked Mother of God to help her. Vasylko was walking in the house, when the mother returned. All honour to our Queen of Heaven for her grace." [...] 2. The seniour priest of Buchyn, Sergiy Kulchytskyi ,recalled the memories about his life trial, which were written down by his daughter Valentyna. The Theotokos of Buchyn helped him to survive. [...] Sergiy Kulchytskyi 1946 : «It was snowing after in 1938 years after the Protection Mother of God. I {{got up and went to}} feed cows at seven o’clock in the morning. While I was going back, my little son was running to me just in a nightshirt. I quickly leaned him up and went to the house. He had measles before it, but rash had passed away. Slavko caught terrible cold then. After a few days the temperature began to rise. We tried to help him at home, asked medical assistant, Demyan, for help, made <b>cupping-glass</b> and gave him milk with honey, but it didn’t help. The temperature was 39, then 40 and 40,5. I went to the doctor in Lyubashiv. It was an old , experienced doctor, he was 76 years old. He dressed a warm sheepskin coat and went with us. When the doctor inspected my so, examined his chest , nodded and said: «He has pneumonia-inflammation of the lungs with congestion. His state of the health is very dangerous, you should hope for God. I have done everything possible, have given him milk with honey to drink.» The doctor explained us that Slavko had caught cold because of having measles before it. Slavko felt asleep and temperature began decrease, and it was 38 in the morning, he became cheerful and had a snack. Temperature was decreasing. I felt something bad in my bones and invited deacon Nykon Naumovych and church warden Hnat with his wife. At 5 oclock p.m. the temperature was 35. He was ill,his eyes were closed. At 9 p.m. the temperature was 35 and pulse was remiss. I asked the deacon to check it, because I was very nervous and wasn’t able to recognize it. The deacon didn’t hear it, too. I wrapped up Slavko in my sheepskin coat, carried him but the breathing wasn’t heard. I laid him down, his eyes were closed. Somebody said me to be quiet, because he was dying. I took a candle into his arms, the second one put near icons. I told my wife to go to the church and pray in front of Mother of God. I stayed near our son. She went to the church with church warden at midnight. Slavko had no features of life. It continued till 5 a.m. Suddenly I saw pulsating artery on his neck. He was alive. Nearly 6 o’clock he opened his eyes and whispered «father». We gave him some milk with honey, then some tea. Later, he had good appetite, put on weight and run till summer.» ...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} examples of effective using of sliding <b>cupping-glass</b> massage for disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and removal of weariness. This {{is kind of}} massage including combination influences to patient’s back and chest by cupping-glasses and massage. However, work of masseur is connected with a big physical stress. Moreover, masseur can make the massage only with one patient by two hands. As a result daily productivity of the masseur is limited. Therefore advanced intelligence carried massage robots are needed for sliding <b>cupping-glass</b> massage, being able to work autonomously without {{the presence of the}} masseur. In this paper, a novel approach to a creation of intelligence self-propelled autonomous portable massage robot based on original 2 D parallel mechanism is presented. This robot based on triangular parallel structure with 3 d. o. f., called the Triangle, is designed for sliding <b>cupping-glass</b> massage for back and chest. Main massage manipulations of robot are presented along with a description of proposed locomotion algorithms. Locomotion and manipulation experiments are performed by pneumatic prototypes. We examine design principles of the Triangle as future intelligent base block for various rehabilitation and other robotic systems that can self-propelled and self-reconfigure...|$|E
50|$|Having {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the Peninsular War, he settled at Oporto as surgeon to the Portuguese forces. There he married Miss Whately, sister of the future Archbishop. Returning to England in 1820, he perfected himself by further study, and in 1826 published his researches relative to the absorption of poison, and the means of counteracting it by the application of <b>cupping-glasses.</b> He was employed by Government in several medical inquiries, {{both at home and}} abroad, {{and was one of the}} commissioners in the investigations that led to the Factory Acts.|$|R
6000|$|Last spring, Miss Young, the {{daughter}} of Dr. Young, had occasion to call on me on some business, in which I had hopes of serving her. As I endeavoured {{to explain to her}} what I had to say, I had the horror to find I could not make myself understood. I stammered, stuttered, said one word in place of another--did all but speak; Miss Young went away frightened enough, poor thing; and Anne and Violet Lockhart were much alarmed. I was bled with <b>cupping-glasses,</b> took medicine, and lived on panada; but in two or three days I was well again. The physicians thought, or said at least, that the evil was from the stomach. It is very certain that I have seemed to speak with an impediment, and I was, or it might be fancied myself, troubled with a mispronouncing and hesitation. I felt this particularly at the Election, and sometimes in society. This went on till last November, when Lord ------ came out to make me a visit. I had for a long time taken only one tumbler of whisky and water without the slightest reinforcement. This night I took a very little drop, {{not so much as a}} bumper glass, of whisky altogether. It made no difference on my head that I could discover, but when I went to the dressing-room I sank stupefied on the floor. I lay a minute or two--was not found, luckily, gathered myself up, and got to my bed. I was alarmed at this second warning, consulted Abercrombie and Ross, and got a few restrictive orders as to diet. I am forced to attend to them; for, as Mrs. Cole says, [...] "Lack-a-day! a thimbleful oversets me." ...|$|R
60|$|The Castle of this ogress and child-queller {{was in a}} steep by-street at Brighton; {{where the}} soil was more than usually chalky, flinty, and sterile, and the houses were more than usually brittle and thin; where the small front-gardens had the unaccountable {{property}} of producing nothing but marigolds, whatever was sown in them; and where snails were constantly discovered {{holding on to the}} street doors, and other public places they were not expected to ornament, with the tenacity of <b>cupping-glasses.</b> In the winter time the air couldn't be got out of the Castle, and in the summer time it couldn't be got in. There was such a continual reverberation of wind in it, that it sounded like a great shell, which the inhabitants were obliged to hold to their ears night and day, whether they liked it or no. It was not, naturally, a fresh-smelling house; and in the window of the front parlour, which was never opened, Mrs Pipchin kept a collection of plants in pots, which imparted an earthy flavour of their own to the establishment. However choice examples of their kind, too, these plants were of a kind peculiarly adapted to the embowerment of Mrs Pipchin. There were half-a-dozen specimens of the cactus, writhing round bits of lath, like hairy serpents; another specimen shooting out broad claws, like a green lobster; several creeping vegetables, possessed of sticky and adhesive leaves; and one uncomfortable flower-pot hanging to the ceiling, which appeared to have boiled over, and tickling people underneath with its long green ends, reminded them of spiders--in which Mrs Pipchin's dwelling was uncommonly prolific, though perhaps it challenged competition still more proudly, in the season, in point of earwigs.|$|R
60|$|January 31 [to February 9, Edinburgh].--Retain my purpose, however, {{and set out}} for Edinburgh alone--that is, no one but my servant. The snow became impassable, and in Edinburgh I remain {{immovably}} fixed for ten days--that is, till Wednesday--never once {{getting out}} of doors, save to dinner, when I went and returned in a sedan chair. I commenced my quarantine in Mackenzie's Hotel,[425] where I was deadly cold, and it was tolerably noisy. The second day Mr. Cadell {{made a point of}} my coming to his excellent house, where I had no less excellent an apartment and the most kind treatment--- that is, not making a show of me, for which I was in but bad tune.[426] The physical folks, Abercrombie and Ross, bled me with <b>cupping-glasses,</b> purged me confoundedly, and restricted me of all creature comforts. But they did me good, as I am sure they meant to do sincerely; and I got rid of a giddy feeling, which I have been plagued with, and have certainly returned much better. I did not neglect my testamentary affairs. I executed my last will, leaving Walter burdened, by his own choice, with £1000 to Sophia, and another received at her marriage, and £2000 to Anne, and the same to Charles. He is to advance them money if they want it; if not, to pay them interest, which is his own choice, otherwise I would have sold the books and rattletraps. I have made provisions for clearing my estate by my publications, should it be possible; and should that prove possible, from the time of such clearance being effected, to be a fund available to all my children who shall be alive or leave representatives. My bequests must, many of them, seem hypothetical; but the thing, being uncertain, must be so stated.|$|R
