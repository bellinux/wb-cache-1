5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of <b>collimated</b> <b>light,</b> light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of <b>collimated</b> <b>light</b> created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

50|$|The {{dispersion}} or diffraction is only controllable if {{the light}} is collimated, that is if all the rays of light are parallel, or practically so. A source, like the sun, which is very far away, provides <b>collimated</b> <b>light.</b> Newton used sunlight in his famous experiments. In a practical monochromator, however, the light source is close by, and an optical system in the monochromator converts the diverging light of the source to <b>collimated</b> <b>light.</b> Although some monochromator designs do use focusing gratings that do not need separate collimators, most use collimating mirrors. Reflective optics are preferred {{because they do not}} introduce dispersive effects of their own.|$|E

50|$|Paraboloids {{arise in}} several {{physical}} situations as well. The best-known instance is the parabolic reflector, {{which is a}} mirror or similar reflective device that concentrates light {{or other forms of}} electromagnetic radiation to a common focal point, or conversely, <b>collimates</b> <b>light</b> from a point source at the focus into a parallel beam. The principle of the parabolic reflector may have been discovered in the 3rd century BC by the geometer Archimedes, who, according to a dubious legend, constructed parabolic mirrors to defend Syracuse against the Roman fleet, by concentrating the sun's rays to set fire to the decks of the Roman ships. The principle was applied to telescopes in the 17th century. Today, paraboloid reflectors can be commonly observed throughout much of the world in microwave and satellite-dish receiving and transmitting antennas.|$|R

40|$|Improved {{optoelectronic}} instruments (specially configured digital cameras) {{for reading}} direct-marked data-matrix symbols on {{the surfaces of}} optically reflective objects (including specularly reflective ones) are undergoing development. Data-matrix symbols are two-dimensional binary patterns that are used, like common bar codes, for automated identification of objects. The first data-matrix symbols were checkerboard-like patterns of black-and-white rectangles, typically existing in the forms of paint, ink, or detachable labels. The major advantage of direct marking (the marks are more durable than are painted or printed symbols or detachable labels) is offset by a major disadvantage (the marks generated by some marking methods do not provide sufficient contrast to be readable by optoelectronic instruments designed to read black-and-white data-matrix symbols). Heretofore, elaborate lighting, lensing, and software schemes have been tried in efforts to solve the contrast problem in direct-mark matrix- symbol readers. In comparison with prior readers based on those schemes, the readers now undergoing development {{are expected to be}} more effective while costing less. All of the prior direct-mark matrix-symbol readers are designed to be aimed perpendicularly to marked target surfaces, and they tolerate very little angular offset. However, the reader now undergoing development not only tolerates angular offset but depends on angular offset as a means of obtaining the needed contrast, as described below. The prototype reader (see Figure 1) includes an electronic camera {{in the form of a}} charge-coupled-device (CCD) image detector equipped with a telecentric lens. It also includes a source of <b>collimated</b> visible <b>light</b> and a source of <b>collimated</b> infrared <b>light</b> for illuminating a target. The visible and infrared illumination complement each other: the visible illumination is more useful for aiming the reader toward a target, while the infrared illumination is more useful for reading symbols on highly reflective surfaces. By use of beam splitters, the visible and infrared <b>collimated</b> <b>lights</b> are introduced along the optical path of the telecentric lens, so that the target is illuminated and viewed from the same direction...|$|R
