5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E

5|$|The International Telecommunication Union uses {{an internationally}} agreed system for {{classifying}} radio frequency signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified {{according to its}} bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal.</b> It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the parallel universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E
25|$|Conventional amplitude-modulated signals can be {{considered}} wasteful of power and bandwidth because they contain a <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> and two identical sidebands. Therefore, SSB transmitters are generally designed to minimize the amplitude of the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal.</b> When the carrier {{is removed from the}} transmitted signal, it is called suppressed-carrier SSB.|$|E

40|$|A {{correction}} to a {{differential phase}} measurement used for vehicle attitude determination on nonaligned antenna arrays {{is determined by}} calculating a carrier phase angle of <b>carrier</b> <b>signals</b> received by each antenna, and correcting the measurement for the right-hand circular polarization effect on the nonaligned antennas. Accordingly, circular polarization effects of the <b>carrier</b> <b>signals</b> are removed from a nonaligned antenna array, allowing the nonaligned antenna array {{to be used for}} vehicle attitude determination...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} method {{based on}} anisotropic diffusion notion is proposed {{in this paper}} to remove noise from noisy signals modulated with multiple <b>carrier</b> <b>signals</b> by preserving <b>carrier</b> <b>signals</b> as well as discontinuities present in the original noiseless signals. Gaussian and correlated noise contaminating signals with up to four carriers are considered here. Our algorithm proposed here is implemented with both explicit and semi-implicit discretization schemes.

25|$|Like {{traditional}} physical watermarks, digital watermarks {{are often}} only perceptible under certain conditions, i.e. after using some algorithm. If a digital watermark distorts the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> {{in a way}} that it becomes easily perceivable, it may be considered less effective depending on its purpose. Traditional watermarks may be applied to visible media (like images or video), whereas in digital watermarking, the signal may be audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. A signal may carry several different watermarks at the same time. Unlike metadata that is added to the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal,</b> a digital watermark does not change the size of the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Very large {{radio telescopes}} on Earth were also {{listening}} to Huygens 10-watt transmission using {{the technique of}} very long baseline interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on January 14, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> from Huygens. The GBT continued to detect the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> well after Cassini stopped listening to the incoming data stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also listened for the Huygens signal.|$|E
25|$|An OFDM <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> {{is the sum}} of {{a number}} of {{orthogonal}} sub-carriers, with baseband data on each sub-carrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK). This composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier.|$|E

50|$|A {{carrier system}} is a {{telecommunications}} system that transmits information, such as the voice signals of a telephone call and the video signals of television, by modulation of one or multiple <b>carrier</b> <b>signals</b> above the principal voice frequency or data rate.|$|R
25|$|The needed {{properties}} of a digital watermark {{depend on the}} use case {{in which it is}} applied. For marking media files with copyright information, a digital watermark has to be rather robust against modifications that {{can be applied to the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>signal.</b> Instead, if integrity has to be ensured, a fragile watermark would be applied.|$|E
25|$|SSTV uses analog {{frequency}} modulation, {{in which}} every different value of brightness in the image gets a different audio frequency. In other words, the signal frequency shifts up or down to designate brighter or darker pixels, respectively. Color is achieved by sending the brightness of each color component (usually red, green and blue) separately. This signal can be fed into an SSB transmitter, which in part modulates the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Telecommunications {{engineering}} {{focuses on the}} transmission of information across a channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; {{this is known as}} modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.|$|E

25|$|In fiber-optic communications, wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) is {{a technology}} which multiplexes {{a number of}} optical <b>carrier</b> <b>signals</b> onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths (i.e., colors) of laser light.

25|$|However, {{in order}} for a {{receiver}} to reproduce the transmitted audio without distortion, it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, SSB transmissions can sound unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original <b>carrier</b> <b>signal</b> can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to synchronize with the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This mode of transmission is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.|$|E
25|$|This {{experiment}} used an ultra-stable oscillator {{to improve}} {{communication with the}} probe by giving it a very stable carrier frequency. This instrument was also {{used to measure the}} wind speed in Titan's atmosphere by measuring the Doppler shift in the <b>carrier</b> <b>signal.</b> The swinging motion of the probe beneath its parachute due to atmospheric properties may also have been detected. Failure of ground controllers to turn on the receiver in the Cassini orbiter caused the loss of this data. Earth-based radio telescopes were able to reconstruct some of it. Measurements started 150 kilometres above Titan's surface, where Huygens was blown eastwards at more than 400 kilometres per hour, agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at 200 kilometres altitude, made {{over the past few years}} using telescopes. Between 60 and 80 kilometres, Huygens was buffeted by rapidly fluctuating winds, which are thought to be vertical wind shear. At ground level, the Earth-based doppler shift and VLBI measurements show gentle winds of a few metres per second, roughly in line with expectations.|$|E
