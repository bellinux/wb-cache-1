5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
25|$|The first captain {{to declare}} was Charles Wright in 1890. In {{a game against}} Kent at the Bat and Ball Ground in Gravesend, Wright {{declared}} Nottinghamshire's second innings closed on 157 for 5 to set Kent a target of 231 to win. However, the tactic did not <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> the game was drawn with Kent on 98 for 9 and Nottinghamshire requiring one more wicket to win.|$|E

5000|$|Jet: (voiced by Brent Hirose) A Pteranodon. <b>Comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> {{the most}} street smart and (modern) worldly of the Posse, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} language (referring to many people as [...] "Dudes"). He <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> rude, somewhat of a jerk, and full of himself but can be helpful, and quick to cover up a situation with words to those who are unaware. At times, he can be quite hasty which gets him captured or into trouble, usually as a result of trying to command the Posse, and take charge from Kane.|$|R

25|$|At {{the finish}} of the 1966 Le Mans 24 hours, the two Shelby-American Inc. entered Ford GT40 MK II's were {{both on the}} lead lap, running first and second, with the car Hulme was partnering with Ken Miles in the lead. In the lead half-hour of the race, the Fords bunched up {{together}} in a pre-arranged plan for Bruce McLaren and Miles to cross the line, headlights ablaze, in a dead-heat. Unfortunately the dead-heat that Henry Ford II had so proudly planned did not <b>come</b> <b>off,</b> <b>as</b> the timekeepers decided that a dead-heat was technically impossible as the Hulme/Miles car had qualified faster than the McLaren/Amon car, and therefore covered a shorter race distance. Therefore, when the two cars arrived side-by-side at the finish, Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were classified as the winners with Hulme and Ken Miles in second.|$|E

I feel like we are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Carina MacKenzie {{wrote of}} the sixth-season episode [...] "Invasion": [...] "By far the best moment in this episode was Robbins' scene with Torres' father, Carlos. Jessica Capshaw has an {{incredible}} ability to take even the most melodramatic of [...] "Grey's" [...] speeches and deliver them with a subtlety and an honesty that makes them <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> sincere instead of overwrought. [...] "I was named for a battleship," [...] she said, and in the powerful monologue that followed, she calmly and carefully explained that Torres was still the woman Carlos raised.|$|E
500|$|IGN's [...] A.E. Sparrow {{said that}} {{compared}} with the film, the manga has [...] "a healthy amount of additional storylines, characters and dialogue..." [...] He also said, [...] "Mizu Sahara's artwork brings a bit of clarity to scenes that might have <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> muddled in the anime". Anime News Network's Theron Martin said the manga has [...] "strong storytelling which carries good emotional appeal, fleshes out the original anime" [...] but said it [...] "unnecessarily adds on to the ending", and that [...] "character designs were not Shinkai's strong point, and Sahara's are only a slight improvement".|$|E

His wife Sybil (Tanya Franks) is suspicious of his intentions. Later, during filming of Cleopatra, Elizabeth has {{a change of heart}} and invites Richard into her trailer for a drink. However, she accuses him of trying to seduce her.|$|R
50|$|Peggy Truman, Paul's {{wife and}} Will's sister-in-law, {{is played by}} Helen Slater. She was only shown in one episode and <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> waspish and {{suspicious}} of Grace's friendly behavior towards her own husband.|$|R

500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} {{land-based}} vehicles more responsive {{and easier to}} control than in previous games. Game Informers Bertz explained that [...] "cars have a proper sense of weight, while retaining the agility necessary for navigating through traffic at high speeds". In addition to the vehicle handling, most reviewers noted the shooting mechanics were tighter {{than they had been}} in previous games, but Destructoid's Sterling felt that in spite of the improvements, auto-aim was [...] "twitchy and unreliable" [...] and cover mechanics [...] "still <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> dated and unwieldy". Some reviewers felt the game solved a continual problem by adding mid-mission checkpoints.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews among television critics. The Los Angeles Times Carina MacKenzie's {{review of}} the episode was largely positive, though she called it [...] "immature" [...] of the episode's writers to have the characters in constant battle with one another, and deemed the Mercy West resident's orange scrubs unnecessary. MacKenzie highly praised the characterization of Kepner, in addition to Capshaw's performance, commenting: [...] "Jessica Capshaw has an incredible ability to take even the most melodramatic of Grey's [...] speeches and deliver them with a subtlety and an honesty that makes them <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> sincere instead of overwrought." [...] MacKenzie concluded that Karev, Yang, and Meredith had appropriate reactions to Stevens' departure.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} show Bart watches, Tuesday Night Live, is {{a parody of}} NBC's Saturday Night Live. Krusty appears in a sketch called [...] "The Big Ear Family", and says that the sketch goes on for twelve more minutes, even though the joke's punchline has already been established. That was Jon Vitti's way of criticizing Saturday Night Live for having overlong sketches with thin joke premises. The sequence originally had a longer version of the Tuesday Night Live band playing into the commercial break, but it was cut because Vitti, who was a writer on Saturday Night Live during the 1985–86 season along with fellow The Simpsons writers, George Meyer and John Swartzwelder, {{did not want to}} <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> being bitter.|$|E

500|$|The album's final parody is [...] "eBay", {{based on}} [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by Backstreet Boys. In this song, the narrator {{describes}} {{a variety of}} obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was going to shoot a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I probably should have done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concern with}} the nature of free will and {{determinism}} grew out of Morgan's difficulties with plotting and constructing plot-twists; he explained that Bruckman and the killer interact in ways [...] "that were really easy to plot, but which makes the story seem complicated." [...] While writing the character's lines, Morgan realized that Mulder, were he to interact with a [...] "normal person", would <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> sounding insane when in fact he {{is supposed to be a}} smart person. As such, Morgan decided to [...] "shake up Mulder's image" [...] to make him look slightly ridiculous; in the episode, Mulder views Bruckman [...] "only as a phenomenon" [...] and not as a person. To counter this, Morgan wrote Scully to see Bruckman, not as a psychic, but as a human.|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson rated the episode one star out of five, calling the premise and {{characters}} dull. The two criticized Anderson {{for looking at}} the [...] "minutiae of life too intensely", which made many of the actors and actresses <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> ciphers. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson were critical of Anderson's directing style, calling it [...] "pretentious", noting that the plot's significance was drowned out by unnecessary artistic flourishes and needless pizzazz. Paula Vitaris from CFQ gave the episode a negative review, awarding it onestar out of four. She called Anderson's directing [...] "heavy-handed" [...] and bemoaned the storyline because it [...] "plays havoc with Scully's motivations and character as established {{in the past seven}} years".|$|E
5000|$|The JazzTimes {{review by}} Mike Shanley states [...] "Everything {{has a strong}} sense of direction, even during moments when things sound spare and minimal. As a result, the album <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> the most focused Zooid release yet." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{story of}} Adam causing Ashley's {{miscarriage}} was named [...] "editor's choice" [...] by the magazine. Engen {{was nominated for}} a SoapCentral Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009. Some fans were upset that Adam and Rafe's [...] "sex scene" [...] was implied rather than shown onscreen; Branco spoke out about the issue, saying, [...] "ilming a sex scene between a straight and gay man could <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> offensive. Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc." [...] Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, [...] "or me, the way it was done was tasteful and it almost makes the audience wonder what exactly happened. You can create that in your head and try to interpret it by how the characters reacted afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} he was finally {{starting}} to understand Jenna, and how she fits into the show. He said that even though she was supposed to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> flighty and disillusioned at times, he realized that in reality she was not completely flighty and disillusioned. He also noted the development in Liz and Jenna's friendship, learning that they go [...] "way back" [...] as friends and as a comedy team. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad disagreed, however. She felt that the show had too many storylines and that this episode made it seem as if the show was about the relationship between Liz and Jenna, rather than the storylines introduced in the pilot. She said that having several ongoing storylines is possible, but the show needs some kind of center.|$|E
500|$|Among less {{favorable}} reviews, author Phil Farrand called [...] "Home" [...] his least-favorite {{episode of the}} first four seasons of the show in his book The Nitpicker's Guide to the X-Files, writing that he [...] "just [...] get this episode" [...] because [...] "Mulder and Scully seem reckless" [...] and the Peacock brothers [...] "are better suited for comic books". Paul Cornell, Keith Topping, and Martin Day, in their book X-Treme Possibilities, were critical of the violent content of the episode. Topping called the episode [...] "sick", Cornell felt that Mulder and Scully's wisecracks made them <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> cruel, and Day felt that the violence went overboard. Day, however, offered a few complimentary observations, noting that [...] "Home" [...] did, indeed, have merit, and that the juxtaposition of [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful!" [...] with the violent antics of the Peacocks was something [...] "David Lynch would be proud of".|$|E
