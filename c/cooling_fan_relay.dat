40|$|Article history: Because {{of their}} longer {{operating}} times and larger size relative to conventional <b>fans,</b> the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted in buses consume larger amounts of energy. Most of the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted {{in a bus}} {{are connected to the}} engine by a viscous clutch. A viscous cooling fanâ€™s speed is determined by its fluid temperature, which is affected by the air flow through the radiator. The fan does not react immediately to the coolant temperature and in doing so causes unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, the fuel economy of buses using viscous fans can be improved by changing to an electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> design, which can be actively controlled. In addition, electric power consumption is increased by using electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans.</b> Thus, when electric fans are applied in conjunction with the alternator management system (AMS), the fuel economy is further enhanced. In this study, simulations were performed to predict coolant temperature and <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> speeds. Simulations were performed for both viscous and electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> and power consumption was calculated. Additionally, fuel economy was calculated applying both the alternator management system and the electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|R

This {{paper is}} to study the {{variable}} frequency control against the compressor and the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> of an air-cooled chiller, and continues to measure and collect the actual operating data, by use of such data as the chilled water supply/return temperature, chilled water flow rate, power consumption, and ambient wet-bulb temperature to conduct the COP analysis of the air-conditioning system. The experimental results show that proper use of the frequency converter to change the operation frequency of the compressor and of the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> indeed can effectively enhance the COP of the air-cooled chiller operation, and reduce the power consumption of the compressor and the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> of the air-cooled chiller to achieve the energy-saving effect...|$|R

40|$|As {{commonly}} used forced convection air cooling devices in electronics, <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> are crucial for guaranteeing {{the reliability of}} electronic systems. In a <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> assembly, fan bearing failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation speed, locked rotor, failure to start, and other problems; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} conduct research on the health assessment of <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> bearings. This paper presents a vibration-based fan bearing health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for fan bearing degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of fan bearings. A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i. e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI. The analysis results suggest that the HCI can identify incipient fan bearing failures and describe the bearing degradation process. Overall, the work presented in this paper provides a promising method for fan bearing health evaluation and prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Bearings with an {{insufficient}} {{amount of}} lubricant {{can lead to}} early field failures, especially in applications which fail due to lubricant degradation, such as <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> used for thermal management of electronics. A reduced amount of lubricant can accelerate the wear process in the bearing, since {{there is not enough}} lubricant film thickness to support the operating load on the bearing. Qualification of bearings in <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> is carried out by time-truncated tests, where <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> have to operate without failure for a pre-determined period of time. Under-lubricated bearings can survive without failure in these tests leading to the usage of these bearings in the field resulting in field returns and warranty claims. A non-linear dynamic model of a ball bearing is develope...|$|R
