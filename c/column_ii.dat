The details of how the f-electrons correlate at low temperature to become so massive lacks a coherent theory, partially because so few materials display this heavy behavior and thus global trends remain unclear. UHg_{ 3 } is now found experimentally to be a heavy Fermion antiferromagnet, just as are all the other U_{x}M_{y} compounds with the metal M being in <b>column</b> <b>II</b> B (filled d electron shells) in the periodic table (Zn/Cd/Hg) and the spacing between Uranium ions being greater than the Hill limit of 3. 5 Angstroms.

40|$|Abstract: The generally-accepted {{explanation}} {{of the collapse of}} the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 is based on the speculative “theory ” of progressive buckling of bearing columns at the speed of free fall triggered by creep buckling of the columns of the floor subject to the conflagration from the spilled fuel, and by dynamic impact of the upper structure. In the present paper it is shown that this official “theory ” is wrong because it is built on false assumptions and incorrect calculations. The “theory” cannot explain the free fall, explosion sound, and pulverization of the buildings as well as other facts of this event. The simultaneous collapse of the neighboring 47 -story tower directly contradicts to the “theory”. It is shown that, consistent with all known facts of the matter, the scenario of all collapses was this: (i) heating of bearing columns in the “hot” spot caused high compressive thermal stresses in these <b>columns,</b> (<b>ii)</b> these stresses combined with internal stresses triggered a fracture wave, and (iii) the fracture wave disintegrated the entire building by invisible cracks for less than 0. 1 s producing the sound of explosion and providing the conditions necessary for free fall of steel fragments and dust clouds of tiny fragments of glass, marble and concrete. The theory of fracture waves, see Appendix 1, supports this scenario. The official “ theory ” is placed i...|$|R
