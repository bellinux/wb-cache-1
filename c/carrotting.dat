In vitro experimentation demonstrated that <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR nominally detected 10 CFU S. agalactiae after 4 h of <b>carrot</b> broth incubation with competitive flora. Detection rates improved with inocula of 100 and 1, 000 CFU S. agalactiae, with the majority of these aliquots demonstrating detection after 2 h of <b>carrot</b> broth incubation. <b>Carrot</b> broth was prospectively inoculated with clinical vaginal/anorectal swabs, with 500 -μl aliquots collected. Early aliquots from 227 specimens were subjected to <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR (early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR) in instances of subsequent positive <b>carrot</b> broth culture or positive overnight clinical <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR. The S. agalactiae detection rate by early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR (66. 1 %) exceeded that observed for 227 remnant swabs retrospectively tested by direct swab PCR (56. 4 %; P = 0. 03).

40|$|Abstract <b>Carrot</b> is {{one kind}} of {{vegetables}} that is highly consumed in Indonesia and foreign countries. <b>Carrots</b> are usually marketed {{in the form of}} unpeeled <b>carrots,</b> but now the demand of peeled <b>carrots</b> or minimally processed <b>carrots</b> increases significantly, especially for export. Unfortunately, the peeled <b>carrot</b> usually is more perishable than unpeeled <b>carrots.</b> Therefore, postharvest technology to maintain the quality of peeled <b>carrot</b> is required, one of them is wax coating technology. The aim of this research was to determine the best treatment of coating and storage temperature to maintain quality of peeled <b>carrot</b> during cold storage. Three kinds of storage temperatures (5, 10, 15 °C) and three kinds of coating (carnauba wax, chitosan, carnauba wax+chitosan) were applied in this research. The change of quality of peeled <b>carrot</b> during storage such as moisture content, weight loss, respiration rate, total plate count, color and organoleptic test was investigated. The results showed that the storage temperature significantly influenced the quality parameters analyzed.
