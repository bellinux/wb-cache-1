40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of optimal bus policy {{for dealing with}} fuel consumption in urban areas under different hypotheses of <b>car</b> <b>pricing</b> is investigated. The transport system of autos and buses is modelled as set of modes in equilibrium where bus service is provided {{with the objective of}} maximizing fuel savings over the whole of the road network and where <b>car</b> <b>pricing</b> is exogenously imposed by local authority. Results of a case study show that policies based on frequency, fare, and bus size alone have negligible effectiveness unless they are supported by <b>car</b> <b>pricing</b> measures. Also, the strong sensitivity of optimal bus operating parameters with respect to the time-to-fare elasticity ratio of demand is highlighted. ...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is {{a critical}} and highly visible urban problem. In land scarce Singapore, the problem is even more crucial {{and the government has}} resorted to gargantuan measures not only to curb car use but also car ownership. Besides a plethora of road-use taxes, a unique tax structure on car ownership is employed that comprises hefty taxes on new car purchases plus provisions for tax discounts if new car purchases are accompanied by the scrappage of old cars. Consequently, a thriving scrap car market has evolved in which scrap <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> exceed even new <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> in some other countries. This paper constructs a theoretical model to explain the determination of the equilibrium scrap <b>car</b> <b>prices.</b> The equilibrium properties are subject to empirical tests. The paper also discusses the welfare implications of this unique policy scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Car</b> <b>prices</b> in Europe are {{characterized}} by large and persistent differences across countries. This paper documents and explains this price dispersion. Using a panel data set extending from 1980 to 1993, two main facts concerning <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> in Europe are demonstrated: (1) the existence of significant differences in quality adjusted prices across countries, with Italy and the United Kingdom systematically representing the most expensive markets; (2) substantial year-to-year volatility that is, to a large extent, accounted for by exchange rate fluctuations and the incomplete response of local currency prices to these fluctuations. These facts are analyzed {{within the framework of}} a multi-product oligopoly model with product differentiation. The model identifies three potential sources for the international price differences: price elasticities generating differences in mark-ups; costs; and import quota constraints. Based on the results the authors conjecture that EMU will substantially reduce the year-to-year volatility observed in the <b>car</b> <b>price</b> datastatus: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{suggest to}} use Internet <b>car</b> sale <b>price</b> {{advertisements}} for measuring economic inequality between and within German regions. Our estimates of regional income levels and Gini indices based on advertisements are highly, {{positively correlated with}} the official figures. This implies that the observed <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> {{can serve as a}} reasonably good proxy for income levels. In contrast to the traditional measures, our data can be fast and inexpensively retrieved from the web, and more importantly allow to estimate Gini indices at the NUTS 2 level – something that never has been done before. Our approach to measuring regional inequality is a useful alternative source of information that could complement the officially available measures. <b>Car</b> <b>price</b> advertisements, economic inequality, German NUTS 1 and NUTS regions, Gini index, Internet...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of car user taxes on vehicle quality and demand for kilometres. First, holding <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> fixed, we find that a higher fuel tax leads {{households}} to choose cars of better fuel efficiency, provided that the demand for car use is inelastic. Surprisingly, a higher kilometre tax reduces the demand for fuel efficiency. Next, we study how <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> react to the tax changes. Fuel taxes make owning very fuel-efficient cars more expensive, while reducing <b>prices</b> of <b>cars</b> of low fuel efficiency. Both fuel taxes and kilometre charges imply lower prices for large and powerful cars...|$|R
