At each decision point constraints are posted that later decisions must obey. We use <b>constraint</b> <b>posting</b> to help verify that a circuit modelled at the analog level will exhibit its intended digital behavior. A circuit's analog behavior depends not only on the circuit's structure, but also on how the circuit is used. We post constraints to ensure that a circuit will only be used commensurate with its intended function.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Inspired by the {{popularity}} of anytime algorithms in solving complex real world problems, we define a class of scheduling problems. In addition to the normal resource constrained project scheduling assumptions, each activity in a project has a quality profile with an anytime property, which means {{that it can be}} stopped at any time {{and the quality of the}} output is proportional to its duration. Instead of finishing all activities as fast as possible, the goal of scheduling is to maximize the sum of qualities given a hard project due data. We formulate this quality maximization problem as a constraint-based optimization problem, analyze its complexity and present a precedence <b>constraint</b> <b>posting</b> procedure for generating a schedule with a good quality sum. Different <b>constraint</b> <b>posting</b> heuristics are evaluated based on the solution they can produce, CPU time and the number of posted constraints. 2 ̆...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} symmetry-breaking {{constraints}} is often evaluated empirically. In {{order to understand}} which symmetric configurations are removed {{by a set of}} constraints, we have to understand the underlying structure of the symmetry group in concern. A class of symmetry that frequently occurs in constraint programming is the row and column symmetries of a matrix model. In this paper, we study these symmetries from a structural viewpoint, and show how the graph of the associated group can be built. The graph can help us to understand the effect of certain symmetry-breaking <b>constraints</b> <b>posted</b> on a matrix model, though some questions remain open.

40|$|Abstract. In {{knowledge}} generating {{production processes}} such as intelligence gathering and news reporting, {{the quality of the}} result produced by a given activity depends on its duration, and, due to resource limitations and process deadlines, tradeoffs must invariably be made regarding how much time to devote to various activities to achieve maximum overall effect. In essense, some activities must be executed in faster time cycles than would be desirable under non-constraining circumstances, with consequent degradation of process quality. In this paper, we consider this type of scheduling problem, which we refer to generally as quality maximization. Starting with normal resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) assumptions, we define a new type of scheduling problem by additionally associating a quality profile with each activity in the project. Quality profiles have an “anytime ” property, implying that activities can be terminated at any point, with the quality of the output being proportional to duration. Instead of finishing all activities as fast as possible, the goal of scheduling in this context is to maximize the overall quality given a hard project due date. We formulate this quality maximization problem as a constraint-based optimization problem, and present a new <b>constraint</b> <b>posting</b> algorithm for solving this problem that incorporates a linear optimization program. Different <b>constraint</b> <b>posting</b> heuristics are defined and evaluated on a set of quality maximization RCPSP problems constructed from standard reference RCPSP problems. The experimental results show the overall effectiveness of our approach for generating schedules to maximize quality. And ratio-based heuristics provide a promising starting point for stochastic sampling or other schedule refining techniques by solving 100 % problems without backtracking. ...|$|E

40|$|Simple Temporal Networks (STNs) are {{frequently}} used in scheduling applications, as {{they provide a}} powerful and gen-eral tool for managing temporal constraints. One obstacle to their use in multi-agent scheduling contexts, however, is the additional problem of maintaining consistency across agent models. Like in centralized applications, unexpected exe-cution results (e. g., an activity taking longer to execute than planned) can introduce conflicts into an agent’s local model that require changes to its current local schedule. But in a dis-tributed environment these local changes must also be prop-agated to those other agents with interdependent decisions, and the asynchrony and latency of this communication can introduce inter-agent inconsistency. In this paper, we con-sider the problem of managing and recovering from detected inconsistencies in a distributed STN-based scheduling frame-work. Our approach exploits a higher, domain-level seman-tics of the temporal <b>constraints</b> <b>posted</b> in the STN to design a set of strategies to update the agent’s schedule and resolve the STN conflict.

However, the two-stage method is limited to exploring {{only a fraction of}} the space of partial-order schedules, namely those that can be obtained from the given fixed-time schedule.

However, inconsistencies remain, including a stark contrast of non-volcanic and volcanic passive margins north and south of the aseismic ridges, and evidence from seaward dipping reflector distributions suggesting segmentation influenced magmatism. Within this project, different methods for the formation of the volcanic passive margins in the southern South Atlantic have been explored. To test the main influence on magmatism during break-up, observational <b>constraints</b> of <b>post</b> and syn-rift magmatism originate from 38 wide-angle and multichannel seismic profiles. These measurements show that at 450 km south of the Walvis Ridge, oceanic crust has a thickness of 11. 7 km, thinning to 6. 1 km at a distance of 2300 km along-strike. Overall, oceanic crustal thickness decreases linearly along-strike with little indication of segmentation. Active mantle upwelling was also tested using the relationship between melt volumes and seismic velocity from syn-rift magmatism, with little evidence for this process. Using a numerical model of continental rifting capable of producing melt thickness and major element oxide compositions through time, the observational <b>constraints</b> from <b>post</b> and syn-rift magmatism required a hot layer present decreasing in temperature relative to the asthenosphere from 250 °C in the north to 50 °C at a distance of 2300 km south along-strike.
