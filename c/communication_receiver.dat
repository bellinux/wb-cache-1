50|$|A {{communications}} receiver {{is a type}} of radio receiver used as a component of a radio communication link. This is in contrast to a broadcast receiver which is used to receive radio broadcasts. The difference between the two is that broadcast receivers only receive broadcast bands, such as the medium wave and/or longwave AM broadcast bands and the VHF FM broadcast band, while a <b>communication</b> <b>receiver</b> receives a wider part of the radio spectrum not used for broadcasting, that includes amateur, military, aircraft, marine, and other bands. They are often used with a radio transmitter as part of a two way radio link for shortwave radio or amateur radio communication, although they are also used for shortwave listening.|$|E
50|$|AN/ARC-5 set {{composition}} and control differed markedly {{from the earlier}} systems. Three-unit receiver racks were still predominant, but the receiver line-up was quite different. One receiver would usually be a R-4A homing receiver, another the VHF R-28, and the last an MF/HF <b>communication</b> <b>receiver.</b> The transmitter rack would hold a VHF T-23 and an MF/HF transmitter corresponding to the MF/HF receiver. Frequency-stabilized versions of the AN/ARC-5 communications receivers usually have a yellow circle-S stamped on the front panel. Such receivers were not remotely tuned by the pilot, but were instead lock-tuned to the associated transmitter's frequency before take-off. AN/ARC-5 navigation receivers are not so stabilized, and if installed in the rack a control that allows remote tuning is required.|$|E

40|$|Modern radio {{terminals}} {{for high}} data rate <b>communication</b> require wideband <b>receivers.</b> The well-known receiver architectures, such as zero-IF-receivers usually require very accurate component matching. In order to relax these requirements digital techniques are used on one side. On the other side alternative receiver architectures such as the six-port are investigated. The six-port has been introduced as a very flexible and elegant means for microwave measurements in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Later on {{it has been used}} in radar applications. It was not until recently that <b>communication</b> <b>receivers</b> have been built upon the six-port principle. In order to generate the required IQ-signal from the output signals of a six-port, knowledge of the six-port structure and/or of the signal statistics must be available. The first can be obtained by means of calibration procedures, while the latter can be used in blind techniques. Classical calibration procedures employ probes that are connected to the six-port. This is not applicable in <b>communication</b> <b>receivers.</b> Alternatively, a method is presented that uses the incoming signal as the calibration-driving probe and moreover uses the fact that the I-component and the Q-component of the signal are uncorrelated in most practical scenarios...|$|R
