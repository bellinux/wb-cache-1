The election resulted in a hung parliament where PPP had secured the most seats in the National Assembly and PML (N) the second most. After the formation of a coalition government between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, Abbasi was inducted into the federal cabinet of Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was appointed as the Minister for Commerce. However, he resigned from the ministerial office after PML (N) left the PPP-led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|General {{elections}} were held on 10 October 2002 under Musharraf to elect the National Assembly.

Abbasi indicated that the exile of Sharif disappointed the people, due to which PML (N) only won 19 out of 342 seats in the National Assembly. People from his constituency claim he contested the election unwillingly, explaining why he lost it. After his defeat, he distanced himself from politics to focus on Airblue Limited, which he founded in 2003.

According to BBC Urdu, he had close contacts with Shujaat Hussain, leader of the then ruling party, and from whom Abbasi gained support for his airline.|$|E

The controversial Miss Manila beauty pageant dawned on Mar 1, 1953, when Imelda and the Reyes spouses were in great despair after hearing news that Norma Jimenez became the candidate of Miss Philippines and the winner of Miss Manila, and sought to meet the mayor of Manila, Aresenio Lacson, who revoked the decision and made Imelda Romualdez the winner of Miss Manila. The mayor announced that there were violations of rules by the International Fair Board, and it is the mayor's authority to nominate the <b>candidate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City of Manila for the beauty contest. It turned out that Imelda won 655 points whereas Norma Jimenez acquired 453 points.

5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888.

Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the <b>candidate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co.
