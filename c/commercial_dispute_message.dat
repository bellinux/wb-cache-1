40|$|Mediation is {{developing}} and increasingly {{becoming one of}} the most popular modes for resolving international <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> worldwide. In the Pacific, mediation has also been introduced to resolve disputes and lessen the burden of the Courts with case backlogs and assist in the improvement of the business environment in the Region. Prior to the introduction of western systems of resolving disputes such as litigation, arbitration and mediation, Pacific Island Countries had their own traditional methods of resolving customary disputes. This paper therefore aims to study these methods and determine whether mediation is culturally fitting and whether mediation is the appropriate mode to resolve <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> or cross-border <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> in these countries. Further, it will address whether introducing more traditional customs into the mediation rules that were introduced and developing the rules to suit these societies, would have any benefits in resolving <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Extract: Throughout Australia, {{voluntary}} mediation {{is commonly}} used to resolve a variety of <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes,</b> yet intellectual property (IP) disputes are a subset of <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute</b> in which mediation appears to be seldom used.

40|$|Extract: Modern {{means of}} {{communication}} and the liberalisation of international trade have transformed the world into a global marketplace. Businesses that participate in this market may opt to resolve their domestic or international <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> by arbitration or mediation as opposed to litigation (or adjudication). There is a growing awareness among lawyers and business people that litigation is not the only, and frequently not the best, method of resolving <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes.</b> Hence, ADR methods, which traditionally encompass all alternatives to litigation, including negotiation and conciliation, are receiving increasing recognition...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, many {{countries}} {{have increased their}} use of alternative mechanisms of dispute resolution to resolve {{a growing number of}} financial and <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes.</b> This trend has been supported by civil justice reforms taking place throughout the world, including those within Australia, and Canada.

40|$|Court-connected {{mediation}} {{has steadily}} expanded its scope in many Anglo-American jurisdictions {{over the past}} 20 years. 1 Its growth has been spurred by diverse factors that include mediations' greater perceived cost-effectiveness when compared with conventional civil litigation, coupled with corresponding public, judicial and legal professional interest in the greater participant control mediation permits. This growth has been particularly evident in <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution, where business pragmatism is a further spur to finding mediated solutions. Using the England and Wales (EW hereafter) civil procedure rules (CPR) mediation provisions as a commencement point, 2 this opening chapter critically assesses the widening range of court-connected mediation possibilities available within the <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> resolution sphere. In the first section, key mediation theory principles are identified and explained. From here, the EW commercial mediation-rules framework is considered, {{as a means to}} introduce other comparative Anglo-American jurisdiction analyses. Cases and commentaries provide additional support for the contention that court-connected mediation bondaries are limitless, in the sense that no <b>commercial</b> mediation <b>dispute</b> is likely unsuited to a mediation attempt. The third section offers a brief prediction concerning mediation's likely future scope, where mediation will be the accepted first formal step in every <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute.</b> The conclusions section affirm the proposition that those cases where mediation fails are now regarded by many commentators as exceptions that tend to prove the rule asserted in this assessment...|$|R
