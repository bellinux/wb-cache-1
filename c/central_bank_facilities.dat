40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} framework for describing, a process for identifying, and a model for evaluating misalignments in the supply chain when varying elements such as structure, processes, and management components. The developed approach {{makes it possible to}} address and improve the alignment of supply chain structures, processes, and management components. To further increase knowledge of how to improve the alignment in supply chains, two specific models were developed for choosing contract types and governance structures in the trucking service supply chain including shipper, forwarders, and carriers. These models extend the first approach with detailed insights {{that can be used to}} align incentives in the trucking service supply chain, which contributes to the overall research purpose. When studying the Swedish cash supply chain and its structure, processes, and management components, particular focus was directed on three major design changes: centralization of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> storage <b>facilities,</b> eliminating returns to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> storage <b>facilities,</b> and providing interest compensation at depots. By analyzing these changes using a network flow model, results showed that centralization from two to one <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> storage <b>facility</b> led to unintended increases in transportation costs and risk, while eliminating returns to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> storage <b>facilities</b> led to increased transportation flow, larger shipment sizes, and larger risk, but reduced transportation costs. Furthermore, results showed that providing interest compensation to private depots led to reduced transportation costs as well as risk. From studying a trucking service supply chain, a performance-based contract type was found to align incentives between a large Swedish grocery retailer and its forwarders by relieving the forwarders of coordination responsibility. This meant that they could improve trucking cost utilization and thereby reduce their price to the shipper, and still improve their profitability. Further, a cooperative governance structure utilizing a profit-sharing mechanism was found to align incentives between forwarders and carriers, which meant increased service frequency, reduced service price, and increased chain profit...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{countries}} in the model,labeled u and r, which {{can be interpreted as}} representing the United States {{and the rest of the}} world. To keep the analysis as simple as possible, we assume that their characteristics are identical, except where indicated. In particular, we assume that country z has an overall output share of τz; (z = u, r), where 0 ≤ τz ≤ 1 and τu = 1 − τr. In each period in each country, a continuum of infinitely lived agents participate in two distinct international markets: One is a Walrasian centralized global market, and another is a decentralized market, where pairs of buyers and sellers from the {{two countries}} are randomly matched. Transactions in the decentralized market are characterized by a double-coincidence problem, which rules out barter, and anonymity, which rules out the provision of credit between matched agents. It therefore follows that a tangible medium of exchange is required for transactions to take place in the decentralized market. 1 This appendix derives the results tested in Dollar Illiquidity and <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Facilities</b> During the Global Financial Crisis, by Andrew K.

40|$|Market {{reaction}} {{to a change in}} official interest rates will depend {{on the extent to which}} the change is anticipated, and on how it is interpreted as a signal of future policy. In this paper, a technique is developed to separate the anticipated and unanticipated components of such changes, and applied to estimate the response of euro–deutsche mark interest rates to adjustments in the Bundesbank’s Lombard and discount rates. [JEL E 43, E 47] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, financial market participants, and agents in the economy at large attach importance to official <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> interest rates. What are termed official rates typically comprise the rates applied at one or more <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> standing <b>facilities</b> and in some cases at which the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> operates a regular tender. In most industrialized countries, as in a number of developing countries, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> determines these rates both to define the range within which it manages short-term interbank rates through on-going open market operations, and to signal its medium-term policy stance (see Borio, 1997, for a recent survey). A change in official rates can thus affect expectations that are reflected in longer-term interest rates and other financial market prices, and hence initiate the monetary policy transmission process. It is therefore important that policymakers be able to predict the market response to such changes. Yet market participants have an incentive to anticipate policy shifts, and insofar as they succeed, market prices should largely adjust in advance of the implementation of...|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} includes coordination and motivation of independently operating partners. Therefore, {{it is important}} to align logistics structures, processes and incentives, especially when making major changes involving those components. Traditionally, cost, quality, and service have served as prioritized performance indicators for supply chains, but lately risk is also taken into consideration (Tang, 2006), especially when studying risk-exposed supply chains. This paper presents a case study of a cash supply chain (CSC). A CSC provides society with notes and coins (Rajamani et al., 2006), which typically involves two parties working together: a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> and a group of private actors (private banks and logistics service/security providers). Together, they form a closed-loop supply chain (see Guide and Van Wassenhove, 2006), which through their storage facilities and transport means supply cash to their customers (ATMs, bank branches, and retailers), whom in turn enables society's cash consumption. The CSC studied in this paper has during {{the last couple of years}} gone through several design changes in network structure (e. g. reducing number of storage facilities), processes (outsourcing), and incentive mechanisms (payment schemes and policies). Most design changes were carried out in order to decrease number of transports from and to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> storage <b>facilities,</b> nevertheless some of them led to unintended effects (so-called misalignments). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present a model that determines effects caused by design changes in a CSC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the financial system on <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> and government support 1 How much does the banking sector depend on public support? Utilisation of many support facilities has declined, due mainly to a fall in demand. Supply factors play a smaller, but not insignificant role, as governments and <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> have tightened the conditions on which certain support measures are available or have phased them out entirely. However, not all financial institutions have reduced their use of support <b>facilities.</b> Weaker <b>banks</b> especially continue to depend on public support. JEL classification: E 5, G 2. Over the past few months, authorities have taken their first steps to end some of the public support measures put in place {{in response to the}} financial crisis. For instance, the Federal Reserve completed its purchase of Treasury securities in October 2009; new issuance under the UK credit guarantee scheme ended in December; the ECB conducted a last 12 -month euro repo and the Bank of Japan stopped its purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds in the same month; and the Swiss National Bank ceased providing Swiss francs through foreign exchange (FX) swaps against euros in January 2010. Thus, the exit has begun. This feature analyses the use of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> liquidity <b>facilities</b> and government debt guarantees 2 to assess to what extent the financial system continues to depend on those measures. The take-up of many measures has declined. On the one hand, this seems to reflect better market access and hence reduced demand for government support. On the other hand, supply conditions have also become more restrictive, at least for some facilities. There is also some evidence of tiering in the use of government debt guarantees...|$|R
