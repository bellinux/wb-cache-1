An alternative loss on drying experiment was further described and showed similar results when applied on closely related hop samples. CBN content could be used as a marker for storage control of cannabis samples.

They usually enter the subsurface in the form of organic liquids which exhibit low miscibility with water and thus form a separate dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL). Here we analyze the movement of DNAPL in a three-dimensional randomly heterogeneous porous medium saturated with water. We consider the fluid interface between DNAPL and water to form a sharp boundary at which the capillary pressure head, assumed equal to the entry pressure head of DNAPL, is prescribed either deterministically or randomly. We treat log hydraulic conductivity as a statistically homogeneous random field with given mean, variance and covariance, This allows us to cast the corresponding boundary-value problem {{in the form of an}} integro-differential equation, in which the parameters and domain of integration are random.

In the present study, a novel microbially-driven Fenton reaction system was designed to generate hydroxyl (HO) radicals for simultaneous degradation of source zone levels of single, binary, and ternary mixtures of TCE, PCE, and 1, 4 -dioxane. The new Fenton reaction system was driven by the Fe(III) -reducing facultative anaerobe Shewanella oneidensis amended with lactate, Fe(III), and contaminant mixtures and exposed to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The novel microbially-driven Fenton reaction system successfully degraded TCE, PCE, and 1, 4 -dioxane either as single contaminants or as binary and ternary mixtures. Degradation of lignocellulosic biomass was also demonstrated through the novel microbially driven fenton reaction by S. oneidensis. In this study, we have developed a new method that combines both pretreatment and saccharification of cellulose and xylan in a microbially driven fenton reaction. The combined pretreatment and saccharification method for cellulose and xylan developed did not involve the addition of acid, alkali compounds {{or the use of}} hydrolyzing enzymes thus being an economically feasible process to directly produce simple fermentable sugars from cellulose and xylan.

Target analyte species include <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> such as perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). A laboratory based bench top system is used to optimize flow systems and analysis protocols. The optimum conditions determined in this set of experiments would then be used in testing a field portable version of the instrument. The theory of operation is similar to more familiar chromatography. Analyte species are separated from a mixture based on differential migration in a flow chamber. A carrier gas is pumped through the chamber in one direction, and a drift gas is flowed in an opposite direction. The drift gas opposes flow and causes some molecules to traverse the chamber more slowly than others. The velocity of various types of molecules through the chamber is a function of their size and their interaction with the two gases. Analyte molecules are introduced though a sampling port into a charging chamber where they receive electron charge from a Ni 2 ̆ 6 #; 63 source. They are then blocked from entering the chamber until an electrostatic port is opened. The time of flight through the chamber is detected at the far end by an ion detector and identifies the chemical species involved. The current at this detector is proportional to the number of molecules of that type in the sample.

Linear acenes, including tetracene, pentacene, and their derivatives, have received particular attention due to the synthetic flexibility in tuning their chemical structure and properties and to their high device performance. Unfortunately, longer acenes, which could exhibit even better performance, are susceptible to oxidation, photo-degradation, and, in solar cells which contain fullerenes, Die Is Alder reactions.

New synthetic techniques have been developed to create stable PAHs that extend conjugation in two dimensions. The stability of these novel compounds is consistent with Claes sextet rule as the 2 -D PAHs have greater numbers of sextets in their ground-state configuration than their linear analogues. The ionization potentials (IPs) of nonlinear acenes decrease more slowly with annellation in comparison to their linear counterparts. As a result, 2 -D bistetracene derivatives that are composed of eight fused benzene rings are measured to be about 200 times more stable in <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> than pentacene derivatives with only five fused rings. Single crystals of the bistetracene derivatives have hole mobilities, measured in OFET configuration, up to 6. 1 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1), with remarkable I-on/I-off ratios of 10 (7). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide insight into the electronic structures at both molecular and material levels and to evaluate the main charge-transport parameters. The 2 -D acenes with large aspect ratios and appropriate substituents have the potential to provide favorable interstack electronic interactions, and correspondingly high carrier mobilities. In stark contrast to the 1 -D acenes that form mono- and bis-adducts with fullerenes, 2 -D PAHs show less reactivity with fullerenes. The geometry of 2 -D PAHs plays a crucial role in determining both the barrier and the adduct stability. The reactivity and stability of the 2 -D PAHs with regard to Diels Alder reactions at different reactive sites were explained via DFT calculations of the reaction kinetics and of thermodynamics of reactions and simple Huckel molecular orbital considerations. Also, because of their increased stability in the presence of fullerenes, these compounds have been successfully used in OPVs. The small-molecule semiconductors highlighted in this Account exhibit good charge-transport properties, comparable to those of traditional linear acenes, while being much more environmentally stable. These features have made these 2 -D PAHs excellent molecules for fundamental research and device applications...|$|R
50|$|Direct fired rotary desorbers {{have been}} used {{extensively}} over the years for petroleum contaminated soils and soils contaminated with RCRA hazardous wastes {{as defined by the}} USEPA. A 1992 paper on treating petroleum contaminated soils estimated that between 20 and 30 contractors have 40 to 60 rotary dryer systems available. Today, it is probably closer to 6 to 10 contractors with 15 to 20 portable systems commercially available. The majority of these systems utilize a secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) or catalytic oxidizer to thermally destroy the volatilized organics. A few of these systems also have a quench and scrubber after the oxidizer which allows them to treat soils containing <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organics</b> such as <b>solvents</b> and pesticides. The desorbing cylinder for full scale transportable systems is typically four to ten feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. The maximum practical solids temperature for these systems is around 750 to 900 °F depending on the material of construction of the cylinder. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 6 to over 100 tons per hour for transportable units.|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} a systematic {{experimental study of}} the large strain surface mechanical properties of certain semicrystalline polymers, at the nanometre scale. A poly(etheretherketone) (PEEK) was selected as a model semicrystalline polymer for these investigations, as PEEK is currently finding extensive use in high performance composites. The central theme of the Thesis is to elucidate the nano normal indentation response and the scratch deformation mechanisms of semicrystalline polymers. Effective selection and design improvements of materials in surface engineering and tribological applications require knowledge of their near-to-surface mechanical properties. Therefore, this experimental study seeks to elucidate {{an understanding of the}} response of semicrystalline polymers in single point contacts. This Thesis approaches the nano surface mechanical property characterisation using indentation and scratching techniques. Indentation is a relatively simple and virtually nondestructive means of assessing mechanical properties of materials by an indenter, inducing a localized deformation into a solid surface. PEEK and other commercially available common polymers were indented and the data were analysed using a contact compliance method in conjunction with an MTS Nano IIs indenter system. The load-displacement curves, the hardness, the elastic modulus, the plasticity index and the creep response data and associated analysis for the PEEK surfaces are presented {{as a function of the}} contact displacement. A comparison of the data for the load-displacement curves, the hardness and the elastic modulus for common commercial polymers is described. A study of surface deformations of the PEEK surfaces when it undergoes scratching by means of conical indenters drawn along the surfaces under different contact conditions is also described. The scratch deformations produced considerable loss in optical appeal and surface mechanical properties of polymeric materials. The experimental investigation of the scratch response of the PEEK is focused upon the contact conditions. Scratch deformation maps have been constructed showing the effect of the normal load, the strain (the contact geometry), the strain rate (the scratching velocity), the contact temperature, the state of interfacial lubrication and the crystallinity of the polymer upon the scratching behaviour of the polymeric surface. The extent and the geometric characteristics of the surface damage produced are determined subjectively using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical profilometry techniques. The nano hardness and the elastic modulus results as a function of contact displacement for PEEK composites are also presented. The fibre oriented PEEK composites were scratched using a pendulum sclerometer to analyze the orientation effects on scratch deformations. Finally, nano indentation results for the modified PEEK surfaces under thermal, solvent and mechanical disruptions are reported. The major conclusions of this Thesis are that the nanoindentations into the polymers show a surface hardening response and are dependent upon the contact conditions. The semicrystalline polymers have bimodal nanoindentation characteristics due to presence of the hard crystalline lamella and the soft amorphous phase. The semicrystalline polymers exhibit periodic fluctuations in surface mechanical properties with increasing penetration depth. The scratch deformations of semicrystalline polymers depend upon the contact conditions. A peculiar fibrillation of the polymeric surface was observed when scratched under severe contact conditions (high normal load and sharp conical indenters). The scratch deformations of fibre oriented polymers are highly fibre orientation dependent relative to the scratch direction. Surface plasticisation of amorphous PEEK has been observed in <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mainly in <b>chlorinated</b> solvents. Semicrystalline PEEK was seen to exhibit considerable inert behaviour to common <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> but <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> has caused decrease in surface mechanical properties. A surface hardening of amorphous PEEK has been observed after immersion in water. A qualitative methodology, based on nanoindentation data, to analyze subsurface deformations of polymers resulting from scratch deformations are also presented.

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} is {{a widespread}} problem. As human activities generate chemical wastes, we seek quick, yet not always environmentally friendly, ways to dispose of them. Often, chemicals are dumped into waste containers and buried. Unfortunately, these chemicals may spill or leak, seep deeper into the ground, and eventually reach groundwater. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> such as trichloroethene, tetrachloroethane, and chloroform are common contaminants in groundwater [1]. These solvents originate from chemical spills, tank leaks, and waste disposal practices [2]. Such contaminants are harmful to humans, {{and need to be}} removed to restore clean groundwater. There are two types of methods to clean chemically contaminated soil and groundwater: ex situ and in situ. Both types have advantages and disadvantages. In situ remediation avoids the cost of removing the contaminated material and has a lower risk of worker exposure to the contaminants. One in situ technique that shows promise is remediation, which uses microorganisms to anaerobically degrade contaminants. In bioremediation in situ, the microorganisms that are already present in the ground utilize nutrients that are injected into the ground to metabolize the contaminants into nonhazardous materials. The nutrients serve as a carbon source for the microbes. Though this method has been used with some success, there have been problems with too rapid release of nutrients to the microbes. In these cases, the microbes multiplied too rapidly and caused biofouling. This can occur when the nutrient content of the bioremediation solution is too high, as when lactate or lactic acid is the nutrient. Lactic acid is typically produced in carbohydrate matter by fermentation, and is used mainly in the food and pharmaceutical industries [3]. Because it has been found difficult to uniformly distribute lactate solutions in a contaminated area due to biofouling, it was suggested that polylactic acid, in colloidal form, be used instead. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a polymer of lactic acid, C 3 H 6 O 3 [3]. PLA is used in medicine and agriculture. In medicine, PLA is used in sutures because it degrades within the body after the incision has healed. In agriculture, PLA is used in combination with polyglycolic acid for the release of chemicals [4]. We expect PLA to degrade in the ground at a rate that allows bioremediation to occur as intended. Currently, bioremediation of chlorinated solvents involves injecting nutrient containing solvents into the ground to induce the expected activity of the microbes. The solution must have a proper amount of nutrients for the microbes to metabolize so that they can continue to degrade the contaminants. If too much nutrient is available, and the microbes multiply too fast and clog the injection point, the solution may not reach the area where the contaminants are. One way to slowly release the nutrients for bioremediation is to package them as colloids. Colloids are particles that are less than one micrometer in size, with surface chemical properties that allow them to remain suspended in water and, therefore, to travel with water. Our research addresses the problem of packaging nutrients as colloids to support bioremediation...|$|R
