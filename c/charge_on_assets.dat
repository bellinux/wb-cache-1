The author of this article argues that such behavior reflects not a general decline in ethical standards so much as executives' growing sense that accounting itself has become "unhinged from value. " For example, clearly valuable expenditures on R&D, customer acquisition, and employee training are generally expensed immediately against earnings. And reported corporate income is often further reduced by provisions for losses that most companies never expect to incur, by "book" taxes they never expect to pay, and by depreciation <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> that are actually increasing in value. At the same time, the opportunity costs associated with employee stock options and the corporate use of equity capital are not reflected in the accountant's measure of profit. 2003 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R

The key role of CCPs in mitigating counterparty risk and contagion has in turn cast them as systemically important financial institutions whose eventual failure may lead to potentially serious consequences for financial stability, and prompted discussions on CCP risk management standards and safeguards for recovery and resolutions of CCPs in case of failure. We contribute to the debate on CCP default resources {{by focusing on the}} incentives generated by the CCP loss allocation rules for the CCP and its members and discussing how the design of loss allocation rules may be used to align these incentives in favor of outcomes which benefit financial stability. After reviewing the ingredients of the CCP loss waterfall and various proposals for loss recovery provisions for CCPs, we examine the risk management incentives created by different ingredients in the loss waterfall and discuss possible approaches for validating the design of the waterfall.

Questionnaires were administered on selected bank branch managers of conventional banks, rural banks and savings and loans companies. Findings from this study has brought to the fore some interesting revelations. The results indicated that when loan managers are deciding on whether to accept or reject an SME loan application, intended purpose of loan, repayment of previous loan, repayment schedule, type of business activity, size of loan relative to size of business and availability of collateral, ranked highest on their criteria list. On the contrary, CVs of clients, government guarantee of loans, <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> and gearing ranked lowest on the criteria list in terms of importance. The relevant factors identified in {{this study showed that}} lenders took particular interest in risk when dealing with SMEs. This is not out of place, as every business seeks to make profit and thus they need to be sure of recouping their monies when they lend them out to small businesses. It is thus very necessary for SME borrowers to develop an understanding of the decision criteria used by financial institutions in order to increase the probability of getting their loan request approved by fulfilling the required criteria adequately. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into low-voltage (LV) residential distribution networks inevitably increases the overall demand, especially peak demand, which may cause thermal or voltage issues. In this paper, a 400 V practical residential distribution network is modelled {{and used to}} quantify these impacts due to the growing penetration of EVs. Residential load profiles in 1 -minute resolution and EV charging profiles with recorded State of Charge (SOC) are randomly and statistically created. Then, a simple charging management algorithm with locally made decision is suggested at EV users' charging points. Results prove that this approach can mitigate the negative impacts of EV <b>charging</b> <b>on</b> network <b>assets.</b> Moreover, it can reduce EV users' electricity cost for <b>charging</b> based <b>on</b> existing UK electricity price scheme 'Economy 7,' without compromising EV usage or substantial network infrastructure reinforcement or installation of extensive monitor, control and communication system.

40|$|The {{method of}} book value is, relatively, {{the easiest and}} the least {{time-consuming}} method of enterprise assetsâ€™ valuation. However, the reliability of valuation by means of this method is questionable. The source of this doubt {{can be attributed to}} the problem of equivocal qualification of some liabilities to equities or to outside capital. Deferred incomes and charges are a particular example of the said liabilities. One of the reasons of showing deferred <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> the <b>assets</b> side and provisions on the liabilities side is the existence of a transitory difference in the income tax. The author of the paper raises the question if this difference influences the value of net assets, and if so, whether it depends on the way it is included in the formula of determining this value? It has been proved that the influence of the allocation for the transitory difference in the income tax on the value of net <b>assets</b> depends <b>on</b> the method of their classification when determining this value. It has also been proved that, at the point of calculating the value of net assets, there exists a problem of classifying some liabilities as equities or as outside capital and that it is needed that each and every part of a balance included in this calculation be dealt with individually...|$|R

This rate of exchange, being substantially in excess {{of the value of the}} mark-notes at the rate of exchange current at the time (and enormously in excess of the rate to which the mark notes have since fallen, the Belgian franc being now worth more than three marks), was the occasion of the smuggling of mark-notes into Belgium on an enormous scale, to take advantage of the profit obtainable.

It will certainly be desirable for the Belgian and German Governments to come to some arrangement as to its disposal, though this is rendered difficult by the prior lien held by the Reparation Commission over all German assets available for such purposes.|$|R
