25|$|The antilopine {{kangaroo}} (Macropus antilopinus) is, essentially, the far-northern {{equivalent of}} the eastern and western grey kangaroos. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the antilopine wallaroo, but in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to red and grey kangaroos. Like them, it is a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious. Its name comes from its fur, which is similar in colour and texture to that of antelopes. Characteristically, the noses of males swell behind the nostrils. This enlarges nasal passages and allows them to release more heat in hot and humid climates.|$|E

25|$|The modern law of {{contract}} is primarily a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrial revolution and the social legislation of the 20th century. However, the foundations of all European contract law are traceable to obligations in Ancient Athenian and Roman law, while the formal development of English law began after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror created a common law across England, but throughout the middle ages the court system was minimal. Access to the courts, in what are now considered contractual disputes, was consciously restricted to a privileged few through onerous requirements of pleading, formalities and court fees. In the local and manorial courts, according to English law's first treatise by Ranulf de Glanville in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a wager of law). They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Batman's {{popularity}} was waning. CBS {{was interested in}} producing a Batman in Outer Space film. Producers Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan purchased the film rights of Batman from DC Comics on October 3, 1979. It was Uslan's wish [...] "to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way Bob Kane and Bill Finger had envisioned him in 1939. A <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night; stalking criminals in the shadows." [...] Richard Maibaum was approached to write a script with Guy Hamilton to direct, but the two turned down the offer. Uslan was unsuccessful with pitching Batman to various movie studios because they wanted the film {{to be similar to}} the campy 1960s TV series. Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film.|$|E

The game developer modeled Kabuto's attacks after those of giant monsters in classic monster movies, allowing him to use professional wrestling attacks and aerial techniques such as elbow drops, foot stomps, and the [...] "butt flop" [...] described as [...] "like the body slam, but with less dignity". To balance his strength, a weak point at his waist inflicts heavy damage when struck. Players playing the giant monster can assume a perspective through his mouth to target prey.|$|E

500|$|Bauer started courting her in 1903, {{but since}} they were apart most of the time, this was done by mail. Their {{relationship}} developed as they shared their dreams, aspirations, doubts and insecurities in their correspondence. For Bauer, Ellqvist became his inspiration, muse, and [...] "fairy princess"; it was as such he painted {{her for the first}} time in Sagoprinsessan (The Fairy Princess). He made sketches for the painting in 1904, and finalized them in an oil painting in 1905. Ellqvist is portrayed as a strong, enlightened and unobtainable Valkyrie. The painting was shown at Bauer's first exhibition at the Valand Academy in Gothenburg in 1905 (where he was one of eleven debutants) and in Norrköping in 1906, where it was sold to a private collector. It is now in the Jönköpings läns museum. Bauer tried to mold Ellqvist into his vision of a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods and as the perfect artist's wife; he wanted her to make a home for them in a romantic cottage in the woods, while he wandered about the forest seeking inspiration.|$|E
500|$|In June 1812, he was {{appointed}} Solicitor General for England and Wales, receiving the customary knighthood, and, in May 1813, he {{was appointed}} Attorney General. The Attorney General was the senior Crown prosecutor, {{during a time when}} the Prince Regent feared liberal changes to the criminal law and Parliamentary structure. Garrow, as [...] "a mere <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Regent", could be trusted to oppose this; rather than the progressive, defensive work undertaken in his early career, this period was one of conservative aggression against the reformers. Garrow ran particularly foul of Sir Samuel Romilly, who was one of those looking to reform a penal code many claimed was not working. On 5 April 1813, Romilly's Bill on Attainder of Treason and Felony came before Parliament. Its intent was to remove corruption of the blood from cases involving treason and felony; Garrow, then Solicitor General, declared that the Bill would remove one of the safeguards of the British Constitution. The Bill eventually failed, and corruption of the blood was not removed from English law until the Forfeiture Act 1870.|$|E

However, Charlotte Wilder, a writer on USA Todays sports column For The Win, was unimpressed by Vinicius's design, stating, [...] "Whoever was in charge of coming up with this <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> huge hands and feet did exactly what it looks like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, stuff it with some synthetic filling, and call it day." [...] Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, criticized Rio 2016 for failing to capitalize on environmental protection by [...] "inventing" [...] mascots, rather than using actual animal species. Young also criticized the organizers for not offering a female name in the public vote.|$|E

[...] But Jacob N. Liggett of Rockingham County voiced the ex-Confederate doctrine that [...] "the Federal Government is the <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acts of the States." [...] Christopher Y. Thomas of Henry County proposed a compromise, to simply assert Article VI of the U.S. Constitution for Virginia's Bill of Rights, Section 2, that [...] "the Constitution of the United States, {{and the laws of}} Congress passed in pursuance thereof, constitute the supreme law of the land, to which paramount allegiance and obedience are due from every citizen..." [...] That was not enough for the Radical majority. Linus M. Nickerson of Fairfax County who had served in a New York infantry regiment successfully added [...] "this State shall ever remain a member of the United States of America... and that all attempts from whatever source, or upon whatever pretext, to dissolve said Union... are unauthorized, and ought to be resisted with the whole power of the State." ...|$|E

Anderson ranked the human bat as the eighth creepiest <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show.

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five.

Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed.

[...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E
