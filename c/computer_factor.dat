After concentration of CSF to about 50 μΐ by ultrafiltration and refractometric determination of protein, approximately 20 - 40 ^g of total protein are used for electrophoresis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and analyse specific instances of transactive communication as children engaged in a paired melody writing task using a computer-based composing environment. Transactive communication has been identified as one of the features of general collaborative engagement that is most helpful in an educational sense, and which makes collaborative learning an important tool for learning and teaching. The paper reports the results of an empirical study in which a group of 10 and 11 year olds worked in pairs to compose short melodies using computers. Analysis of between-pupil dialogue suggested that levels of transactive communication varied between pairs, and also within pairs as pupils took on different roles at the <b>computer.</b> <b>Factors</b> of individual difference, such as musical expertise or whether the pair were friends, did not appear to have a significant influence on the extent of, or nature or, transactive communication...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OVERVIEW: Interns' {{anxiety about}} {{computer}} use ("computer anxiety") and {{their attitudes toward}} medical computer applications were determined by a standardized questionnaire. Participants were surveyed before and {{after three months of}} differential exposure to three clinical information systems (CISs), including one with provider-entered encounters. POPULATION: Fifty-one interns completed both surveys. Their average age was 27 years. Thirty-three percent were female, 7 % were African American, and 8 % were foreign graduates. RESULTS: The most common previous exposures to computers were for literature searching and retrieval of patient information (both 92 %). Factors that commonly emerged as predictive of anxiety about computer use included self-rated skills, typing ability, and <b>computer</b> attitudes. <b>Factors</b> predictive of attitudes toward computers included self-rated skills, typing ability, maximal frequency of prior computer use, computer ownership, and <b>computer</b> anxiety. <b>Factors</b> that were not predictive of computer anxiety or attitudes toward computers included age, gender, and physician input of data. CONCLUSION: Identification of markers for negative psychological reactions to computer use may allow development of interventions to improve acceptance of computer base patient records (CBPRs) ...|$|R
