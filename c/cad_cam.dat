25|$|Simulation {{solutions}} are being increasingly integrated with CAx (<b>CAD,</b> <b>CAM,</b> CAE....) solutions and processes. The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, {{especially at the}} earlier concept and design stages, {{has the potential of}} providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter time-to-market, to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.|$|E

Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a multi-CAD environment, and include solutions for managing simulation data and processes and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as tailorable user interfaces and [...] "wizards" [...] which allow all appropriate PLM participants {{to take part in}} the simulation process.|$|E

A simple practical set of methods in which a variety of 3 D complex shape drawings suitable for WEDM could be easily created, analyzed and transferred to other forms for Wire Electric Discharge Machining have also been developed and are introduced here towards the aim of integrating of CAD-CAM based on AUTOCAD Release 11. A communication protocol between <b>CAD</b> and <b>CAM</b> has been set up, that is to say, a DXF interface programme has been developed to communicate with AUTOCAD via the DXF mechanism to create a standard database which {{makes it possible to}} realise the integration of <b>CAD</b> and <b>CAM.</b> A universal control programme has also been developed which is suitable for machining any kind of complex shaped model in WEDM. Improving the accuracy of WEDM machining by means of integrating <b>CAD</b> and <b>CAM</b> is discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional {{geological}} modelling is a {{very important}} and hard work in the numerical simulation of engineering geology and geotechnical engineering. However, the 3 D modelling capability of preprocessing of existing numerical simulation software is far less than professional <b>CAD</b> / <b>CAM</b> modelling software. Therefore, in order to enhance the 3 D modelling efficiency of numerical simulation, data conversion between the <b>CAD</b> / <b>CAM</b> modelling software and numerical simulation software is often in great need. For some historical reasons, the data between <b>CAD</b> / <b>CAM</b> modelling software and numerical simulation software is not so compatible, and there are still some unsolved problems in the process of data transformation, such as incomplete information definitions, lost of topology relations after conversion and failed to identify attribute information, etc. To improve this situation, data conversion interfaces between several commonly used <b>CAD</b> / <b>CAM</b> modelling software and numerical simulation software have been studied in detail, then the shortcomings of existing common data transfer structures are discussed, and then {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} commonly used data standards are compared. Based on the STEP standards, a preliminary data conversion method applicable to the engineering geology has been suggested. It is primary method that can implement data conversion between <b>CAD</b> / <b>CAM</b> software and numerical simulation software by programming. Not only the accuracy of the geometry data exchange and the requirements for topological relations are met, but also important attribute description information is included. Finally the 3 D model conversion of Xiangjiaba hydropower station is taken as an example to confirm that the model data interface development method based on the STEP standard is feasible...|$|R
