5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for <b>catenation,</b> with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{replication}} factories perform disentanglement {{of sister}} chromatids. The disentanglement {{is essential for}} distributing the chromatids into daughter cells after DNA replication. Because sister chromatids after DNA replication hold each other by Cohesin rings, there is the only chance for the disentanglement in DNA replication.

40|$|Background. The {{precision}} of the metaphase-anaphase transition ensures stable genetic inheritance. The spindle checkpoint blocks anaphase onset {{until the last}} chromosome biorients at metaphase plate, then the bonds between sister chromatids are removed and disjoined chromatids segregate to the spindle poles. But, how sister separation is triggered is not fully understood. Principal Findings. We identify PIASc as a human E 3 sumo ligase required for timely and efficient sister chromatid separation. In cells lacking PIASc, normal metaphase plates form, but the spindle checkpoint is activated, leading to a prolonged metaphase block. Sister chromatids remain cohered even if cohesin is removed by depletion of hSgo 1, because DNA <b>catenations</b> persist at centromeres. PIASc-depleted cells cannot properly localize Topoisomerase II at centromeres or in the cores of mitotic chromosomes, providing a functional link between PIASc and Topoisomerase II. Conclusions. PIASc directs Topoisomerase II to specific chromosome regions that require efficient removal of DNA <b>catenations</b> prior to anaphase. The lack of this activity activates the spindle checkpoint, protecting cells from non-disjunction. Because DNA <b>catenations</b> persist without PIASc {{in the absence of}} cohesin, removal of <b>catenations</b> and cohesin rings must be regulated in parallel...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{division}} of DNA into two daughter nuclei {{is a critical}} event in every cell cycle. The pairing of sister chromatids {{in order to allow}} accurate segregation, is achieved by two primary mechanisms – the SMC complex cohesin binds as replication ends and holds sisters together with protein-mediated links; and the process of replication intertwines sister chromatids in a way that results in DNA-DNA mediated links called <b>catenations.</b> At the point of segregation, it is crucial that cohesin is destroyed and all <b>catenations</b> are resolved. Topoisomerase 2 (Top 2) is the primary actor in S. cerevisiae able to resolve DNA inter- twines. This enzyme appears to maintain an equilibrium level of <b>catenations</b> between S phase and mitosis and it {{has been shown to be}} capable of both introducing and removing <b>catenations</b> by its strand passage mechanism. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, a shift to positive supercoiling may help to direct the action of topoisomerase enzymes towards full decatenation at the crucial moment of DNA segregation. Further, it has been shown that condensin, another SMC complex, has a pivotal role in this supercoiling transition. Here, work is presented to link this change in supercoiling to physical tension across sister chromatids aligned on the metaphase plate. The regulation of this transition requires Cdc 5 kinase, Ipl 1 kinase and acts independently of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint. Furthermore, the supercoiling transition is linked to a global enrichment of Smc 2 across the entire length of chromosomes as the spindles form and anaphase progresses. This enrichment is matched by Top 2 binding and this Top 2 enrichment depends directly on the action of Smc 2. It is hypothesised that this recruitment of Top 2 is dependent on <b>catenations</b> being revealed by the supercoiling action of Smc 2. If Top 2 is not active, then Smc 2 continues to bind globally to DNA and further increase the level of positive supercoiling, suggesting that the complex is able to sense the presence of remaining <b>catenations.</b> Finally, a secondary last minute catenane resolution pathway may have been identified that occurs after the supercoiling transition and is regulated by the Anaphase Promoting Complex.

A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from the filled pπ orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty dπ orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of carbon monoxide in metal carbonyl complexes and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes (trimethylammonium being a useful catalyst for this reaction).|$|E

2500|$|Silicides {{are usually}} {{prepared}} by direct {{reaction of the}} elements. For example, the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, {{and most of these}} compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides [...] contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the [...] anion, isoeelctronic with white phosphorus, P4. Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e.g. Cu5Si); with increasing silicon content, <b>catenation</b> increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e.g. U3Si2) or four silicon atoms (e.g. 44−) at first, followed by chains (e.g. CaSi), layers (e.g. CaSi2), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e.g. α-ThSi2) as the silicon content rises even higher.|$|E
2500|$|Because the Si–C bond {{is close}} in {{strength}} to the C–C bond, organosilicon compounds {{tend to be}} markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, tetraphenylsilane (SiPh4) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428°C, and so can its substituted derivatives Ph3SiCl and Ph2SiCl2, which boil at 378°C and 305°C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for <b>catenation</b> and forming multiple bonds. However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si–F bond is significantly stronger than even the C–F bond {{and is one of}} the strongest single bonds, while the Si–H bond is much weaker than the C–H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the SN2 or SN1 processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si–C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C–O σ* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called [...] "SN2 at silicon" [...] for simplicity.|$|E
2500|$|Tetrahedral {{coordination}} {{is a major}} structural motif in silicon chemistry {{just as it is}} {{for carbon}} chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise as well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon, and thus octahedral coordination is also significant. For example, the electronegativity of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency towards <b>catenation</b> (formation of Si–Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon due to the concomitant weakening of the Si–Si bond compared to the C–C bond: the average Si–Si bond energy is approximately 226kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356kJ/mol for the C–C bond. This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the double bond rule. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of hypervalence, as seen in five- and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as [...] and [...] Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behaviour, particularly in the behaviour of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal. However, metallicity does not become clear until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.|$|E

Nondisjunction during mitosis can {{contribute to the development of}} some forms of cancer, e.g. retinoblastoma (see below).Chromosome nondisjunction in mitosis can be atrributed to the inactivation of topoisomerase II, condensin, or separase.Meiotic nondisjunction has been well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast undergoes mitosis similarly to other eukaryotes. Chromosome bridges occur when sister chromatids are held together post replication by DNA-DNA topological entanglement and the cohesion complex. [...] During anaphase, cohesion is cleaved by separase. Topoisomerase II and condensin are responsible for removing <b>catenations.</b>|$|R
