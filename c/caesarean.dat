5|$|Pregnant Kathy McCready is {{undergoing}} an emergency <b>caesarean.</b> As her husband prepares, the ward is locked down, {{and the child}} delivered is seen to be an alien.|$|E
5|$|The total medical {{cost for}} a pregnancy, {{delivery}} and {{care of a}} newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a <b>Caesarean</b> section as of 2012. In most other countries the cost is less than half. For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by <b>Caesarean</b> section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|The Bushes {{had tried}} to {{conceive}} for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency <b>Caesarean</b> section, as Laura had developed life-threatening pre-eclampsia (toxemia). The twins {{graduated from high school}} in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004. To date, Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins.|$|E
5|$|The Greek text of {{the codex}} is a {{representative}} of the <b>Caesarean</b> text-type. It belongs to the textual family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text. It agrees 31 times with the original text against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category III.|$|E
5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s. This means {{the text of the}} codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 119 times, with the original text against the Byzantine 80 times, and with both the Byzantine and original text 60 times. There are 69 independent or distinctive readings in the Gospels. While the Gospels are a representative of the <b>Caesarean</b> text-type, the remainder of the books of the New Testament in this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type and falls into Category V, the lowest and least important in Aland's Profile.|$|E
5|$|Carmella begins {{an online}} {{business}} with Marco Silvani (Jesse Rosenfeld), and develops an attraction to him. She initially resists {{as she is}} {{still in love with}} Oliver, but learns to her disappointment that he does not reciprocate her feelings. Carmella gives birth prematurely by <b>Caesarean</b> section; the condition of her daughter, Chloe (Sarah May), who is placed in the neonatal intensive-care unit, quickly improves. Mother and daughter move in with Marco, prompting a jealous Oliver to file for sole custody of Chloe, though he later rescinds this decision. Marco proposes to Carmella and she accepts, however later that day he is severely injured in a bushfire. Carmella marries him from his hospital bed, and Marco dies shortly afterwards. Following his death, Carmella believes she is haunted by Marco's spirit. Oliver moves to New York, but she declines his invitation to accompany him. He later moves to Portugal, and in December 2008, Carmella and Chloe leave to be with him. They briefly return to Erinsborough when Oliver's mother Rebecca (Jane Hall) breaks up with her husband Paul (Stefan Dennis), to convince her to come and live with them.|$|E
5|$|Faye and Joseph separate, {{and she and}} Linden begin a relationship. Faye {{discovers that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joseph's baby, but Linden promises to support her and they become briefly engaged. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their engagement. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by <b>Caesarean.</b> She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a <b>Caesarean</b> section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Nancy later discovers she {{is again}} {{pregnant}} with Darren's child. Nancy later suffers a miscarriage. Nancy and Darren later discover she is again pregnant. Nancy goes into premature labour and {{gives birth to}} their son three months premature by emergency <b>caesarean.</b> Darren and Nancy are told that their son may suffer brain damage. During her pregnancy Nancy helped her friend Mitzeee Minniver (Rachel Shenton) after she escaped from prison, making Nancy stressed. Darren blames Nancy for their son's premature birth and tells her he will not forgive her if their son dies. Darren and Nancy name their son Oscar, who {{turns out to be}} deaf. This causes problems in Darren and Nancy's relationship, with Darren wanting their son to go through an operation for his hearing but Nancy not wanting to. The stress results in Nancy becoming addicted to painkillers. Darren eventually finds out about Nancy's painkiller addiction leaving him furious and Nancy moves away for a short time. Darren and Nancy become friends with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey), and let her move in with them as a full-time nanny.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is hit {{in the head with a}} glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by <b>Caesarean.</b> She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave the baby with Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E
25|$|Mothers {{who have}} {{previously}} had a <b>caesarean</b> section {{are more likely}} to have a <b>caesarean</b> section for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a <b>caesarean</b> section. There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous <b>caesarean.</b>|$|E
25|$|Self-inflicted <b>caesarean</b> {{section is}} the concept of a mother alone {{performing}} her own <b>caesarean</b> section. There have apparently been a few successful cases, notably Inés Ramírez Pérez of Mexico who in March 2000, performed a successful <b>Caesarean</b> section on herself.|$|E
25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} <b>caesarean</b> section. There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous <b>caesarean</b> section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after <b>caesarean</b> section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in <b>caesarean</b> section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat <b>caesarean</b> section than in an elective repeat <b>caesarean</b> section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat <b>caesarean</b> section.|$|E
25|$|In rare cases, <b>caesarean</b> {{sections}} {{can be used}} {{to remove}} a dead fetus. A late-term abortion using <b>Caesarean</b> section procedures is termed a hysterotomy abortion and is very rarely performed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>caesarean</b> {{hysterectomy}} {{consists of}} a <b>caesarean</b> section followed by {{the removal of the}} uterus. This may be done in cases of intractable bleeding or when the placenta cannot be separated from the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Pliny the Elder {{theorized that}} Julius Caesar's name {{came from an}} {{ancestor}} who was born by <b>caesarean</b> section, {{but the truth of}} this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman <b>caesarean</b> section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by <b>caesarean</b> section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a <b>caesarean</b> taken place.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism {{there is}} a dispute among the poskim (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether a first-born son from a <b>Caesarean</b> section has the laws of a bechor. Traditionally, a male child {{delivered}} by <b>Caesarean</b> is not eligible for the Pidyon HaBen dedication ritual.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be a}} {{somewhat}} higher incidence of postnatal depression in the first weeks after childbirth for women who have <b>caesarean</b> sections, but this difference does not persist. Some {{women who have had}} <b>caesarean</b> sections, especially emergency caesareans, experience post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caesarean</b> section, {{also known}} as C-section or <b>caesarean</b> delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies. A <b>caesarean</b> section is often {{performed}} when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A <b>caesarean</b> delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{continuity}} of care with a known carer may significantly decrease the rate of <b>Caesarean</b> delivery {{but there is also}} research that appears to show that there is no significant difference in <b>Caesarean</b> rates when comparing midwife continuity care to conventional fragmented care.|$|E
25|$|Wound infections occur after <b>caesarean</b> {{sections}} {{at a rate}} of 3-15%.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by intact dilation and extraction or by hysterotomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure {{similar to a}} <b>caesarean</b> section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a <b>caesarean</b> section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|An early {{account of}} <b>caesarean</b> section in Iran is {{mentioned}} {{in the book of}} Shahnameh, written around 1000 AD, and relates to the birth of Rostam, the national legendary hero of Iran. According to the Shahnameh, the Simurgh instructed Zal upon how to perform a <b>Caesarean</b> section, thus saving Rudaba and the child Rostam.|$|E
25|$|One twin born vaginally and {{the other}} by <b>caesarean</b> section.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the prevalence of <b>caesarean</b> section is higher than needed in many countries and physicians are encouraged to actively lower the rate, as a <b>caesarean</b> rate higher than 10-15% is not associated with reductions in maternal or infant mortality rates. Some evidence supports {{a higher rate of}} 19% may result in better outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Carbetocin {{compared}} with oxytocin produced {{a reduction in}} women who needed uterine massage and further uterotonic drugs for women having <b>caesarean</b> sections. There {{was no difference in}} rates of PPH in women having <b>caesarean</b> sections or women having vaginal deliveries when given carbetocin. Carbetocin appears to cause less adverse effects. More research is needed to find the cost effectiveness of using carbetocin.|$|E
25|$|Children with Timothy {{syndrome}} {{tend to be}} born via <b>caesarean</b> section due to fetal distress.|$|E
25|$|A planned <b>caesarean</b> (or elective/scheduled <b>caesarean),</b> {{arranged}} {{ahead of}} time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before {{or during the}} pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation. In the UK, this is classified as a 'grade 4' section (delivery timed to suit {{the needs of the}} service) since the need for delivery is not urgent.|$|E
25|$|It is {{most common}} to {{classify}} <b>caesarean</b> sections by {{the urgency of}} performing them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caesarean</b> section, {{if there}} is an {{associated}} risk with vaginal delivery, as such feotal or maternal compromise.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Caesarean</b> {{birth of}} her last child, Noe {{suffered}} a uterine rupture and underwent a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Higher infant {{mortality}} risk: In <b>caesarean</b> sections performed with no indicated medical risk (singleton at full term in a head-down position {{with no other}} obstetric or medical complications), {{the risk of death}} in the first 28 days of life has been cited as 1.77 per 1,000 live births among women who had <b>caesarean</b> sections, compared to 0.62 per 1,000 for women who delivered vaginally.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{anaesthesia}} {{is used in}} 95% of deliveries, with spinal {{and combined}} spinal and epidural anaesthesia being {{the most commonly used}} regional techniques in scheduled <b>Caesarean</b> section. Regional anaesthesia during <b>Caesarean</b> section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.|$|E
25|$|Elective <b>caesarean</b> {{sections}} may {{be performed}} {{on the basis of}} an obstetrical or medical indication, or because of a medically non-indicated maternal request. Among women in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, about 7% preferred <b>caesarean</b> section as a method of delivery. In cases without medical indications the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend a planned vaginal delivery. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that if after a women has been provided information on the risk of a planned <b>caesarean</b> section and she still insists on the procedure it should be provided. If provided this should be done at 39 weeks of gestation or later.|$|E
