500|$|A promotional video, {{directed}} by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video is computer generated and begins with stylised shots of traffic moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, New York. The camera zooms in to show a man and women, who appear as thermal images, driving one of the cars. The man <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and puts a CD in the car's stereo before the video switches to an outside shot of the vehicle driving through a tunnel and a busy street. Another street is shown with many neon signs, including one which says [...] "Broadway" [...] and another with features the legend [...] "Juxtapozed with U, Super Furry Animals". The couple continue driving until they reach the Guggenheim Art Museum where they park beside a valet who opens the car's passenger door. The next shot shows the museum's interior exhibit which consists of a black and neon blue grids with various mathematical symbols and currency signs on the walls. The couple talk {{to one of the}} crowd in the club before leaving the building and walking past the valet to a lift which takes them to a party on the roof of a skyscraper. Shots of a swimming pool on the skyscraper's roof and the couple kissing are intercut with images of fire engines driving through the streets past the Chrysler Building. These fire engines arrive below the skyscraper where the party is taking place and several people, including the couple, look down on them from above. Firemen are shown fighting a blaze on several floors of the skyscraper and a helicopter is seen flying to rescue the partygoers. In the last few seconds of the video the skyscraper explodes and the helicopter crashes into the roof of the building. The Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] single.|$|E
50|$|The film {{ends with}} James having a {{conversation}} with his publisher about the success of his first book. The closing scene is of James attending his mother's funeral, standing grim-faced and aloof at his father's side, as he impatiently <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chuck is {{the last}} {{character}} seen alive and {{he is about to}} leave the police station to make a run for it, when he hears that the game is about to be broadcast. Chuck <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and sees that he has enough time to watch the game, and sits down to watch as the movie ends and the credits roll.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990 World Cup semi finals between hosts Italy and champions Argentina Vautrot added 8 {{minutes of}} {{stoppages}} {{in the first}} period extra time. He later explained that he had forgotten to <b>check</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The next day, Will {{calls on}} Charlotte {{and they go}} out together. They talk about their age {{difference}} and her illness. As they walk through the beautiful fall foliage in Central Park, Charlotte recites lines from the poem [...] "God's World" [...] by Edna St. Vincent Millay. As they talk, she notices him <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and she takes it from his wrist, saying she'll return it when he forgets that she has it. At his restaurant, they continue {{to get to know}} each other while preparing a meal for <b>his</b> staff. <b>Watching</b> her among <b>his</b> friends, he begins to fall in love.|$|R
50|$|When {{the man is}} sawing and <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> sundial <b>watch</b> (then {{realizing that}} it does not work because there are clouds in the sky), the man behind him is playing golf (the follow-through of which resembles the use of a scythe).|$|R
50|$|Doffing his bedclothes, he <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and, {{realizing that}} he is fully behind schedule, hurriedly readies the engine to depart. Mail is loaded aboard the mail car on the train and with a toot on the engine's whistle, Casey sets off at a dangerously high speed {{through the maze of}} {{switches}} and sidings, nearly T-boning two other trains in the process before making it safely out of the yard.|$|E
50|$|He meets Linus at the wall, {{and they}} discuss the {{previous}} day. It eventually ends when Linus <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and realizes {{he needs to}} leave, because {{he was invited to}} a barbecue at Mary Jo's farm. Charlie stays and pulls out a book, reads a couple of old sayings about love, then closes the book with a sigh, resigning {{to the fact that he}} and Mary Jo were never meant to be.|$|E
50|$|After quickly {{throwing}} {{the last of}} the would-be thieves away from the train, Casey <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and is horrified to discover that the train thieves have put him fully behind schedule once again. Determined {{to make up for lost}} time whatever the cost, he opens the engine's throttle so wide that he actually rips the engine's handle from its mount and throws it away. The night time changes to day as the train speeds at a high speed.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, after Santos-Dumont {{complained to}} his friend Louis Cartier about the {{difficulty}} of <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> pocket <b>watch</b> during flight, Cartier created his first men's wristwatch, thus allowing Santos-Dumont to <b>check</b> <b>his</b> flight performance while keeping {{both hands on the}} controls.Cartier still markets a line of Santos-Dumont watches and sunglasses.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2009, {{the band}} was {{selected}} by Spin Magazine and John Varvatos as one of three global finalists in the magazine's [...] "Free the Noise" [...] competition. Taking a detour from their national Canadian tour, {{the band was}} flown to New York City to perform at the now-defunct venue CBGB (now owned by competition co-creator John Varvatos). Guitarist Matthew Kliewer stated: [...] "There were apparently 950 people there. I heard that Dennis Quaid was there, but I couldn't {{see if he was}} jumping up and down, <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> or trying to save the planet." ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{come to a}} balloon, {{in which}} float Buddy and several animals, {{including}} an elephant, a lion, and a bear. Buddy looks through a spy-glass to see {{a sign that says}} [...] "Buddy's Circus will arrive at 2:00 P.M." [...] <b>Checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> Buddy sees that the time is nigh: he releases from his arms a gaggle of stakes, which land perfectly in a circle completed by the sign, and which are hammered into the earth by an octopus, which then is flattened by the landing balloon, which seamlessly morphs into a circus tent. Two men set up walls outside the tent, and one of them begins welcoming patrons to the show.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{a lesson}} about {{incendiary}} bombs is given. The text states {{that one should}} never approach incendiary bombs {{for the first five}} seconds. A small Japanese man with an umbrella appears, reads the text, <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> (which is decorated with Nazi swastikas) to count the seconds and then roasts a sausage above the dynamite stick. Then he explodes; emerging from the blast, he is headless, but his glasses and hat are still in the same place. The figure then says [...] "Oh, rosing face, prease! Rosing face!" [...] as a pun on the Asian concept of [...] "losing face" [...] or shaming oneself in public.|$|E
50|$|The goad reappears, {{this time}} with a wheel attachment, and prods the other sack, exiting as before. B is precise, {{efficient}} and eager; he only requires a single prod to rouse him. The clothes he - presumably - folded neatly before are now scattered about (clear evidence of the existence of a third party) but he never reacts to this and simply goes about his business. He knows how to dress and take care of his clothes. He takes greater care of himself (brushing his teeth and exercising), is better organised (he <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> - eleven times in total - and consults a map and compass before setting off to move the sacks), but still his shift is no more meaningful. Even though he has more to do than A, Beckett instructs that B performs his chores briskly so that they should take approximately the same time as Aâ€™s. After moving the sacks he undresses and, rather than dumping his clothes in a pile, B folds them neatly before crawling into his own sack.|$|E
5000|$|Later, at the cave, Ta and Sa {{arrive to}} tell Holly that Ta {{will open the}} pylon in return for [...] "odumani" [...] - everything, {{referring}} to all the Marshalls' belongings. Seeing {{no other way to}} help her family, Holly reluctantly agrees. Later, the Pakuni have piled all of the Marshalls' things into the cart and arrive at the pylon where they resume their chant. Again, the moons all align and the pylon opens but no one comes out. Holly decides to go in after her father and brother but once inside, the door closes again and she finds herself alone. Seconds later, the Pakuni watch as the door opens again and Rick and Will step out. Rick <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and finds that time outside the pylon has passed more quickly than inside but that he is confident that they can use this pylon to return home. They are about to return to the cave to tell Holly the good news when they realize that all their belongings are there and that something must have happened to Holly. Rick grows angry at Ta and demands that he open the pylon.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers {{had become}} one of America's {{favorite}} theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, [...] "First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly <b>checked</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and ad-libbed, [...] "The 9:20's right on time. You can set your watch by the Lehigh Valley." ...|$|R
50|$|HergÃ©, {{the creator}} of Tintin, makes a number of Hitchcock-like cameo {{appearances}} in the cartoon seriesâ€”as he often did in the original books. Most {{of the time he}} is just a passing figure in the street, such as when he is <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> in The Blue Lotus or a reporter (The Broken Ear) or a technician (Explorers on the Moon). These brief appearances, however, are not sporadic as he is featured in all of the TV episodes. His letter box can even be seen next to Tintin's in The Crab with the Golden Claws. Other cameos are less flattering: he is a gangster in Tintin in America and an inmate at the lunatic asylum in Cigars of the Pharaoh, along with his fellow artist and collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|R
40|$|A brief mime showing two players, A and B, in {{two large}} sacks on the stage. Beckett {{specified}} ?violent? lighting and extended the notion {{by having the}} players prodded into action by a ?goad. ? A is ?slow, awkward and absent? whereas B is ? brisk, rapid, precise. ? The goad prods A into movement and a dull, gradual emergence to set about his banal routine. Disheveled and sulky, he eventually undresses and re-enters the sack. At this point, the goad prods B into action. He embarks on a more complicated routine, <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> moving briskly to relocate the sacks on the stage before retiring {{back to his own}} sack. The goad, now on two wheels, awakens A and the routine goes on. What unites A and B is the equal absurdity of their lives in a vicious circle of never-ending useless activity. Cast: Pat Kinevane as A, Marcello Magni as B...|$|R

5000|$|The short {{begins with}} a narrator (voiced by an uncredited Robert C. Bruce) who {{introduces}} a 5 inch tall dwarf elephant. Its huge roar causes a dock worker to faint. In the next scene, the elephant is hogging the bird bath in a yard. The owner of the house phones the police about it, but is merely taken to a mental hospital because they believe he's crazy. Next, a woman hanging up the laundry in another yard is handed clothes pins by the elephant. When she notices, she screams in horror and runs inside, taking refuge in a washer. Next, a man exits an optometry clinic with new glasses, but {{when he sees the}} tiny elephant, he marches back inside, punches the optometrist, and leaves, because he thought the doctor made him see things that aren't there. Next, in a high rise apartment, a mother is informed by her daughter that an elephant is in her room. The skeptical mother puts her back to bed. Later, the daughter is bringing a piece of cake to the elephant. This time, the mother goes into her room to look in the dollhouse. When the tiny elephant roars at her, the mother faints in shock. Later, a drunk man leaves a bar, and sees the tiny elephant (who gets the man's attention by roaring). He <b>checks</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and then simply says: [...] "You're late." [...] As he wanders off, he mutters to himself: [...] "He always used to be pink!" [...] After that, a line of elephants at a circus includes the tiny elephant, which freaks out one of the other elephants. A cat chases a mouse under a tent, only to grab the tiny elephant instead. When it roars, the cat turns into a monkey. Later, at a psychiatrist's office, a woman is talking about her life and when the psychiatrist sees the tiny elephant (who had just drank all the water from his drinking glass), he switches places with the woman. Then, the cartoon cuts to a man painting a flag pole. A crowd is watching below. The elephant approaches and roars, causing the spectators to join the flag pole painter. After this, various newspaper headlines describe the panic in the city: [...] "Mass hallucination grips city", [...] "Hundreds Claim to Have Seen Tiny Elephant", [...] "I Seen It.", [...] "Picayune Pachyderm Panics Populace", [...] "Noted Scientist to Take to Air to Calm Alarmed Citizenry". The last headline leads into the final set piece: Robert Bruce Cameron, said scientist, says the elephant is just a figment of everyone's imagination. The tiny elephant walks into view, moving the microphone from the oblivious scientist as he reads his statement to the moderator who is petrified at the bizarre sight. The moderator says that Cameron's views don't necessarily represent the views of the station, and faints. The tiny elephant roars as the cartoon ends. (The moderator is named [...] "Mr. Pratt", a nod to Warner Bros. layout artist Hawley Pratt, who would go on to create the Pink Panther character for DePatie-Freleng Enterprises).|$|E

To the right a large light pole stands near one of many palm trees which decorate the area. To the left stands a statue of a figure holding {{what appears to be a}} spear at the top of a dark column. The column is surrounded by short bushes and a wide, grass yard. The massive city hall stands in the background with a tall archway over its main entrance.; Although the caption reads "City Hall", this building is the Casa de Gobierno (Government House) also known as Casa Rosada (Pink House).

5000|$|The Ronald Cecil Concert Party {{postcard}} shows a {{crowd on}} the Herne Bay seafront around 1913, including rehearsed and choreographed tableaux vivants by actors. It was apparently produced {{in response to}} the contemporary eagerness of aficionados to collect and examine (with a hand lens) the detailed prints made from large glass negatives. The signature of such a postcard is the inclusion of tableaux signifying the fleeting moment, and in this example it is the running boy about to go out of frame on the left, and the policeman <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> in the foreground. The positions of the actors would be held still for the camera at a prearranged moment, which may have been announced by the chiming of the clock tower out of frame to the right, or a call from the man on the right of the stage.

5000|$|The two {{men were}} {{identified}} as Manoel Pereira da Cruz and Miguel JosÃ© Viana, two electronic technicians from Campos dos Goytacazes, a town several kilometers to the northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Following an investigation, police reconstructed a plausible narrative of the men's last days. On August 17, Cruz and Viana left Campos dos Goytacazes with the stated intent {{that they needed to}} purchase some materials for work. The two men then boarded a bus to NiterÃ³i, and arrived at 2:30 pm. Evidence shows that the waterproof coats were purchased at a shop there, and one bottle of water from a local bar. Upon being interviewed, the waitress from the bar described Miguel as [...] "very nervous," [...] and noticed he frequently <b>checked</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> That is the last time they were known to have been seen alive; it is presumed they went directly from the bar to the spot at which they were discovered.|$|R

5000|$|Time was of {{the essence}} and MassÃ©na at once sent one of his aides-de-camp, Charles Oudinot, the son of Marshal Duke of Reggio, with orders to bring forward the Guard cavalry. The young Oudinot hastily set off and MassÃ©na was impatiently <b>checking</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> pressed to commit this cavalry to what he {{believed}} was a decisive action of the battle. Much to the general staff's stupefaction, Oudinot was soon seen returning without any cavalry following him. As {{soon as he saw}} him, MassÃ©na furiously shouted from afar: [...] "Where is the cavalry of the Guard?". The sweaty, dust-covered Oudinot needed a moment to catch his breath after his exhausting gallop but then explained that {{he was not able to}} fetch it. Oudinot had encountered the Guard cavalry deputy commander, General Louis Lepic, who sharply refused to commit his men, saying that he only recognised the Duke of Istria (BessiÃ¨res) as commander and that without explicit orders from its commander, the Guard Horse Grenadiers and Dragoons would not draw their swords. In a staggering display of treachery, BessiÃ¨res was absent from the field of battle, needlessly inspecting a series of ditches where the French army had passed a few days before. Unable to find the commander of the Guard in time, MassÃ©na was forced to admit that the opportunity was lost.|$|R

They poled down the Awanui River, then ran up all available canvas - the ship still had to clear the bar.The Greyhound raced at the bar with the auxiliary engine running and the sails set [...] "Goose Wing" [...] fashion, one boom on the port beam, one boom on the starboard beam and the wind blowing from directly astern.

5000|$|The week {{begins with}} David waking up on Monday morning at 11:00 AM {{to the sound}} of a fast-talking DJ who is playing [...] "7 Days" [...] on the radio. Having left the TV on the {{previous}} night, David sees a story on the news about a firefighter who rescued a baby from a burning building. He turns the TV off and stands up, and as he does, the DJ says [...] "Just rewind and come again". A rewinding noise is heard and the song starts again; a few hours later, David is walking around Southampton and is on the way to see his friends. He sees a busker with a guitar and an open case for donations but walks past him. He also sees a newsstand where the main headline is the story about the firefighter which he saw on the TV earlier. A girl walking by David breaks her high heel and he grabs her hand to stop her from falling to the ground. An old lady sits on a bench with a balloon but lets go of it and it floats away. As he walks through a subway, three boys run past and one of them steps on David's shoe, leaving a speck of mud on it. David walks to the exit of the subway and he sees a beautiful 24-year-old woman wearing sunglasses walking towards him. She asks him what time it is and he pulls back his left sleeve to <b>check</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> but suddenly realises that he isn't wearing it and the woman walks away. These scenes are intercut with scenes at the hairdresser's in the present day, where David is singing the song to the guy cutting his hair (the parts of the lyrics which are questions, such as [...] "Didn't she mind?", [...] "What was the deal?" [...] and [...] "So, was she keen?" [...] are asked by the hairdresser).|$|R
