This paper presents two temperature-aware scheduling approaches to maximize the test throughput {{in the presence of}} inter-chip process variation. The first approach, an off-line technique, improves the test throughput by extending the traditional scheduling method. The second approach, a hybrid one, improves further the test throughput with a <b>chip</b> <b>classification</b> scheme at test time based on the reading of a temperature sensor. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed methods. I...|$|E

The three steel grade materials were dry-turned using aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) duratomic coated inserts at cutting speeds ranging from 1500 – 2000 rpm (229 – 314 m/min), feed rates of 0. 25 – 0. 75 mm/rev and depth of cut kept constant at 0. 5 mm. Surface roughness values at different cutting conditions were measured and analysed. Chips formed at different cutting parameters were collected, classified according to ISO 3685 standards for <b>chip</b> <b>classification</b> and their surface morphology were analysed using optical microscopy. It was observed that feed rate had the greatest influence on surface roughness for the three workpiece materials. Surface finish deteriorated as feed rate increased.

Advanced signal analysis {{was carried out}} by spectral estimation through a parametric method. In this approach, the signal spectrum is assumed to take on a specific functional form, the parameters of which are unknown. The spectral estimation problem becomes one of estimating the unknown parameters of the spectrum model, rather than the spectrum itself. From the cutting force signal, a set of features, corresponding to the characteristic parameters of the spectrum model, were obtained by linear predictive analysis. Decision making on chip form through the analysis of sensor signal features was performed using an unsupervised neural network methodology based on Kohonen maps.

40|$|Abstract—Bio-chips {{are used}} for {{experiments}} on genes and contain various information such as genes, samples and so on. The two-dimensional bio-chips, in which one axis represent genes and the other represent samples, are widely being used these days. Instead of experimenting with real genes which cost lots of money and much {{time to get the}} results, bio-chips are being used for biological experiments. And extracting data from the bio-chips with high accuracy and finding out the patterns or useful information from such data is very important. Bio-chip analysis systems extract data from various kinds of bio-chips and mine the data in order to get useful information. One of the commonly used methods to mine the data is classification. The algorithm that is used to classify the data can be various depending on the data types or number characteristics and so on. Considering that bio-chip data is extremely large, an algorithm that imitates the ecosystem such as the ant algorithm is suitable to use as an algorithm for classification. This paper focuses on finding the classification rules from the bio-chip data using the Ant Colony algorithm which imitates the ecosystem. The developed system takes in consideration the accuracy of the discovered rules when it applies it to the bio-chip data in order to predict the classes.

40|$|Prediction {{of outcome}} in {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) is currently {{based on the}} TNM staging classification; however, histopathological classification alone is insufficient for accurately predicting survival in stage II and III patients. Studies indicate that microarray gene expression profiles can predict survival in CRC. We hypothesize that tumor gene expression in combination with clinical parameters, is a better predictor of outcome in stage II and III colorectal cancers than the TNM stage classification alone. Clinical records and follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed for 58 Stage II and Stage III patients with primary colorectal cancer, who did not receive any neoadjuvant therapy preoperatively and whose samples had been previously analyzed for gene expression profiles using the Affymetrix U 133 a Gene <b>chip.</b> For molecular <b>classification</b> of patients as being at high or low risk for poor survival, samples {{were divided into two}} clusters by hierarchical cluster analysis of genes selected by SAM.

In this paper, we presented a new method and a compact device of classification of microalgae cells by simultaneous detection of three kinds of signals of single microalgae cells in a disposable microfluidic <b>chip.</b> The microfluidic <b>classification</b> device has advantages of fast detection, low cost, and portability. The species of a single microalgae cell can be identified by simultaneous detection of three signals of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF), side light scattering (SLS), and resistance pulse sensing (RPS) of the microalgae cell. These three signals represent the different characteristics of a microalgae cell. A compact device was designed to detect these three signals of a microalgae cell simultaneously.

40|$|The U. S. Antarctic {{meteorite}} {{program began}} in the 1970 s and has provided more than 18, 000 samples in over three decades. The program {{is based on a}} three agency agreement between NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution. The collection, stored at the Johnson Space Center and the Smithsonian, {{is one of the largest}} collections of meteorites in the world and features samples from the moon and Mars, asteroids, and material from the early solar system. A brief consideration of the collection shows that it contains 92. 2 % ordinary chondrites, 3. 2 % carbonaceous chondrites, 3. 7 % achondrites (1. 7 % HED), as well as many puzzling ungrouped meteorites. JSC has sent splits of nearly 20, 000 meteorite samples to more than 500 scientists around the world since 1977. After the meteorites are collected in Antarctica, they are shipped frozen to JSC in Houston, usually arriving in April following the field season. The Astromaterials Curation Office at JSC is responsible for: - receiving the frozen meteorites. - staging: repackaging and changing the samples field identification numbers with official names. - submitting the names to the Nomenclature Committee of the Meteoritical Society for approval as new meteorites. - initial processing: weighing, measuring, describing and photographing the sample and providing a <b>chip</b> for <b>classification</b> to the Smithsonian Institution staff. - the issuing of two newsletters per year, announcing hundreds of new meteorites. - the handling of requests from the scientific community and the allocation of those requests that are approved. - providing supplies and tools for the field team such as teflon bags and tape, aluminum foil, clean tweezers and tongs. - maintaining the meteorite database with more than 76, 000 sample splits. - making petrographic thin and thick sections for the JSC library and scientific investigators. - providing storage and handling of the meteorites in a class 10, 000 clean room.

40|$|Dedicated radio {{hardware}} is {{no longer}} promising {{as it was in}} the past. Today, the support of diverse standards dictates more flexible solutions. Software-defined radio (SDR) provides the flexibility by replacing dedicated blocks (i. e. ASICs) with more general processors to adapt to various functions, standards and even allow mutable design changes. However, such replacement generally incurs significant efficiency loss in circuits, hindering its feasibility for energy-constrained devices. The capability of dynamic and blind spectrum analysis, as featured in the cognitive radio (CR) technology, makes chip implementation even more challenging. This work discusses several design techniques to achieve near-ASIC energy efficiency while providing the flexibility required by software-defined and cognitive radios. The algorithm-architecture co-design is used to determine domain-specific dataflow structures to achieve the right balance between energy efficiency and flexibility. The flexible instruction-set-architecture (ISA), the multi-scale interconnects, and the multicore dynamic scheduling are also proposed to reduce the energy overhead. We demonstrate these concepts on two real-time blind <b>classification</b> <b>chips</b> for CR spectrum analysis, as well as a 16 -core processor for baseband SDR signal processing. The blind classifier achieves a 59 x lower energy compared to an exhaustive method, while the 16 -core SDR processor shows > 2. 4 x higher energy efficiency than state-of-the-art communication processors and closes the gap with functionally-equivalent ASICs to within 2. 6 x. These techniques not only enable energy-efficient and flexible radio implementation, but can also be applied to other domains of computing...|$|R
