We argue that the overall competitiveness of the political arena depends both on the endogenous number of parties contesting the election and the endogenous level of campaign spending. These two dimensions are linked together through their combined effect on the total equilibrium level of political rents. We illustrate the key insights of the model through the analysis of two major electoral institutions: campaign spending limits and <b>compulsory</b> voting. In <b>particular,</b> we show that under some conditions spending caps and compulsory voting can be pro-competitive, leading {{to an increase in}} the number of parties contesting the elections...|$|R

Meanwhile, as the Deep submicron technology fore- shadows highly defective chips era, fault-tolerant designs become <b>compulsory.</b> In <b>particular,</b> the fault tolerance of a core interconnect is critical, and inevitably increases its complexity. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel adaptive routing algorithm that is able to route messages {{in the presence of}} any set of multiple nodes and links failures, as long as a path exists. Compared to the existing solutions, the proposed algorithm provides fault tolerance without using any routing table. It is scalable and can be applied to multicore chips with a 2 D mesh core interconnect of any size. The algorithm is deadlock-free and avoids infinite looping in fault-free and faulty 2 D meshes, based on Virtual Networks and Virtual Channels. We simulated the proposed algorithm using the worst case scenario, regarding the traffic patterns and the failure rate up to 40 %. Experimentation results confirmed that the algorithm tolerates multiple failures even in the most extreme failure patterns. Additionally, we monitored the trade off between the fault tolerance and the average latency for faulty cases, as measurement of the performance degradation. The algorithm detects the interconnects partitioning and enables "preferred paths" for streaming applications...|$|R

We investigate this issue in an informational voting setting, in which some voters are uninformed and face the swing voter’s curse, implying that they can only affect the expected election outcome adversely. We generate predictions using a simple model of strategic voting in which some voters receive a psychological benefit (along the lines of Riker and Ordeshook (1968)) from choosing an action that they consider a legitimate participation in the election. We test our model in a double-blind pen-and-paper laboratory experiment, and find that the main comparative predictions of the model hold in the data, particularly strongly for <b>compulsory</b> voting.

We show that depending on the level of the personal bias (weight on private preference), voting is either according to private preferences or according to signals.

In contrast, when voting takes place according to signals, turnout is locally too low.

The paper develops the implications and describes the construction and administration of a discrete choice experiment to almost 1200 members of Australias mandatory retirement savings scheme. The experiment �nds overall rates of violation of roughly 25 %, and substantial variation in rates, depend- ing on the presentation of investment risk and {{the characteristics of the}} participants. Presentations based on frequency of returns below or above a threshold generate more violations than do presentations based on the probability of returns below or above thresholds. Individuals with low numeracy skills, assessed as part of the ex-periment, are several times more likely to violate implications of the conventional expected utility model than those with high numeracy skills. Older individuals are substantially less likely to violate these restrictions, when risk is presented in terms of event frequency, than are younger individuals. The results pose significant questions for public policy, in <b>particular</b> <b>compulsory</b> de�ned contribution retirement schemes, where the future welfare of participants in these schemes depends on quantitative decision-making skills that a signi�cant number of them do not possess. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has highlighted {{a contradiction in}} regard to environmental reporting in South Africa. Managers, who can influence decisions regarding disclosure, express the view that more environmental reporting is needed, yet very little such reporting is done. A questionnaire was sent to every company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) with the request that the financial director should complete it. The questionnaire set out to establish whether managers are still as positive about environmental reporting as reported in previous research findings and, furthermore, to determine {{the reasons for the}} dearth of environmental reporting. Managers are still as positive as before about environmental reporting. The reasons for not reporting range from the contention that data is not available, that there are no legal requirements and that there is no demand for the data to the contention that it is not applicable to the particular industry and that costs exceed benefits. Most respondents do not regard the fear of liability to be a very important reason for non-disclosure. The most important reason for non-disclosure {{is that there is no}} legal requirement in respect of disclosure. This reason, together with the positive attitude of directors towards environmental reporting in general and towards reporting on a <b>compulsory</b> basis in <b>particular,</b> makes a strong case for the introduction of legislation in this regard.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, {{scholarship}} across disciplines has employed the "ghostly" as critical lens {{for understanding the}} upheavals of modernity. The ghost stands metaphorically for the lasting trace {{of what has been}} erased, whether bodies or histories. The ghost always stands for something, rather than the ghost simply is [...] a conception in keeping with dominant Western rationalism. But such a reading practice threatens the very sort of violent erasure it means to redress, uncovering lost histories at the expense of non-Western and "minority" ways of knowing. What about the ghost as ghost? What about the array of non-rational knowledges out of which the ghostly frequently emerges? This project seeks to transform the application of the ghostly as scholarly lens, bringing to bear Foucault's notion of "popular" knowledges and drawing from Asian American studies and critical mixed race studies frameworks. Its timeline begins with the 1965 Immigration Act and traces across the 1970 s to 1990 s rise of multiculturalism and the 1980 s to 2000 s rise of the Multiracial Movement. For field of analysis, the project turns to Asian American literature and its rich evocations of the ghostly and <b>compulsory</b> rationalism, in <b>particular</b> Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior and China Men, Amy Tan's The Hundred Secret Senses, Nora Okja Keller's Comfort Woman, Lan Cao's Monkey Bridge, Heinz Insu Fenkl's Memories of My Ghost Brother, Shawna Yang Ryan's Water Ghosts, and Ruth Ozeki's A Tale for the Time Being. It outlines a new reading strategy, a new means of conceiving of both Asian American literature and existing "spectral" scholarship as cultural productions. It also addresses a dimension of American history and lived reality that scholarship to date has not only ignored but actively suppressed. And insofar as the reach of "spectral" scholarship extends well beyond Asian American communities and Asian American studies [...] across an interdisciplinary net of subjects, a cross-cultural set of histories [...] this project is a necessary corrective with a wide scope of consequence for scholarly practice more generally. What it offers is an alternative approach, an alternative vision, reaching for a progressive politics of the ghostly...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 How can {{education}} in the Arctic foster individual and community resilience {{in a time of}} rapid social-environmental change? Education and learning, have powerful potential to affect future social-environmental system resilience. This research unpacks and examines the connections and feedbacks among studies of social-environmental systems (SESs), resilience, compulsory education and Indigenous knowledge. The last few decades have witnessed global recognition of rapid climate change in the Arctic; primarily the diminishing cryosphere. This has led to discussion and debate over the role of schools in addressing local knowledge, environmental changes, and community priorities. In the U. S. state of Alaska and in other Arctic regions, the role of <b>compulsory</b> schooling, in <b>particular</b> public schools, in improving the fit between environmental changes, learning practices, and future policies for local to regional Arctic SESs has been largely overlooked. I hypothesize that, as extensions of governments, public schools in the U. S. Arctic and in similar locations offer an opportunity to better link societies and environments through governance. At the individual level, education is a vital component of resilience, but such education must embrace multiple perspectives in its curriculum to honor and access the diverse input offered by local, Indigenous, and Western methods of knowledge production. At the societal scale, schools are an untapped resource with which to meet the challenge of bolstering capacity for proactive adaptation in a time of rapid transformation. Youth in the Arctic will actively shape the future yet currently remain an untapped resource in the pursuit of community resilience. Critical thinking exercises like scenarios development are crucial to build adaptive capacity, in large part through entraining leadership skills based on multiple forms of knowledge brought to bear on the complexity of SES change. This research demonstrates, through three periods of fieldwork between 2012 - 2016 engaging resident youth and older experts from the Northwest Arctic and North Slope Boroughs, the significance of compulsory, higher, and Indigenous educations to residents. The cumulative results of this interdisciplinary study offer two overarching and generalizable lessons. First, empowering young people through rigorous involvement in multiple knowledge systems, thinking, deliberating, and planning for futures develops a foundation for effective individual and community resilience throughout their adult years. Second, alternative school practices can provide the flexibility, support, and innovation necessary to enable young people to gain Western education but with ample time and space to provide Indigenous knowledge learning and to engage in livelihoods based on their unique environments and the traditions of their ancestors...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This study {{investigates the}} effect of the debt {{counselling}} procedure, {{as well as the other}} provisions of the National Credit Act, on the choice of the debtor or creditor to make use of the sequestration procedure in terms of the Insolvency Act. The Insolvency Act and the procedures it makes available are discussed in detail. There are two distinguishable options, namely voluntary surrender and <b>compulsory</b> sequestration, and <b>particular</b> focus is placed on the 'advantage to creditors' requirement. This requirement is of the utmost importance because the court will seldom if ever grant a sequestration order if it cannot be proven that the creditors will gain at least some form of benefit from it. The ‘advantage’ requirement is also applicable with regards to compulsory sequestration, but the onus of proof is not as strict as with voluntary surrender. The aim of this requirement is to protect creditors so that they could at least recover part of their debt. The second chapter deals with the procedure in accordance with section 74 of the Magistrates Court Act, referred to as an administration order. This is another type of debt relief available to debtors. However, there are strict requirements that have to be met before a debtor will be allowed to make use of this procedure. These requirements include that the debt owed by the debtor should not exceed R 50 000 and the composition of the debt should not be complicated. This procedure is not applied very often as very few debtors owe less that R 50 000. The procedures brought into life by the Credit Act are of the utmost importance for this study. The Credit Act added various new terms to the law, including overindebtedness, reckless credit, debt counselling and debt review. Each of these terms’ meaning and their effect on current procedures, as prescribed by legislation, are analysed. Following various court judgments it has become clear that the Credit Act has in fact changed the legal position drastically. In my opinion the debtor is afforded much more protection in terms of the Credit Act when it is compared to the protection that he received in terms of the Insolvency Act. Various mandatory steps were added which a creditor, or credit provider in terms of the Credit Act, must comply with before he will be allowed to claim a debt from a debtor, or consumer in terms of the Credit Act. This creates a situation where the creditor is sometimes disadvantaged since the debtor is granted a reprieve and the period he is allowed to repay his debts is often extended without the consent or input from the creditor. As soon as a debt restructuring order has been made by court, the creditor cannot take the decision on review. Regarding the relationship between insolvency procedures and debt review, it has happened on more than one occasion that creditors as well as debtors have made use of sequestration procedures only then to be forced by the courts to rather make use of debt review. This means that both creditors and debtors no longer have a choice regarding which procedure, and in accordance with which act, they would like to pursue. I am of the opinion that despite this there still is a place for both procedures in South African law. The best procedure to follow would depend on the special circumstances of each individual case.

5000|$|Sedigheh Karimi, {{researcher}} at the University of Melbourne, in 2014 argued that virtual environment like My Stealthy Freedom provides opportunities for independent representation and for introducing new identities: Admittedly, in this traditionally male-dominated part of the world, women have gradually risen from being just mothers and housewives confined mainly to the private spheres of their families, to becoming influential players in public life. New media offer decent promises for women ability to construct their identities on their own in the public sphere. To give an instance, Facebook content indeed indicates information of self-presentation and personal documentation of everyday lives of users. Facebook acts as an archive of social relationships and provides a means of recording ongoing interactions. It {{is a way of}} archiving the self, storing biography and enhancing social memory. Thus, Facebook can offer a record of the texture of individuals’ daily lives or at least a view of life that users wish to portray.To sum up, cyberspace represents a new glimpse of hope for many marginalized groups, including women. The interactive and open nature of this virtual environment gives those groups opportunities for independent representation of themselves, and a potential for introducing new identities. S. Karimi Karimi paraphrases some scholars who believe that Islamic culture and veil deconstruct women's self-identity and reconstruct and identity of obedience for them, and state that participants of the campaign are courageous women who have shocked the World since Facebook has approximately 1,3 billion users. Alison N. Novak from Temple University and Emad Khazraee from the University of Pennsylvania stressed importance of breaking boundaries of the state's internet censorship efforts: The goal of My Stealthy Freedom is to mobilize public opinion regarding the issue of women's rights, hijab, and the female body. Particularly salient to the use of My Stealthy Freedom are the intersections of risk in protest through the use of Twitter and Facebook. Both social media platforms are illegal in Iran, requiring users to access illegal circumvention tools to get around the country’s firewall. A. N. Novak & E. Khazraee Gholam Khiabany, a senior lecturer in Media and Communications department at Goldsmiths, University of London, has praised Alinejad's campaign: The Stealthy Freedom campaign has {{to be seen as a}} continuation of the challenges, concerns, and anxieties over hijab in Iran. This concern has been expressed, produced, and reproduced in different forms. Without a doubt, the Stealthy Freedom campaign has to be seen as an innovative and effective idea for highlighting the real concerns over <b>compulsory</b> hijab in <b>particular,</b> and women's personal freedom in general. The campaign also reveals the great potential of civil disobedience against 'moral' concerns of the Iranian state. Gh. Khiabany Victoria Tahmasebi-Birgani, an assistant professor of women and gender studies at the University of Toronto, also gave compliments: Online campaigns such as MSF Stealthy Freedomare enabling sites in which Iranian women can publicly talk about their everyday acts of defiance, even if this amounts to a simple image of unveiled hair, [...] "inappropriate" [...] laughter in a public space, or a picture of a palm with the gender equality sign written on it. Iranian women's active participation on online platforms empowers them to connect the intimate stories of their private lives, their excluded bodies, and their forbidden desires to the larger context of Iran's struggle for a more inclusive and gender-egalitarian future. V. Tahmasebi-Birgani Gi Yeon Koo, a cultural anthropologist from Seoul National University and the member of Institute of Cross-Cultural Studies, stated: This online movement finds its value in that it has become a new platform for women to raise their voices in the public sphere. In contemporary Iranian society, the hijab is one of the most political devices as it transcends a mere Islamic garment and holds symbolic significance, representing one of the greatest political struggles between the reformists and the conservatives. G. Y. Koo As Iman Ganji, Koo also aligns the movement with social changes started since Hassan Rouhani assumed the presidency. In 2015 the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy gave Alinejad its women's rights award for [...] "giving a voice to the voiceless and stirring the conscience of humanity to support the struggle of Iranian women for basic human rights, freedom and equality".|$|R
40|$|Military Service and Women’s Conditions in Israel: Some Elements of ReflectionWomen’s {{condition}} in Israel finds his roots in several factors: cultural, socio-economical, religious {{as a reflection}} of the complexity of people in this country. The geopolitical situation, linked to the state of war of Israel, also affect women’s life in Israel. Israel {{is one of the few}} countries, and the only western country in the world, that drafts women in the army <b>compulsory</b> service. In <b>particular</b> this element creates interesting paradoxes between women’s contribution to the defence of the country, the status traditionally attributed to them and their own path to emancipation in the Israeli society. The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) is a central institution for the Israeli society. IDF draws the societal hierarchy in the State, determines the attribution of resources and it represents a way of access to the political arena in Israel. Responding to the national duties, among which the compulsory service is the highest expression, is what makes one a good citizen. But in Israel a wide cleavage between women and men is perpetrated in the army and into the military organisation itself. By consequence the gender division in the army is reproduced in civil life as well. Women serve in the army for a shorter period of time, their contribution, for most of them, is reduced to female work and, once freed by the army duty, they do not enjoy socio-economical opportunities as men do. Many feminists and that part of the women movements which had more influence in the Parliament, started to focus their attention on the achievement of a wider range of jobs and positions for women in the army. These last decades have seen important changes in the Israeli army that have modified its structure in particular concerning the gender relations and the women’s role in the military. The opening of flight courses for officers to women was an important starting point as well as the opening of combat units. The second Lebanon war has seen for the first time, since the birth of the Israeli Nation, women’s operational participation during a conflict. This marks a big change for the Israeli army, which may lead to a new balance of opportunities between women and men and a transformation of the classical roles attributed to women and their public participation in social and political life in Israel. In order to understand the social and gender implications of the presence of women in the army, the article will start considering the meaning of the compulsory service in Israel at the light of the centrality of the IDF in the Israeli society. How does the Israeli society understand the army experience? What impact has the army and in <b>particular</b> the <b>compulsory</b> service in the lives of Israelis?We will then focus in <b>particular</b> on the <b>compulsory</b> service for women. What is its structure? Which have been the different steps for the achievement of the position women now have in the army in Israel? We will analyse then one of the main concept currently used to define the army service in Israel: rite of passage and rite of citizenship. We will claim that the army service is now understood and lived by individuals in very different ways. The compulsory service is an experience that people coming from different parts of the society live in many different ways. This is especially true for women. The army service as a rite of passage for the majority of its conscripts seems to lose its characteristic of transmutation (the passage from one status to another), but it still remains a rite of institution. In a gender perspective, the army service, as a rite of institution, can be seen as a ritual that distinguishes, once and for all, the female army experience from the male one and finally reinforcing the gender differences. At last we will try to enlighten the impact of the army experience on women in Israel in their path to emancipation and we will claim that the IDF plays a big role in the socialisation and internalisation of gender roles in the Israeli society. We will also claim that other agencies exist, like the national school education and the religious institution, that influence the building of women’s identity and contribute to determine the status of women in Israel. Some of these agencies influence directly the army institution...|$|R
