5000|$|Except {{for very}} large examples, {{lubrication}} {{was almost always}} manual. Main crankshaft bearings and the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> on the crankshaft generally has a grease cup—a small container (cup) filled with grease and a screwed-on cover. [...] When the cover is screwed down tighter, grease is {{forced out of the}} bottom of the cup and into the bearing. Some early engines have just a hole in the bearing casting cap where an operator squirts lubricating oil while the engine is running. The piston is lubricated by a drip oiler that continuously feeds drips of oil onto the piston. The excess oil from the piston runs out of the cylinder onto the engine and eventually onto the ground. The drip oiler can be adjusted to drip faster or slower depending on the need for lubrication, dictated by how hard the engine is working. The rest of the moving engine components were all lubricated by oil that the engine operator would have to apply from time to time while the engine was running.|$|E

40|$|Main and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> {{along the}} {{crankshaft}} in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow {{to ensure the}} performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main <b>bearing</b> and the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> large end <b>bearing</b> loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> large end <b>bearing</b> and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> large end and small end bearing stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main <b>bearing</b> and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> large end <b>bearing</b> appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> small end <b>bearing</b> appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the theoretical modelling of the torque-producing mechanism in a radial-piston, eccentric-type, hydraulic mvtor for low-speed operation. The major difficulty in such an malysis is the description of the,frictional losses which, at low speeds, principally result from boundary lubrication conditions. The level of friction is also dependent on the distribution of the transferred forces and the amount of distortion in the bearings These forces vary during the pressure cycle, and squeeze-jlm ejects are introduced between the bearing faces during the period of time,following the introduction of pressure into the cylinder. The interaction between the frictional effect in the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> and the operation of the hydrostatic slipper i s central to the modelling process. Friction coefficients in the bearings are determined that predict similar efficiencies to those obtained from test measurements on a low-speed motor.

40|$|Most {{machinery}} failures {{are attributed}} to wear of components. Experimental investigation of wear is highly demanding, especially for internal combustion (IC) engines, due to the complex reciprocating mechanism. This thesis presents a simulation based approach to investigate the wear related faults in IC engine bearings, through the integration of two approaches i. e. wear and vibration based analysis, for timely fault detection and prediction of remaining lifetime of the bearings. An engine dynamics model is established to provide the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> with actual service environment. The inherent engine inertia and the combustion force determine the magnitude of load on the bearing. To balance this load, a hybrid force model is developed to cover a range of lubrication regimes and provide real time information on bearing dynamics. The simulated information is robust to predict wear depths and generate corresponding vibration signals {{for a range of}} operating conditions. For wear calculation, a variable wear coefficient is simulated as a function of asperity contact area during transition from the mixed to boundary lubrication regime, thus signifying the severity of impending wear with growing contact. The effect of speed, external load and bearing clearance on vibration signals and wear severity is studied and validated through experiments. Envelope analysis successfully revealed the wear critical locations and wear severity for all operating conditions tested. From simulated data, appropriate vibration and wear based indicators are identified for correlation analysis. A relation is developed which can enable the prediction of bearing wear situation directly based on the selected vibration based indicator (I-Kaz coefficient) without having to actually inspect the bearing for wear. A framework for predicting the remaining lifetime of the bearings through instantaneous wear rates obtained from simulation is also presented. The application of the developed method is demonstrated on a Toyota 3 SFE engine, but the application is equally valid for any similar engine, provided the engine parameters are updated. Being vested with the combined benefits of wear and vibration based analysis techniques; the developed simulation is capable to detect bearing faults with good accuracy, with minimal dependence on real engine testing, for validation purpose only...|$|E

5000|$|Oil {{circulation}} is kept {{separate from}} the fuel/air mixture, thereby preserving oil rather than burning it as happens in two-stroke engines.

50|$|When {{compared}} to a V6 or V8, an inline four will generally have somewhat lower frictional losses at a comparable engine speed due to having fewer pistons, <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> and <b>bearings,</b> although the lower frictional loss is offset in practice by the inline four's need to operate at a higher RPM {{compared to}} a larger engine {{in order to produce}} equivalent power.|$|R
40|$|Available design {{trends for}} big end <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> utilize widely adopted rapid methods for {{prediction}} of minimum film thickness {{due to their}} superior speed and ease of use.

The significance of structural elasticity and updated models was investigated using a mode based elastohydrodynamic lubrication model which includes body forces, mass conserving cavitation, and surface roughness. Eight physical <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> were modeled using finite element methods and simulated over a variety of conditions, varying engine speed, bearing clearance, and oil viscosity. The results show operating conditions where rapid methods can inaccurately predict minimum film thickness.

50|$|Unlike larger engines, the {{crankcase}} {{does not}} contain only engine oil because it handles the fuel/air mixture.

These engines have been used in larger sizes for small cars. They were considered in the 1980s as more fuel efficient engines for larger cars, but the increased interest in engine emissions at this time prevented their use: mixing their lubricating oil into the engine's intake mixture gave high HC emissions and this problem was not overcome.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{rapid and}} {{globally}} convergent predictive tool for dynamically loaded journal bearing design is developed. For accomplishment {{of such an}} aim, a neural network model of crankshaft and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> in an internal combustion engine is developed as an alternative for the complicated and time-consuming models. Six most important parameters are selected as inputs of neural network. These parameters are: oil viscosity, engine speed, bearing radial clearance, bearing diameter, slenderness ratio and maximum force applied on bearings. Also, some significant parameters are calculated as neural network outputs. These parameters include: all components of friction loss, all components of oil consumption, minimum oil film thickness, eccentricity, oil temperature rise and displacement relative to shell. In addition, an optimum analysis is performed. To achieve such a target, multi-objective optimization methodology is a good approach inasmuch as several types of objective are minimized or maximized simultaneously. The optimization goal is to minimize friction loss and lubricant flow as the two objectives and develop a Pareto optimal front...|$|R
40|$|The {{heating and}} {{mechanics}} effects {{due to the}} temperatures and pressures in bearings were largely studied these last years but separately; few studies are devoted to the two phenomena acting together in dynamic mode, such as the crankshaft and rod bearings; where the requirements are very severe.

Simulation résults of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> of in internal combustion engine are presented and show that the thermal distortion has remarkable effects on the bearings performances; therefore the thermo-elastohydrodynamic analysis is very recommended to predict the performances of the journal bearings in internal combustion engines...|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low oil pressure. 1) no oil or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with oil pressure as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low oil pressure can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> will seize. Indications of low oil pressure may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine.

5000|$|In 1961 the Series IIIA was {{announced}} with the Series II Sunbeam Alpine [...] engine. Externally and internally the Series IIIA was {{identical to the}} Series III. The improvements were directed solely at improving the durability of the car. To this end, engine capacity was increased and a stiffer crankshaft fitted. To increase reliability, the crankshaft incorporated larger diameter <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> which called for modifications to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> and gudgeon pins. Modified oil and water pumps completed the engine changes. As a result, power output increased from [...] to [...] at 5,100 rpm and torque increased from 84 lbft Nm at 3500 rpm to [...] at 3,900 rpm. In addition, the Series IIIA included many detail changes such as an increased diameter front anti-roll bar which greatly improved roadholding, a redesigned clutch bell housing, a revised clutch assembly with nine pressure springs instead of six and a redesigned air cleaner assembly. Inside the car a fresh-air heater, hitherto available only at extra cost, became a standard fitting. [...] All of these changes combined to make the Series IIIA subtly different from its predecessor and to give the Sunbeam Rapier a new lease {{of life in the}} showroom.|$|R
50|$|Following {{two years}} of {{production}} improvements were introduced in September 1927 for that year's motor show. The wheelbase was lengthened by 2 in but not the car's overall length. The steering was improved for a smoother and lighter action and the column rake was now adjustable. The front brake cables were replaced with rods. The engine received larger crankshaft and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> and an anti-detonating ("anti-knock") design adopted for the cylinder head. A Weymann fabric bodied 4-light 4-door sports saloon (as chosen for personal use by Henry Segrave) with safety glass option and a 6-light Safety saloon (fitted with Triplex safety glass) joined the range. The artillery wheel option was dropped. Dipping headlights were a new feature. Separate seats replaced the front bench seat and both back and front seats were widened. There were also changes to the mudguards and running boards. The export car was widened to 67 in inches and its track to 56 in inches. A water-impeller and a large top radiator tank were also fitted to export cars.|$|R
