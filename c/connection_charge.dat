40|$|This two-part paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} retail electricity tariffs for distribution systems with distributed energy resources such as solar power and storage. In particular, the optimal design of dynamic two-part tariffs for a regulated monopolistic retailer is considered, where the retailer faces exogenous wholesale electricity prices and fixed costs {{on the one hand}} and stochastic demands with inter-temporal price dependencies on the other. Part I presents a general framework and analysis for revenue adequate retail tariffs with advanced notification, dynamic prices and uniform connection charges. It is shown that the optimal two-part tariff consists of a dynamic price that may not match the expected wholesale price and a <b>connection</b> <b>charge</b> that distributes uniformly among all customers the retailer's fixed costs and a price-volume risk premium. A sufficient condition for the optimality of the derived two-part tariff among the class of arbitrary ex-ante tariffs is obtained. Numerical simulations quantify the substantial welfare gains that the optimal two-part tariff may bring compared to the optimal linear tariff (without <b>connection</b> <b>charge).</b> Part II focuses on the impact of two-part tariffs on the integration of distributed energy resources.

This paper presents a transmission pricing method based on electricity tracing which is applicable to the EGAT existing transmission business unit (from 1997 to 2003) and third party access to GridCo through bilateral transaction (from 2003 onwards).

40|$|Lighting {{is one of}} the {{determinants}} of quality of life. In most developing countries, households spend a considerable part of their cash income on modern fuels to meet their lighting needs. The average amount of fuel consumed for lighting is much higher in villages without electricity than in villages with it; moreover, people with non-electric light have much lower lighting levels than people with electric lights. Why then do people use non-electric lighting when electricity is available? Mainly because they fit well with poor family spending patterns. The initial cost and per month cost of a wick lamp are low, and kerosene can be bought in small quantities as needed. Households with electricity are accustomed to much higher levels of light, for which they have to finance a <b>connection</b> <b>charge,</b> installation cost and for which they pay more for regular use. It is found that houses with electric lighting typically have lighting in every room, whereas non-electric users tend to use only one lamp for the whole house. Although both kinds of lamp give light, they are not directly comparable; it takes 18 kerosene lamps to give off the light of a single 60 watt incandescent bulb.

Thus these units are not effectively contributing to the on line spinning reserves to maintain power system / grid stabilization.

40|$|This two-part paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} retail electricity tariffs for distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs). Part I presents a framework to optimize an ex-ante two-part tariff for a regulated monopolistic retailer who faces stochastic wholesale prices {{on the one hand}} and stochastic demand on the other. In Part II, the integration of DERs is addressed by analyzing their endogenous effect on the optimal two-part tariff and the induced welfare gains. Two DER integration models are considered: (i) a decentralized model involving behind-the-meter DERs in a net metering setting, and (ii) a centralized model involving DERs integrated by the retailer. It is shown that DERs integrated under either model can achieve the same social welfare and the net-metering tariff structure is optimal. The retail prices under both integration models are equal and reflect the expected wholesale prices. The connection charges differ and are affected by the retailer's fixed costs as well as the statistical dependencies between wholesale prices and behind-the-meter DERs. In particular, the <b>connection</b> <b>charge</b> of the decentralized model is generally higher than that of the centralized model. An empirical analysis is presented to estimate the impact of DER on welfare distribution and inter-class cross-subsidies using real price and demand data and simulations. The analysis shows that, with the prevailing retail pricing and net-metering, consumer welfare decreases with the level of DER integration. Issues of cross-subsidy and practical drawbacks of decentralized integration are also discussed. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the households ’ water choice decision and willingness to pay for improvement in water services. Data were collected from 216 randomly selected households from the ten sub-zones of Ijebu- Ode local government area, Ogun State. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, generalized linear demand and logit regression models. Results show that majority of households ’ water supply was from private piped/borehole (64. 8 %) followed by public piped (18. 5 %), and well (16. 7 %,). Also, majority (58. 3 %) of the households are dissatisfied with the current water supply situation and the households preferred water choices are public piped (64. 4 %), private piped/borehole (30. 1 %) and well water (5. 6 %) [...] These preferences of household’s water choices were determined by quality, convenience, availability and cost with 35. 6 %, 33. 3 %, 18. 5 % and 12. 5 % respectively. It was revealed further that household per capita expenditure on water is N 60 (US$ 0. 38) per day an equivalent of N 1, 800 (US$ 11. 5) per month which are significantly higher than current <b>connection</b> <b>charge</b> for public piped per month. The result of generalized linear demand model shows that connection charges, household size, distance to water source, availability and quality of water source, unit price paid per liter, and marital status were determinants of households ’ water choices.

40|$|The thesis synthesises current {{water utility}} practice, and {{economic}} theory, {{through the development}} of a practical water rate based on marginal cost pricing. The suggested water rate is a three part tariff consisting of volumetric, <b>connection</b> and access <b>charges.</b> The volumetric charges recover the long run marginal costs associated with water demand, and include peak and off-peak prices. They are calculated using an extension to the Turvey concept of long run marginal cost. The <b>connection</b> <b>charges</b> represent the marginal costs associated with connecting to the system, rather than those associated with water demand. They are of two types: those related to the local distribution network, and those related to annual operating costs. An access charge is also suggested as a means of recovering residual common costs associated with economies of scale related to production. The proposed water rate, while based primarily on possible welfare improvements, also promises gains in simplicity in use and rate stability over time, compared to current practice...|$|R
