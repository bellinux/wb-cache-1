40|$|The {{effect of}} dipole–dipole <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> {{on the net}} nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) has been {{analyzed}} here for realistic systems by extending the three-spin calculations to four and five spins in order to account for additional <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> and spin diffusion. These have been compared {{with the addition of}} leakage terms to the three-spin system. The additional spins enhance cross-correlation effects on one hand but on the other act as supplementary relaxation pathways for the magnetization to diffuse. This analysis shows that for a linear array of spins in the long-correlation limit, dipole–dipole <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> increase net NOE, while spin diffusion decreases it, and that the cumulative effect is a reduced effect of <b>cross</b> <b>correlations.</b> In other geometries and correlation limits, the effect of <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> on net NOE is generally small...|$|R

Numerous {{methods have been}} proposed to characterize the multifractal nature of these long-range <b>cross</b> <b>correlations.</b> However, several important issues about these methods are not well understood and most methods consider only one moment order. We study the joint multifractal analysis based on partition function with two moment orders, which was initially invented to investigate fluid fields, and derive analytically several important properties. We apply the method numerically to binomial measures with multifractal <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> and bivariate fractional Brownian motions without multifractal <b>cross</b> <b>correlations.</b> For binomial multifractal measures, the explicit expressions of mass function, singularity strength and multifractal spectrum of the <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> are derived, which agree excellently with the numerical results.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dipolar <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> and strong {{coupling}} in transverse relaxation of single- and multiple-quantum coherences is investigated for a homonuclear ABX spin system. Analytical expressions for the linewidth of each coherence, in {{the limit of}} the simple-line approximation, have been obtained by explicit calculation of the spectral densities at frequencies zero, ω, and 2 ω, where ω is the Larmor frequency. The results are presented in a matrix notation which clearly separates the contribution of auto- and cross-correlation spectral densities as well as the contribution of strong coupling to these linewidths. It is found that, in the strong-coupling situation, all the coherences between mixed eigenstates have unequal linewidths in the presence {{as well as in the}} absence of <b>cross</b> <b>correlations.</b> In the weak-coupling limit, the <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> show up as a differential effect to the linewidths such that single-quantum coherences among themselves and the double- and zero-quantum coherences taken together have equal numbers of cross terms with positive and negative sign.

For bFBMs, MFXWT may provide spurious multifractality because of the wide spanning range of the multifractal spectrum. We also apply the MFXWT method to stock market indexes and uncover intriguing joint multifractal nature in pairs of index returns and volatilities. Comment: 10 pages and 6 figue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} blind source {{separation}} consists in retrieving unknown source signals from their mixtures. In {{the estimation of}} sources, most of the proposed algorithms use stochastic or natural gradient to optimize some contrast function obtained from the independence property of sources. In this paper, we deal with non-stationary source signals, and propose a new approach, based on the second order statistics, to blindly separate them. Our approach {{is based on the}} assumption that the <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> of the output signals should be equal to zero. The <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> are parameterized by the weights of a self organized neural network, which implements a demixing model. The dynamics of the neural network weights and observations of the <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> are represented using the state space model. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to estimate the unknown weights. As an on-line second order optimization algorithm, EKF showed superior convergence properties compared to the stochastic gradient descent based separating algorithm. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} imaging with passive {{arrays of}} sensors using as illumination ambient noise sources. The first step for imaging {{under such circumstances}} is the computation of the <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> of the recorded signals, which have attracted {{a lot of attention}} recently because of their numerous applications in seismic imaging, volcano monitoring, and petroleum prospecting. Here, we use these <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> for imaging reflectors with travel-time migration. While the resolution of the image obtained this way has been studied in detail, an analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is presented in this paper along with numerical simulations that support the theoretical results. It is shown that the SNR of the image inherits the SNR of the computed <b>cross</b> <b>correlations</b> and therefore it is proportional to the square root of the bandwidth of the noise sources times the recording time. Moreover, the SNR of the image is proportional to the array size. This means that the image can be stabilized by increasing the size of the array when the recorded signals are not of long duration, which is important in applications such as non-destructive testing. ...|$|R
