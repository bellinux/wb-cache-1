50|$|No. 2002 {{proved to}} be more {{efficient}} than 2001, due to a lower <b>cylinder</b> <b>clearance</b> volume and because the stepped-cam cutoff modifications made to No. 2001 reduced economical working relative to the infinitely variable cutoff of No. 2002. Consequently, the following locomotives were built with piston valves.|$|E
50|$|Working {{from the}} crankcases out, the 'phase 2' engine sees the crank thrust bearing {{relocated}} {{to the rear}} of the shaft - this reduces transfer of natural frequencies to the transmission, resulting in improved NVH. Pistons are all-new in the B4. Despite being made from forged aluminium, the pistons are heavier (162 up from 152 grams) and incorporate solid skirts, reduced piston pin offset, a molybdenum coating, reduced top-land to <b>cylinder</b> <b>clearance</b> and flat-top combustion surfaces. Improved off-boost torque comes from a raised static compression ratio - 9.0:1 compared to the Impreza WRX's 8.0:1.|$|E
50|$|The PZL P.6 did {{not enter}} {{production}} because the next variant, the more advanced PZL P.7, was developed. The first prototype was basically the P.6 with a more powerful Bristol Jupiter VII F engine. Due {{to the use of}} a supercharger, it had better performance at higher altitudes. The prototype P.7/I was first flown in October 1930 by Bolesław Orliński. Initially, engine cylinders had individual <b>cylinder</b> <b>clearance</b> fairings. After some changes, most noticeably adding a wide Townend ring to the engine and making the tail slimmer, the second prototype P.7/II, built in autumn 1931, was accepted for production with the designation P.7a. It also featured a redesigned wing with slightly increased span, taken from the PZL P.8, and shorter ailerons and smooth upper surfaces, instead of ribbed ones.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "2618" [...] {{performance}} piston alloy {{has less}} than 2% silicon, and {{could be described as}} hypo (under) eutectic. This alloy is capable of experiencing the most detonation and abuse while suffering the least amount of damage. Pistons made of this alloy are also typically made thicker and heavier because of their most common applications in commercial diesel engines. Both because of the higher than normal temperatures that these pistons experience in their usual application, and the higher coefficient of thermal expansion due to low-silicon content causing greater thermal growth, these pistons require a larger piston to <b>cylinder</b> bore <b>clearance</b> at assembly temperatures. This leads to a condition known as [...] "piston slap" [...] which is when the piston rocks in the cylinder and it causes an audible tapping noise that continues until the engine has warmed to operational temperatures, expanding the piston and reducing piston to <b>cylinder</b> wall <b>clearance.</b>|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} here quantifies the forces {{applied to the}} main bearings of three six-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines and reviews their exciting properties in both time and frequency domains. The engine structure response at the bearing supports and the outer surfaces are correlated. Vibration acceleration was measured, in the three different directions, at the engine main bearings and the outer surface. The liner vibrations were also measured. A theoretical model for calculating the bearing forces and estimating the bearing moment characteristics is proposed. The calculated bearing forces are investigated in both time and frequency domains. The characteristics of the forces driving the piston across the <b>cylinder</b> <b>clearance</b> are calculated. The characteristics of the forces acting on the liner by the piston are also calculated. Combining {{the results of the}} measurements with the theoretical model for force calculation, a technique for estimating the actual running clearance of the piston is presented. A technique for deriving the displacement from the measured acceleration is developed. By representing the engine response in terms of displacement it is possible to recognise the applied force time history and thus the identification of the specific parts of the engine structure primarily excited by moments and by direct force. It is shown that the engine structure response is a transient phenomenon and is maximum {{in the vicinity of the}} applied force. The displacement technique for quantifying engine response provides detailed information of the distortion of the running engine enabling the prediction of mechanical inputs which control the turbocharged engine noise...|$|E

50|$|However, {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the overall design whilst the locomotive was under production at Eastleigh Works. The earlier class members mounted a lower running plate that was raised above the <b>cylinders</b> for <b>clearance.</b> These locomotives also sported a single, straight splasher above the driving wheels, an embellishment that would feature on Urie's later N15 class. The later production locomotives did not feature this design, with a higher-mounted straight running plate above the driving wheels, a feature that was perpetuated on the later S15 class design by Urie.|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{displacing}} boom is large-scale motion manipulator. During {{the long}} distance pouring the postures needs to frequently change.

Then transfer matrix method is used to build the multibody concrete placing boom model by dividing the system into two substructures. Next typical working conditions displacements and accelerations during the pouring process are studied. The results of the numerical method are correct and feasible compared with Recurdyn software and the experimental ones. So it provides reference to the real-time monitoring and structure design for such light weight large scale motion manipulators...|$|R

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} control in mechanical systems has become ever more significant for automotive industry where {{the comfort of}} the passenger compartment represents a challenging issue for car manufacturers. The reduction of piston slap noise is pivotal for a good design of IC engines. In this scenario, a methodology has been developed for the vibro-acoustic assessment of IC diesel engines by means of design changes in piston to <b>cylinder</b> bore <b>clearance.</b> Vibration signals have been analysed by means of advanced signal processing techniques taking advantage of cyclostationarity theory. The procedure departs from the analysis of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) in order to identify a representative frequency band of piston slap phenomenon.

The second order harmonic component has been used as the benchmark parameter of piston slap noise. An experimental procedure of vibrational benchmarking is proposed and verified at different operational conditions in real IC engines actually equipped on cars. This study clearly underlines the crucial role of the transducer positioning when differences among real piston-to-cylinder clearances are considered.

40|$|The {{phenomena}} of aggregation and disruption of fat globules in cream subjected to viscous flow were studied, and special care {{was taken to}} exclude air bubbles. In classical churning processes the incorporation of air was essential, but it was clearly shown that also {{in the absence of}} air rapid and efficient churning was possible. Churning was shown to be satisfactory at a fairly narrow range of shearing rates; higher and lower rates led to excessive churning times, or to abnormal butter formation and high fat content in the buttermilk. The experiments were performed in a cylindrical vessel in which a concentric solid cylinder could be rotated at different speeds. The influence of shear rate (<b>cylinder</b> velocity, annular <b>clearance</b> and cream viscosity), temperature, fat content, acidity and fat globule size were studied in relation to churning time and efficiency. Partly empirical equations were derived, describing the relations. A churning time of a few seconds and a fat content in the buttermilk below 1 % could easily be achieved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{different}} types of instabilities of free cylinders (diameter D, length L) have been studied in a viscous flow (velocity U) between parallel vertical walls of horizontal width W at a distance H: {{the influence of the}} confinement parameters D/H and L/W has been investigated. As D/H increases, there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the axis with respect to the horizontal. The two types of oscillations may be superimposed in the transition domain. The frequency f of the transverse oscillations is independent of the lateral confinement L/W in the range: 0. 055 < L/W < 0. 94 for a given cylinder velocity V_cx and increases only weakly with V_cx. These results are accounted for by assuming a 2 D local flow over the cylinder with a characteristic velocity independent of L/W for a given V_cx value. The experimental values of f are also independent of the transverse confinement D/H. The frequency f_f of the fluttering motion is significantly lower than f: f_f is also nearly independent of the cylinder diameter and of the flow velocity but decreases significantly as L/W increases. The fluttering instability is then rather a 3 D phenomenon involving the full length of the <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>clearance</b> between its ends and the side walls...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1997 model year, the 2.2-litre {{engine for}} 1997 Legacy and Impreza models had {{internal}} and external changes that yield an approximately 10% increase in power and 3% increase in fuel economy.Accomplishing this involves many factors, {{one of which is}} engine friction reduction. The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to <b>cylinder</b> wall <b>clearance</b> has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the lash adjuster must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines. The roller assemblies are not serviceable separately, but the rocker arms may be serviced as individual units.The carbon composition head gaskets with integrated o-rings are interchangeable from left to right on 1990 to 1994 NA engines only.Other Engine Modifications (2.2L 1997): The intake manifold has been reshaped to increase the airflow mass and speed, contributing to improved low and mid engine speed operation.

40|$|A {{study of}} engine oil {{consumption}} (OC) was conducted both theoretically and experimentally. It {{was found that}} oil blowing into the combustion chamber through the top ring gap (termed ‘reversed oil’) and oil returning to the crankcase through the oil ring gap (termed ‘blowby oil’) are important factors affecting OC. It was also observed that depending on the ring gap clearance, enlarged because of ring wear (for example the radial ring wear of 50 pm corresponds to a gap enlargement of roughly 0. 31 mm) or non-optimal ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume, the 2 nd land pressure can exceed cylinder pressure-leading to increasing reversed oil and consequently higher OC. The deterioration of OC with increasing operation has been traced to lowered oil-scraping capability with ring wear. This is true. However, the above-mentioned phenomenon {{can be considered as}} another reason for such OC. This paper describes the relationship between reversed oil(b 1 owby oil ratio and OC, and presents a procedure for optimizing ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume for acceptable OC.
