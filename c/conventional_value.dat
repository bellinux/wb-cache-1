60|$|In {{regulating}} {{education by}} this standard, {{there are some}} general considerations that should be ever present to us. The worth {{of any kind of}} culture, as aiding complete living, may be either necessary or more or less contingent. There is knowledge of intrinsic value; knowledge of quasi-intrinsic value; and knowledge of <b>conventional</b> <b>value.</b> Such facts as that sensations of numbness and tingling commonly precede paralysis, that the resistance of water to a body moving through it varies as the square of the velocity, that chlorine is a disinfectant,--these, and the truths of Science in general, are of intrinsic value: they will bear on human conduct ten thousand years hence as they do now. The extra knowledge of our own language, which is given by an acquaintance with Latin and Greek, may be considered to have a value that is quasi-intrinsic: it must exist for us and for other races whose languages owe much to these sources; but will last only as long as our languages last. While that kind of information which, in our schools, usurps the name History--the mere tissue of names and dates and dead unmeaning events--has a <b>conventional</b> <b>value</b> only: it has not the remotest bearing on any of our actions; and is of use only for the avoidance of those unpleasant criticisms which current opinion passes upon its absence. Of course, as those facts which concern all mankind throughout all time must be held of greater moment than those which concern only a portion of them during a limited era, and of far greater moment than those which concern only a portion of them during the continuance of a fashion; it follows that in a rational estimate, knowledge of intrinsic worth must, other things equal, take precedence of knowledge that is of quasi-intrinsic or conventional worth.|$|E

60|$|Thus to the {{question}} we set out with--What knowledge is of most worth?--the uniform reply is--Science. This is the verdict on all the counts. For direct self-preservation, or the maintenance of life and health, the all-important knowledge is--Science. For that indirect self-preservation which we call gaining a livelihood, the knowledge of greatest value is--Science. For the due discharge of parental functions, the proper guidance {{is to be found}} only in--Science. For that interpretation of national life, past and present, without which the citizen cannot rightly regulate his conduct, the indispensable key is--Science. Alike for the most perfect production and highest enjoyment of art in all its forms, the needful preparation is still--Science. And for purposes of discipline--intellectual, moral, religious--the most efficient study is, once more--Science. The question which at first seemed so perplexed, has become, in the course of our inquiry, comparatively simple. We have not to estimate the degrees of importance of different orders of human activity, and different studies as severally fitting us for them; since we find that the study of Science, in its most comprehensive meaning, is the best preparation for all these orders of activity. We have not to decide between the claims of knowledge of great though <b>conventional</b> <b>value,</b> and knowledge of less though intrinsic value; seeing that the knowledge which proves to be of most value in all other respects, is intrinsically most valuable: its worth is not dependent upon opinion, but is as fixed as is the relation of man to the surrounding world. Necessary and eternal as are its truths, all Science concerns all mankind for all time. Equally at present and in the remotest future, must it be of incalculable importance for the regulation of their conduct, that men should understand the science of life, physical, mental, and social; and that they should understand all other science as a key to the science of life.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores Paul's {{approach to}} the social conflicts involving Christian identity in 2 Corinthians. In order to grasp the dynamics of 'social identity' {{in the world of}} the. New Testament, this study examines the significance of the concept of persona and the Roman stress on persona for denoting a person's identify in the Graeco-Roman world in the first century CEo In addition, this study examines Paul's critique of social identity in light of two other figures - Epictetus and Valerius Maximus - and their critiques. All three social critics react against a conventional (or popular) view of persona, which is a preoccupation with its superficial features. In the case of Paul, 2 Corinthians is investigated to show Paul's reaction against the Corinthian Christians' adoption of the <b>conventional</b> <b>values</b> of persona that were prevalent in Roman Corinth. Paul's conflict with the Corinthians is clearly seen in their superficial assessment of his persona as lacking the appropriate credentials for an apostle. Throughout the letter, Paul denounces the <b>conventional</b> <b>values</b> of persona by rejecting the external elements of the outer person and emphasising instead the inner person. Furthermore, in contrast to the Corinthians' <b>conventional</b> <b>values</b> of persona, Paul promotes a subversive Christ-like identity, which is a visible embodiment of the dying and life of Jesus Christ.
