50|$|A 20 million gallon {{irrigation}} reservoir, {{constructed in}} 1997, covers 7.5 acre. Carefully designed to blend with the landscape, the reservoir attracts wild waterfowl, including oyster catchers, great <b>crested</b> grebes and <b>shelducks.</b> Elsewhere on the estate, bird life includes little owls, kingfishers, kestrels, green woodpeckers hobbies, robins, wrens and long-tailed tits. Hedgehogs, foxes, moles, voles, shrews, water voles, {{rabbits and hares}} are common.|$|R
50|$|Torry Bay is {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Intertidal mudflats are an important estuarine habitat for birds and thousands are attracted to the reserve every year. The apparent barrenness of the shore is deceiving. It {{has been estimated that}} one square metre of mud may contain up to 60,000 laver spire snails or thousands of ragworms. These invertebrates provide essential food for the birds that overwinter at Torry Bay. In the winter you can see large numbers of great <b>crested</b> grebe, <b>shelduck,</b> wigeon, curlew, redshank and dunlin. Others like sandwich tern, ringed plover, ruff and greenshank occur on migration during the autumn.Washed up on the beach, you can also find cockles, mussels, periwinkles and tellins. Rockpools often contain butterfish, gobies, sea anemones, shore crabs and shrimps.Pockets of saltmarsh contain colourful flowers such as sea aster, thrift and scurvy grass. One plant that grows in the soft mud is the uncommon eelgrass, an important food source for the wigeon.|$|R

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> or Korean <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> (Tadorna cristata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Anatidae. It is {{critically}} endangered and may be extinct. The male <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> has a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, {{while the rest of}} its face, chin, and throat are brownish black. The male's belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverts are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a white eye ring, black crest, white face, chin, throat, neck, and uppers wing coverts and a dark brown body with white striations. Additionally, both sexes have a distinctive green tuft of feathers protruding from the head.|$|E
50|$|This {{group is}} largely {{tropical}} or Southern Hemisphere in distribution, {{with only two}} species, the common shelduck and the ruddy shelduck breeding in northern temperate regions, though the <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> (presumed extinct) was also a northern species.|$|E
50|$|Nagamichi Kuroda (extra=24 November 1889 - 16 April 1978) was a Japanese ornithologist. His works {{included}} Birds of the Island of Java (2 Volumes, 1933-36) and Parrots of the World in Life Colours (1975). He {{described the}} <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> in 1917.|$|E
50|$|This duck was {{collected}} in Korea and exported to Japan between 1716 and 1736 for aviculture, {{where it was}} known as the Korean Mandarin Duck. It was captured for aviculture in Japan up to at least 1854 and was portrayed in the Kanbun-Kinpu, a Japanese avicultural work. Old Chinese tapestries also portray a duck similar in appearance to the <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck.</b> Kuroda claimed that Japanese hunters were still hunting the species in Korea in the 1920s. Three specimens exist in museums. The only male specimen is kept with a female in the Kuroda collection in the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, Tokyo. The male {{was collected}} {{at the mouth of the}} Geum River in 1913 or 1914, and the female was collected near Busan in December 1916. The female specimen described by Philip Lutley Sclater, collected by Lieutenant F. Irmininger near Vladivostok in April 1877, was displayed in 1894 by the Zoological Society of London and today is kept in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Two additional <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> specimens are known to have existed, though both have been lost. The female collected in 1913 along with the sole male was given to a friend of the collector and subsequently has vanished. Additionally, around 1900 a Chinese hunter offered a specimen to a Peking University professor, but, as the professor did not realize how rare the bird was, he turned it down. In 1991, the <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> appeared on a Mongolian postage stamp.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> is sexually dimorphic, {{with the}} male {{possessing}} a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, {{while the rest}} of its face, chin, and throat are brownish black. The male's belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverlets are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a large white eye ring, black crest, and white face, chin, throat, neck, and upper wing coverts. It also has a dark brown body with white striations. Both sexes have a green tuft of feathers protruding from their head. The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> is about 63 to 71 cm long, and therefore is slightly larger than a mallard. Its bill and legs are pinkish, though those of the female are paler than those of the male. The bill of the male has a small, knob-like appendage at its base. The plumage of the immature is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> {{has been}} {{collected}} near Vladivostok in Russia and near Fusan and Kunsan in Korea. It {{has been proposed}} that the species breeds in far-eastern Russia, northern North Korea, and northeast China and winters in southern Japan, southwest Korea, and along the east China coast {{as far south as}} Shanghai. It is believed to have a relict range, or to have been more widespread in historic times.|$|E
50|$|Very {{little is}} known about this bird because of the limited number of {{observations}} of this species. It apparently breeds in Korea and eastern Russia and is probably a relict species that had a wider distribution in prehistoric times. Some think that this species is extinct, although occasional sightings are reported, including a number of recent reports from the interior wetlands of China. Due to the persistent reports of the species' survival, it is listed as critically endangered. However, the <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> has not been definitively sighted since 1964.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> was {{initially}} collected in April 1877 near Vladivostock, Russia. However, {{it was not}} described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and falcated duck (Anas falcata). Around 1913, a pair was collected in Korea, and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist Nagamichi Kuroda. Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater's suggested parents of the alleged hybrid. Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916, and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan, Kuroda described this bird as Pseudotadorna cristata in 1917. The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda's collection. A {{member of the family}} Anatidae, this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda, but is now placed in the genus Tadorna, which includes six other species of Old World shelducks. The genus name Tadorna comes from the Celtic word tadorne and means [...] "pied waterfowl", essentially the same as the English [...] "shelduck". The specific epithet, cristata, comes from the Latin word for crested. The species' common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck's head. This species is also known as the Korean <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck,</b> Korean sheldrake, and Korean Mandarin.|$|E
50|$|Though {{not much}} {{is known about}} this shelduck, it is {{believed}} to be migratory, traveling from Siberia in the breeding season to Korea, southern Russia, and Japan for the winter. The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> is believed to eat aquatic vegetation, agricultural crops, algae, invertebrates, mollusks, crustaceans, carrion, and garbage. It has been suggested that this shelduck may be a nocturnal feeder. While its nest has not been described, similar shelducks nest in burrows and cavities; it has also been suggested that this species may nest in tree cavities. It has been proposed that this species lays less than ten eggs which the female alone incubates. It is believed to breed from May to July. The shelduck has been observed in flocks of two to eight birds.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>shelduck</b> {{has never}} been {{numerous}} in modern times, though it {{is thought to have}} been more widespread historically due to its presence in Japanese aviculture. The species is known from only a handful of sightings and some retroactively declared it extinct in 1916 after a female was shot at Busan, South Korea. In 1943, a sighting of this bird was reported near Chungcheongbukdo, building hopes that the species persisted. A group of three birds, two females and a male, was sighted by two Russian students in 1964 in the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago near Vladivostok with a small flock of harlequin ducks. In 1971 it was reported from North Korea's northeast coast and in 1985 two were reported from eastern Russia. However, there are severe doubts about the accuracy of the 1971 record. A recent survey of Chinese hunters resulted in a number of unconfirmed reports from northeastern China. For example, a Chinese forest worker claimed that he unknowingly ate two in 1984. There are also unconfirmed reports of about twenty crested shelducks in the Dashanbao region of Yunnan, though many believe this flock to be a misidentified flock of ruddy shelducks. It is believed that, if the species survives, there likely are fewer than 50 individuals.|$|E

This group of 14 species has a worldwide distribution except for North America. The typical sheldgeese are grazing birds, the ecological counterparts of the true geese, while the shelducks are mostly wading and dabbling birds, frequently feeding {{to a large extent}} on aquatic invertebrates. In all of the species the adult male has an enlarged bony bulla in the syrinx, which is evidently responsible for the whistling or whistlelike sounds that are important in sexual and aggressive displays. The females of all species have more reedy and typically gooselike or ducklike notes. In all species the males are larger than the females, and often differ appreciably from them in plumage. Although pair bonds are sometimes said to be permanent in the group, in some species at least they may be ruptured through interactions with outside males, and a premium is placed on male aggressiveness during sexual competition for mates. The wings are used in fighting and in most species they are strongly patterned, with white coverts and iridescent coloration on the secondaries or their greater coverts. The downy young are also typically patterned contrastingly in the shelducks and sheldgeese, a characteristic shared with various other cavity-nesting waterfowl...|$|E
