50|$|One recent {{definition}} of a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is a value coproduction configuration of people, technology, internal and external <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> connected via value propositions, and shared information (language, laws, measures, etc.). The smallest <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is a single person and the largest <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is the world economy. The external <b>service</b> <b>system</b> {{of the global economy}} is considered to be ecosystem <b>services.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>systems</b> can be characterized by the value that results from interaction between <b>service</b> <b>systems,</b> whether the interactions are between people, businesses, or nations. Most <b>service</b> <b>system</b> interactions aspire to be win-win, non-coercive, and non-intrusive. However, some <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> may perform coercive service activities. For example, agents of the state may use coercion in accordance with laws of the land.|$|R
50|$|Every <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is both {{a service}} {{provider}} and a customer of multiple types of <b>services.</b> Because <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> are designed both in how they provision and consume <b>services,</b> <b>services</b> <b>systems</b> are often linked into a complex service value chain or value network where each link is a value proposition. <b>Service</b> <b>systems</b> may be nested inside of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> (e.g., staff and operating room unit inside a hospital {{that is part of}} a nationwide healthcare provider network).|$|R
40|$|A <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is an {{organization}} of the resources and processes, which interacts with the customer and produces service outcomes. Since {{a majority of the}} <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> are labor-intensive, the main resources are the service workers. Designing such <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> is nontrivial due to a large number of parameters and variations, but crucial for business decisions such as labor staffing. The most important design point of a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is how and when service requests are assigned to service workers a. k. a. dispatching policy. This paper presents a framework for evaluation of dispatching policies in <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> A discrete event simulation model of a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> in the data-center management domain is presented. We evaluate four dispatching policies on five real-life <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> We observe that the simulation-based approach incorporates intricacies of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> and allows comparative analysis of dispatching policies leading to more accurate decisions on labor staffing. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{the service sector}} has grown in most {{advanced}} industrialized economies to be the dominant economic activity. Researchers are working to understand service activities and define scientific concepts and methods of service under an emerging research area called service science. Service {{is defined as the}} application of competence and knowledge to create value. Value is realized through interactions and cocreation among <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>systems</b> vary in scope (from individuals to businesses, organizations, governments, and nations) and adapt dynamically and connect to other <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> through value propositions. The <b>service</b> <b>system</b> has been proposed as an abstraction for service science, and yet {{it is not clear how}} to characterize a given organization as a <b>service</b> <b>system.</b> In this article, we present a review of literature on <b>service</b> <b>system</b> concepts and define a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> framework developed from the literature that can be used to characterize an organization as a <b>service</b> <b>system.</b> C © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Large <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> {{today are}} of highly network structures. In this thesis, these large <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> are called {{networked}} <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> The network {{nature of these}} systems has no doubt brought mass customized services but has also created challenges {{in the management of}} their safety. The safety of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> is an important issue due to their critical influences on the functioning of society. Traditional safety engineering methods focus on maintaining <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in a safe state, in particular aiming to maintain systems to be reliable and robust. However, resilience cannot be absent from safety out of many recent disasters that occur in society. The goal of this thesis is to improve the resilience of networked <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> Four major works have been performed to achieve this goal. First, a unified definition of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> was proposed and its relationship to other system concepts was unfolded. Upon the new definition, a domain model of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> was established by a FCBPSS framework, followed by developing a computational model. Second, a definition of resilience for <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> was proposed, based on which the relationship among three safety properties (i. e., reliability, robustness and resilience) was clarified, followed by developing a framework for resilience analysis. Third, a methodology of resilience measurement for <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> was proposed by four measurement axioms along with corresponding mathematical models. The methodology focused on the potential ability of a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> to create optimal rebalancing solutions. Two typical <b>service</b> <b>systems,</b> transportation system and enterprise information system, were employed to validate the methodology. Fourth, a methodology of enhancing resilience for <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> was proposed by integrating three types of reconfigurations of systems, namely design, planning and management, along with the corresponding mathematical model. This methodology was validated by an example of transportation system. Several conclusions can be drawn from the work above: (1) a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> has a unique characteristic that it meets humans' demand directly, and its safety relies on the balance between the supplies and demands; (2) different from reliability and robustness, the resilience of a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> focuses on the rebalancing ability from imbalanced situations; (3) it makes sense to measure the resilience of a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> only for a particular imbalanced situation and based on evaluation of rebalancing solutions; and (4) integration of design, planning and management is an effective approach for improvement of the resilience for a <b>service</b> <b>system.</b> The contributions of this thesis can be summarized. Scientifically, this thesis work has improved our understanding of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> and their resilience property; furthermore, this work has advanced the state of knowledge of safety science in particular having successfully responded to two questions: is a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> safe and how to make a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> safer? Technologically or methodologically, the work has advanced the knowledge for modeling and optimization of networked <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in particular with multiple layer models along with the algorithms for integrated decision making on design, planning, and management...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a unified}} {{definition}} of the <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is proposed. The motivation of this research effort is based on our observation that there are diverse definitions or descriptions of the <b>service</b> <b>system</b> in the literature {{and they have not}} provided an identity of the <b>service</b> <b>system.</b> Our goal to define the <b>service</b> <b>system</b> is thus to establish its identity. The most salient feature in our definition is the introduction of three subsystems in a service system: infrastructure, substance, and management. The substance flows over the infrastructure under the constraints of management. A service is established at the moment when the substance interacts with the human to cause a change in the human's status or state under a protocol, which further meets the human's request and need. With this new definition, a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> can be distinguished from other systems, such as manufacturing system, agricultural system, and product system. The new definition will be useful to classification of various <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> and various theories for <b>service</b> <b>systems,</b> which is the key to knowledge management for <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> and to optimization of design and management of <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> © 2014 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractService {{science is}} {{perceived}} as a multidisciplinary approach with the <b>service</b> <b>system</b> as its most important element. The services we use are provided through a certain <b>service</b> <b>system,</b> whereas <b>service</b> <b>system</b> has a specific structure and creates value through defined interactions between its entities, as well as through interactions with external <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> On a large scale, economy as a whole may be interpreted as one huge <b>service</b> <b>system,</b> containing a variety of entities and interrelated sub-systems. Thus, we provide in our work an analysis of how service science deals with the interaction within and between <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> creating value. And, as one goal of service science and <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> is to provide a basis for service innovation, through which cost efficiency and value creation is enabled, we discuss how service innovation explores means of securing knowledge leadership, which is crucial for further growth of the service sector...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{rapid growth}} in the global service economy has greatly {{increased}} research in Service Science and <b>Service</b> <b>Systems</b> Engineering (SSE). In <b>Service</b> <b>Systems</b> practice, the <b>service</b> value chain in terms of links among system entities is defined to co- create value and deliver high quality of <b>service.</b> A <b>Service</b> <b>System</b> is thus defined by its value co-creation chain in which all relevant stakeholders collaborate dynamically in real time or near-real time to deliver high quality service according to the business, service, and customer goals. This paper illustrates how SSE can help define, and discover relationships among <b>Service</b> <b>System</b> entities and addresses the service-oriented, customer-centric, holistic systems view in order to plan, design, adapt or self- adapt to co-create value. Modern <b>service</b> <b>systems,</b> which may be classified as system of systems (SoS), mandate well-defined integration and governance to link <b>service</b> <b>system</b> entities for the real-time dynamic analysis of ever-changing requirements within a <b>Service</b> <b>System.</b> In this paper, SSE concepts and methodologies are applied across various SSE stages to describe an intelligent emergency transportation system and a near real-time dynamic Smart Grid <b>service</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally, issues which {{need to be addressed}} within SSE methodologies for global deployment of efficient world-wide <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an Intentional Architectural Framework for developing Knowledge-Intensive <b>Service</b> <b>System</b> Architectures (IAF-KISSA). This framework enables the specification {{and evaluation of}} knowledge-intensive <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> (KISS) architectures at the levels of network, performance, engagement, and activities. A chosen architecture then allows designing, developing, and adapting a KISS throughout its lifecycle. This research is motivated {{by the lack of}} <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> engineering (SSE) methods specifically created for KISS, despite their economic importance in industrialized economies. Examples of KISS include joint innovation initiatives and IT outsourcing contracts. KISS possess a number of distinctive characteristics, including: the knowledge-intensity of their processes and outputs; the inter-organizational coproduction of outputs, and the multi-stakeholder perspective that drives the evaluation of these systems’ performance. SSE aims to define and discover dynamic relationships among entities in order to plan, design, and adapt <b>services</b> <b>systems</b> to cocreate value [1, 2]. SSE calls for a change in perspective in service engineering, from services as products to <b>services</b> as socio-technical <b>systems</b> where actors and resources are configured to collaboratively create value. An important challenge for the field of SSE is the creation of advanced models, methods, and tools for developing <b>service</b> <b>system</b> architectures. However, current <b>service</b> <b>system</b> architectures typically retain a functional and provider perspective on <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> operations without accounting for KISS characteristics. Using an intentional approach leads to modeling a <b>service</b> <b>system</b> in terms of agents, goals, strategies, and dependencies, thus addressing these concerns by moving from a functional to a strategic level of analysis [4]. Using an intentional approach to architecting KISS is thus ideally suited to their social and behavioral complexity. IAF-KISSA contributes a novel approach for architecting KISS, a type of <b>service</b> <b>system</b> that has hitherto been beyond the scope of SSE. Moreover, given the importance of knowledge for all types of <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> [2], IAF-KISSA could provide an innovative manner in which to architect <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in general...|$|R

40|$|In cloud {{computing}} environments, {{one of the}} most important barriers to the adoption of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> is interoperability. Generally, in {{cloud computing}} environments at software as a service level, interoperability refers to the ability of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> on one cloud provider to communicate with software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> on another cloud provider. The current software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments have not been built with interoperability as a primary concern. Software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments are poorly developed to meet the interoperability challenges. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model. During the past few years, at software as a service level, various interoperability frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability between systems. The syntactic interoperability of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> have already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration has been given to semantic interoperability issues. Both syntactic and semantic interoperability are necessary prerequisites to achieve interoperability. Achieving semantic interoperability is a challenge within the world of software as a service in cloud computing environments. Therefore, a semantic interoperability framework for software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments is needed. In this thesis, we develop a semantic interoperability framework for software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments. For this purpose, we illustrate how current technologies, such as service oriented architecture, can represent an adequate foundation for implementing such framework. The capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for semantic interoperability between software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments will be studied and demonstrated. iv In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments, extensive experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. Overall, the effectiveness of semantic interoperability of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments with the proposed framework shows a significant improvement in comparison with the existing models and frameworks...|$|R
