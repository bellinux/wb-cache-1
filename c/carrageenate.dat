40|$|Structural {{characteristics}} and thermal stability {{of a series}} of dodecylammonium carrageenates formed by stoichiometric complexation of dodecylammonium chloride and differently charged carrageenans (kappa-, iota- and lambda-carrageenan, respectively) were investigated. IR spectral analysis confirmed the electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions between the dodecylammonium and carrageenan species. X-ray diffraction experiments show increased ordering in the complexes compared to that in the parent carrageenans. Dodecylammonium carrageenates have a layer structure, in which a polar sublayer contains layers of carrageenan chains and a nonpolar sublayer consists of conformationally disordered dodecylammonium chains electrostatically attached to the carrageenan backbone. The major factor that determines the dodecylammonium <b>carrageenate</b> structure is cationic surfactant, while the carrageenans moiety {{plays a major role in}} determining thermal properties.
