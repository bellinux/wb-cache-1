5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} varies with {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin. This <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> understood {{as the result of}} multiple floods; the variable levels correspond to Lake Missoula breaching the ice dam at varying lake levels, releasing different volumes of flood waters. This would suggest the time between floods is variable.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
5|$|The United States naval gunfire support {{debate is}} an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} groups like the United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> provided. At {{the heart of the}} issue is the role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|Gris's {{works from}} late 1916 through 1917, {{more so than}} before, exhibit a {{simplification}} of geometric structure, a blurring {{of the distinction between}} objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> seen in the artists Woman with Mandolin, after Corot (September 1916) and in its epilogue Portrait of Josette Gris (October 1916).|$|E
25|$|It {{had been}} {{supposed}} that William's son Domnall mac Uilleim was illegitimate, but more recent histories accept that Domnall {{was a legitimate}} son of the prince, although not by Alice de Rumilly. The continuing support for the Meic Uilleim in Moray, together with their obviously Gaelic background, <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> explained by the assumption that Domnall's mother was a daughter of Óengus of Moray. Following modern historians, the Meic Uilleim were thus descended from Scots kings.|$|E

It <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> recognized by the rather large black area above the bill, almost reaching to the forehead and without a white stripe above it. In flight, the wide instead of pointed black tail end of L. minor is characteristic. The African species are completely allopatric with L. excubitor; they lack white scapulars (grey-backed fiscal) or wingspots (Mackinnon's fiscal) and differ in some other details, particularly the tail pattern.|$|E

Mayan sites are not only noted for large numbers of structures, but also for glyphs, other inscriptions, and artwork that has provided a relatively complete history {{of many of the}} sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose {{would have}} applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from {{the language of}} law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.|$|E
