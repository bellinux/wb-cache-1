This paper uses both cointegration {{analysis}} and forecasting analysis {{in an attempt}} to examine the main factors influencing the money supply process in Saudi Arabia over the 1984. 07 - 1995. 06 period. The empirical findings seem to suggest that the money multiplier in Saudi Arabia is the mirror image of the <b>currency</b> <b>ratio.</b> A common trend seems to be driving their long run behavior. For most of the time, movements in the <b>currency</b> <b>ratio</b> are to a larger extent equally associated with changes of both demand deposits and currency. Lately, money growth has been largely ascribed to monetary base growth. The forecasting exercise reveals that the basic model yields relatively higher forecasts for the multiplier. It also indicates that a reserve ratio shock would induce a larger negative effect on the money multiplier and then on to the money stock than a <b>currency</b> <b>ratio</b> shock. This finding may suggest that factors outside SAMA's control that are likely to influence the <b>currency</b> <b>ratio</b> do not greatly limit its ability to manage the money supply process. Thus, the monetarist contention that central banks are able to control the money stock is not that controversial in the Saudi monetary context...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study empirically {{investigates the}} extent of {{noncompliance}} with the tax code and examines the determinants of federal income tax evasion in the U. S. Employing a refined version of Feige’s (1986; 1989) General <b>Currency</b> <b>Ratio</b> (GCR) model to estimate a time series of unreported income as our measure of tax evasion, we find that 18 - 23 % of total reportable income may not properly be reported to the IRS. This {{gives rise to a}} 2009 “tax gap” in the range of $ 390 -$ 537 billion. As regards the determinants of tax noncompliance, we find that federal income tax evasion is an increasing function of the average effective federal income tax rate, the unemployment rate, the nominal interest rate, and per capita real GDP, and a decreasing function of the IRS audit rate. Despite important refinements of the traditional <b>currency</b> <b>ratio</b> approach for estimating the aggregate size and growth of unreported economies, we conclude that the sensitivity of the results to different benchmarks, imperfect data sources and alternative specifying assumptions precludes obtaining results of sufficient accuracy and reliability to serve as effective policy guides. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} size of underground economy in Iran and to identify the elements having taken {{a role in the}} creation of the same for the period 1961 - 2001 by using modified <b>currency</b> <b>ratio</b> method as a monetary approach to the estimation of the size of underground economy. Regression model has been stipulated with the consideration of special economic circumstances prevailing in Iran. <b>Currency</b> <b>ratio</b> (circulating currency to total private sector bank deposits ratio) has been considered as a function of economic development (per capita income), inflation rate, the degree of urbanization (a measure of the development of financial institutions) and private consumption expenditures. Government expenditures to GDP ratio (a measure of government economic interventions), import tax burden, direct tax burden, social security tax burden and black market foreign exchange rate have been also considered as the indicators and variables reflecting underground economy. The model has been estimated by using an auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and the results are indicative of a high volume of such activities within the frameworks of the economy of Iran. The mean size of underground economy has been 27. 76 percent of GDP during the period of study. Out of all the factors creating the underground economy, the size of government fraction of economy has had the greatest effect and social insurance burden has had the smallest one. Although the increase in insurance burden is in itself a factor in the creation of underground economy, in its turn has a striking negative impact on the performance and stability of social insurance funds. ...|$|E

40|$|PhDIn {{a series}} of essays a number of {{important}} issues of macroeconomic modelling of a small transition economy are explored. The essays are unified by the common theme of dollarization or currency substitution, which is asserted to be a significant characteristic of many transition economies. Two introductory chapters survey firstly, economic development in transition and secondly the phenomenon of currency substitution. These are followed by the construction of an integrated stochastic macroeconomic model of a transition economy at the early stage of reform, which employs a general equilibrium optimizing framework. The main issues addressed are: domestic money demand, the <b>currency</b> substitution <b>ratio,</b> the expected rate of inflation, real assets returns, the equilibrium growth rate of economy as well as government ability to control these variables. An expression for the <b>currency</b> substitution <b>ratio</b> is derived from the 'first principles' of stochastic optimization. Next is a comprehensive econometric analysis of currency substitution in Latvia. This is among the first research of this kind. Rather than drawing inferences on the degree of currency substitution from domestic money demand modelling, the most common approach to the empirical analysis of the phenomenon, the chapter employs direct modelling of the <b>currency</b> substitution <b>ratio.</b> Extensive model construction, estimation, evaluation and testing are perforined with the use of wide range of modem econometric techniques. Methodological issues are exposed and discussed. A number of instruments are identified, which can be used by the monetary authorities to influence currency substitution behaviour. Finally, the impact of an unanticipated monetary shock in a small open transition economy with dollarization, factor price rigidities, and nontradeables is reexamined. This chapter represents a first time, non-trivial expansion of the recent socalled 'new open economy macroeconomics' to account for the dollarization phenomenon which has been a persistent feature of many transition economies.

40|$|We use {{annual data}} drawn from 1950 - 85 to {{estimate}} an econometric {{model of the}} money multiplier for the United Kingdom. We define the money multiplier as ratio of the money stock broadly defined (M 3) and the monetary base (M 0), and then decompose the multiplier into the <b>currency</b> <b>ratio,</b> the time deposit ratio and the reserve ratio. We find that the multiplier has been increased by institutional changes. These have arisen as banks have been deregulated and as they have competed for sight deposits by offering interest-bearing accounts. We find that the multiplier increases as interest rates rise because the demand for cash {{and the demand for}} bank reserves fall. The money multiplier also varies directly with the level of economic activity. An increase in the demand for money would therefore lead to an increase in the money supply, assuming that the monetary base (M 0) is unchanged.

The framework is then applied to 100 countries over 1990 - 2004. The results suggest that a turning point has been reached in recent years: while most countries made money on their reserves during 1990 - 2001, most have been losing money during 2002 - 04.

On the other hand, PPPs take into account the actual price levels prevailing in a country by directly comparing them with the prices for similar products in other countries. The ICP conducts surveys every five/six years to collect price and expenditure data for all goods and services that make up the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in order to calculate the PPPs.
