50|$|Solidago canadensis (known as Canada {{goldenrod}} or <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod)</b> is an herbaceous perennial plant of {{the family}} Asteraceae native to northeastern and north-central North America but established as an invasive plant {{in other parts of}} the continent and in other countries as well. It is often grown as an ornamental in flower gardens.|$|E
40|$|<b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago canadensis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} invasive weeds in South-eastern China. To evaluate its potential application as dietary supplement in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), the antibacterial properties of aqueous and ethanol extracts of this plant against three major pathogenic bacteria in crayfish aquaculture were examined. Inhibition zone tests and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration revealed that the extracts had lower antibacterial activity than extracts from two traditional medicinal plants that possess antibacterial properties, garlic (Allium sativum) and cortex phellodendri (Phellodendron chinense). However, they did exhibit greater antibacterial effects than extracts from another widely used medicinal plant, Sophora flavescens, and an aquatic weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides. Aqueous extracts of <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> gave greater inhibition than the ethanol extracts. Crayfish fed a diet with 2 % these aqueous extracts exhibited significantly higher enzyme activity of alkaline phosphatase, catalase and phenoloxidase (P< 0. 05). Based on the results of this study, we conclude that aqueous extracts of <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> are highly promising for the development of new dietary supplement for use in crayfish aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> Solidago canadensis (L) is an {{invasive}} species in Poland. It occurs both in habitats only weakly impacted by anthropogenic factors {{as well as}} in habitats subjected to intensive transformations by humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the habitats of S. canadensis in Mińsk Mazowiecki and in out-of-town areas. It has been shown, based on an analysis of the principal soil properties, that the sites where S. canadensis was found had clayey-sandy soil and a C/N ratio indicative of medium and high soil degradation. <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> was found at sites with a diverse content of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium in soil, as well as a diverse soil pH, indicative of a strongly acidic, acidic and alkaline character of the soil...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of interest, Protected Landscape Area (PLA) Slavkov Forest two {{locations}} were chosen where invasive plants populations were mapped. The field work focused on mapping the occurrence of giant hogweed, all species of knotweed, <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod,</b> tall goldenrod and Himalayan balsam. The aim {{was to determine the}} invaded sites in {{the area of}} PLA Slavkov Forest. It was found that the mapped areas are most prone to giant hogweed. A considerable number of invaded sites have been chemically treated. In the studied area, <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> and tall goldenrod were present only in a small extent and Himalayan balsam was almost absent. No knotweed invaded locations were found. The invaded sites were most often observed in the vicinity of mesophilic meadows, urbanized area and arable land. This issue is dealt with in the Management plan for the protected landscape area Slavkov Forest, and in various projects aimed at mapping and disposal of invasive species...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{invasive}} plant species. Following invasive plant species were mapped in the South Bohemian region of Třeboň: <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago canadensis), Giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea), Bohemian knotweed (Reynoutria x bohemica), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Sakhalin knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis) and Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). The goal of this thesis was to map the above-mentioned species in one part of Stropnice Site of Community Importance and its surroundings. Furthermore, the thesis also aimed to record the most frequently colonized biotopes according to the invaded locations. The results show that <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> colonized seventeen locations and therefore {{it is one of the}} most invasive species. Next, Himalayan balsam was found in seven locations and Japanese knotweed in five locations. Last, Bohemian knotweed and giant goldenrod each colonized only one location. In this area, such species most often invade biotopes affected by people and locations near water resources. The plants also grow mostly in wet localities...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{invasion}} of exotic plants has been recognised as the serious cause of the biodiversity loss and natural habitats degradation and threat to the ecosystems functions, just the {{little attention has been}} paid to the potential impacts of the goldenrod invasion on the soil properties. Equally, currently obtained results are contrary and ambiguous. We tested whether the grass fields invaded and uninvaded by <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago canadensis L.) differ in pH, soil moisture, organic carbon (Cox), humus and P, K and Mg contents and related the variations to the chosen environmental variables. We did not find significant distinctions of the studied types of habitats in the selected physico-chemical soil properties as well as the relation between the goldenrod invasion and the changes in soil properties. Nevertheless, whereas the soil reaction, soil moisture and Mg content were higher in the invaded soils, the Cox, humus and P and K contents were higher in the uninvaded ones. Doubtless, further attention need to be paid to this problem...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of {{invasive}} plant species around the Stropnice Special Area of Conservation located in the region of Třeboň. The aim of this thesis was to map following invasive plant species: <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago canadensis), Giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Sakhalin knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) and Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). The locations of the above-mentioned species were mapped using GPS. The data were then digitized and map outputs were created using the ArcGIS 10. 2. 2 program. These outputs identified the expansion of the invasive plant species. The results showed that giant hogweed is not located in the mapped area, but the other mapped invasive plant species were found there. These species most often invaded the biotope of mesic Arrhenatherum meadows (T 1. 1), followed by tall-sedge beds (M 1. 7) and anthropogenic areas with sporadic vegetation outside human settlements (X 6). The problem of invasive plant species can be solved by their removal and by educating the general public about the risks these plants pose...|$|E
40|$|In this Master's thesis {{we studied}} whether the {{extracts}} {{of the three}} goldenrod (Solidago) species have antifungal activity. Since the common goldenrod (S. virgaurea) is indigenous, {{and the other two}} – <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (S. canadensis) and giant goldenrod (S. gigantea) are invasive alien species, we tested the differences in antifungal activity according to their origin and used plant material (leafs, inflorescence) and way of preparing extracts (aqueous, organic – 96 % ethanol). Fungi used in the study were: Alternaria alternata, Alternaria infectoria, Aspergillus flavus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Botrytis cynerea, Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium poae and Penicillium palitans. We selected these species because of their negative effects on plants grown for food. After one week we measured the area of fungal mycelium and calculated the growth percentage according to the control. We found out that inhibition of fungal growth was similar when aqueous and organic extracts were applied. Also leaf extract caused similar effects as inflorescence extracts. According to the sensitivity to the extracts, the fungi followed the order: F. poae being the most sensitive, than E. nigurm, A. alternata, C. botrytis, A. pullulans, A. infectoria and P. palitans as the least sensitive. The differences in efficiency of the extracts of the leaf and inflorescence extracts of three goldenrod species were not significant...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{occurence}} of invasive plants in the Protected Landscape Area (PLA) of Kokořínsko-Máchův kraj. Three invasive species - <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago canadensis), Bohemian knotweed (Reynoutria x bohemica) and Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) were mapped {{in the southern part of}} the PLA. The aim of the research was to identify the distribution of these invasive plants and to create maps of their occurrence in the monitored area using ESRI ArcMap software. Part of the work was to determine the incidence of invasive species in Natura 2000 habitats and ecosystems, according to the data set of the Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech Republic (Layer of Natura 2000 habitats; Consolidated layer of ecosystems of the Czech Republic, Czech: KVES). Most invaded Natura 2000 habitats and KVES ecosystems were identified. From all three of the studied plants growing within the study area, Solidago canadensis occurred the most. From the resulting field research and ongoing expertise, show that most areas of invaded habitats by Solidago canadensis are athropogenically influenced - grassland, introduced shrub vegetation and urbanized areas. During mapping of the invaded habitats only a limited, eradicative management by SCI employees was found, although part of the surveyed area is located in the SCI Kokořínsko...|$|E
40|$|Background. ProstaNorm® (0. 2 g tablets {{and liquid}} extract for oral administration) {{is a complex}} {{medication}} (dry and liquid) extracted from a mixture of medicinal plants (Hyperici herb, <b>Canadian</b> <b>goldenrod</b> herb, Glycyrrhiza roots, Echinacea purpurea rhizome and roots). It has been successfully used during the last 20 years {{for the treatment of}} chronic prostatitis (CP) (especially the abacterial form), CP-associated infertility (spermatopathy), and for the restoration of normal urination. Previous studies have already demonstrated good antimicrobial activity of ProstaNorm®, which enables its use in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP), especially taking into account other well-known effects of the drug (anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, improvement of the prostatic tissue microcirculation and sperm characteristics). Objective : to evaluate in vitro bacteriostatic activity of ProstaNorm® against uropathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (mostly with CP). Materials and methods. The following strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi were isolated from urine, prostatic fluid, and ejaculate of patients with urinary tract infections: Streptococcus haemolyticus (n = 10), Streptococcus aureus (n = 3), D-group Streptococcus (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), Enterococcus faecium (n = 5), Escherichia coli (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), Candida albicans (n = 4), Candida glabrata (n = 2). We assessed antibacterial activity of ProstaNorm® (using the dilutions from 1 : 20 to 1 : 1280 of the initial 10 % solution) against the isolated uropathogens. Results. We found that ProstaNorm® has a pronounced bacteriostatic effect against gram-negative bacteria (with the highest sensitivity shown by all Klebsiella pneumonia strains and 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when the microbial growth delay was 4. 5 – 5. 0 hours) and gram-positive bacteria (enterococci, hemolytic streptococci, and D-group streptococci). Additionally, the drug exhibits a bactericidal effect against some strains of gram-positive bacteria (three strains of streptococci). However, ProstaNorm® has no effect against Candida. Conclusion. Our results allow recommending ProstaNorm® for the treatment of chronic prostatitis accompanied by urinary tract infections.  </p...|$|E
