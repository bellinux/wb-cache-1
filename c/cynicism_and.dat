5|$|The neo-noir film genre {{developed}} mid-way {{into the}} Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected {{much of the}} <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> the possibility of nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent than in earlier noir films.|$|E
5|$|Spoilt Rotten {{received}} a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised {{for carrying out}} a thought-provoking and convincing analysis of a newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason. Some critics, however, accused the author of <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> misanthropic pessimism in his approach, and the historian Noel Malcolm claimed that Dalrymple had overreached in his analysis.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, {{who opposed}} the war out of doctrinaire <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> a belief that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and Asturias dissented and were heatedly denounced {{by the majority of}} Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{religious}} beliefs {{date back to}} the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek {{religious beliefs}}. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as <b>Cynicism</b> <b>and</b> Stoicism.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics, {{many of whom}} appreciated the album's combination of melodic song craft and catchy, pop-oriented material that, while slickly produced, avoided the commercial <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> adult contemporary posturing {{of some of their}} '80s and '90s forebears. An international success, the album topped the charts in sixteen countries and, by December 2012, has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide. The album bowed at number two on the UK Albums Chart and ultimately became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011. Up All Night debuted to number one on the United States Billboard 200, selling 176,000 copies in its first week. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Up All Night was the third global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 4.5 million copies.|$|E

500|$|Kain's {{appearance}} undergoes [...] "pretty dramatic changes" [...] {{throughout the}} games as he ages, but core personality attributes cited by Defiances developers include his intelligence <b>and</b> <b>cynicism,</b> arrogance <b>and</b> regality, and his defiant nature. In the series' fictional universe, he {{is described as}} the guardian of balance, a being responsible for preserving the health and integrity of Nosgoth (the games' setting), but left incapable of realizing this duty due to spiritual corruption that he inherited at birth.|$|R

25|$|The Deux arabesques is {{an example}} of one of his {{earliest}} works, already developing his musical language. Suite bergamasque (1890) recalls rococo decorousness with a modern <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> puzzlement, and contains one of his most popular pieces, Clair de Lune. His String Quartet in G minor (1893) paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration, using the Phrygian mode as well as less standard scales such as the whole-tone, which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony. He was beginning to employ a single, continuous theme, breaking away from the traditional A–B–A form with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since Joseph Haydn.|$|E
25|$|New York City-based Texas Is the Reason bridged the {{gap between}} indie rock and emo in their three-year {{lifespan}} on the East Coast, melding Sunny Day Real Estate's melodies and punk musicianship and singing directly to the listener. In New Jersey, the melodic hardcore Lifetime played shows in fans' basements. Their 1995 album, Hello Bastards on Jade Tree Records, fused hardcore with emo and eschewed <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> irony in favor of love songs. The album sold {{tens of thousands of}} copies, and Lifetime inspired the New Jersey and Long Island emo bands Brand New, Glassjaw, Midtown, The Movielife, My Chemical Romance, Saves the Day, Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday and Thursday.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E

[...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the last thing I wanted to be."

500|$|Jardine is {{inextricably}} associated with Bodyline. John Arlott wrote in 1989 that [...] "It is no {{exaggeration to say}} that, among Australians, Douglas Jardine {{is probably the most}} disliked of cricketers." [...] In the view of Christopher Douglas, his name [...] "stands for the legendary British qualities of cool-headed determination, implacable resolve, patrician disdain for crowds and critics alike– if you're English that is. To Australians the name is synonymous with the legendary British qualities of snobbishness, <b>cynicism</b> <b>and</b> downright Pommie arrogance." [...] He also argues that Bodyline, which was legal at the time, was a necessary step to overcome the unfair advantage which batsmen of the time enjoyed.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Newsweek, critic Jack Kroll {{thought the}} early part of the film was handled [...] "with wit and style", {{although}} he went on to say that the director was [...] "hamstrung by Lorenzo Semple's script".

He wrote that Klaus Maria Brandauer's character was [...] "played with silky, neurotic charm", While Barbara Carrera, playing Fatima Blush, [...] "deftly parodies all the fatal femmes who have slithered through Bond's career". Schickel's highest praise was saved for the return of Connery, observing [...] "it is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again.
