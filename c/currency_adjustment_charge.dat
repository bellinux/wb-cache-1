The determinants of intra-European FDI and their impact on country specialisation are successively considered, discerning counterbalancing and agglomeration factors. We show that such as geographic proximity, trade links and market potential contributed to FDI concentration in core countries while FDI facilitate industrial diversification in host countries. As economic integration progress, Europe moves from a product-based industrial specialisation to a more vertical specialisation based on quality differences and technological levels. The more advanced countries get more and more specialised in high-quality and technology intensive goods while peripheral countries remain dependent from low-tech and low quality products.

Within the hour adjustment is sufficiently quick to be considered efficient but the lack of full adjustment to fundamental value is not what would be predicted within an efficient market.

S. investor. Because national indices can consist of differing property mixes, this study separately analyzes the office, retail, and warehouse sectors. Moreover, these analyses also convert total returns into their fundamental components: initial yield, growth in income, and shifts in capitalization rates. The paths of currency-adjusted income and asset values and, therefore, capitalization rates are also presented. Generally speaking, the fundamental components of retail returns across the four countries exhibit greater divergence than the office and warehouse sectors. It is interesting that the U. S. property sectors showed the worst performance, while the Australian retail and the British office and warehouse sectors were the best performers (both before and after <b>currency</b> <b>adjustments).</b> Additionally, the currency-adjusted Australian returns were adversely effected by exchange rate movements, while the British returns were positively effected. Lastly, the correlation of the quarterly percentage change in income was generally lower and less statistically significant that the correlation patterns observed among the other components of return.

40|$|AbstractIn Thailand, 67 % (119, 434 GWh) {{of primary}} energy {{resource}} for electricity generation relies on natural gas. Therefore, {{it may not}} be sustainable for the future, due to instability of energy resources. Thai government has launched the policy measure to motivate private sector for investment in electricity generation from renewable energy since 2007. It was called “Adder”. In 2012, the feed-in tariffs (FIT) measure has been announced by the National Energy Board in 2013 to replace adder because adder is paid on top of the retail electricity price but FIT is a fixed price. However, both adder and FIT subsidize so higher cost resulting in higher retail electricity price to customers. This study assesses impact on retail electricity price thru fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>charge</b> (Ft) from Adder and FIT policy during 2010 to 2030 by using the alternative energy development plan (AEDP), optimization, and power development plan (PDP 2010 rev. 3). As a result, in 2030 in optimization case, subsidy on FIT will be about 48, 873 million Baht while subsidy on adders will be about 53, 416 million Baht. The FIT will increase average national electricity production cost in Ft mechanism by 0. 013 Baht/kWh in 2030 while Adders will increase average national electricity production cost of 0. 154 Baht/kWh in 2030. It is found that FIT scheme lowers burden of subsidy than adder scheme in both short and long terms.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the foreign <b>currency</b> translation <b>adjustments</b> and the firm’s market value of the Australia-based oil and gas multinational companies. The translation accounting under the former standard AASB 1012 “Foreign Currency Translation ” and the current standard AASB 121 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates ” produces different translation adjustment results. This study empirically examines this relationship and finds that the translation adjustments under the former standard AASB 1012 provide information that is opposite to the economic effects of the exchange rate changes. Also, this study uses a case study approach to examine the effect of the new standard AASB 121 on the market value of the oil and gas firms.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of natural}} organic matter (NOM) on mineral (hydr) oxide {{plays an important}} role in the evaluation of the speciation of toxic metal ions in the environment. Because both NOM and mineral oxide have variable charges that adjust upon adsorption, a good understanding of proton binding is required before the binding of metal ions can be understood. In this study, the adsorption of purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) on goethite was examined as a function of the environmental conditions (pH, salt concentration, and free concentration of PAHA) together with the proton adsorption to PAHA, goethite, and their mixtures. The induced charges on both components were separated on the basis of the difference between the charge/pH curves of the mixture and those of the single components. The electrostatic potential profile across the adsorbed layer was obtained as a numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the charge density of the adsorbed PAHA and the goethite surface. From the quantitative evaluation of the induced charge on both components, it is revealed that the degree of the <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> is related to the electrostatic affinity between the PAHA segments and the goethite surface, the electrostatic repulsion between the PAHA segments, and the electrostatic shielding by salt ions. Considering the charge distribution of the adsorbed PAHA at the goethite surface, it is concluded that the change of the <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> is sensitive to that of the conformation of the adsorbed PAHA. From the detailed inspection of the assumptions made and the comparison with the reported theoretical calculations, the obtained potential profiles are considered to broadly reflect the true potential profiles. Because a <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> is not frequently considered in detail in relation to the NOM adsorption on metal (hydr) oxides, the obtained results can form the basis for the further development of modeling of the adsorption of NOM on (hydr) oxide surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 lead to harder regulations for the banking industry which included larger capital reserves for the banks. One of the parts that contributed to this increased capital reserve was the the credit valuation <b>adjustment</b> capital <b>charge</b> which can be explained as {{the market value of}} the counterparty default risk. The purpose of the credit valuation <b>adjustment</b> capital <b>charge</b> is to capitalize the risk of future changes in the market value of the counterparty default risk. One financial contract that had {{a key role in the}} {{financial crisis}} was the credit default swap. A credit default swap involves three different parts, a contract seller, a contract buyer and a reference entity. The credit default swap can be seen as an insurance against a credit event, a default for example of the reference entity. This thesis focuses on the study and calculation of the credit valuation adjustment of credit default swaps. The credit valuation adjustment on a credit default swap can be implemented with two different assumptions. In the first case, the seller (buyer) of the contract is assumed to be default risk free and then only the buyer (seller) contributes to the default risk. In the second case, both the seller and the buyer of the contract is assumed to be default risky and therefore, both parts contributes to the default risk. Finanskrisen och Lehman Brothers konkurs 2008 ledde till hårdare regleringar för banksektorn som bland annat innefattade krav på större kapitalreserver för bankerna. En del som bidrog till denna ökning av kapitalreserverna var kreditvärdighetsjusteringens kapitalkrav som kan förklaras som marknadsvärdet av motpartsrisken. Syftet med kreditvärdighetsjusteringens kapitalkrav är att kapitalisera risken för framtida förändringar i marknadsvärdet av motpartsrisken. Ett derivat som hade en nyckelroll under finanskrisen var kreditswappen. En kreditswap innefattar tre parter, en säljare, en köpare och ett referensföretag. Kreditswappen kan ses som en försäkring mot en kredithändelse, till exempel en konkurs på referensföretaget. Detta arbete fokuserar på studier och beräkningar av kreditvärdesjusteringen på kreditswappar. Kreditvärdesjusteringen på en kreditswap kan implementeras med två olika antaganden.
