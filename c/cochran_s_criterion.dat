40|$|Classical work in {{the field}} of {{high-resolution}} radar often assumes that an echo signal is made of a number of components that can be decomposed via Fourier analysis. Adjacent components are said to be resolved in the frequency domain if the intensity between them drops at least 3 decibels. This working definition is an extension of Lord Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> for optical resolution. The problem with this approach is that whereas Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> assumes signal incoherence, a high-resolution radar signal is often the coherent sum of sinusoids. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the consequences of using Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> in the analysis of radar signals. Specifically, computer simulations using a complex signal is analyzed via the periodogram as the relative phase between the two components of the signal is allowed to change. The net effect introduced by this phase variation is to reduce or increase the spacing and intensity between two adjacent spectral peaks. These changes are due to constructive or destructive interference of spectral cross terms that cannot be ignored when attempting to resolve frequency components from one another. Thus, the use of Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> to define the resolution of a high-resolution radar system is inappropriate since phase difference information determines the relative range and relative doppler of a multi-component target. ...|$|R

40|$|The bipolar {{filtration}} {{introduced by}} T <b>Cochran,</b> <b>S</b> Harvey and P Horn is {{a framework for}} the study of smooth concordance of topologically slice knots and links. It is known that there are topologically slice 1 –bipolar knots which are not 2 –bipolar. For knots, this is the highest known level at which the filtration does not stabilize. For the case of links with two or more components, we prove that the filtration does not stabilize at any level: for any n, there are topologically slice links which are n–bipolar but not (n + 1) –bipolar. In the proof we describe an explicit geometric construction which raises the bipolar height of certain links exactly by one. We show this using the covering link calculus. Furthermore we discover that the bipolar filtration of the group of topologically slice string links modulo smooth concordance has a rich algebraic structure...|$|R

Employing preparations of the scrapie agent enriched 100 - to 1000 -fold with respect to protein, we found that digestion by proteinase K destroyed more than 99. 9 % of the infectivity. Diethylpyrocarbonate, which chemically modifies amino acid residues in proteins with high efficiency, also inactivated the scrapie agent in these purified preparations. Reductions of infectivity by proteinase K and diethylpyrocarbonate were not observed with less purified preparations. The agent bound to phenyl-Sepharose could not be eluted with 8. 5 M ethylene glycol; however, a combination of ethylene glycol and detergents did release the agent. These observations provide good evidence for a protein and for hydrophobic domains within the scrapie agent.

The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the diagnostic value of biochemical parameters together with Light%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>criteria</b> to differentiate exudative from transudative effusions. Material and Method: The LDH, total protein, albumin, adenosine deaminase (ADA), apolipoprotein A 1, apolipoprotein B, Lipoprotein-A, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels of patients with unknown etiology were measured both in plasma and pleural fluid. Mann-Whitney U was used to compare the groups and p < 0. 05 was accepted as statistical significance. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for each biochemical parameter. The ROC analysis was used to estimate the optimum cut-off value for the highest sensitivity and specificity. Results: Pleural LDH (p= 0. 001), total protein (p= 0. 001), albumin (p= 0. 001), triglyceride (p= 0. 001), total cholesterol (p= 0. 001), HDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 042), VLDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 001), LDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 001), apolipoprotein A 1 (p= 0. 021), and HDL-cholesterol/LDL-cholesterol ratio (p= 0. 048) were found significant in differentiating exudative from transudative effusions.
