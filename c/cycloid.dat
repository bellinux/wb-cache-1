5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the <b>cycloid</b> scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E

25|$|In the 17th century, {{the method}} of {{exhaustion}} led to the rectification by geometrical methods of several transcendental curves: the logarithmic spiral by Evangelista Torricelli in 1645 (some sources say John Wallis in the 1650s), the <b>cycloid</b> by Christopher Wren in 1658, and the catenary by Gottfried Leibniz in 1691.|$|E
25|$|In medieval Europe the {{quadrature}} meant {{calculation of}} area by any method. More often the Method of indivisibles was used; {{it was less}} rigorous, but more simple and powerful. With its help Galileo Galilei and Gilles de Roberval found the area of a <b>cycloid</b> arch, Grégoire de Saint-Vincent investigated the area under a hyperbola (Opus Geometricum, 1647), and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa, de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator noted the relation of this area to logarithms.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding {{the arduous}} duties of his professorship, he found time for {{investigation}} in various fields of physical science, and he published {{a very large}} number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the <b>cycloid,</b> the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction micrometre, and various problems of spherical trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|The case {{of higher}} {{integers}} was computed by Cavalieri for n up to 9, using his method of indivisibles (Cavalieri's principle). He interpreted these as higher integrals as computing higher-dimensional volumes, though only informally, as higher-dimensional objects were as yet unfamiliar. This method of quadrature was then extended by Italian mathematician Evangelista Torricelli to other curves {{such as the}} <b>cycloid,</b> then the formula was generalized to fractional and negative powers by English mathematician John Wallis, in his Arithmetica Infinitorum (1656), which also standardized the notion and notation of rational powers – though Wallis incorrectly interpreted the exceptional case n=1 (quadrature of the hyperbola) – before finally being put on rigorous ground {{with the development of}} integral calculus.|$|E
25|$|Creating {{a natural}} {{lighting}} {{system that has}} evoked such acclaim was challenging, and Kahn's office and the lighting designer Richard Kelly investigated over 100 approaches {{in their search for}} the proper skylight system. The goal was to illuminate the galleries with indirect natural light while excluding all direct sunlight, which would damage the artwork. Richard Kelly, lighting consultant, determined that a reflecting screen made of perforated anodized aluminum with a specific curve could be used to distribute natural light evenly across the <b>cycloid</b> curve of the ceiling. He hired a computer expert to determine the exact shape of the reflector's curve, {{making it one of the}} first architectural elements ever to be designed with computer technology.|$|E

25|$|Other {{branches}} of physics also received attention {{during the period}} of the Scientific revolution. William Gilbert, court physician to Queen Elizabeth I, published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Robert Boyle (1627–91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the gas law named for him; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the Royal Society of England (1660) and the Academy of Sciences in France (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as John Wallis, William Brouncker, Thomas Sydenham, John Mayow, and Christopher Wren (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, James Bernoulli showed that the <b>cycloid</b> is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, Johann Bernoulli showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a catenary, the curve with the lowest possible center of gravity available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the <b>cycloid</b> is the solution to the brachistochrone problem.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{analyzed}} {{this problem}} by finding the curve down which a mass will slide {{under the influence of}} gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called tautochrone problem. By geometrical methods which were an early use of calculus, he showed it to be a <b>cycloid,</b> rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not isochronous. He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the center of oscillation and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the conical pendulum, consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|The product {{rule and}} chain rule, {{the notions of}} higher {{derivatives}} and Taylor series, and of analytic functions were introduced by Isaac Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus {{to solve the problem}} of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a <b>cycloid,</b> and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he understood the principles of the Taylor series. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} Brachistochrone {{curve is}} one of fastest descent on a vertical plane. In this paper curves on fastest descent on surfaces that can be represented by elliptic integrals are studied. In the first part it is shown that such curves have to lie on spheres or cones.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were made using a microwave generator, which sent a narrow beam, through a metallic plate with horizontal movement. At {{the other end}} a horn antenna coupled to a field-strength detector. In linear polarization double <b>cycloids</b> paths were found and in circular polarization spiral paths were found. These experiments suggested that the photon is composed by two particles in dynamic equilibrium. The description of this model is given later {{as well as its}} parameters.

50|$|Vortices {{need not}} be {{steady-state}} features; they can move and change shape. In a moving vortex, the particle paths are not closed, but are open, loopy curves like helices and <b>cycloids.</b> A vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern. In that case the streamlines and pathlines are not closed curves but spirals or helices, respectively. This {{is the case in}} tornadoes and in drain whirlpools. A vortex with helical streamlines is said to be solenoidal.|$|R
25|$|Huygens {{generally}} {{wrote in}} French or Latin. While still {{a college student}} at Leiden he began a correspondence with the intelligencer Mersenne, who died quite soon afterwards in 1648. Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son's talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to Archimedes (3 January 1647). The letters show the early interests of Huygens in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the suspension bridge, and the demonstration that a catenary is not a parabola. In 1647/8 they cover the claim of Grégoire de Saint-Vincent to squaring the circle; rectification of the ellipse; projectiles, and the vibrating string. Some of Mersenne's concerns at the time, such as the <b>cycloid</b> (he sent Evangelista Torricelli's treatise on the curve), the centre of oscillation, and the gravitational constant, were matters Huygens only took seriously {{towards the end of}} the 17th century. Mersenne had also written on musical theory. Huygens preferred meantone temperament; he innovated in 31 equal temperament, which was not itself a new idea but known to Francisco de Salinas, using logarithms to investigate it further and show its close relation to the meantone system.|$|E
25|$|The Sillaginidae are {{medium-sized}} fishes which grow to {{an average}} of around 20cm and around 100 g, although the largest member of the family, the King George whiting is known to reach 72cm and 4.8kg in weight. The body shape and fin placement of the family is quite similar to most {{of the members of the}} order Perciformes. Their bodies are elongate, slightly compressed, with a head that tapers toward a terminal mouth. The mouth has a band of brush-like teeth with canine teeth present only in the upper jaw of Sillaginopsis. The cranial sensory system of the family is well developed above and laterally, with the lower jaw having a pair of small pores behind which is a median pit containing a pore on each side. On each side of the elongate head the operculum has a short sharp spine. They have two true dorsal fins; the anterior one supported by 10 to 13 spines while the long rear one is held up by a single leading spine followed by 16 to 27 soft rays. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, having two small slender spines followed by 14 to 26 soft rays. Their bodies are covered in ctenoid scales, with the exception of the cheek which may have <b>cycloid</b> or ctenoid scales. There is a wide variation in the amount of lateral line scales, ranging from 50 to 141. The swimbladder in the Sillaginidae is either absent, poorly developed, or highly complex with anterior and lateral extensions that project well into the caudal region. A unique duct-like process is present from the ventral surface of the swimbladder to just before the urogenital opening in most species. The presence and morphology of each species' swim bladder is often their major diagnostic feature, with McKay's three proposed subgenera based on swimbladder morphology alone. The sillaginids have only a small range of body colourings and frequently the only colour characteristics to identify between species are the arrangements of spots and bars on their upper bodies. Most of the family are a pale brown – creamy white colour, while a few species are silver all over. The undersides of the fish are usually lighter than the upper side, and the fins range from yellow to transparent, often marked by bars and spots.|$|E
500|$|The dorsal {{scales are}} {{generally}} small, acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened, while {{the throat and}} pectoral (chest) scales are keeled. Granular (bumpy) scales are found {{on the top of}} the head and the [...] neck, while the scales on the middle of the neck are keeled, acute, flattened, and imbricate. In the middle of the back, there is some crowding and size reduction in the scales, and none of these scales are granular. On the dorsal side of the tail, the scales are acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened. On the underside of the tail, the scales are smooth, rounded, and enlarged towards the centre of the tail (mid-ventrally). The ventral scales are rounded, smooth, <b>cycloid</b> (have a smooth outer edge), and imbricate. The scales on the ventral caudal (head) scales are smooth, <b>cycloid,</b> and enlarged mid-ventrally.|$|E
50|$|Agassiz {{found that}} his palaeontological labors made {{necessary}} a new basis of ichthyological classification. The fossils rarely exhibited any traces of the soft tissues of fish. They consisted chiefly of the teeth, scales and fins, with the bones being perfectly preserved in comparatively few instances. He therefore adopted a classification which divided fish into four groups: Ganoids, Placoids, <b>Cycloids</b> and Ctenoids, based {{on the nature of}} the scales and other dermal appendages. While Agassiz did much to improve fish taxonomy, his classification has been superseded by later work.|$|R

5000|$|His {{published}} mathematical work is summarised in a treatise of nineteen pages, Exercitatio geometrica, de maximis et minimis (1666) {{in which}} he studies the maxima of functions of the form [...] and tangents to curves with equation , using methods that are an early form of induction. This treatise was much admired by his contemporaries and has recently been republished as an appendix to Mercator's 'Logarithmo-Technia' (1688). He also studied spirals (1644) and <b>cycloids</b> (1674) and recognised {{that the study of}} tangents and the calculation of areas are reciprocal operations.|$|R
