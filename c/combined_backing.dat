50|$|Theophylact was the {{hereditary}} Count of Tusculum, {{a small hill}} {{town near}} the vicinity of Rome. He is mentioned {{for the first time}} in a document of 901 as palatine iudex of the Emperor Louis III. He remained in Rome, commanding a group of soldiers after the emperor’s return to Provence in 902, and was prominent in the overthrow of Antipope Christopher in January 904, whom he very likely ordered to be killed whilst in prison later that year. Theophylact formed an alliance with Alberic I of Spoleto, and with their <b>combined</b> <b>backing,</b> Pope Sergius III was elected in Christopher’s place. During his pontificate, Theophylact became Sergius’ sacri palatii vestararius and magister militum, effectively seizing control of the city. He was also granted other honorific titles, such as senator, glorissimus dux, and dominus urbis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{control of}} a humanoid robot in active compliance just after the impact consecutive to a fall. The goal of this post-impact braking is to absorb undesired linear momentum accumulated during the fall, using a limited supply of time and actuation power. The gist of our method is an optimal distribution of undesired momentum between the robot's hand and foot contact points, followed by the parallel resolution of Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) at each contact. This distribution is made possible thanks to torque-limited friction polytopes, an extension of friction cones that takes actuation limits into account. Individual LMPC results are finally <b>combined</b> <b>back</b> into a feasible CoM trajectory sent to the robot's whole-body controller. We validate the solution in full-body dynamics simulation of an HRP- 4 humanoid falling on a wall...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{taxonomy}} of Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) approaches for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) operation {{in an integrated}} airspace. Possible approaches for UAVs are surveyed and broken down based on their types of surveillance, coordination, maneuver, and autonomy. The factors are <b>combined</b> <b>back</b> selectively, {{with regard to their}} feasibility for operation in an integrated airspace, into several ’generic approaches’ that form the CD&R taxonomy. These generic approaches are then attributed to a number of available method in the literature to determined their position in the overall CD&R scheme. The attribution shows that many proposed methods are actually unsuitable for operation in an integrated airspace. Furthermore, some part of the taxonomy does not have an adequate representative in the literature, suggesting the need to concentrate UAV CD&R research more in those particular parts. Finally, a multi-layered CD&R architecture is built from the taxonomy, implementing the concept of defense-in-depth to ensure UAVs safe operation in an integrated civil airspace.
