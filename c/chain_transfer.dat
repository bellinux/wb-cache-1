25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation <b>chain</b> <b>transfer</b> or RAFT {{polymerization}} is one {{of several}} kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a <b>chain</b> <b>transfer</b> agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E

RAFT polymerization has also been effectively carried out over a wide temperature range.|$|E

The thermal properties of the resulted PLA and P(LA-co-CL) polyols were investigated by DSC and TGA. The glass transition temperature (T_g) of PLA polyols increases with increasing M_n; the introduction of caprolactone can decrease T_g effectively and enhance the thermal stability of PLA polyols...|$|R

2500|$|Using a {{compound}} with multiple dithio moieties (often termed a multifunctional RAFT agent) {{can result in}} the formation of star, brush and comb polymers. Taking star polymers as an example, RAFT differs from other forms of living radical polymerization techniques in that either the R- or Z-group may form the core of the star (See Figure 7). While utilizing the R-group as the core results in similar structures found using ATRP or NMP, the ability to use the Z-group as the core makes RAFT unique.

The method involves adding a catalytic <b>chain</b> <b>transfer</b> agent to the reaction mixture of the monomer and the radical initiator. Catalytic <b>chain</b> <b>transfer</b> proceeds via hydrogen atom transfer from the organic growing polymeryl radical to cobalt(II), producing a polymer vinyl-end group and a cobalt-hydride species (equilibrium 2). The Co-H species then reacts with the monomer to start a new Co(III)-alkyl species, which re-initiates a new growing polymeric radical (reversible termination, equilibrium 1). The main products of catalytic <b>chain</b> <b>transfer</b> polymerization are therefore vinyl terminated polymer chains which are shorter than in conventional (free) radical polymerization.|$|E
