50|$|A Flinders bar is a {{vertical}} soft iron bar {{placed in a}} tube on the fore side of a compass binnacle.

50|$|A compass {{installed}} in a vehicle or vessel has {{a certain amount of}} error caused by the magnetic properties of the vessel. This error is known as <b>compass</b> <b>deviation.</b> The magnitude of the <b>compass</b> <b>deviation</b> varies greatly depending upon the local anomalies created by the vessel. A fiberglass recreational vessel will generally have much less <b>compass</b> <b>deviation</b> then a steel hulled vessel. Electrical wires carrying current have a small magnetic field around them and can cause deviation. Any type of magnet, such as found in a speaker can also cause large magnitudes of <b>compass</b> <b>deviation.</b> The error can be corrected using a Deviation Table. Deviation Tables are very difficult to create. Once a deviation table is established, it is only good for that particular vessel, with that particular configuration. If electrical wires are moved or anything else magnetic (speakers, electric motors, etc.) are moved, the deviation table will change. All Deviations on the Deviation Table are indicated West or East. If the compass is pointing West of the Magnetic North Pole, then the Deviation is Westward. If the compass is pointing East of the Magnetic North Pole, then the Deviation is Eastward.|$|E

The difference should not be large, but it can result in being off course and not finding something. A compass is a magnet, and will affect another compass nearby, so they can not be checked by putting them together.|$|R

50|$|The compass will {{indicate}} {{the magnetic field}} direction {{at the place where}} it happens to be at the time. If there are influences other than the Earth’s magnetic field, these may change the direction indicated by the compass. These effects are called deviation, and can be caused by a whole range of things. Any magnetic object or electrical current will have an influence, some more than others. The current in a dive computer is too small to affect the compass, even when quite near, but the hull of a ship or overhead power lines may make a difference even several meters away. It is difficult and often impossible to correct for all possible deviations, but it is worth checking a dive <b>compass</b> for <b>deviation</b> caused by dive equipment. It has been known for regulators to cause deviation, steel cylinders can cause deviation, and powerful lights may be a problem. A diver propulsion vehicle with an electric motor is also a potential problem for those who use them, though divers have been known to navogate adequately using compasses mounted on the handgrip of a DPV. A magnetic clip used to secure equipment to the diver's harness has a powerful magnet in both parts, and should not be used to hold the compass, as the part attached to the compass will produce a serious error.|$|R
40|$|A {{major focus}} of the Western European Transmission System Operators (TSO’s) is {{reinforcing}} their crossborder power capacity for mutual support in case of emergencies and also as an beneficial good that can be traded on specialised energy markets. The Belgian TSO, Elia, is studying the use of new and emerging technologies, together with their advantages and disadvantages, for further development of the interconnections with the neighbouring countries. High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology, and especially the promising Multilevel Modular Converters (MMC) for the Voltage Sources Converters (VSC) opened {{a wide range of}} new opportunities. The NEMO project, a 1000 MW undersea link with the United Kingdom, is the object of interest for this paper. A quite similar link, technology-wise, but with other motivations and challenges, is the ALEGRO-link, with a rating of 1000 MW as well. Both installations will be connected to the meshed 400 kV-grid. The paper gives an overview of the technical choices and obstacles that are made, their motivations both for the AC/DC converter and the subsea cable. For the converter and its connection to the main grid, specifically the Belgian side, the main focus will lay on the choice of converter technology between the two concurring state-of-the-art technologies based on thyristor and IGBT topologies. The drastic reduction of the operation losses over the years, lesser footprint, absence for the need of reactive power and additional filtering, grid support in voltage and frequency, the possibility for blackstarting, and by nature the most adapted technology for meshed DC grids, made the technology decision sway {{in the direction of the}} MMC VSC configuration. The subsea power link side of the project contains a set of particular obstacles as well. First of all: the cable routing. This part of the North Sea, close to the harbours of Zeebruges, Antwerp and Rotterdam, is one of the world’s most used sea routes. The selection of the cable route needed to be chose for minimal interaction with the present maritime transport (e. g. anchor dragging, <b>compass</b> <b>deviations),</b> with existing pipe line and telecom routes, detected ship wrecks, environmental protected zones (onshore as well as offshore) and future possible development of the HV network in the sea. The paper will present the major outcomes for the cable routing: offshore route on the seabed, the necessary landfalls and the onshore route to the HVDC substation on the Belgian side. In the second subsection on the power link, the choice of the technical characteristics of the DC power cables together with their performance requirements are highlighted. An overview of the major specification will is presented together with their motivations. Again, two concurring technologies are available on the market: the mass-impregnated (MI) cables, with their higher possible voltage rating, are weighed against the synthetic XLPE cable, which, even though still lower in voltage rating, provide some exceptional long-term opportunities. The paper concludes with a listing of necessary step to be taken and technical challenges to be overcome to make this project a success. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of bird migration has long fascinated us humans {{and it has}} prompted questions like where do they go or come from {{and how do they}} find their way? Arctic shorebirds are well known for their spectacular long-distance migrations with some species travelling more than 10 000 km every spring and autumn, and some even cover this distance in one single nonstop flight. The aim of my thesis was to investigate the flexibility of Arctic shorebirds when it comes to orientation behaviour, departure behaviour and migration strategy. In spite of the extensive knowledge about orientation and migration performance of birds there is still a poor understanding of how birds orient when actually travelling on migration. Flight directions and routes of migrating birds are determined by the birds’ compass orientation, but also by effects of wind, social influence, responses to topography and landmarks, and to navigation cues. I found fine-scaled orientation changes of migrating shorebirds passing southern Sweden. The shorebirds might travel approximately along a straight geographic <b>compass</b> course, with <b>deviations</b> due to large-scale topography to maximize general association with coastal habitats during migration. Younger birds may learn the general flight paths and course changes from older and experienced individuals in the flocks, but most of this learning process between generations probably does not take place until after the birds’ first autumn migration since juveniles migrate at a later time in the season than adults. I also found that the shorebirds showed clearly different responses to crosswinds when passing southern Sweden demonstrating that shorebirds are remarkably variable in their response to crosswinds also during short sections of their migratory journey. I compared departure and flight activity of shorebirds migrating in contrasting wind regimes during autumn (high probability of wind resistance) and spring (high probability of wind assistance) in southern Scandinavia. The shorebirds changed their threshold for departure in relation to wind between the two seasons in a dramatic way: flying almost exclusively with wind assistance during spring migration but regularly with wind resistance during autumn. The degree of wind selectivity in relation to the distributions of available wind effects was similar during autumn and spring, during both seasons the shorebirds selected to migrate on days with better winds than expected. My results show that birds do not have a fixed threshold of wind assistance for their departure on migratory flights but the same birds depart in very different wind situations during spring and autumn seasons in southern Scandinavia when winds regimes in relation to the birds’ migratory direction were very different. This suggests that migratory birds have an adaptive flexibility in their responses to wind depending on seasonal wind regimes. Finally, I investigated stopover lengths and flight distances of dunlins Calidris alpina migrating along the East Atlantic flyway to characterize the autumn migration strategy and compared these results with the migration strategy used in spring along the same route {{in order to understand the}} evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of flexibility in migration strategy. The autumn migration strategy of the dunlins was characterized by short-stop-short-hop migration for both adults and juveniles while during spring, dunlins adopted a long nonstop migration strategy instead. The major reasons for these contrasting strategies between seasons are probably food availability and wind pattern. In conclusion my thesis shows that arctic shorebirds and probably other migratory birds have an impressive flexibility when it comes to migratory behaviour and in many cases this flexibility is adaptive...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{deviation}} is {{the angle}} from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing {{mark of the}} <b>compass.</b> <b>Deviation</b> is positive if a compass bearing mark (e.g., compass north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°. Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on {{the orientation of the}} boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to compass bearing to obtain magnetic bearing.|$|E

In 1866, Evan Hopkins of London registered a patent for a process [...] "to depolarise iron vessels and leave them thenceforth free from any compass-disturbing influence whatever". The technique was described as follows: [...] "For this purpose he employed a number of Grove's batteries and electromagnets. The latter were to be passed along the plates till the desired end had been obtained... the process must not be overdone for fear of re-polarising in the opposite direction."

40|$|Iron in the {{vicinity}} of compasses results in magnetic deviations. ADCPs mounted on steel buoyancy devices and deployed on seven moorings on the East Greenland outer shelf and upper slope from 2007 to 2008 suffered from severe magnetic deviations of > 90 ^∘ rendering the ADCP data useless without a compass correction. The effects on the measured velocities, which may also be present in other oceanic velocity measurements, are explained. On each of the moorings, velocity measurements from a different instrument which was assumed not to be affected by magnetic deviation are overlapping in space and time with the compromised ones. A method is described to determine the magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>deviation</b> from the compromised and uncompromised velocity measurements and the compromised compass headings. The method depends on the assumption that at least one instrument per mooring is not compromised.

40|$|Local water {{temperature}} increases associated with global warming {{have the potential}} to melt glaciers and ice sheets, which are major contributors to sea level rise. This Bachelor of Science thesis examines the flow of warm (0 ◦C – 2 ◦C) Atlantic Water (AW) in the Norske trough on the East Greenland continental shelf using an oceanographic section of CTD and ship-board ADCP (SADCP) data collected in June 2014. The Norske trough connects the open ocean to the marine terminating glacier Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden at 79. 5 ◦ N and it is of interest whether warm water can flow through this trough to the floating ice tongue. The CTD data shows that AW with temperatures of 1. 5 ◦C and salinities of 34. 5 is overlain by Polar Water (PW) with temperatures of - 1. 5 ◦C and salinities of 31. 5. The stratification is strong and the halocline is located at a depth of 100 m. The SADCP data was detided using the barotropic tidal model AOTIM 5 and it shows that the flow reaches velocities along the trough of up to 0. 15 m s− 1 in the upper 250 m. The absolute geostrophic velocities calculated using the SADCP data, as well as the Rossby radius of 12 - 14 km calculated from the stratification, support the assumption that a bi-directional flow with an in- and outflow exists in the trough. Hence it is shown that warm AW reaches the Norske trough and flows into the direction of the 79. 5 ◦ N glacier at a depth where it could potentially melt the glacier or its floating ice tongue. As a precursory step, it was attempted to calibrate lowered ADCP (LADCP) data in order to remove compass deviations that were assumed to be caused by a steel block {{in the vicinity of the}} CTD rosette. The data of both the upward and the downward looking LADCP were compared to the SADCP data in order to determine the <b>compass</b> <b>deviation.</b> It was found that in this case this method can- not be used to gain more information about the flow below 250 m depth because the compass deviations vary over time and between stations. It is proposed that this is due to the electromagnetic influence of coiled cables that were located close to the instrument...|$|E
