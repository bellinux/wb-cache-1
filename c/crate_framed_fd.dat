The experimental program was conducted on four specimens (frames). The parameters are studied change panel of frame from non infill to infill, change thickness of infill wall and change type of bricks. The dimension of frames is selected to represent half scale frames and tested under cyclic loading.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of wooden crate designs. By {{far the most}} common are 'closed', 'open' and 'framed'. A Closed Crate {{is one that is}} completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An Open Crate is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of an open crate as compared to a closed crate. Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the crate would be considered an open crate. The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered 'cleats' rather than sheathing thus rendering the crate unsheathed. An unsheathed <b>crate</b> is a <b>frame</b> <b>crate.</b> A <b>Frame</b> <b>Crate</b> is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically an open crate will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{are often}} confronted with diverse medical decisions. Often lacking {{relevant}} medical knowledge, patients fail to independently make medical decisions and instead generally {{rely on the}} advice of doctors. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the characteristics of and differences in doctor-patient medical decision making on the basis of construal level theory. METHODS: A total of 420 undergraduates majoring in clinical medicine were randomly assigned to six groups. Their decisions to opt for radiotherapy and surgery were investigated, with the choices described in a positive/neutral/negative frame × decision making for self/others. RESULTS: Compared with participants giving medical advice to patients, participants deciding for themselves were more likely to select radiotherapy (F 1, 404  =  13. 92, p =  011). Participants from positive or neutral frames exhibited a higher tendency to choose surgery than did those from negative <b>frames</b> (<b>F</b> 2, 404  =  22. 53, p<. 001). The effect of framing on independent decision making was nonsignificant (F 2, 404  =  1. 07, p =  35); however the effect of framing on the provision of advice to patients was significant (F 2, 404  =  12. 95, p<. 001). The effect of construal level was significant in the positive <b>frame</b> (<b>F</b> 1, 404  =  8. 06, p =  005) and marginally significant in the neutral <b>frame</b> (<b>F</b> 2, 404  =  3. 31, p =  07) but nonsignificant in the negative <b>frame</b> (<b>F</b> 2, 404  = . 29, p =  59). CONCLUSION: Both social distance and framing depiction significantly affected medical decision making and exhibited a significant interaction.
