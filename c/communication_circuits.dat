25|$|Primary batteries, or primary cells, {{can produce}} current {{immediately}} on assembly. These are {{most commonly used}} in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and <b>communication</b> <b>circuits</b> where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E

30|$|Microwave {{transistors}} are {{key components}} {{in the next generation}} wireless communication systems [1 – 4], such as cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems [5 – 7], and cognitive relay network [8, 9]. With the increasing complexity of <b>communication</b> <b>circuit</b> and system structure, designers rely more heavily on computer-aided design (CAD) software to achieve efficient design. Microwave device models are essential to CAD software. The accuracy of these models can even decide whether the <b>communication</b> <b>circuit</b> and system design is successful or not. Due to rapid technology development in semiconductor industry, new microwave devices constantly arrive. Models suitable for previous devices may not fit new devices well. There is an ongoing need for new accurate models.|$|R
