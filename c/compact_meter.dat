40|$|In {{this work}} we suggest a new {{mechanism}} for metering {{the popularity of}} web-sites: the <b>compact</b> <b>metering</b> scheme. Our approach does not rely on client authentication or on a third party. Instead, we suggest {{the notion of a}} timing function, a computation that can be performed incrementally, whose output is compact, and whose result can be used to efficiently verify the effort spent with high degree of confidence. We use the difficulty of computing a timing function to leverage the security of a metering method by involving each client in computing the timing function (for some given input) upon visiting a web site, and recording the result of the computation along with the record of the visit. Thus, to forge client visits requires a known investment of computational resources, which grows proportionally to the amount of fraud, and is infeasible for visit counts commonly found in the World Wide Web (WWW). The incremental nature of the timing function is used to create a new measur [...] ...|$|R

To create a compact biosensor reader, a compact tunable vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and a <b>compact</b> built-in wavelength <b>meter</b> were manufactured.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a very <b>compact</b> wavelength <b>meter</b> for on-chip laser monitoring in the shortwave infrared wavelength range {{based on an}} optimized arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) filter with an integrated photodiode array. The AWG response is designed to obtain large nearest neighbor crosstalk (i. e. large overlap) between output channels, which allows accurately measuring the wavelength of a laser under test using the centroid detection technique. The passive AWG is fabricated on a 220 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform and is combined with GaInAsSb-based photodiodes. The photodiodes are heterogeneously integrated on the output grating couplers of the AWG using DVS-BCB adhesive bonding. The complete device with AWG and detectors has a footprint of only 2 mm(2) while the measured accuracy and resolution of the detected wavelength is better than 20 pm.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} frequencies of the terahertz (THz) radiation emitted by the antenna {{mounted on the}} photoconductive (PC) device is presented. Two laser beams with slightly different frequencies irradiate the PC device, producing a beat current of 1 [*]THz in the photocurrent. A microwave signal {{is applied to the}} antenna electrode. The frequency of the THz wave is measured using the homodyne detection of the optical beat with the high-order harmonics of the microwave. It is being investigated that the high-order harmonics are produced by the PC device owing to its nonlinearity. Periodic peaks generated by the homodyne detection were observed in the photocurrent, as the microwave was swept from 16 to 20 [*]GHz with a power of − 40 [*]dBm. Using the peak frequencies, the THz-wave frequency was determined to be 1030. 3 ± 3. 73 [*]GHz. The measurement error is estimated to be less than 0. 43 [*]GHz. The proposed method realizes a <b>compact</b> frequency <b>meter</b> in the THz region...|$|R
40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cyclonic separators are acceptable as hydrocyclone, mist eliminators, separator internal device and <b>compact</b> <b>metering</b> package. Weight and small footprint requirements for {{applications such as}} subsea separation, downhole separation, and compact gas monetization systems is driving interest in using cyclonic separator for bulk gas-liquid separation. Unfortunately, the challenge of coping with the effect of unsteady inlet flow behaviour on the separator performance limit it acceptance for bulk gas-liquid separation. Fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour inside the separator under various inlet flow conditions is required {{to deal with the}} challenge. While most published work have addressed flow behaviour in the lower half of cyclonic separator, this thesis concentrated on the upper half. A gas-liquid pipe cyclonic separator was setup at Cranfield University for bulk gas-liquid separation. Large amount of data at the inlet and upper part of the separator were acquired using electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire meshes sensor (WMS), conductivity hold up probe and pressure transducers. The acquired data were used in analysing flow regimes, upward swirling liquid film (USLF), zero-net liquid flow (ZNLF), liquid holdup and, general separator performance. It was found from analysis of USLF data that a maximum USLF height exists for every constant superficial liquid velocity. A correlation based on dimensionless numbers was proposed for predicting this height. Experimental results on ZNLF showed that a critical ZNLF also exist above which liquid carryover can take place. The liquid holdup for this critical ZNLF was measured under separator operating condition using ERT and a correlation for predicting the liquid holdup was proposed. Four flow regimes were identified as swirling annular, light-mist heavy-mist and churn using visual observations, ERT, WMS and pressure transducer. A flow regime map was proposed based on gas and liquid Froude number. The performance based on the operating envelope for liquid carryover and pressure drop for horizontal and 270 downward inclined tangential inlet was compared. It was concluded that the separation performance was marginally improved by using an inclined tangential inlet. The pressure drop for the inclined inlet was far greater than that of horizontal inlet. Two inlet nozzles with D–shape were used for separation enhancement. The nozzle that reduces the diameter of full pipe bore by 25 % gave slight improvement but also gave the greatest pressure drop. The nozzle that reduced the full pipe bore diameter by 50 % performed poorly...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the principle, some design solutions and last theoretical and by simulation results, for the suspension realized with the self-adjustable shock absorber, called shortly VZN, {{relative to the}} standard one. The self-adjustable shock absorber VZN, an intelligent shock absorber, realized without electronics or mechanisms, grant with European Patent EP 1190184 B and Romanian Patent 118546, {{is much better than}} standard ones because confers possibilities of stepwise adjustment of damping force as function as the instantaneous piston position.
