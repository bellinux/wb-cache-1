40|$|Collings (2008) in {{his review}} of MNCs and {{employment}} relations (ER) notes that whilst international human resource management (IHRM) has received widespread attention in the literature, comparatively, ER issues within MNCs have not received anywhere near the same attention, with some notable exceptions. Yet despite this, Collings postulates that " [...] .

This chapter sets out to partly redress this imbalance by investigating employee representation and <b>consultation</b> <b>policies</b> and practices within MNCs operating in Ireland. In doing so, the chapter is organised into two broad sections.

40|$|Treaty 7 First Nations, {{who have}} {{occupied}} the South Saskatchewan River Basin since time immemorial, have water rights protected by s. 35 of the Constitution, Treaty 7, and the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement, 1930. This thesis suggests that Alberta has devised a legal regime that circumvents the treaty {{relationship between the}} Crown and Treaty 7 First Nations. Section 52 of the Constitution and the principles of constitutionalism {{and the rule of}} law require that Crown legislation and action must be consistent with the Constitution. Because Aboriginal and treaty rights are protected under s. 35 (1) of the Constitution, Alberta’s consultation guidelines must address the protection of existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. This thesis examines whether the treaty or any subsequent Crown legislation or Crown action has extinguished the Aboriginal and treaty rights of Treaty 7 First Nations and draws the conclusion that the Aboriginal rights of Treaty 7 First Nations not only continue to exist, but are afforded additional protection by Treaty 7 and the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement. This leads to the conclusion that Alberta’s consultation policy fails to recognize and affirm Aboriginal and treaty rights in their entirety as they currently exist. To the extent that Alberta’s Aboriginal <b>consultation</b> <b>policies</b> and regulations are inconsistent with s. 35 (1) they are null and void...|$|E
40|$|The tribal {{right to}} {{consultation}} requires {{the federal government to}} consult with Indian tribes prior to the approval of any federal project, regulation, or agency policy. This article, which provides the first comprehensive analysis of this right, highlights the current inconsistencies in interpretation and application of the consultation duty. It then attempts to provide suggestions for changes that can be implemented by the legislative, executive or judicial branches. In Part I, we provide a brief overview of the development of the trust responsibility and explain how it came to include three substantive duties: to provide services to tribal members, to protect tribal sovereignty, and to protect tribal resources. In Part II, we offer the first detailed explanation of how the trust responsibility developed the procedural duty to consult with Indian tribes. In this section we also discuss recent attempts by the Obama Administration to reform the federal government’s consultation duty. In Part III, we analyze the <b>consultation</b> <b>policies</b> that have been developed by federal agencies. In doing so, we identify four flaws that have prevented these policies from being truly effective: lack of enforceability, specificity, uniformity, and substantive constraints. Finally, in Part IV we present our proposal for reforming the consultation duty through legislation, and offer suggestions that can be implemented by the judicial and executive branches in the interim...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the use {{and need}} for involvement of external participants in the EU decision making process through the relevant instruments. The analysis begins with the Treaty of Lisbon and the observation that the principle of participation was not been retained {{in the text of}} the Treaty. At present, participation is mainly implemented by the White Paper on EU Governance; the White Paper is considered to be the starting point for the involvement of external participants as well as the use of scientific and technical knowledge in EU decision-making process. The analysis continues with the review of a myriad of communications, policies, and initiatives in this domain: for instance, the Guidelines on collection and use of expertise and the Science and society action plan are discussed in details. Better involvement has to be supported by appropriate communication and <b>consultation</b> <b>policies</b> as well as access to information and justice, the latter being implemented by the Århus Convention. This convention, which has been partially transcribed into EU law, enacts a requirement to form a qualified entity in order to be eligible to represent a public interest in the environmental field. Finally, comitology committees are recognized {{to be one of the}} legal tools to involve external participants in the EU decision-making process. Still, the scientific know-how as well as the provided expertise is non-binding; independent participation is not yet established in the EU decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} ethics consultations at {{a single}} institution that has a mandatory ethics <b>consultation</b> <b>policy.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients who were admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} at Columbia University Medical Center and had an ethics consultation between August 1, 2006, and July 31, 2007. All mandatory and nonmandatory ethics consultations were reviewed. Patient diagnosis, prognosis, presence of do-not-resuscitate order, presence of written advance directives, reason for the ethics consultation, and survival data were collected. The number of ethics consultations hospital-wide from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, was collected. RESULTS: The total number of mandatory and nonmandatory ethics consultations requested was 168. Of these consultations, 108 (64 %) were considered mandatory, and 60 (36 %) were considered nonmandatory. Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007, the total number of ethics consultations increased 84 %. CONCLUSION: The increase in the total number of ethics consultations is interpreted as a positive outcome of the mandatory policy. The mandatory ethics <b>consultation</b> <b>policy</b> has possibly increased exposure to ethics consultant-physician interactions, increased learning for physicians, and raised awareness among physicians and nurses of potential ethics assistance. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The federal {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s duty {{to consult with}} Indian tribes {{has been the subject}} of numerous executive orders and directives from past and current U. S. Presidents, which have, in turn, resulted in the proliferation of agency-specific <b>consultation</b> <b>policies.</b> However, there is still no agreement regarding the fundamental components of the consultation duty. When does the consultation duty arise? And what does it require of the {{federal government}}? The answers to these questions lie in the realization that the tribal consultation duty arises from the common law trust responsibility to Indian tribes, which compels the United States to protect tribal sovereignty and tribal resources, as well as to provide certain services to tribal members. In that respect, the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s duty to consult with Indian tribes has a unique foundation that distinguishes it from decisions to consult with State governments or encourage public participation through the Administrative Procedures Act. This Article argues that the duty to consult with Indian tribes is properly viewed as a procedural component of the trust responsibility. It further argues that a more robust, judicially enforceable consultation requirement would be the most effective way to ensure that the federal government fulfills the substantive components of its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, while avoiding the difficult line-drawing that would be inherent in direct enforcement of those components. In this way, the consultation duty could become a powerful tool to ensure that federal agencies know and consider the impacts their actions will have on Indian people, before those actions are taken...|$|E

40|$|In this {{normative}} inquiry, we will assess two planning {{policies that}} the Montreal Citizen's Movement (MCM), a municipal {{party of the}} left, experimented with while in power at the City of Montreal, from 1986 to 1994. The MCM implemented an unprecedented public <b>consultation</b> <b>policy</b> and it also wished {{to put in place}} a compensation policy for equal housing and land-use opportunities, which, effectively, it tried in a redevelopment project known as 'Overdale' in 1987. These two experiments were an attempt to tame the land-use market and to make it ethical. In assessing these experiments, we will first propose planning principles built on egalitarian ethics and, then, apply those egalitarian planning principles as evaluation criteria in the assessment. We will also examine similar experiments carried out elsewhere; we will compare the MCM public <b>consultation</b> <b>policy</b> with the Participative Budget of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and the Overdale experience of compensation with a case from Santa Monica, California. The MCM public consultation experiment was, without doubt, an exciting start that brought the politics of public deliberation to planning; however, we will argue that we need to put egalitarian constraints on planning deliberation if we want that deliberation to be not only a source of good planning but also of community building. We will also argue that the Overdale experiment of compensation is indeed a good source of heuristic learning on how to plan for equal land-use opportunities in a city of market liberalism such as Montreal. In this thesis we will persistently argue that we should appeal to egalitarian reason, in order to build a good and beautiful city...|$|R

The Commission's documents on its <b>policy</b> of <b>consultation</b> and cooperation with external non-governmental actors reveal that a reflective approach has emerged during the 1980 s, referring to a more elaborate concept of 'good governance'. The gradual extension is most noticeable in the change of terminology, from ‘consultation’ (1960 / 70 s) to 'partnership' (1980 / 90 s) and 'participation' (1990 s/ 2000).
