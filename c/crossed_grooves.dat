40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} performance of grinding wheel {{in terms of its}} internal granular particles and their effect on the surface finish for both soft and hard metals subjected to both dry and wet conditions of use. The study considers the properties of materials of construction including hardness of the granular particles and their size and distributions that affects the grinding wheel efficiency in abrading of soft and hard metal surfaces. Furthermore, in order to improve grinding performance, the mechanism of clogging the cutting surface of the grinding wheel as a function of for example, the surface properties of granular particles and the chips formed during the grinding operation have been considered. Objective of this project is to study the overall sharpness of the grinding wheel in terms of its internal granular particles and their effect on the surface finish for both soft and hard metals at different conditions of use. The properties of materials of construction including hardness of the granular particles that affects the grinding wheel efficiency in abrading of soft and hard metal surfaces have been studied. During this project two novel grinding wheels, namely single grooved and crossed grooved wheels, have been developed and their performance has been compared with a selected commercial grinding wheel, the design of grinding wheels incorporated an innovative surface profile which {{has been shown to be}} capable of taking potentially large depths of cut at high wheel and workpiece speeds to create a highly efficient material removal process. This aggressive processing generated high temperatures in the contact zone between the wheel and workpiece. The voltage measured by oscilloscope during grinding of different workpiece materials including mild steel, brass and aluminium bars was related to the temperature generated between wheels and workpiece materials. Temperatures in the ground surface can be predicted with a knowledge of the specific grinding energy and the grinding parameters used. Specific grinding voltage recorded at high specific material removal rates demonstrated a constant value of specific grinding heat dependent on cutting and contact conditions, improving accuracy of the predictive model. 4 Cutting and contact conditions in the different grinding wheels vary dependent on their surface patterns. This thesis shows how temperature, contact stresses, material removal rates vary with the surface profile, size and orientation of the abrasive particles of the grinding wheel, affecting {{the performance of}} the grinding wheel during the grinding operations. Redesigning grinding wheels by making grooves on surface of wheel, material removal rate was increased and less voltage has been recorded. Also, time for redressing wheels was reduced. The wheel surface of <b>crossed</b> <b>grooves</b> shape showed a significant improvement in grinding of soft materials e. g. aluminium. Finally, the different stress distribution, including von_Mises, principal stresses and shear stresses, in the grinding wheels and the three workpiece bars during the grinding process were investigated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) technique. The maximum von-Mises stress value of the brass bar was found to be 173. 2 MPa. Hence the strength of produced grinding wheel calculated as 207 MPa which was extensively higher than the maximum von-Mises stress value obtained from FEA profile, resulting 19. 5...|$|E

The controller {{is based on}} a model of point vortices with one degree of freedom and consists of the equation of vortex equilibrium and the Kutta condition in the groove edges. Parameters of a control system for grooves of different depths in a stationary stream are calculated. We determined that in shallow grooves, the region of stability of vortices is wider, than in deep grooves, so they are more promising for control. These results are used to estimate the parameters of the active control scheme with a feedback in a nonstationary flow when the system is responsive to external perturbations. Examples of an implementation of such a scheme are presented for the case when the flow velocity changes periodically or linearly. ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????, ??????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ? ??????? ????????. ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????? ? ????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ????? ? ??????? ?????-?????????? ? ?????? ??????? ???????. ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ??????? ????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????. ????????, ??? ? ?????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ????, ??? ? ????????, ??????? ??? ???????? ????? ?????????????? ??? ??????????. ??? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ????? ? ???????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ??????, ????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ??????? ??????????. ????????? ??????? ?????????? ???? ?????, ????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ??? ?? ????????? ??????...|$|R

40|$|Recently, new {{processes}} to produce enhanced boiling surfaces have been developed. Those are extrusion, {{a combination of}} extrusion and chipping, mechanical rolling, hydraulic expansion, and sintering of metal powder, all of which involve complex operations and high production costs. Grooved rolling is introduced as a simple process to form enhanced boiling surfaces. First, the deformation caused by grooved rolling was analysed by applying a visioplasticity method with plasticine model rolling. Characteristic deformations using the grooved rolling technique occur {{in the form of}} a continuous indentation by the teeth of the grooved roll to the surface of a plane sheet or strip, deformation is mainly confined to the region between the teeth of the upper grooved roll and lower flat roll, plastic flow of the work occurs mainly in a longitudinally and the tips of rib projections formed by grooved rolling are rounded.

Improvement ofsmall cracks on the strip-surface was tried and effect of groove at the roll surface on the strip surface was shown. Design/methodology/approach: Method {{used in the present study}} was high speed twin roll caster withgrooved roll. Two kinds of grooves were used: one was parallel groove and the other was <b>cross</b> <b>groove</b> machinedby knurling and bite attached to a lathe. Findings: Findings of this research are that grooved roll was effective to eliminate the small cracks on the stripsurface. The contact condition between the roll and the melt became uniform by the small groove on the rollsurface. Contact area became small, and heat transfer between the melt and roll became small, too. As the result,chill structure did not become columnar, and crack did not occur. Groove pattern on the strip surface could beerased by the cold rolling. Research limitations/implications: Research limitation is that groove life could not be investigated. Practical implications: Practical implications are as below. The roll load was small and strip was not hot-rolledin a high speed twin roll caster. The grooved roll made strip-surface sound. Grooved 600 mm width roll was tested,and usefulness of the grooved roll was shown.

Ten oak dugouts were discovered at the foot of these sites, together with neolitic objects in secondary position, six examples have already been dated using C 14 analysis. The weight of the sediment covering these vestiges (which were substantially deformed) and their rather fragmented state, does not allow for a study of their forms. This can only be done at a later stage, after completion of the conservation and restoration process. However, it is essential to proceed with the analysis of the marks left by the tools (or workmanship traces) before this work due to their being barely visible and their superfìcial aspect. The interest ο f these skiffs is not so much in their form (they are all incomplete) as in the building process. Three of them have carbonised traces protruding from the bottom which is, sometimes, exceptionally thin. This proves that the prehistoric people mastered the practice of hollowing out by fire {{from the beginning of the}} middle neolithic period (n° 1). The use οf different techniques and tools for making the bottom and sides has also been noted. The first one has a szries of parallel lines with the longitudinal axis, made up of a succession of cupulas produced by hitting with an adze. The sides, however, bear oblique traces (n° 3, 7 and 8) sometimes in the form of a group of offset marks, the layout ο f which indicates the uses ο f axes (also confirmed by the space available for thè handle).

The latter could well correspond to an original means for controlling the thickness of the bottom during the last stage of hollowing out. Thanks to the analysis of the workmanship traces, sometimes very unclear, the Paris-Bercy dugouts, although incomplete, open new perspectives with regards to their function and building techniques.

As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp's toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it.

Saturn's atmosphere contains persistent oval cloud features reminiscent of features on Jupiter. Smaller irregular features track out {{a pattern of}} zonal winds that is symmetric about Saturn's equator and appears to extend to great depth. Winds are predominantly eastward and reach 500 meters per second at the equator. Titan has several haze layers with significantly varying optical properties and a northern polar "collar" that is dark at short wavelengths. Several satellites have been photographed at substantially improved resolution. Enceladus' surface ranges from old, densely cratered terrain to relatively young, uncratered plains <b>crossed</b> by <b>grooves</b> and faults. Tethys has a crater 400 kilometers in diameter whose floor has domed to match Tethys' surface curvature and a deep trench that extends at least 270 ° around Tethys' circumference.

Even a rotation deviation of 5 degrees can cause a false-positive or false-negative diagnosis.

The sculpture {{of the adult}} volution is somewhat irregularly and rather distantly spirally <b>grooved,</b> the <b>grooves</b> <b>crossed</b> by coarse irregular and arcuate growth wrinkles. The shell is colorless, glossy chestnut shaded to greenish yellow at the margin. The spire is tinged with reddish brown. The color of the ventral side of the shell is nacreous, gleaming white and purple. The columellar lip is white. The periostracum is thin and polished. The color of periostracum is greenish-olive. The spire is quite flat. The protoconch is of 1½ rapidly increasing whorls. The protoconch is flatly convex, one-seventh of the total length, regular, well defined. The shell has two whorls. The adult half whorl is the most rapidly increasing, fingernail-shaped, descending at the suture. The suture is deep. The peristome is thin and sharp, the upper lip very little curved. The outer lip is regularly rounded. The basal lip is nearly straight. The columella is very short, subvertical. Inner lip is thickly callous, terminating below in 1 or several minute tubercles, and spreading broadly above over the parietal wall. The inside of the aperture is strongly callous in the centre and towards the columella, {{where there is a}} well-impressed muscular scar of the columellar muscle. A second elongated muscle-scar is situated on the inner side of the basal lip.|$|R
