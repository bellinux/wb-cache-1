Collateral management began in the 1980s, with Bankers Trust and Salomon Brothers taking collateral against credit exposure.

There {{are many ways to}} limit counterparty risk. One of them focuses on controlling credit exposure with diversification, netting, <b>collateralisation</b> and hedging.|$|E

At first, in February and March 2011, the Bundesbank downplayed the Target balances as an irrelevant statistical position.

40|$|A {{part of the}} {{literature}} (for example Bester 1987) points out that collaterals and guarantees could be a device available to debtors for signalling the ex-ante quality of investment projects. Therefore, if credit were properly contracted, borrowers with higher credit quality would subscribe contracts with higher <b>collateralisation</b> levels. The above argument, nevertheless, neglects an important fact of real world credit markets. If financial intermediaries have the capability of properly assessing risk components, they can try to control overall risk by managing LGD: an increase in PD may be offset by a commensurate decrease in LGD through higher <b>collateralisation</b> and/or more protective contractual structures. The argument should be true especially for the leasing market, in consideration {{of the nature of}} the specific credit contract where the leased asset is a sort of “internal collateral”. At this regard we can offer empirical evidence, based on two portfolios of leasing contracts, which indicate: a) the good ex-ante risk managing capability of intermediaries that are able to balance the probability of default and the loss given default case by case, using the proper contracts structures and choosing the necessary <b>collateralisation</b> level, b) their careful management of recovery procedures strategies...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} to {{the literature on the}} interaction between bank financing choices and financial stability. The main objective of the paper is to investigate the implications of the observed increase in <b>collateralisation</b> of financial transactions, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and bank funding, such as repo funding and covered bond issuance. To this end, the paper presents a simple model of secured and unsecured bank funding to analyse the impact of increased asset encumbrance on liquidity risk, solvency risk and changes in collateral value. The main point is easily understood: <b>collateralisation</b> is not a panacea. Instead, increasing levels of <b>collateralisation</b> of bank funding may increase the procyclicality of credit provision and may even increase the probability of a sudden withdrawal of unsecured funding; also known as a bank run. The paper by Gai, Haldane, Kapadia and Nelson distinguishes nicely the microprudential benefits from the macroprudential concerns stemming from high levels of asset encumbrance. From the perspective of a supervisor that is most concerned about the stability of a single financial institution in isolation, increased levels of secured funding are a positive: secured funding is less likely to be withdrawn during times of crisis and it is cheaper than unsecured funding. Also, the mere diversification of funding sources provides some insurance against adverse developments i...|$|E

40|$|The primary aims of {{the work}} {{undertaken}} in this thesis were to examine whether there is genetic regulation of EPC number and / or function and to determine if EPC dysfunction precedes the onset of CAD. In additional studies, the role that EPCs play in two relevant coronary pathologies - in-stent restenosis (ISR) and coronary <b>collateralisation</b> - was examined. Finally, an exploratory analysis was undertaken to determine if cellular senescence, assessed by telomere length, impacts on EPC function. A total of 162 subjects were studied including 24 healthy parent-healthy offspring pairs and 27 CAD parent-healthy offspring pairs for the principle objectives. The relationships between EPCs and ISR and coronary <b>collateralisation</b> were studied in 21 and 39 subjects, respectively. In all subjects, the number of circulating CD 34 +VEGFR- 2 + and AC 133 +VEGFR- 2 + EPCs, the number of EPCs grown in vitro, and the migration capacity of cultured EPCs towards VEGF were determined. There was significant correlation {{in the number of}} cultured EPCs between parents and their offspring (Healthy: R= 0. 492, p= 0. 015; CAD: R= 0. 751, p< 0. 001) Offspring of subjects with CAD had significantly higher numbers of circulating CD 34 +VEGFR- 2 + and AC 133 +VEGFR- 2 + cells than offspring of healthy subjects (p= 0. 018 and p< 0. 001, respectively). There was no striking relationship between EPC number or function and either ISR or degree of coronary <b>collateralisation.</b> Telomeres were significantly shorter in offspring of subjects with CAD than offspring of healthy subjects (5. 7 +/- 0. 2 kb vs 6. 7 +/- 0. 7 kb, p < 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{collateral}} circulation which supplies a myocardial territory, {{subtended by}} a chronic total occlusion (CTO), may be observed at invasive coronary angiography. The prognostic and protective role of such <b>collateralisation</b> is well demonstrated {{suggesting that a}} good collateral circulation may be a predictor of myocardial viability, but current evidence is discrepant. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the relationship between <b>collateralisation</b> from the contralateral epicardial vessels and myocardial viability by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). METHOD: Consecutive patients with CTO having had both CMR and invasive coronary angiography were retrospectively identified. The collateral circulation was graded with the Cohen and Rentrop classification. CMR images were graded per segment for wall motion (1 : normal/hyperkinetic, 2 : hypokinetic, 3 : akinetic, or 4 : dyskinetic) and wall motion score index (WMSI) was calculated. The segmental transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement was scored as 1 (0 %), 2 (1 - 25 %), 3 (26 - 50 %), 4 (51 - 75 %) and 5 (76 - 100 %). RESULTS: A good collateral circulation was more likely to supply viable myocardium (p= 0. 01). There was no relationship between collateral circulation supply and wall motion score index (WMSI), however, increasing transmurality of LGE was significantly associated with higher mean WMSI representing increasing dysfunctional myocardium (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The presence of collateral coronary circulation at angiography predicts the presence of viability on cardiovascular MRI, with a gradation of greater viability associated with improving Rentrop grade. A collateral circulation at angiography should, therefore, prompt more formal assessment of viability and consideration of revascularisation in order for the patient to obtain the associated functional and prognostic improvement...|$|E

First, the paper explains the design of such a framework from the perspective of risk mitigation, which is the purpose of <b>collateralisation.</b> The paper argues that, by means of appropriate risk mitigation measures, the residual risk on any potentially eligible asset can be equalised and brought down to the level consistent with the risk tolerance of the central bank. Once this result has been achieved, eligibility decisions should be based on an economic cost-benefit analysis. Second, the paper looks at the effects of the collateral framework on financial markets, and in particular on spreads between eligible and ineligible assets. ...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular disease {{remains the}} leading cause of death worldwide. However, there remain a {{significant}} number of patients who are not eligible for current treatment options. Therapeutic angiogenesis offer great potential in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Recent experiments demonstrated that haem oxygenase- 1 (Hmox 1) possesses pro-angiogenic and atheroprotective properties. Recent studies have also shown that the vascular protective effects of Hmox 1 may be mediated by endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilisation. EPCs are implicated in vascular regeneration and angiogenesis. However, outcomes from clinical trials on cell therapy have been disappointing and hampered by the use of unselected cell populations. This thesis therefore investigated several aspects of the role of Hmox 1 and EPCs in therapeutic angiogenesis and vascular repair. Firstly, the role of Hmox 1 in ischaemia-mediated neovascularisation was investigated. Secondly, the relationship between bilirubin concentration (a surrogate marker of Hmox 1 activity in humans) and amputation was explored. Thirdly, the relationship between level and function of distinct EPC populations and coronary <b>collateralisation,</b> as well as the extent of coronary epicardial and microvascular disease, was explored. There were several key findings from this thesis. Firstly, we found that Hmox 1 played a critical role in ischaemia-mediated neovascularisation, and that this protective effect of Hmox 1 may be mediated by EPC mobilisation and hypoxia-induced glucose metabolism. Secondly, we found an inverse relationship between bilirubin concentration and amputation. Lastly, we found that higher late-outgrowth endothelial cell, but not early EPC, levels and function were associated with better coronary <b>collateralisation</b> and less severe epicardial coronary disease. These findings may have implications for therapeutic angiogenesis and atheroprotection in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

40|$|Ethiopia has {{experimented with}} land law reforms linked to agriculture-led {{national}} development strategies that Emperor Haile Sellassie I, Derg, and EPRDF introduced since Emperor Menelik II enacted modern Ethiopia’s first reform intended for development in 1908. Nonetheless, the country’s smallholder productivity averaged 1. 0 ton/hectare and its poverty ranked 174 th in the UNDP Human Development Index in 2011. This thesis examines {{whether and how}} land law reform {{can be used to}} help raise smallholder productivity and tackle poverty in Ethiopia notwithstanding the challenges of legal pluralism. By drawing upon evidence from law and development research and experience and analysing it in the Ethiopian context, the thesis argues that reform can help raise smallholder productivity, but only by recognising legal pluralism and changing the land tenure system’s formal state or non-formal customary land policies, laws, and institutions which constrain the provision and implementation of productivity-raising smallholder land rights that enhance tenure security, facilitate the transfer of rights over land, and authorise the <b>collateralisation</b> of land rights; and tackle poverty by thereby increasing food supplies, raising incomes, and improving health, education, and other necessities for the country’s predominantly rural population. Specifically, the thesis explores the possibility of using reform to adopt a hybrid state-private-customary land policy that combines the advantages of state land ownership policy that the government enforces, private ownership that critics favour, and non-formal arrangements that society uses. It then highlights how within the framework of this hybrid policy reform may help issue land laws boosting the provision of land rights that enhance tenure security by specifying definition of state, private, and communal landholdings, certification of lifelong usufructuary landholding, stricter eviction and confiscation procedures, and clearer expropriation and compensation mechanisms; that facilitate transfer by easing lease, donation, and succession restrictions; and that authorise <b>collateralisation</b> conditionally. Finally, it demonstrates how reform may help establish land institutions that improve implementation by incorporating non-formal arrangements, establishing a federal executive institution, clarifying the mandates of regional institutions, and assigning the judiciary greater dispute resolution role...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{database}} of SME credit approvals from a large Belgian bank, this paper extends the empirical evidence on the determinants of collateral by examining the determinants of business collateral simultaneously with the determinants of personal collateral/commitments.

Family firms are more likely to offer a higher degree of collateral/commitment protection while introducing competition between banks decreases this likelihood. The collateral requirement decreases in the length of the bank-borrower relationship. Furthermore, trade credit seems to have a signalling effect. The ‘lazy banks hypothesis ’ was not supported. Our results suggest that beside risk arguments, also commercial arguments help explain the pledging of collateral.

30|$|Studying {{the dynamic}} changes after a meal could offer insight into key {{pathophysiological}} changes (hepatic artery buffer response and liver perfusion), {{which may have}} critical contributions to clinical management. Although the significance of hepatic artery buffer response in patients with CC is not completely understood, it is hypothesised {{that the increase in}} hepatic arterial flow in a low portal venous flow state sustains oxygen delivery to the liver and thus has a protective effect on organ function [46]. We propose that studying postprandial change in liver and collateral haemodynamics will aid individualised treatment strategies for portal hypertension and hence reduce the rate of treatment non-response. Haemodynamic change following a meal challenge has been utilised as a model to study the effects of novel treatment for portal hypertension [28, 47, 48]. In patients with extensive <b>collateralisation</b> and greater postprandial rise of the collateral circulation, the efficacy of eradicating the varices as the primary treatment strategy in reducing the risk of bleeding should be evaluated.|$|E
