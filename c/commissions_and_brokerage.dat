25|$|Negrín signed 19 {{consecutive}} sell orders between February 19, 1937 and April 28, 1938, {{directed to}} the successive People's Commissioner of Finance: G. F. Grinko (until May 1937), V. Tchoula (until September 1937) and A. Zverev (until {{the end of the}} war). In them, the value of an ounce of gold troy was converted into pounds sterling, U.S dollars or French francs according to the exchange rate at the London Stock Exchange. According to Martín Aceña, 415tonnes of crude gold (374tonnes of fine gold) were sold in 1937, then between January and April 1938 another 58 (52) were sold, and out of the remaining gold, 35 (31) tonnes were separated from the original deposit to constitute a second deposit that guaranteed a credit of 70 million U.S. dollars. Thus, by August 1938 a remaining 2tonnes were still available. The Republic obtained from the selling of the gold a total of 469.8 million U.S. dollars, 131.6 of which remained within the USSR to pay for various purchases and expenses. The Soviets kept 2.1% of the funds in the form of <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> <b>brokerage,</b> and kept an additional 1.2% in the form of transport, deposit, melting, and refining expenses: in total, slightly less than 3.3%, approximately 14.5 million U.S. dollars. The remaining 72%, 338.5 million U.S. dollars' worth, was transferred to the Banque Commerciale pour L'Europe du Nord, or Eurobank, in Paris, the Soviet financial organization in France, property of the Gosbank, the national bank of the Soviet Union. From Paris, agents of the Treasury and diplomatic representatives paid for the purchase of matériel acquired in Brussels, Prague, Warsaw, New York and Mexico, among others.|$|E

40|$|Terms such as <b>{{commission}}</b> <b>and</b> <b>brokerage</b> {{are similar}} {{in the concept of}} agency and in some cases they are different. In the legal system of Iran, commission section is derived from French law and it drives out the commission from the realm of agency and justifies it as an entity equal to the contract of the mandate. On the other hand, the brokerage has not been discussed in Iran’s jurisprudential sources and civil law as a legal body establishment; therefore, we can take it as new found phenomena that came to our legal system simultaneous with the commercial law concepts.   Such differences between commission agent with broker can be stated like this: the commission agent is only obliged to announce the actions and especially do his missions to the commander, in fact the commission agent has the right of disclosure before his commander, but according to the article 337 of the written law, the broker also has the right of disclosure of the details of transaction toward the party with whom the brokerage contract has not been signed. The broker is usually the middleman of the transmission in consideration of receiving a specific amount of money or he can find a party for a person who wants to conduct a transaction and he himself doesn’t get involved in the transaction and is not engaged, whereas the commission agent is directly a contracting party and the true beneficiary (commander) which the transaction is done in his account has no contact with the main buyer. This survey is done by the analytical-descriptive method for comparing the <b>brokerage</b> <b>and</b> <b>commission</b> in the commercial law of Iran...|$|R

40|$|Large {{institutional}} investors dominate many financial markets. This paper develops a consumption-based model of markets {{in which all}} institutional traders recognize their impact on prices. Bilateral (buyer and seller) market power changes efficiency and arbitrage properties of equilibrium. Predictions match temporary and permanent price effects of supply shocks, order breakup, limits to arbitrage, nonneutrality of trading frequency, and real effects of shocks and announcements in periods other than event dates. Maximizing welfare and stabilizing liquidity through disclosure of information about fundamentals presents a trade-off. Equilibrium representation as “trading against price impact ” provides a link with the industry’s practice. (JEL E 21, G 12, L 13) Since trade-level data first became available two-and-a-half decades ago, it has been well understood that, in many contemporaneous markets, trade is dominated by a relatively small group of large, {{institutional investors}} whose positions move prices, thereby adversely affecting their terms of trade. Trading costs associated with price impact are first order and exceed all explicit trading costs, such as <b>commission,</b> <b>brokerage,</b> <b>and</b> order-processing fees. Technique...|$|R
