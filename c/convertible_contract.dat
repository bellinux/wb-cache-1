40|$|In an {{incomplete}} contracts setting, we analyze {{the nature of}} financial contracting when the entrepreneur can decide {{on the degree of}} specificity of investments. By investing in project-specific assets, an entrepreneur increases the productivity of his project but decreases its liquidation value. In debt financing, there is an additional strategic incentive to specialize assets to decrease the bargaining power of the lender. Although specializing assets is socially optimal, debt financing may not be feasible when assets can be made highly specialized. Equity financing, provided by an active investor such as a VC, may be feasible when there is greater scope for specializing the assets because the VC’s effort becomes more valuable as assets become more specific. In turn the VC’s effort helps persuade the entrepreneur to take the firm public and allows the VC to cash out. VC equity financing results in socially optimal investment and exit decisions; however, <b>convertible</b> <b>contracts,</b> which introduce inefficient liquidation, are also used to ensure the feasibility of financing. We predict that firms with greater opportunity to specialize will be mostly financed by equity versus debt and firms financed by <b>convertible</b> <b>contracts</b> are more likely to go public...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of {{convertible}} debt on the investment incentives facing stockholders. The effect depends critically on the value of existing assets relative to the firm's investment requirements. With a restrictive dividend covenant, convertible debt mitigates the overinvestment incentive associated with risky debt but exacerbates the underinvestment incentive at higher values of existing assets. A less‐restrictive dividend covenant exacerbates overinvestment under straight debt financing but reduces the underinvestment incentive induced by the conversion feature. In this context, a <b>convertible</b> debt <b>contract</b> with a less‐restrictive dividend covenant maximizes firm value...|$|R

In a model where an entrepreneur obtains funding for a project from a venture capitalist, we illustrate an advantage of convertible debt over a mixture of debt and equity in stage ¯nancing situations. Essentially, when the venture capitalist retains the option to abandon the project, the entrepreneur has an incentive to engage in window dressing and bias positively the short-term performance of the project, reducing the probability {{that it will be}} liquidated. An appropriately designed <b>convertible</b> debt <b>contract</b> prevents such short-termistic behavior since window dressing also increases the probability that the venture capitalist will convert debt into equity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a financial contracting problem between a risk neutral entrepreneur and a risk averse investor. Once the venture is started, the entrepreneur chooses {{an action that}} determines the riskiness of the venture's payoff. When action choice is contractible, the optimal risk sharing consideration under limited liability calls for a pure debt contract and the low risk action is adopted. When the action choice is not contractible, due to the risk shifting problem implementing the low risk action requires a deviation from the optimal risk sharing. I focus on situations where despite this deviation, the risk averse investor prefers to implement the low risk action and show that a <b>convertible</b> debt <b>contract</b> is superior to pure debt, pure equity and any mixture of debt and equity.

In a model where an entrepreneur obtains funding for a project from a venture capitalist, we illustrate an advantage of convertible debt, over a mixture of debt and equity, in stage financing situations.

Attempts by the lender to carry an equity interest in the property {{in a manner similar}} to <b>convertible</b> bonds through <b>contract</b> have been therefore struck down by courts as [...] "clogs", but developments in the 1980s and 1990s have led to less rigid enforcement of this principle, particularly due to interest among theorists in returning to a freedom of contract regime.|$|R
40|$|Venture capital {{financing}} {{is characterized}} by extensive use of convertible debt and stage financing. The paper shows why convertible debt {{is better than a}} simple mixture of debt and equity in stage financing situations. When the venture capitalist retains the option to abandon the project, the entrepreneur has an incentive to engage in ‘window dressing’ or short-termism, i. e. to bias positively the short-term performance of the project, {{in order to reduce the}} probability that the project will be liquidated. With a <b>convertible</b> debt <b>contract,</b> such behaviour reduces the likelihood of liquidation, but increases the probability that the venture capitalist will convert debt into equity, reducing the entrepreneur’s profits. With convertible debt, therefore, the entrepreneur will not engage in as much short-term behaviour in terms of signal manipulation in comparison to a situation where only straight debt-equity financing is used. convertible debt; Short Termism; Venture Capital; window dressing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the strategic behavior exhibited by entrepreneurs {{in the context}} of <b>convertible</b> preferred stocks <b>contracts</b> where the venture capitalists are protected by an antidilution clause. These types of provision stipulate conversion ratios in inverse proportion to performance measures and thus potentially induce entrepreneurs to overstate earnings. We show that the degree to which earnings is reported truthfully is heavily influenced by the particular conversion ratios selected by the venture capitalists. Nevertheless, adjusting the conversion ratios to encourage entrepreneurs to report truthfully may dampen the effect of antidilution clauses in motivating the entrepreneurs to exert greater effort...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{financing}} possibilities for capital constrained entrepreneurs when venture financiers perform two tasks, monitoring and advice. We model advice as effort that results {{in an increase in}} the probability of success. In turn, we consider monitoring as an activity exerted to control entrepreneurial project choice, which results in an increase in the returns in the less successful state. Thus entrepreneurs favor advice and dislike monitoring. Through the financial claim offered, an entrepreneur can affect the financier 9 ̆ 2 s effort exertion on the two tasks. The primary result is that highly capital constrained entrepreneurs can get financing only with intense monitoring and limited advice. The optimal financial claim resembles to a <b>convertible</b> debt <b>contract.</b> Entrepreneurs endowed with more self-financing can restrain the level of monitoring, thus induce more advice, and can offer an equity contract. The results may shed light on contracting practices observed in the venture capital industry, namely the unusual negative correlation between control and cash-flow rights and the use of a variety of securities...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a manager}} borrows {{external}} funds {{in order to}} invest in production and also in prevention. The latter action must reduce the environmental risk driven by {{the activity of the}} firm. Prevention is observable neither by outside lenders nor by institutions such as environmental agencies for instance. In such a situation, we show that issuing convertible bonds - which permits the holder to exchange his bonds for a predetermined number of shares of the firm - from a limited liability firm could be a way to improve prevention compared to what can usually be done with standard debt. Such a relationship between the firm and the bank might be an alternative, or a complement, to the CERCLA legislation about extended liability which prevails in the United States and which is often discussed in Europe as a possible support of a more tightened European environmental legislation. We obtain an optimal <b>convertible</b> bond <b>contract</b> that induces more prevention and higher expected net revenues for the firm than standard debt. The expected social welfare is also improved. Finally, the economic implications of our findings are discussed.

5000|$|Dealerships {{could finally}} order a Firebird Convertible from a {{recognized}} coach builder {{that was already}} converting other GM products (though {{more than a dozen}} other companies had been converting F-bodies into convertibles since 1982 for Pontiac & Chevrolet dealers). ASC (American Sunroof Company, Later [...] "American Specialty Cars") (of ASC McLaren fame) offered Pontiac Dealerships a Firebird/Formula/Trans Am/GTA <b>convertible.</b> ASC was <b>contracted</b> to convert all of the official Camaro Convertibles from 1987 to 1992. However, due to fuel economy restrictions mandated by the EPA, a convertible Firebird would have been assessed a $1200 Gas Guzzler Tax because the LB9 & L98 when paired with a Trans Am or GTA would have been lower than 22.5 average MPG. For this reason Pontiac did not directly offer a convertible through dealers like the Camaro. However these were not an official Pontiac offering, they are considered coach convertibles. The conversion of the Firebird was identical to the [...] "Factory" [...] Camaros of the same model year. The exception was the obvious cosmetic changes, the rear quarter caps, spoiler (Which was a Base spoiler Wing cut off) and the high mount 3rd brake light were Firebird convertible specific.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the key issues relating to the development of local corporate bond markets. We examine the requirements for local corporate bond market development, and compare and contrast experiences across both mature and emerging markets. We suggest that core aspects such as benchmarking, corporate governance and disclosure, credit risk pricing, the availability of reliable trading systems, and the development of hedging instruments are fundamental for improving the breadth and depth of corporate debt markets. The demand and supply of corporate bonds are dependent on factors such as the investor base, both local and foreign, and government policies toward the issuance process and associated costs, as well as the taxation regime. The sequencing of reforms is key to market development.
