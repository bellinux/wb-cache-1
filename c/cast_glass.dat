25|$|However, {{during the}} last thirty years of the 1st century AD there was a marked change in style, with strong colours disappearing rapidly, {{replaced}} by ‘aqua’ and true colourless glasses. Colourless and ‘aqua’ glasses had been in use for vessels and some mosaic designs prior to this, but start to dominate the blown glass market at this time. The use of strong colours in <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> died out during this period, with colourless or 'aqua' glasses dominating the last class of cast vessels to be produced in quantity, as mould and free-blowing took over during the 1st century AD.|$|E
25|$|Roman glass objects {{have been}} {{recovered}} across the Roman Empire in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts. Glass was used primarily {{for the production of}} vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely coloured <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> vessels. However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colourless or ‘aqua’ glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, {{and by the end of}} the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which must have been very expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|E
2500|$|Horn's 2009-2010 work Well and Truly, [...] {{consists}} of ten solid <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> parts, each measuring 91.5cm {{in diameter and}} 45.5cm in height. Well and Truly {{is part of a}} private collection, but was included in an exhibition of the same title at Kunsthaus Bregenz from April 24 to July 4, 2010. The 10 glass elements are cylinders in shades of blue and pale blue greens. Like earlier glass sculptures Horn has produced, these works bear rough, textured sides that evidence the process of casting used to produce them, and smooth, fire polished top surfaces that are, from different angles, reflective and seemingly endless in depth. In Briony Fer's essay for the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn, she writes about the experience one has with the surfaces of these glass works, [...] "There is an almost unbearable precision in the effect of the light on the smooth surface of glass or an accidental but infinitesimal flaw in the surface that creates an effect of massive turbulence in certain lights and absolutely none in others. Depending on the angle of view, glass has a surface of either razor sharpness or infinite depth. At one moment its surfaces can seem as thin and dazzling as the gold leaf laid out on the floor of Paired Gold Mats, for Ross and Felix, at another it is purely transparent. You cannot see the change happenings in perception; it is only visible in its sudden effect when one kind of surface has switched invisibly into another. You can see into it and then suddenly the light changes, and it has no inside at all--only a surface and a shine that reflects outward. The line between the two is so fine that in perception it no longer exists. But it is our experience that fractures in an instant." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{large part}} of the soil of England was owned by the monks. They now possessed {{considerable}} buildings, with stone churches of some pretensions, in which service was conducted with pomp and impressiveness. The tiny chapel of St. Lawrence, at Bradford-on-Avon, forms the best example of this primitive Romanesque architecture now surviving in England. Around the monasteries stretched their well-tilled lands, mostly reclaimed from fen or forest, and probably more scientifically cultivated than those of the neighbouring manors. Most of the monks were skilled in civilised handicrafts, introduced from the more cultivated continent. They were excellent ecclesiastical metalworkers; many of them were architects, who built in rude imitation of Romanesque models; and others were designers or illuminators of manuscripts. The books and charters of this age are delicately and minutely wrought out, though not with all the artistic elaboration of later mediæval work. The art of painting (almost always in miniature) was considerably advanced, the figures being well drawn, in rather stiff but not unlifelike attitudes, though perspective is very imperfectly understood, and hardly ever attempted. Later Anglo-Saxon architecture, such as that of Eadward's magnificent abbey church at Westminster (afterwards destroyed by Henry III. to make way for his own building), was not inferior to continental workmanship. All the arts practised in the abbeys were of direct Roman origin, and most of the words relating to them are immediately derived from the Latin. This is the case even with terms relating to such common objects as candle, pen, wine, and oil. Names of weights, measures, coins, and other exact quantitative ideas are also derived from Roman sources. Carpenters, smiths, bakers, tanners, and millers, were usually attached to the abbeys. Thus, in many cases, as at Glastonbury, Peterborough, Ripon, Beverley, and Bury St. Edmunds, the monastery grew into the nucleus of a considerable town, though the development of such towns is more marked after than before the Norman Conquest. As a whole, it was by means of the monasteries, and especially of their constant interchange of inmates with the continent, that England mainly kept up the touch with the southern civilisation. There alone was Latin, the universal medium of continental intercommunication, taught and spoken. There alone were books written, preserved, and read. Through the Church alone was an organisation kept up in direct communication with the central civilising agencies of Italy and the south. And while the Church and the monasteries thus preserved the connection with the continent, they also formed schools of culture and of industrial arts for the country itself. At the abbeys bells were <b>cast,</b> <b>glass</b> manufactured, buildings designed, gold and silver ornaments wrought, jewels enamelled, and unskilled labour organised by the most trained intelligence of the land. They thus remained as they had begun, homes and retreats for those exceptional minds which were capable of carrying on the arts and the knowledge of a dying civilisation across the gulf of predatory barbarism which separates the artificial culture of Rome from the industrial culture of modern Europe.|$|E
