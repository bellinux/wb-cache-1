By extending the contour tree (Freeman and Morse, 1967) to a contour graph, open <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> and carrying <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> can be handled. The ambiguities of the topological relationships among <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> are resolved using map structure information, i. e., elevation tags and index <b>contour</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Contour</b> graph is constructed and processed efficiently by introducing index contour graph.

2500|$|Since {{multiple}} distinct gait parameters have {{a significant}} impact on the energetic cost of walking, each of these parameters have to be considered when examining the primary goal of metabolic cost optimization. [...] The visualization of such an optimization for walking speed, cadence, and step length can be expressed in the form of a contour map, in which parameter combinations that lie on the same <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> share the same cost of transport (cal/kg/m). [...] The green, red, and blue, dotted lines represent values where cadence, walking speed, and step length are constrained, respectively. [...] These lines can be formed by finding the tangent points that lines representative of several constant parameter values form with the constant COT contours. [...] For example, the optimal COT's for constrained walking speeds (red) can be found by drawing vertical lines and noting where they form a tangent with a contour, as seen with point B in the diagram. [...] A series of these intersections can then form the curve for optimal COT under constrained walking speed. [...] These constrained optimization values not only reflect the naturally selected preferred gait parameters that are observed by fixing a single parameter at different values, but also form part of a predictive map that allows for the identification of the cost of transport for a multivariate system.|$|E
