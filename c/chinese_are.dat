5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia.

Relations between the Vietnamese and <b>Chinese</b> <b>are</b> considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities.

John Webb, the British architect, went a step further. In a Biblical vein similar to Kircher's, he tried to demonstrate that <b>Chinese</b> <b>was</b> the Primitive or Adamic language.
