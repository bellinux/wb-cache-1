It is an unmarked and undeveloped island that also is Connecticut's {{smallest}} state park at 0.88 acres. The island acquired its name when a local man declared it to be Minnie Island, because he took his wife, Minnie, to it for picnics. Joseph Leary, author of A Shared Landscape writes, [...] "s far back as anyone <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>the</b> island was a frequent landing place for boating parties and a great place for local children to explore." [...] The island was claimed by both the towns of Salem, Connecticut and Montville, Connecticut though it was not in the land records of either town. This went unnoticed until a man attempted to purchase the island, and then made attempted to establish claim to the island. The man introduced a bill to authorize the sale by the state to establish title to the island, but instead the Connecticut General Assembly drafted and passed a bill to turn the island into a park.|$|E
500|$|Tippett {{recognised}} {{the importance}} to his compositional development of several 19th- and 20th-century composers: Berlioz for his clear melodic lines, Debussy for his inventive sound, Bartók for his colourful dissonance, Hindemith for his skills at counterpoint, and Sibelius for his originality in musical forms. [...] He revered Stravinsky, sharing the Russian composer's deep interest in older music. Tippett had heard early ragtime {{as a small}} child before the [...] First World War; he noted in his later writings that, {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, ragtime and jazz [...] "attracted many serious composers thinking to find... a means to refresh serious music by the primitive". His [...] interest in these forms led to his fascination with blues, articulated in several of his later works. Among his contemporary composers, Tippett admired Britten and shared his desire to end the perception of English music as provincial. He also had a high regard for Alan Bush, with whom he joined forces to produce the 1934 Pageant of Labour. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> excitement I felt when he outlined to me his plan for a major string quartet".|$|E

[...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave.

2500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that fish can retain {{information}} for months or years. Anecdotally, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> human voice call announcing food five years after last hearing that call.

Sockeye salmon still react to a light signal that precedes food arrival up to eight months since the last reinforcement. Some common rudd and European chub could remember the person who trained them to feed from the hand, even after a 6-month break. [...] Crimson-spotted rainbowfish can learn how to escape from a trawl by swimming through a small hole in the center and they remember this technique 11 months later. Rainbow trout can be trained to press a bar to get food, and they remember this three months after last seeing the bar. Red Sea clownfish can recognize their mate 30 days after it was experimentally removed from the home anemone.|$|E

Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
