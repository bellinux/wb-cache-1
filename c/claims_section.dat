5000|$|The {{confusing}} arising {{about the}} scope of the claimed invention in this case led in part to the Patent Act of 1836, which introduced the requirement of a separate <b>claims</b> <b>section</b> for all patents. [...] That requirement in turn made the specific legal analysis in this case largely obsolete. However, the case continued to be cited for the general principle that a patentee need not be aware of a previous use in order for that previous use to render the patent invalid.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to handling these routine matters, {{the chief of}} the <b>Claims</b> <b>Section</b> participated in the negotiations with the Korean government concerning the payment of foreign claims generated by troops of the Army of the Republic of Korea who were active in South Vietnam. In fact, the MACV Staff judge Advocate's office was to {{play a vital role in}} the negotiation and implementation of certain claims agreements with the Vietnamese government and the Free World allies which came to be known as [...] "knock-for-knock" [...] agreements. These compacts contained provisions whereby the government of one nation waived the claims against the government of the second nation for damage to government property. The agreements did not, however, waive the personal right of an individual to claim damages in the case of negligence of a member of the force of another allied nation. The arrangements nevertheless removed a potential irritant to the relationships among the Free World forces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{case was}} the {{culmination}} of a long series of previous decisions holding that an invention had not only to set forth how to implement the invention, but also how the invention differed from the prior art. This doctrine ultimately gave rise to the requirement for separate, distinct claims, as adopted in the Patent Act of 1836. It also gave rise to the written description requirement as distinct from the enablement requirement. However, in modern jurisprudence the written description requirement did not re-emerge as a distinct issue until the passage of the Patent Act of 1952. It first entered modern jurisprudence as a distinct requirement when the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals issued its In re Ruschig decision in 1965. [...] This historical connection notwithstanding, authorities including Judge Rader have argued that Evans v. Eaton in fact supports considering enablement and written description as a single requirement, because the need for distinction from the prior art was addressed by the requirement for a separate <b>claims</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

These claims were then indexed using Lemur’s BuildIndex function. In the topic documents we also focussed exclusively on the <b>claims</b> <b>sections.</b> These were extracted and converted to queries by removing stopwords and punctuation. We did not perform any term selection. We retrieved 100 patents per topic using Lemur’s RetEval function, retrieval model TF-IDF.

40|$|Biological {{diversity}} in the patent system is an enduring focus of controversy but empirical analysis {{of the presence of}} bio{{diversity in}} the patent system has been limited. To address this problem we text mined 11 million patent documents for 6 million Latin species names from the Global Names Index (GNI) established by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). We identified 76, 274 full Latin species names from 23, 882 genera in 767, 955 patent documents. 25, 595 species appeared in the <b>claims</b> <b>section</b> of 136, 880 patent documents. This reveals that human innovative activity involving bio{{diversity in the}} patent system focuses on approximately 4 % of taxonomically described species and between 0. 8 – 1 % of predicted global species. In this article we identify the major features of the patent landscape for biological diversity by focusing on key areas including pharmaceuticals, neglected diseases, traditional medicines, genetic engineering, foods, biocides, marine genetic resources and Antarctica. We conclude that the narrow focus of human innovative activity and ownership of genetic resources is unlikely to be in the long term interest of humanity. We argue that a broader spectrum of biodiversity needs to be opened up to research and development based on the principles of equitable benefit-sharing, respect for the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, human rights and ethics. Finally, we argue that alternative models of innovation, such as open source and commons models, are required to open up biodiversity for research that addresses actual and neglected areas of human need.

40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of research}} evidence is showing the advantages of using certain skills and behaviours called language learning strategies in general and vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs) in particular {{in the process of}} L 2 acquisition. University students who require reading English texts in their fields of study have to expand their vocabulary knowledge in a much more efficient way than ordinary ESL/EFL learners.   And ELT course books are a good place to incorporate learner training in this regard. The {{purpose of this study is}} to see how vocabulary learning strategies are treated in both the book designer's <b>claims</b> <b>section</b> and the exercises of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course books for students of medicine and para-medicine on the one hand and English for General Purposes (EGP) course book used commonly by these students in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran on the other. In other words, the specified course books were analyzed based on the insights gained from VLS research to gauge the extent to which they have incorporated VLSs and training in using them. These books were published under the supervision of the center for studying and compiling university books in humanities (SAMT). Based on the review of the relevant literature, three key strategies were identified and an analytic framework was devised. The framework was then applied to the course books. It was found that the treatments in the specified course books were deemed unlikely to improve students’ abilities with these important skills and strategies...|$|E

40|$|The <b>claims</b> <b>section</b> of {{a patent}} {{performs}} an important public notice function in patent law. The claims inform {{us of the}} boundaries delineating the subject matter over which the inventor holds an exclusive right. Methodology for interpreting patent claims has {{a direct impact on}} the claims’ ability to fulfill that mandate. Theories of interpretation are far better developed in statutory and contract law. Many principles animating the debate between form and substance in those fields are relevant to patent law as well, but patents’ divergent genesis and purpose create some important differences. This Article identifies the methodology set forth in the recent Phillips v. AWH Corp. case as a “tiered” substantive approach. Counter to conventional wisdom that formalism’s chief virtue is its production of certain results, this tiered substantive approach in claim construction best achieves certainty and, by extension, furthers the public notice function of claims. It also best comports with the courts’ obligation to construe patents {{in the same manner as}} a “person of ordinary skill in the art. ” Another pivotal consideration is this methodology’s influence on private drafting behavior. The tiered substantive approach will likely induce many inventors to draft their patents more formalistically. In effect, this permits a drafter to opt out of substantivism. Inventors have a variety of formalist tools for reigning in the potentially expansive effect of the tiered substantive methodology. Such a combination – formalism in patent drafting and substantivism in claim interpretation – will most effectively serve the public notice function of claims...|$|E
40|$|After several {{rounds of}} revisions, the American Economic Review has {{accepted}} a Reply to my Comment (Rothstein, forthcoming) on Caroline Hoxbys Does Competition Among Public Schools Benefit Students and Taxpayers (Hoxby 2000). The Reply (Hoxby, forthcoming) is deeply flawed. It badly misstates {{the import of}} my comment; only briefly addresses my primary argument; and gets many important facts wrong. In this rejoinder, I attempt to clarify matters. Although Hoxby purports to refute my Comment, my central conclusions are undisputed: 1) Hoxby has not made available the data that were used for her original paper. 2) Hoxbys basic result holds only when we rely on her specific construction of the larger streams variable. She has never presented estimates that do not rely on this variable; all such estimates that I have computed yield small, insignificant effects of choice on test scores. 3) There are several odd aspects of Hoxbys particular larger streams variable that cast doubt on its validity. 4) There are serious errors in both the program code and data that Hoxby has distributed. Hoxby has not released the code {{that was used in}} her Reply, but she offers no indication that these errors have been repaired. The Replys discussion of these issues is circuitous and masked by extensive, combative digressions about irrelevant points, and even careful readers who lack access to the underlying data may be misled.

40|$|Dealing with failing {{businesses}} is like {{dealing with}} failing marriages. It is messy. The bigger the business the messier {{the process is}} likely to be. Many big business failures in the United States go through their death throes or cure their ills in reorganizations under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. As the vehicle in which big business messes travel, Chapter 11 is viewed as unnecessarily complex, time-consuming, and costly. The justification for Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s very existence has been challenged. This article suggests that we are blaming the vehicle for the mess that it carries. Much of what is problematic with divorce law is that divorce must deal with personal misery. Divorces produce unhappy results, we can 2 ̆ 7 t do much about the underlying problem, so we reform divorce law. Business failure is also an unfortunate, sometimes tragic, event. Much of what is problematic with Chapter 11 is that it must deal with commercial misery. There are limits on how content {{we are likely to}} be with even the most perfect reorganization law. We erroneously measure Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s efficiency by focusing on its absolute costs. We also misjudge its distributional results by comparing them with a classical liquidation regime that predates large corporations. To develop these points, section I narrows the focus to large reorganizations. Section II provides historical background that is central to both of my <b>claims.</b> <b>Section</b> III builds on the historical discussion to suggest that much of the cost and delay in Chapter 11 are unavoidable. After analysing a recent empirical attack on Chapter 11, Section IV considers the history 2 ̆ 7 s implications for modem reform proposals...|$|E
