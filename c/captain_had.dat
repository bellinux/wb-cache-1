5|$|The last {{survivors}} of the Batavian squadron were harried along the coast by the faster forces in the British fleet with Sylph overhauling the 16-gun Mercury, forcing it to surrender just before 11:00.

5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

The hosts managed {{to hang on}} with three wickets in hand, after Davidson's <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> held up play and wasted 20 minutes for {{the running of the}} Melbourne Cup. He performed steadily for the next six matches, not taking more than two wickets in any innings, before playing a prominent role in the final match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria. It was then 100th anniversary of matches between the old rivals. Davidson took 6/99 in the first innings, including Harvey for 128, before adding 2/61 in the second. It helped prevent a defeat on the anniversary and sealed New South Wales' hat-trick of Shield titles.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} enquiry into Magdalenas {{was held}} at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent {{a report to the}} Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of Formal Investigation be held. The enquiry {{was held at}} the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26–28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a Mr. Gray. Evidence was heard that the ship was seaworthy, and that the provision of rescue equipment on board either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to be correct, but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949.|$|E

5|$|Damage to Forte was extensive. The {{stern and}} side facing Sybille {{had been beaten}} in by gunfire as more than 300 shot holes {{combined}} to form gaping holes in hull above the waterline. As well as the masts the bulkheads had been smashed apart and all deck furniture blasted to splinters. 65 of the crew had been killed, including Captain Beaulieu, and approximately 80 wounded, {{more than a third}} of the crew listed as casualties; many of the wounded later died from the effects of amputation. Damages to Sybille were considerably lighter: only six shot had struck the hull in the entire battle: one gun was dismounted, but the worst damage was to Cooke's cabin where a round shot had destroyed most of his furniture. In addition, most of the damage to the masts and rigging proved superficial. Just five crew were killed outright, with another 17 wounded, the latter including Cooke. The British <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> been struck in the left arm, the shot exiting near his spine, with additional injuries to the chest and right arm. He eventually died after a long and agonising deterioration at Calcutta on 25 May 1799 and was buried under a monument with full military honours. A memorial was subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey in his memory.|$|E
5|$|Dave Strack, {{a former}} team 1945–46 <b>captain,</b> <b>had</b> become the {{freshman}} basketball team coach in 1948 and later {{had become a}} variety assistant to Perigo. He led the team to three consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1963–66 and a third-place finish in the 1964 NCAA tournament. During 1964–65 the team compiled a 24–4 overall (13–1, Big Ten) record while completing an undefeated 11–0 overall (7–0, Big Ten) home season and was the national runner-up, falling to John Wooden's UCLA in the 1965 championship game. Strack earned United Press International (UPI) National Coach of the Year honors. The team ended the season listed number one in both the UPI and Associated Press (AP) national rankings. He recruited All-Americans Russell and Buntin to anchor his mid-1960s teams. Tomjanovich also became a Wolverine {{at the end of}} Strack's career and became second team All-Big Ten in 1968 subsequent later stardom. The 1964 team, which went 23–5 overall (11–3, Big Ten), tied with Ohio State with sophomore Russell and junior Buntin. In 1965, Buntin became the first Wolverine to be drafted by the NBA. In 1966, Russell led the team to its third straight conference championship and NCAA selection on his way to National Player of the Year honors.|$|E
5|$|Humphreys, a Naval <b>captain,</b> <b>had</b> married Maria Davenport in 1810, {{and lived}} at Bramall Hall {{long before he}} succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely {{respected}} in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from {{other members of the}} Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the smaller}} ships from the convoy, an American {{merchant}} ship named Silenus, had separated from the main body in the storm and arrived at the Nicobar Islands. There she had encountered Caroline and the American <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> reported the location and value of the convoy to Féretier. Setting all sail, Féretier took Caroline to the north-west, and sighted the convoy at 05:30, {{only a few days}} after leaving the Nicobar Islands. The British ships, under the loose command of John Dale in Streatham, originally mistook the French frigate for the missing Victor and it was not until another half-hour had passed that Dale realised the danger his ships were in. Ordering the Indiamen to form a line of battle, Dale placed his ship in the centre, with the small Lord Keith ahead and Europe behind. However, the lack of naval experience on the British ships resulted in the Indiamen sailing too far from one another in line, thus leaving them unable to provide effective mutual support.|$|E
5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, {{who worked as a}} trader and ship <b>captain,</b> <b>had</b> settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s while it was still part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing macadamia nuts to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|The <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> {{to record}} his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It {{had flown}} a scheduled route to Kjeller, and the <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> continued to Fornebu {{to try the}} new airport. On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made a mistake, and took off from the parking space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war. A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> deliberately arranged that the ship sank on an even keel to make it easier for her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
