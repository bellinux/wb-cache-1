25|$|The Perkin triangle, has means via {{a series}} of glass or Teflon taps to allows {{fractions}} to be isolated {{from the rest of}} the still, without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of reflux. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as nitrogen or argon) and can then be stoppered and removed. A fresh <b>collection</b> <b>vessel</b> can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.|$|E

40|$|A {{chemostat}} {{was designed}} to allow anaerobic growth in the culture vessel {{in the absence of}} a continuous stream of O 2 -free gas. Produced gases were collected within the culture and <b>collection</b> <b>vessels,</b> and pressure build-up was prevented by allowing gases to expand into a collapsed football bladder. The culture overflow was collected in a flask, held at 0 C, that was emptied by applying a positive CO 2 pressure to the system. Ruminococcus albus, a H 2 and CO 2 -producing anaerobe, was used to test the operation of the apparatus. H 2 production was measured by sampling the various gas spaces of known volume and measuring H 2 concentration by gas chromatography. Measurement of accumulated fermentation gases and the effects of the accumulation on fermentations can be studied with the apparatus...|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal {{disintegration}} of molten particles offers one way around these problems. Extensive experience is available with iron, steel, and aluminium. Metal to be powdered is formed into a rod which is introduced into a chamber through a rapidly rotating spindle. Opposite the spindle tip is an electrode from which an arc is established which heats the metal rod. As the tip material fuses, the rapid rod rotation throws off tiny melt droplets which solidify {{before hitting the}} chamber walls. A circulating gas sweeps particles from the chamber. Similar techniques could be employed in space or on the Moon. The chamber wall could be rotated to force new powders into remote <b>collection</b> <b>vessels,</b> and the electrode could {{be replaced by a}} solar mirror focused {{at the end of the}} rod.|$|R

5000|$|Cyclonic and {{filtered}} {{central vacuum}} systems {{are the two}} main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream. True cyclonic cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical <b>collection</b> <b>vessel</b> or bin. Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the <b>collection</b> <b>vessel</b> at a direction tangential to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning vortex. Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward {{to the wall of}} the vessel by centrifugal force, where they fall due to gravity {{into the bottom of the}} collection bin. For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on [...] "Cyclonic separation".|$|E
50|$|In fixed-installation {{central vacuum}} cleaners, the cleaned air may be {{exhausted}} directly outside without {{need for further}} filtration.
