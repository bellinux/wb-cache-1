5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in <b>cider</b> <b>vinegar,</b> wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E

25|$|While the {{earliest}} documented case of scurvy {{was described by}} Hippocrates around 400 BC, the first attempt to give scientific basis {{for the cause of}} this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the British Royal Navy, James Lind. Scurvy was common among those with poor access to fresh fruit and vegetables, such as remote, isolated sailors and soldiers. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on <b>cider,</b> <b>vinegar,</b> sulfuric acid or seawater, along with their normal rations. In the history of science, this is considered to be the first occurrence of a controlled experiment. The results conclusively showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease.

40|$|The {{interest}} for locally produced food is increasing due to consumer {{concern about the}} environment, distrust of industrial foods and a demand for high quality products. Apple is the predominant fruit crop in Sweden, and by processing apples into <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar,</b> these products could significantly {{contribute to the development}} of the market of local foods. In this study different yeast types and different bacterial cultures were evaluated for their suitability in <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar</b> production from cloudy apple juice. Ten apple cultivars (Aroma, Baldwin, Belle de Boskoop, Bramley, Cortland, Gravensteiner, Ingrid-Marie, Jonathan, Rubinola and Spartan) were also evaluated for their suitability for production of juice, <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar.</b> Chemical analyses including total soluble solids, titratable acidity and total phenols were performed on the products along with sensorial evaluation by taste panels. The yeast strains were shown to have an effect on fermentation rate and the resulting content of total phenols in ciders fermented from cloudy apple juice. Dry commercial starter strains gave a higher appreciated cider compared to cider that was spontaneously fermented, and the ale yeast Safale S- 04 was concluded to be the most suited for fermentation of cloudy apple juice. For vinegar production, the bacterial culture had an effect on TSS, but not on any other chemical or taste characteristics. Clear differences in acceptability were found between the cultures; the culture from Alles um den Essig, intended for the submerged method, seemed to better be suited to the used production system compared to cultures developed for the surface method. The cloudy apple juice from the different cultivars varied significantly in chemical composition, with TSS in the range of 9. 6 – 15. 1 %, TA 0. 41 – 1. 24 % and total phenols 123. 9 – 850. 0 mg GAE/L. The comparatively sweet juices of Jonathan and Spartan obtained the highest acceptance whereas juices with lower TSS/TS ratios were less acceptable by the taste panel. During fermentation into cider, the TSS decreased differentially in the cultivars, whereas the differences in TA and total phenols were unaffected. Ciders that were perceived to be comparatively sweet were accepted to a higher degree. The fermentation enhanced the taste differences between the cultivars, and Jonathan and Spartan, were also most accepted as <b>ciders.</b> For <b>vinegar,</b> the differences in traits decreased, and of all the chemical parameters only content of total phenols separated the cultivars. There was however a tendency of lower acceptance of vinegar from Belle de Boskoop, Gravensteiner and Jonathan. It was concluded that several aspects influence the quality of cloudy apple juice, <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar,</b> including cultivar, ripeness and choice of microorganisms for fermentation. For juices and ciders, sweeter products were preferred to a large extent, and the TSS/TA ratio appears to be a good predictor of consumer acceptance. In this study, an apple cultivar with a juice of good taste generally also produced a good cider, whereas the cultivar was of less importance for vinegar production...|$|R
40|$|Rocío Fernández-Pérez [...] . et al. The aim of {{the present}} study was to search for a rapid and {{reliable}} method to enumerate viable acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and to identify to genera and species level AAB isolates from vinegars in full acetic fermentation elaborated by the submerged method from cider, wine and spirit ethanol in industrial bioreactors. Results showed that the rapid epifluorescence staining method using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit and direct counts in Neubauer chamber rendered consistent and reliable data for viable cell counts of bacteria in all the studied vinegars. A linear correlation was shown between viable cell counts and fermentation rates. The highest fermentation rates and viable cell counts were found in <b>cider</b> <b>vinegars,</b> whereas spirit vinegars showed the lowest values for both parameters. Eighty-four AAB pure isolates were recovered from 41 different vinegar samples and were submitted to DNA extraction. PCR amplification of the 16 S– 23 S intergenic spacer region of rDNA and subsequent sequencing were carried out to identify isolates to species level. Results showed that Gluconacetobacter europaeus was the predominant cultivable species, appearing in 79 % of the total isolates. This was the unique species found in spirit vinegars, and this is the first time that AAB from spirit vinegars are taxonomically identified. Ga. europaeus was as well the predominant cultivable species in white wine <b>vinegars.</b> <b>Cider</b> <b>vinegars</b> presented the highest variability of species: Ga. europaeus (35. 3 % appearance among cultivable isolates), Ga. xylinus (35. 3 %), Acetobacter pasteurianus (17. 6 %) and Ga. hansenii (11. 8 %). Red wine vinegars showed cultivable isolates of the species Ga. xylinus (71. 4 %) and Ga. europaeus (28. 6 %). Summarising, both described methods for AAB enumeration and taxonomical identification proved to be fast and reliable methods, and results revealed Ga. europaeus as the cultivable major species in vinegars in full fermentation conducted by the submerged method, suggesting that Ga. europaeus strains can constitute excellent starter cultures for the elaboration of vinegars by the submerged method. his work was supported by grant OTEM 070621 by the company Vinagrerías Riojanas S.

40|$|The {{formation}} of D-amino acids (D-aa) in many fermented foods depends, among other factors, {{on the particular}} fermentation conditions, the action and autolysis of the microorganisms involved. In this sense, the analysis of chiral amino acids is an interesting analytical strategy for food scientists, since these compounds {{can be used as}} bacterial markers and can help e. g., to detect adulterations, microbiological contaminations, etc. In this work, a fast and sensitive method based on micellar electrokinetic chromatography with laser induced fluorescence (MEKC-LIF) has been developed to analyze and quantitate L- and D-aa in vinegars. The chiral-MEKC-LIF procedure uses 100 mM sodium tetraborate, 30 mM SDS and 20 mM -CD at pH 9. 7 as running buffer, obtaining a good separation of the main vinegar L/D amino acids previously derivatized with fluorescein isothiocianate. Namely, L/D proline, alanine, arginine, glutamic and aspartic acid, plus the non chiral amino acid -aminobutyric acid are separated in less than 20 min with high efficiency (up to 720, 000 plates/m) and good sensitivity (LODs lower than 16. 6 nM were achieved). Several D-aa were detected and quantified in balsamic, sherry, white wine, and <b>cider</b> <b>vinegars</b> using this MEKC-LIF procedure, observing interesting differences in their L- and D-aa profiles and contents.
