40|$|Purpose: Present {{work was}} aimed at {{developing}} welding technology applicable for hot and <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>strips</b> made of high alloy martensitic steels. Electron beam (EB) and TIG welding processes parameters were worked out for strips of the 2 N 11 K 13 H 3 M, N 19 M 4 T, H 11 N 10 M 2 T and PH 13 - 8 steel grades (unconventional maraging and precipitation hardening stainless steel grades). Design/methodology/approach: The heats of the steels were laboratory vacuum melted, forged and then hot and <b>cold</b> <b>rolled.</b> Welding process parameters were experimentally selected. Quality of the welds was evaluated by several non-destructive techniques and metallographic examination. Hardness distribution and tensile properties of welded strips were analyzed, and {{post weld heat treatment}} was proposed. Findings: All four steel grades studied were suitable for the electron beam welding and optimum process parameters were worked out for the 3 mm strips. The suitability of the steels to welding using the TIG process was tested with 1. 5 mm strips. Apart from the high cobalt maraging steel, which was not available in the form of thin strips, the other steels were welded successfully in TIG process. After welding, strength of the steels could be largely restored by full heat treatment. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed on weld microstructure evolution, affected by welding processes, to improve fracture properties of welds. Practical implications: Welding technology of the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>strips</b> of the four steel grades, high alloy martensitic grade, was developed, which along with very high mechanical properties and ductile fracture modes, make the steels suitable for advanced structural applications.

The maximum corrosion depth of cold-rolled strip is 94. 8 µm. Annealing treatment can effectively reduce the corrosion depth of alloy.

The corrosion depth of samples annealed at 600 ℃ and 680 ℃ drops from 64. 45 µm to 56. 32 µm respectively. Aluminum content in the alloy also affects the corrosion resistance of the alloy, because oxygen oxidizes aluminum to density Al 2 O 3 film which prevents the further corrosion of the alloy.

The fatigue testing of all the grades was conducted in the VHCF regime using an ultrasonic fatigue testing equipment operating at 20 kHz. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the fracture surfaces revealed {{the presence of a}} microstructure controlled initial growth of short fatigue cracks in all the tested grades. Fracture surfaces of the failed specimens of a high strength martensitic steel grade revealed the typical fine granular area (FGA) within the fish-eye area around the internal inclusions. Fatigue crack initiation in the <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>strip</b> duplex stainless steel grade occurred at surface defects left over by the cold rolling process of this grade.

A similar study on hot rolled plate duplex stainless steel grades, 2304 SRG and LDX 2101, revealed the presence of an initial crystallographic growth region (CGR) in which crack growth direction is changed by microstructural barriers such as phase and grain boundaries.

Texture development from strip casting through to cold rolling and subsequent annealing was therefore studied. Cast strips of two types were produced by solidification into the dual (delta ferrite + gamma austenite) phase and single (delta ferrite) phase domains. The { 001 }⟨uvw⟩ delta ferrite texture is converted into the { 001 }⟨uvw⟩ gamma final texture in the first steel, while most of it transforms into the fcc { 011 }⟨uvw⟩ fiber in the second. The observed variant selection can be explained using the Bain strain model. The cast strips and a hot <b>rolled</b> <b>strip</b> were subsequently <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> and annealed. The gamma-to-alpha' deformation-induced transformation took place during cold rolling and low symmetry rolling textures were produced in the (delta ferrite + austenite) steel after 50 % reduction by cold rolling.
