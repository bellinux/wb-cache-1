50|$|The {{machinery}} for projecting and withdrawing the {{torpedo tube}} {{consists of a}} couple of chain drums worked by gearing which is driven by a rotary engine made by Root, New York, NY. One of these drums is placed in the tank or reservoir in the bows of the vessel, and the chain from it is used for hauling in the tube. In order to prevent the chain from overriding on the drum, it is guided by passing through a suitable block which, as the drum revolves, is moved transversely along the drum and deposits the chain in regular coils. The transverse movement of the guiding block is given by a screwed spindle which has a pinion fixed on it gearing into a spur wheel on the <b>chain</b> <b>drum.</b> The hauling out of the torpedo carrier is effected by means of a chain attached to its inner end and led to the second <b>chain</b> <b>drum</b> which is placed above and slightly abaft the tank, as shown in Fig. 2. The arrangement adopted for guiding the chain is the same in this case as in that of the hauling-in drum. Each drum is loose upon its shaft, but is capable of being connected to it by a clutch, the two clutches being connected by levers {{so that they can be}} thrown into gear alternately. The tube can be run in and out by the machinery we have described at the rate of from 8 to 12 double strokes per minute.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to demonstrate the possibility of replacing the materials of domestic and foreign production currently used for <b>chain</b> <b>drums</b> with alternative materials. ADIs were selected as materials that may replace the cast steels used so far. L 35 GSM cast steel, commonly used for mining chain wheels and austempered ductile iron, conforming with the requirements of EN-GJS- 1400 - 1 quality grade were subjected to wear tests. On the basis of the experimental studies it has been observed that for almost all the combinations of destructive factors considered, the ADI in question was characterised by a wear resistance better than that in the case of the L 35 GSM cast steel used so far. In addition, it has been found that the ADI has favourable features predestining it for use in the production of <b>chain</b> <b>drums</b> for armoured-face conveyors...|$|R

In fast-flowing currents or when there were problems lifting the chain due to silting or obstacles on the riverbed such as large rocks, the boat could swing off-course markedly and list to one side. As a result, on later chain boats, the chain drive was always located in the middle of the boat.|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} {{currently used}} for the fabrication of toothed wheels, gear couplings and <b>chain</b> <b>drums</b> involves the induction hardening process or hardening and tempering after carburising.
