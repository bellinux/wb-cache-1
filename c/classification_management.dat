The present study aimed to examine trauma nurses' knowledge about pressure ulcer prevention, <b>classification</b> and <b>management.</b> Methods: In a cross sectional exploratory study all qualified registered nurses working with trauma patients in the emergency department (ED) of Kashani and Bahonar hospitals, Iran were invited to participate. To assess the nurses' knowledge about pressure ulcer prevention <b>classification</b> and <b>management</b> Pieper's Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Test (PPUKT) was used. Results: Of 185 eligible nurses, 159 participated in the study (response rate of 86). Of these, 80. 5 (n= 128) were women and 19. 5 (n= 31) were men. The mean years of nurses' experience was 10. 3. ±. 7. 2. years. The percentage of correctly answered questions was 64. 6. Nurses had the highest level of knowledge in the section about wound characteristics (77. 3) and the lowest level in the section about pressure ulcer onset (57).

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} <b>classification</b> and <b>management</b> of {{non-performing}} loans between Islamic banks in Malaysia and conventional {{banks in the}} UK and Japan. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate if there are differences in the <b>classification</b> and <b>management</b> of non-performing loans in Islamic banks as a result of the existence of the Investment Account Depositors (IADs). The nature of profit and sharing loss agreement has made the position of IADs in an Islamic bank unique. This uniqueness, however, has posed some degree of risk where in case the bank incurs a loss, the IADs are liable to share this loss. This has made the investment of IADs very risky and is subject to the potential problem of asymmetric information. This paper finds that the Islamic banks define and manage their non-performing loans differently from the conventional banks in the UK and Japan. The analysis shows that even though Islamic banks have special characteristics, the <b>classification</b> and <b>management</b> of its non-performing loans are quite lenient. This is evidenced in the way non-performing loans are defined, the way loss provision is made and the level of disclosure made by an Islamic bank. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is often}} detected {{at a relatively}} late stage when tumour size prohibits curative surgery. Screening to detect HCC {{at an early stage}} is performed for patients at risk. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare prospectively the diagnostic accuracy and <b>classification</b> for <b>management</b> of the two state of the art secondline imaging techniques: triphasic spiral computer tomography (CT) and super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients: Sixty one patients were evaluated between January 1996 and January 1998. Patients underwent CT and MRI within a mean interval of 6. 75 days. Methods: CT and MRI were evaluated blindly for the presence and number of lesions, characterisation of these lesions, and <b>classification</b> for <b>management.</b> For comparison of the data on characterisation, the CT and MRI findings were compared with histopathological studies of the surgical of specimens and/or follow up imaging. Data of patients not lost to follow up were available to January 2001. Results: SPIO enhanced MRI detected more lesions and overall smaller lesions than triphasic spiral CT (number of lesions 189 v 124; median diameter 1. 0 v 1. 8 cm; Spearman rank's correlation coefficient 0. 63, p < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in accuracy between CT and MRI for lesion characterisation. The agreement in <b>classification</b> for <b>management</b> was very good (weighted kappa 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 99). Conclusion: SPIO enhanced MRI detects more and smaller lesions, but both techniques are comparable in terms of <b>classification</b> for <b>management.</b> SPIO enhanced MRI may be preferred as there is no exposure to ionising radiatio...|$|R

Lastly, it suggests that the application of semantic enablers in the context of Content Management Systems can provide the means for better information organization and retrieval as well as enhanced machine interoperability...|$|E
