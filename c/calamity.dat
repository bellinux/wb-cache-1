5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the <b>Calamity</b> {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the <b>Calamity</b> from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the <b>Calamity</b> along with the credits.

5|$|The severe {{flooding}} on Siargao Island led to {{the issuance}} {{of a state of}} <b>calamity.</b> In addition to the state of <b>calamity</b> in Siargao Island, 16 villages within Cagayan de Oro City were declared <b>calamity</b> areas. In the wake of Auring, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) provided family food packets and assistance to flooded areas, valued at PHP372,760 ($8,120USD).

40|$|<b>Calamities</b> such {{as extreme}} {{droughts}} and trade or infrastructure breakdowns potentially hamper {{the continuity of}} individual food companies, {{as well as the}} continuity of food supply in Europe at large. There is a lack of insight into food companies’ resilience in case of cumulative <b>calamities</b> or <b>calamities</b> that did not happen before in recent history. In this context, an expert elicitation study among feed and food companies in the Netherlands was undertaken. Results show that lengthy or structural unavailability of electricity and a lengthy crisis of road transport are perceived as the most threatening <b>calamities.</b> Outcomes also show a relatively limited implementation of BCM (business continuity management) at company level. Complete BCM programs for top- 3 <b>calamities</b> perceived to threaten the continuity of food supply in Europe are reported by 0 % to 30 % of the companies. For <b>calamities</b> perceived to be important for business continuity this is between 20 % and 40 %. In the field of risk management a leading role is attributed to the public sector for improving international governance and setting up a so-called masterplan with measures such as larger raw-materials stocks and broad sourcing. Findings suggest that further actions are needed, starting with prioritised <b>calamities</b> and the design of a masterplan. Yet, stakeholders are also urged to pro-actively “think the unthinkable...|$|R
