For example, the cover bids might contain prices that are uncompetitive in relation to the prices submitted by the conspirator who is designated to win the contract, or alternatively, the cover bids might contain conditions that the conspirators know will be unacceptable to the agency calling for the bids.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of using the Moran’s I statistic to detect <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding</b> on public contracts. The test is applied to data concerning the so-called Swedish asphalt cartel, which was discovered in 2001. Using information on submitted bids and procurement characteristics for both the cartel period (1995 – 2001) and the post-cartel period (2003 – 2009), the Moran’s I correctly predicts <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding</b> behavior for linear and quadratic specifications when such behavior is likely to exist, and rejects such behavior when it’s unlikely to be present. Remarkably, the Moran’s I also correctly indicates and rejects <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding</b> {{on the basis of}} information on the separate bids alone...|$|E

Through careful analysis of bidding behaviors in the Dallas-Ft. Worth (DFW) school-milk industry, I find that cooperation based on rationality and repetition satisfies the conditions for a kind of Folk Theorem. The data also strongly suggest that all major milk processors are engaged in <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding</b> to allocate consumers geographically and command statistically significant incumbency premia in their incumbent districts. Even if the equilibrium outcomes are largely non-cooperative, some pieces of circumstantial evidence uncovered in this school-milk market study may be sufficiently convincing to enable dispensing with evidence of actual communication. Key words: Non-cooperative tacit collusion, <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding,</b> incumbency premium, antitrust policy. JEL Citation Index: C 7, L 1, L 4. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{exposure}} problem appears whenever {{an agent}} with <b>complementary</b> valuations <b>bids</b> {{to acquire a}} bundle of items sold sequentially, in independent auctions. In this letter, we review a possible solution that can help solve this problem, which involves selling options for the items, instead of the items themselves. We provide {{a brief overview of}} the state of the art in this field and discuss, based on recent results presented in [Mous et. al. 2008], under which conditions using option mechanisms would be desirable for both buyers and sellers, by comparison to direct auctioning of the items. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of further research directions in this field...|$|R
40|$|In many multi-unit auctions, bidders ’ valuations for a {{particular}} good depend {{on whether or not}} they also win the auction for another good. In these environments, the auctioneer can allow bidders to reflect these complementarities through additional bidding mechanisms. This paper studies the welfare effects of one such mechanism: “complex bids, ” a <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding</b> procedure used in wholesale electricity auctions that allows companies to specify a minimum revenue threshold for the day. Complex bids allow generating companies to explicitly link their valuations across different hours of the day, which would not be possible in an otherwise uniform price auction. The welfare implications of introducing such bidding procedures are ambiguous. Allowing for greater flexibility has the potential of improving the efficiency in the market, but also gives bidders an additional dimension through which they may exert market power. I develop a model of complex bidding and estimate its structural parameters {{in the context of the}} Spanish electricity market. I then perform a counterfactual analysis in which the original mechanism is compared to one in which complex bids are not allowed. I find that, while firms do exercise market power through complex bids, the positive coordination benefit...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I explore {{issues related}} to energy and {{environmental}} markets. In the first chapter, I examine the benefits of <b>complementary</b> <b>bidding</b> mechanisms used in electricity auctions. I develop a model of complex bidding and estimate its structural parameters {{in the context of}} the Spanish electricity market. I then perform a counterfactual analysis in which the original mechanism is compared to one in which complex bids are not allowed. I find that, while firms do exercise market power through complex bids, the positive coordination benefits of complex bidding dominate. In the second chapter, I explore the impacts of cap-and-trade in the Spanish electricity market, quantifying the rate at which firms internalized the costs of the emissions as well as the rate at which they passed it through. I find evidence that supports a full internalization rate at the firm-level, which results in a partial pass-through due to both demand and supply factors. Finally, in chapter 3, in joint work with Meredith Fowlie and Stephen Ryan, we explore the long run dynamic implications of subjecting an imperfectly competitive industry to market-based pollution regulation. Using two decades of panel data on the US Portland cement industry, we estimate a fully dynamic model of firms' strategic entry, exit, production, and investment decisions. We then use the model to simulate counterfactual outcomes under three general classes of allocation regimes: auctioning, grandfathering, and contingent updating. We find that the imposition of a carbon trading program would lead to large social losses at low to medium carbon prices. by Mar Reguant Ridó. Thesis (Ph. D.)
