40|$|Boreal peatlands, a {{major source}} of {{atmospheric}} CH 4, are characterized by a rapidly fluctuating water table position and meter-scale variations in relief. Regional and ecosystem-based studies show that water table position generally controls CH 4 emission from boreal peatlands by influencing the relative extent of the zones of CH 4 oxidation and production within the peat profile. We used a combined field and laboratory study to assess the influence of local hydrology on the short-term dynamics of CH 4 production, oxidation, and emission from sites in an Alaskan boreal peatland that were characterized by temporarily (site LB 1 A) and permanently (LB 2) water-saturated subsurface peat during the thaw season. The two sites contrasted sharply with respect to the dynamics of CH 4 cycling. Site LB 1 A, which showed low CH 4 concentrations in pore water (< 2 μM) and unsaturated peat (< 2. 6 nM), consumed both atmospheric CH 4 and CH 4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone for a net flux of - 0. 9 mg CH 4 m - 2 d - 1. In contrast, LB 2 had pore water CH 4 concentrations, 300 μM and emitted CH 4 at 69 mg m - 2 d - 1. Roughly 55 % of the CH 4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone at LB 2 was oxidized in transit to the peat surface. Methane oxidation potentials (V(ox)) were maximum in the 10 -cm zone immediately above the local water table at both sites but were greater on a dry mass (dw) basis at LB 2 (498 - 650 <b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 g(dw) - 1 h - 1) than at LB 1 A (220 - 233 <b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 g(dw) - 1 h - 1). Methane production potentials (V(p)) were low (< 2 <b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 g(dw) - 1 h - 1) at LB 1 A, but the maximum at LB 2 (139 <b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 g(dw) - 1 h - 1) was spatially coupled with the maximum V(ox). Methanogens exposed to O 2 produced no CH 4 in a subsequent 48 h anoxic incubation, whereas methanotrophs incubated anoxically oxidized CH 4 vigorously within 20 h of return to an oxic environment, indicating that the former are more sensitive than the latter to adverse O 2 conditions. Experiments with 14 CH 4 showed that ˜ 71 % of assimilated 14 CH 4 was respired as 14 CO 2.

Furthermore, in urethral epithelial cells, the min and oxyR mutants induced the release of proinflammatory cytokines like IL 6 and IL 8 to levels similar to that induced by the parental strain.

Live plants were mainly from the Dipterocarpaceae family whilst leaf litter samples were representative mixtures of different plant species. Environmental parameters, including photosynthetically active radiation, total solar radiation and air temperature, were also recorded. The dominant factor determining magnitude of methyl halide fluxes from living plants was plant species, with specimens of the genus Shorea showing persistent high emissions of both gases, e. g.

Fluxes of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O {{as well as the}} 15 N enrichment of the N 2 O were measured. Denitrifying Enzyme Activity (DEA), total denitrification (N 2 + N 2 O) and N 2 -to-N 2 O ratios were quantified in separate experiments. Over the 57 day incubation, N 2 O fluxes averaged 0. 090 ng N 2 O-N g − 1 h − 1 under ambient and 0. 083 ng N 2 O-N g − 1 h − 1 under elevated CO 2 (not significantly different). The N 2 O production processes were identified by a two-source model. Results showed that N 2 O must have also been produced by a third source – possibly related to organic N transformation – which was stimulated by elevated CO 2. Soil CO 2 fluxes were approximately 20 % higher under elevated CO 2 than soil from ambient but the differences were not significant.

CO 2 did not have any significant effect on DEA while total denitrification and N 2 -to-N 2 O ratios increased by 36 and 33 %, respectively.

40|$|Methane, {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas, is produced or consumed by microorganisms in soil, depending on soil conditions. In general, anaerobic conditions promote activity of methanogenic Archaea, whereas aerobic conditions promote methane consumption by methanotrophic bacteria. Earthworms {{may have an}} effect on methane flux in soil by altering soil pore space, aeration, moisture content, and organic carbon availability, all of which affect the activities of methanogens and methanotrophs. As the range of European and Asian earthworm species expands throughout the United States, their potential effects on methane flux may have global implications. My research focused on the effects of earthworms on methane flux in temperate pastures and on the potential mechanisms involved. In November, 2009, I established 24 experimental plots each at Peckham Farm (PF), Kingston, and at the W. Alton Jones (WAJ) campus of the University of Rhode Island, West Greenwich, both in southern Rhode Island. Three treatments (n= 8) were implemented: (i) earthworms removed (D−), (ii) earthworms removed, counted and returned to the plot (D+), and (iii) undisturbed (U). Weekly methane flux measurements were made from April to November, 2010. Soil moisture and temperature were continually recorded. Methane flux measurements were also made three times over a 24 -h period at each site to quantify diurnal patterns. I also conducted a second experiment {{to examine the relationship between}} earthworm population size and soil properties, and methane flux that did not disturb the soil. I determined methane flux in these supplemental plots at seven randomly selected locations in an area of the field adjacent to the manipulated plot experiment. Once gas sampling was completed, I sampled the soil under each chamber for pH, organic matter content, NH 4 and NO 3 concentrations, soil moisture, and soil temperature. Earthworms were counted, weighed and identified. I also examined the potential effects of earthworms on acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and on methane oxidation, using cast, burrow, and bulk soil from soils inoculated with Anecic and epi-endogeic earthworms, the two most common earthworm ecological groups found at the research sites, and a control soil. Soil from bulk, burrow or casts was transferred to microcosms with conditions manipulated to favor only one of the three processes—methane oxidation, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, or acetoclastic methanogenesis. Microcosms were periodically sampled for methane concentration in the headspace to determine process rates. Mean (± s. d.) methane flux (<b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 -C/m 2 /sec) in the U treatment plots ranged from - 98 ± 6 to - 20 ± 9 at PF and - 42 ± 7 to 2 ± 5 at WAJ. Methane flux in the D- treatment plots ranged from - 95 ± 13 to - 14 ± 11 at PF and - 46 ± 11 to - 4 ± 4 at WAJ. Mean methane flux in the D+ treatment plots ranged from - 73 ± 12 to - 14 ± 12 at PF and - 38 ± 7 to - 8 ± 5 at WAJ. Analysis of the data using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed no overall difference in methane flux among the three treatments at PF. On two out of a total 27 sampling dates, there was significantly higher methane consumption (more negative flux) in D- than in D+ treatments. Furthermore, on three out of 27 sampling dates the D- treatment had significantly lower methane consumption than the D+ treatment. However, no there were no significant differences among treatments in earthworm population density or biomass at the end of the experiment. By contrast, there was a significant overall difference in methane flux among treatments at the WAJ site, although there were no significant difference in earthworm population densities or biomass among treatments at the end of the experiment. Net methane consumption was significantly higher in D- than in D+ treatments on seven out of a total of 26 sampling dates. The results from WAJ support the hypothesis that plots with earthworms removed should have higher net methane consumption than plots with earthworms, whereas results from PF suggest no effect from earthworm removal on methane flux. This suggests that the effect of earthworms on methane flux may be site-specific, contingent upon factors not quantified in this experiment. For the supplemental plots, mean (± s. d.) methane flux (<b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 -C/m 2 /sec) ranged from - 80 ± 15 to - 17 ± 4 at PF and - 40 ± 18 to - 14 ± 3 at WAJ. There was no apparent relation between methane flux and earthworm population density or mass for either site. Population densities of earthworms ranged from 10 ind. /m 2 on 19 August to 103 ind. /m 2 on 7 October at PF, and from 36 ind. /m 2 on 14 October to 132 ind. /m 2 on 17 June at WAJ. Using a backward-elimination stepwise multiple regression analysis I examined methane flux as a function of earthworm population density and soil properties - moisture, temperature, pH, O. M. content, NH 4, NO 3, and sampling date - as well as other earthworm parameters besides earthworm population density, including mass, ecological group, and life stage (juvenile or adult). Results showed no relation between methane flux and any earthworm parameter for either site. The microcosm experiments yielded evidence for an effect of earthworms on methane dynamics. A one-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak all-pairwise comparison showed that the anecic cast treatment had a significantly lower methane oxidation rate than all other treatments in soil from both sites for 80...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic and {{geothermal}} systems emit endogenous gases by widespread degassing from soils, including CH 4, {{a greenhouse}} gas 25 times as potent as CO 2. Recently, {{it has been}} demonstrated that volcanic/geothermal soils act as source, but also as biological filter for methane release to the atmosphere. For long time, volcanic/geothermal soils has been considered inhospitable for methanotrophic microorganisms, but new extremophile methanotrophs belonging to Verrucomicrobia were identified in three different areas (Pozzuoli, Italy; Hell’s Gate, New Zealand; Kamchatka, Russia), explaining anomalous behaviours in methane leakages of several geothermal/volcanic sites. Our aim was to increase {{the knowledge of the}} relationship between methane emissions from volcanic/geothermal areas and biological methane oxidation, by investigating a geothermal site of Pantelleria island (Italy). Pantelleria Island hosts a high enthalpy geothermal system characterized by high temperature, high CH 4 and very low H 2 S fluxes. Such characteristics are reflected in potentially great supply of methane for methanotrophs and scarce presence of inhibitors of their activity (H 2 S and NH 3) in the Pantelleria soils. Potential methanotrophic activity within these soils was already evidenced by the CH 4 /CO 2 ratio of the flux measurements which was lower than that of the respective fumarolic manifestations indicating a loss of CH 4 during the gas travel towards the earth’s surface. In this study laboratory incubation experiments using soils sampled at Favara Grande, the main hydrothermal area of Pantelleria, showed very high methane consumption rates (up to 9500 <b>ng</b> <b>CH</b> 4 h 1 g 1). Furthermore, microbiological and culture-independent molecular analyses allowed to detect the presence of methanotrophs affiliated to Gamma- and Alpha-Proteobacteria and to the newly discovered acidothermophilic methanotrophs Verrucomicrobia. Culturable methanotrophic Alpha-proteobacteria of the genus Methylocystis were isolated by enrichment cultures. The isolates showed a wide range of tolerance to pH (3. 5 – 8) and temperatures (18 – 45 C), and an average methane oxidation rate of 450 ppm/h. A larger diversity of proteobacterial and verrucomicrobial methanotrophs was detected by the amplification of the methane mono-oxygenase gene pmoA. This study demonstrates the coexistence of both the methanotrophic phyla Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria in the same geothermal site. The presence of proteobacterial methanotrophs was quite unexpected because they are generally considered not adapted to live in such harsh environments. Their presence at Favara Grande could be explained by not so low soil pH values (> 5) of this specific geothermal site and by the high methane availability. Such species could have found their niches in the shallowest part of the soils, were the temperatures are not so high, thriving on the abundant upraising methane. Understanding the ecology of methanotrophy in geothermal sites will increase our knowledge of their role in methane emissions to the atmosphere...|$|R
