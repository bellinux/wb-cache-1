To explain this empirical fact, the paper adopts a search model where firms differ in their optimal capital investment.

50|$|As {{a result}} of this {{investment}} drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33 times by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio.</b> Living standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income status to middle-income security with increased household incomes. During a National Day Rally speech in 1987, Lee Kuan-Yew claimed that (based on the home ownership criterion) 80% of Singaporeans could now be considered to be members of the middle-class. However, much unlike the economic policies of Greece and the rest of Europe, Singapore followed a policy of individualising the social safety net. This led to a higher than average savings rate and a very sustainable economy in the long run. Without a burdensome welfare state or its likeliness, Singapore has developed a very self-reliant and skilled workforce well versed for a global economy.|$|E

This study investigates the determinants of the long-run labor productivity growth model in Thailand. The findings indicate that in the short run and the long run, the changes in export-labor ratio growth and physical <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth, particularly the private capital-ratio growth, have a significantly positive effect on the labor productivity growth in Thailand. The increase in the growth rates of export-labor ratio, physical <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio,</b> and private <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> can raise the labor productivity growth. The transportation and communication <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth also has a significantly positive effect on the labor productivity growth in Thailand, but only in the long run. As for the agricultural sector, the change in physical <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth, particularly the private <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth, has a significantly positive effect on the agricultural labor productivity growth in the short run and the long run. The increase in the growth rates of physical <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> and private <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> can raise the agricultural labor productivity growth. The export-labor ratio growth also has a significantly positive effect on the agricultural labor productivity growth, but only in the long run. As for the manufacturing sector, the changes in export-labor ratio growth, public <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth, and human <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth have a significantly positive impact on the manufacturing labor productivity growth in the short run and the long run. The increase in the growth rates of export-labor ratio, public <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio,</b> and human <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> can accelerate the manufacturing labor productivity growth. The physical <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio,</b> the private <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the transportation and communication <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> also have a significantly positive impact on the manufacturing labor productivity growth, but only in the short run. However, the foreign direct equity-labor ratio growth is found to have a significantly negative impact on the manufacturing labor productivity growth. Obviously, no empirical evidence supports the positive relationship between the foreign direct investment-labor ratio growth and the labor productivity growth of the modernization hypothesis. This means that, given the lack of change in the country's fundamental economic structure, Thailand can no longer rely on foreign direct investment as a key driver to enhance its short-run and long-run labor productivity growth. In sum, the findings suggest that the model in this study is robust and flexible enough to urge the policymakers to examine the impact of physical <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> growth and export-labor ratio growth on the labor productivity growth of Thailand both in the short run and the long run...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the interrelationship between capital accumulation, fertility, and growth by introducing an endogenous fertility decision into Diamond's (1965) neoclassical growth model. Under the assumptions that children provide old age support and that individuals incur a variable time cost of raising children, it investigates {{the potential for}} cyclical fluctuations in the <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> and fertility, {{as well as for}} development trap phenomena to be observed. It is shown that when capital and labor are highly substitutable in production, there is a unique steady state equilibrium, and either damped or undamped oscillations in fertility and the <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> may occur. However, when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is less than one, two steady state equilibria may exist; one with a high <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> and a high rate of population growth, and the other with a lower <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratio</b> as well as a lower population growth rate.

40|$|Why capital {{does not}} flow more heavily into poorer {{countries}} with lower <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is a question}} that development economists have been asking for decades. Caselli and Feyrer (2007) developed adjusted marginal product of capital (MPK) models that are very similar across rich and poor countries, proving that capital is indeed allocated efficiently across the world and there are no major frictions preventing optimal allocation of capital. This paper uses updated and improved national accounts data to replicate the methodology set forth in Caselli and Feyrer (2007), testing the long-term validity of their conclusions as well as the effects of the Great Recession on international capital flows between developed and developing countries. I find that while the Great Recession negatively impacted MPKs in both rich and poor countries, capital flows and output growth have since recovered, and MPKs are still very similar across all countries.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} nonwage labor costs (for social security, pensions, {{vacation}} days, severence compensation, and the like) to {{direct wage costs}} is proportionately higher in Europe and Latin America than in Asia and Africa - largely because workers there are protected more by regulations. The distortionary growth of labor costs because of increasing nonwage costs is not common in the LDCs however. The author of this paper found that international differences in labor costs are attributable largely to differences in labor productivity and <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratios.</b> The author also found that labor costs declined significantly in almost all LDCs in the 1980 s, and {{that the impact of}} declining labor costs on manufacturing employment was statistically significant - and bodes well for the growth of nontraditional exports.

While European countries all face this challenge, the speed at which their population ages differs, and thus the pressure on <b>capital-labor</b> <b>ratios.</b> If capital markets are integrated, differences in population aging may lead to cross-country spillovers, as investors freely seek the best returns on capital.

For instance, GDP per capita would on average be 2. 9 %-points lower in Germany in each of the next 50 years if capital markets were perfectly integrated and increases in labor income taxes maintained public debt constant, compared to a closed economy case; by contrast, GDP per capita would on average be 2. 1 %-points higher in France, whose population ages slower than in Germany. I also show that pension reforms can change the cross-country redistribution patterns, some countries losing from capital market integration without the reform but winning with it.
