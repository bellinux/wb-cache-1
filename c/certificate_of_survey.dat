50|$|Shull's first {{large-scale}} {{construction project}} was a suburban development on her parents' property, {{just west of}} what is now downtown Carmel, Indiana. In 1955 Shull's parents signed a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> for the first section of a new subdivision named Christie's Thornhurst Addition. The subdivision is unusual for the exclusive use of Shull’s modern-style home designs. Most post-World War II homes, especially in more conservative areas such as central Indiana, were revival-style or simple ranch homes. To attract homebuyers to Thornhurst, especially the growing number of U.S. military veterans and their families who were eligible for low-interest loans under the G.I. Bill, Shull designed modern homes to fit Federal Housing Administration guidelines. The FHA approved Shull's plans for the first three home designs for Thornhurst, which made them eligible for FHA financing.|$|E
