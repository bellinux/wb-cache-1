It has been claimed that the execution of Earl Ferrers in 1760 – the only time a peer was hanged after trial by the House of Lords – was carried out with the normal hempen rope instead of a silk one.

2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{perhaps as a}} sign of what would come to be, Emperor Wu began to trust {{governing}} officials who were harsh in their punishment, believing that such harshness would be the most effective method to maintain social order and so placing these officials in power.

In 122 BC, Liu An, the Prince of Huainan (a previously trusted adviser of Emperor Wu, and closely enough related to have imperial pretensions) and his brother Liu Ci (劉賜), the Prince of Hengshan, were accused of plotting treason.

However, when Wood gave {{testimony}} at Bagwell's trial, identifying Gambill as the murderer without the incentive of a plea-bargain, Gambill rejected his own agreement with prosecutors and changed his story, minimizing Bagwell's role in the affair and testifying that Wood was Rich's murderer.

50|$|Since {{the federal}} {{government}} of the United States {{does not have a}} generalized police power like that of the states, the scope of its criminal statutes is necessarily circumscribed.

Consequently, Title 18 of the United States Code does not use the aforementioned culpability scheme but relies instead on more traditional definitions of crimes taken from common law. For example, malice aforethought is used as a requirement for <b>committing</b> <b>capital</b> murder.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2007, turmoil {{that had}} been {{affecting}} the mortgage markets spilled over into the leveraged finance and high-yield debt markets. The markets had been highly robust {{during the first six}} months of 2007, with highly issuer friendly developments including PIK and PIK Toggle (interest is [...] "Payable In Kind") and covenant light debt widely available to finance large leveraged buyouts. July and August saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with only few issuers accessing the market. Uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads, which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn. However, the expected rebound in the market after Labor Day 2007 did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing. By the end of September, the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including Citigroup and UBS AG announced major writedowns due to credit losses. The leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill. As 2007 ended and 2008 began, it was clear that lending standards had tightened and the era of [...] "mega-buyouts" [...] had come to an end.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. Sustainable Investors Capital (SiC) will {{capture a}} niche within the South African Private Equity {{industry}} in two ways. Firstly SiC is different {{by having a}} large network of selected members who help generate deal flow, offer their expertise if they choose in ex-post management, and who enjoy the benefit of relevant proprietary research and focused networking events. The second and main differentiating factor {{is the fact that}} the members as investors have the ability to invest on an opt-in basis. When joining SiC, members are offered the opportunity to <b>commit</b> <b>capital</b> to the Discretionary Fund. This is a fund managed by SiC in the typical private equity fashion where the member has limited to zero input in the investment decisions made. However, by <b>committing</b> <b>capital</b> to the Discretionary fund, members’ ipse facto get access to the opt-in investments made by SiC. The opt-in investments allow members to select on a deal-by-deal basis whether they want to invest or not. This has the benefit of increasing the flexibility and agility with which SiC can make investments, as well as granting the advantage to would be investors to optimise the returns on their capital which would be committed (and paying fees) but undrawn under normal private equity model circumstances. The amount that a member is allowed to invest in on an opt-in basis is directly proportional to the <b>capital</b> <b>committed</b> to the Discretionary Fund. This is done to enable SiC to actively and effectively pursue deals with the confidence that capital is available. It is reasonable to assume that the Discretionary Fund will be coinvesting with the opt-in funds...|$|R

Swaps increase debtor nations' incentives to <b>commit</b> <b>capital</b> to investments with a positive net present value.

Second, creditors require a minimum price of equity in terms of debt {{to participate in the}} swap. The swap's effects on the secondary market price of debt are examined.
