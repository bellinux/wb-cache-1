40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation</b> {{has been}} {{presented}} as a system which is able to achieve a 3 -dimensional correction of idiopathic scoliose. We performed a prospective study about the apex derotation following <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 consecutive patients with idiopathic scoliosis were included in this study. On pre- and postoperative CT scans the rotation angle relative to the sagittal plane according to Aaro and Dahiborn (RA sag) were measured the pre- and postoperative changes were evaluated with paired T-tests together with the significance. Kruskal Wallis tests were performed to correlate the mean values of those calculated changes {{with the number of}} instrumented levels and with the different King types of scoliosis. RESULTS: There was no statistical significant increase or decrease of the rotation if we consider the sag without taking into account the type of curve. DISCUSSION: The different ways to measure rotation in scoliosis are presented. The limits of the method we used (RA sag) are also discussed. We reviewed the literature concerning derotation with <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation</b> to compare it with our results. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of rotation in scoliosis is not easy. The CT scan seems to be the best method. Nevertheless, the postoperative changes of the morphology of the patient can be a factor of error in rotational measurement. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background For many years, the <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation</b> {{has been}} {{regarded}} as the standard device for the surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Nevertheless, scientific long-term results on this procedure are rare. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective follow-up study of patients treated for AIS with <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation</b> and spondylodesis. Methods A total of 40 patients with AIS underwent <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation</b> in our department within 3 [*]years and between 1990 and 1992. For the retrospective analysis, first all the patient documents were reviewed, and pre-/postoperative X-ray images {{as well as those}} at the latest follow-up were analysed. Furthermore, it was attempted to conduct a clinical survey using the SRS- 24 questionnaire, which was sent to the patients after a preceding announcement on the phone. Results Radiologically, the frontal main curvature was improved from a preoperative angle of 69. 2 ° to a postoperative angle of 35. 4 °, and the secondary curvature was improved from a preoperative angle of 42. 6 ° to a postoperative angle of 20. 5 °. The latest radiological follow-up at average 57. 4 [*]months post surgery showed an average loss of correction of 9. 6 ° (main curvature) and 4. 6 ° (secondary curvature), respectively. Within the first 30 [*]days post surgery, 3 out of 40 patients (7. 5 %) received early operative revision for the dislocation of hooks or rods. At an average of 45. 7 [*]months (range 11 to 142 [*]months), 19 out of 40 patients (47. 5 %; including 2 patients with early revision) received late operative revisions: The reasons were late infection (10 out of 40 patients; 25 %) with the development of fistulae (7 cases) or putrid secretion (3 cases), which was resolved with the complete removal of instrumentation after all. The average time until revision was 35. 5 [*]months (range 14 to 56 [*]months) after <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> Furthermore, complete implant removal was necessary in 8 out of 40 patients (20 %) for late operate site pain (LOSP). The average time until removal of instrumentation was 62. 7 months (range 18 to 146 [*]months) post surgery; and one patient received partial device removal for prominent instrumentation 11 [*]months post surgery. Altogether, only 22 out of 40 CD instrumentations (55 %) were still in situ. After an average period of 14. 3 years post surgery, it was possible to follow-up 14 out of 40 patients (35 %) using the SRS- 24 questionnaire. The average score was 93 points, without showing significant differences between patients with or without their instrumentation in situ. Conclusions Retrospectively, we documented {{for the first time a}} very high revisions rate in patients with AIS and treated by <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> Nearly half of the instrumentation had to be removed due to late infection and LOSP. The reasons for the high rate of late infections with or without fistulae and for LOSP were analysed and discussed in detail. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) Ca 2 +-ATPase is {{a member}} of the ‘P-type’ class of cation transport ATPases which form a covalent phosphorylated intermediate.

By the use of especially sensitive circular dichroism (<b>CD)</b> <b>instrumentation</b> it is shown here that Ca 2 + addition induces 5 % or 2. 5 % increases in Ca 2 +-ATPase ellipticity at 225 nm in the absence or in the presence of Mg 2 +, respectively.

The event generation mechanism is user-defined by the framework which uses CCI.

Through a simple event set grammar, the user can specify instrumentation for those events they are interested in. Moreover, the user can create new high level events from pre-existing low-level events.

40|$|In the nineties, most spinal {{surgeons}} {{supported the}} validity of segmental spine instrumentation, but this procedure has progressively been abandoned because difficult and with {{a high risk of}} neurological complications, in favor of the Cotrel-Dobousset (CD). The <b>CD</b> <b>instrumentation</b> is based on segmentation of curves, thus improving the angular correction and actuates sagittal profile. Sublaminar acrylic loops (Universal Clamp) shows the same resistance to stress as steel or titanium alloy sublaminar wires. The simple procedure and the tensioning of the strips allows re-tensioning and progressive correction. The increased contact area, improves corrective forces, thus reducing the risk of laminar fractures. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify {{the validity of}} this spinal fixation implant in the surgical treatment of a consecutive series of patients affected by neurologic scoliosis. The authors treated surgically 84 patients affected by neurologic scoliosis with an average age of 14  years (range 10 – 17). Universal Clamps associated with Socore TM spinal assembly, transpedicular lumbar screws and thoracic hooks at the upper end of the curve were used. The etiology of disease was cerebral palsy in 81 cases, Friedreich ataxia in two cases and Aicardi syndrome in one case. The average preoperative angular value was 73 ° ±  16 °. It was implanted a mean of seven Clamps for each procedure (range 5 – 9). The average percentage of correction was 72 %. Mean operative time was 240  ±  30  min with mean blood loss of 1200  ±  400  ml. No intra-operative complications occurred. Mean follow-up was 36  months. At one-year follow-up the mean loss of correction was 7 ° ±  2 ° with no re-intervention required. This is the first report on treatment of neurological scoliosis with this hybrid construct (lumbar screws, thoracic acrylic clamps, thoracic hooks at the upper end of the curve). In this group of patients the Universal Clamps technique appeared safe and effective and its mechanical performance is comparable to all-level screws construct. Furthermore, the kyphotic component can be better managed in case of thoracic lordosis. The most important aspect of this technique is a short operative time and low vascular and neurologic risks combined with a satisfying stability in the short-postoperative period. Nevertheless, it is important to value results on a long-term follow-up to analyze correction loss, pseudoarthrosis, and mechanical failure of the strips...|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{projected}} STRATO 2 <b>C</b> <b>instrumentation</b> a basic meteorological instrumentation and a dropsonde system was developed and finally installed and tested on other aircraft. The basic instrumentation was projected to consist of sensors detecting temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, and radiation quantities. Sensors like these are normally permanently installed, as the parameters they provide are needed for nearly all scientific flight missions. The sensors have been tested intensively especially regarding their ability to operate properly even in the extended altitude region up to 24 km. After that they have been installed inside a wing pylon of the high altitude research aircraft G- 520 T. In a test flight all systems worked without any failure, the temperature data of different sensors agreed quite well, and also the other data appeared to behave as expected. Adding a dropsonde measuring system to the aircraft instrumentation expands the measuring capabilities especially over inaccessible areas, where the network of radiosonde stations on the ground is fragmentary. Dropsondes work like upsondes, which are dropped from an aircraft and descent on a parachute. The receiving station and the data acquisition unit are installed on board the aircraft, therefore no ground stations are needed at all. The system built within the frame of this project has been installed and tested on the DLR meteorological research aircraft Falcon 20, and in the meantime it has been operated successfully in different research projects.

Root canals were filled and, after 6 months, the teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 groups, according to the root-filling removal technique: Group A - hand instrumentation with K-type files; Group B - reciprocating instrumentation with engine-driven K-type files; and Group <b>C</b> rotary <b>instrumentation</b> with engine-driven ProTaper system. CT scans were used to assess the volume of filling material inside the root canals before and after the removal procedure. In both moments, the area of filling material was outlined by an experienced radiologist and the volume of filling material was automatically calculated by the CT software program. Based on the volume of initial and residual filling material of each specimen, the percentage of filling material removed from the root canals by the different techniques was calculated. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and chi-square test for linear trend (?= 0. 05). No statistically significant difference (p= 0. 36) was found among the groups regarding the percent means of removed filling material. The analysis of the association between the percentage of filling material removal (high or low) and the proposed techniques by chi-square test showed statistically significant difference (p= 0. 015), as most cases in group B (reciprocating technique) presented less than 50 % of filling material removed (low percent removal). In conclusion, none of the techniques evaluated in this study was effective in providing complete removal of filling material from the root canals...|$|R

One {{of the most important}} deviations from this requirement, both in FM and direct recording modes, occurs in the area of time delay error. A method for measuring the root-mean-square time delay error (Δ) between points on a record vs their separation in playback time (T) has been described in the literature (Refs. 1 and 2), but the implications and interpretation of this technique have not been fully developed. This paper derives the theoretical relationships between the Δ-T curve and the autocorrelation function of a pure sine wave recorded on the tape, and uses this correspondence to establish a connection between jitter spectra and Δ-T curves. A simple instrument for measuring these curves with high accuracy is described, and results of measurements made on a number of intermediate-band tape units in use at the Goddard Space Flight Center are presented. These measurements show that a low-mass tape unit may be superior to high mass units by more than an order of magnitude. The utility of the Δ-T measurement technique is discussed {{on the basis of its}} direct relationship to PCM and coherent recording applications, and its value as a standard means for evaluating time delay error in magnetic tape links is described. It is also shown that the technique can be used to determine FM modulation index...|$|R
