40|$|Accurate {{mapping of}} {{temporal}} changes in urban {{land use and}} land cover (LULC) is important for monitoring urban expansion and changes in LULC, urban planning, environmental management, and environmental modeling. In this study, we present a feature-based approach of the decision tree classification (FBA-DTC) method for mapping LULC based on spectral and topographic information. Landsat 5 TM and Land 8 OLI images were employed, and the technique {{was applied to the}} coastal city of Xiamen, China. The method integrates multi-spectral features such as SAVI (soil adjustment vegetation index), NDWI (normalized water index), MNDBaI (modified normalized difference barren index), BI (brightness index), and WI (wetness index), with topographic features including DEM and slope. In addition, the new approach distinguishes between fallow land and cropland, and separates high-rise buildings from beaches and water bodies. Several of the FBA-DTC parameters (or rules) from 1997 to 2015 remained constant (i. e., DEM and slope), whereas others <b>changed</b> <b>slightly.</b> WI was <b>negatively</b> related to percent area of beach land, and BI was negatively related to percent area of arable land. The FBA-DTC method had an average user’s accuracy (UA) of 91. 36 % for built-up land, an average overall accuracy (OA) of 92. 13 %, and a Kappa coefficient (KC) of 0. 90 for the period from 2003 to 2015, representing respective increases of 15. 87 %, 10. 17 %, and 0. 13, compared with values calculated using maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Over the past 12 years, built-up land increased from 23. 67 % to 43. 17 % owing to occupation of coastal reclamation, arable land, and forest land. The FBA-DTC method presented here is a valuable technique for evaluating urban growth and changes in LULC classification for coastal cities...|$|R
