50|$|Geist and Lambin (2002) {{assessed}} 152 {{case studies}} of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion (96%), infrastructure expansion (72%), and wood extraction (67%). Therefore, according to this study, forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), <b>commercial</b> <b>wood</b> extraction (52%), permanent cultivation (48%), cattle ranching (46%), shifting (slash and burn) cultivation (41%), subsistence agriculture (40%), and fuel wood extraction for domestic use (28%).

50|$|During the {{following}} decade Vallotton painted, wrote art criticism {{and made a}} number of prints. In 1891 he executed his first woodcut, a portrait of Paul Verlaine. The many woodcuts he produced during the 1890s were recognized as innovative, and established Vallotton as a leader in the revival of true woodcut as an artistic medium. In the western world, the relief print, in the form of <b>commercial</b> <b>wood</b> engraving, had long been utilized mainly as a means to accurately reproduce drawn or painted images and, latterly, photographs. Vallotton's woodcut style was novel in its starkly reductive opposition of large masses of undifferentiated black and areas of unmodulated white. Vallotton emphasized outline and flat patterns, and generally eliminated the gradations and modeling traditionally produced by hatching. He was influenced by post-Impressionism, Symbolism, and especially by the Japanese woodcut: a large exhibition of ukiyo-e prints had been presented at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1890, and Vallotton, like many artists of his era an enthusiast of Japonism, collected these prints.|$|E

50|$|Patented by Charles A. Seely, {{this process}} {{achieves}} treatment by immersing seasoned wood in successive baths of {{hot and cold}} preservatives. During the hot baths, the air expands in the timbers. When the timbers are changed to the cold bath (the preservative can also be changed) a partial vacuum is created within the lumen of the cells, causing the preservative {{to be drawn into}} the wood. Some penetration occurs during the hot baths, but most of it takes place during the cold baths. This cycle is repeated with a significant time reduction compared to other steeping processes. Each bath may last 4 to 8 hours or in some cases longer. The temperature of the preservative in the hot bath should be between 60 to 110 C and 30 to 40 C in the cold bath (depending on preservative and tree species). The average penetration depths achieved with this process ranges from 30 to 50 mm. Both preservative oils and water-soluble salts can be used with this treatment. Due to the longer treatment periods, this method finds little use in the <b>commercial</b> <b>wood</b> preservation industry today.|$|E

The numerical results of samples weight loss showed that durability of control wood samples after one year made less than 5 % in weight losses of elm, maple, alder and horn beech. However, control samples of oak and beech had no weight losses. The treated samples not only had no weight reduction, the absorbed salts made their weight increase.
