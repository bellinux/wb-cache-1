40|$|The Rural Energy Enterprise Development (REED) {{initiative}} provides {{assistance to}} energy-related enterprises {{to prepare them}} for growth and to make eventual investments by mainstream financial partners less risky. This study assesses the <b>non-financial</b> <b>returns</b> of a number of REED-type enterprises and provides guidance for the selection and ongoing evaluation of these enterprises within the context of development interventions. This study concludes that desired development outcomes should provide the basis for programme objectives against which <b>non-financial</b> <b>returns</b> can be measured. However, qualitative information is also necessary, as the context within which an enterprise operates largely defines the importance of these returns. Further work to improve the understanding of this context is necessary prior {{to the development of a}} formalised monitoring programme. Limitations of the assessment process should be recorded and addressed through the ongoing review of the programme, other monitoring efforts and further research...|$|R

30|$|The {{search and}} {{matching}} theories provide the theoretical foundation for this study; they apply {{not only to}} the search for a first job, but to subsequent job changes as well. According to these theories, individuals try to find a job that matches their preferences and abilities as closely as possible in order to maximize the financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>returns</b> of work. Employers, too, are looking for the optimal match between post and employee for the same reasons (Scherer 2005 : 428). However, potential employees have only limited information about the labor market (Jovanovic 1979 : 973) so every job search involves investing money, time and other resources, hence job searches have costs (Wilde 1981 : 1124). These costs rise with the effort made but are also positively correlated with the number of posts considered. According to the theory, individuals will search as long as the expected returns of the search exceed the costs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} returns to lifelong learning, which is {{interpreted}} as the attainment of qualifications following entry into the labour market. For {{a number of reasons}} our analysis of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) represents an important addition to the existing evidence base. We allow for financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>returns</b> to lifelong learning by using as dependent variables both (i) hourly earnings and (ii) CAMSIS score. A fixed effects specification counters the potential biases that arise from unobserved individual heterogeneity and the inclusion of lags allows estimation of how the returns to lifelong learning evolve over a ten year period after the qualification is obtained. We find evidence of earnings and occupation status returns using a broad categorisation of lifelong learning for both men and women, but more variability in returns when disaggregated NVQ-equivalent categories of qualification are considered. Our findings are broadly in line with existing evidence within the UK, which is mostly based on the analysis of cohort studies. 0 f particular interest is the finding that returns to women materialise much sooner after the attainment of a qualification, than is the case for their male counterparts.
