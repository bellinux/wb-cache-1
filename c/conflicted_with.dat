40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relation}} between parent-child conflicts and parental support during early adolescence and anxiety symptoms of adolescents during middle adolescence. This study also examined whether these associations differ for fathers and mothers. Methods: In this longitudinal design 497 Dutch adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (M age T 1 = 13, 03; 56, 7 % boys and 43, 3 % girls) participated. This study consisted of 6 waves and adolescents completed two questionnaires about the degree of parental support and <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> fathers (M age T 1 = 46, 74) and mothers (M age T 1 = 44, 41) and their anxiety. The majority of the adolescents lived in medium or high social economic groups (87, 7 %). Results: The hierarchical regression analyses showed that <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> fathers over time was significantly and positively related to anxiety symptoms in both adolescent boys and girls. A positive significant relation was found between <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> mothers and anxiety symptoms of girls. Regarding parent-child <b>conflicts,</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> fathers was more important in the relation to anxiety symptoms contrary to <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> mothers. Parental support of both fathers and mothers was not associated with anxiety symptoms of adolescents. Conclusion: <b>Conflict</b> <b>with</b> fathers during early adolescence can play an important role in the development of anxiety problems during middle adolescence in both boys and girls. <b>Conflict</b> <b>with</b> mothers during early adolescence predicted especially anxiety symptoms in girls during middle adolescence. This present study suggests that <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> fathers during adolescence may not be underestimated...|$|R

In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power.

40|$|In {{the present}} context of {{organizational}} {{changes and the}} inevitable <b>conflicts</b> coming <b>with</b> these changes, worker representatives are confronted with new challenges in negotiation. Worker representatives act as mediator in organizational conflicts between management and employees. New and complex issues and growing diversity in constituents can increase stress of worker representatives. On the basis of models of interpersonal conflict at work (e. g. Frone, 2000), we analyze the relation between frequency and severity of <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> management and co-workers, and burnout. Thus, we hypothesize that: a.) frequency and intensity of <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> management and with co-workers are positively related with burn out; b) This effect is stronger for <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> co-workers (in-group), compared <b>with</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> management (out-group); c.) <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> co-workers plays a moderator effect in the relation between <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> management and burnout. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 719 Spanish worker representatives using multiple regression analysis. Results confirm our three main hypotheses and show that <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the constituency affects more strongly the perceived burnout by worker representatives. Based on organizational psychology and sociological theories we discuss different reasons that justify these results. Studying predictors from burnout in worker representatives contribute to promote the well-being {{in the practice of}} their role. We put into practice improvement strategies through knowledge transfer and action plans which can help to improve the role of worker representatives in the new industrial relations context. status: publishe...|$|R
