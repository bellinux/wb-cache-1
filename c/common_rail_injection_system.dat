In both <b>systems</b> the <b>injection</b> {{pressure}} has been increased to 1800 bar. This higher injection pressure, associated with new piezo-electric injectors {{in which each}} nozzle is equipped with seven apertures (instead of five previously), allows the number of injections to be multiplied (potentially up to six per cycle) and ensures meticulous uniformity of the diesel injection spray pattern. As {{a result of this}} optimised air/diesel mix, combustion is more complete and more uniform, and therefore reduces emissions at source.|$|R

5000|$|Based on his {{research}} at Macquarie Graduate School of Management, Captain Bethune {{set out to}} prove that hydrocarbon fuels could be replaced by sustainable bio-fuels. He had Earthrace designed by LOMOcean Design and built in order to break the world record for a circumnavigation of the globe by a powerboat in hopes that it would {{call attention to the}} viability of biodiesel as an alternative fuel. He mortgaged his New Zealand home and financed the building in the hopes of recouping the expenses from sponsorship. He declined a $4 million sponsorship from a company that would have required them to use regular diesel.His first attempt began in Barbados on 10 March 2007. He encountered significant delays due to issues with the propellers and other mechanical problems. On the night of 19 March, while around 22 km offshore from Guatemala, Earthrace collided with a local fishing boat. The crew was absolved of any responsibility after a 10-day investigation during which they were held in custody under armed guard in the military compound in Puerto Quetzal. The delays prevented them from completing the circumnavigation in record time using their original start location. The crew took Earthrace to San Diego where they made repairs. They then restarted their record attempt, leaving San Diego on 7 April 2007. Once they rounded Aceh in Indonesia and started crossing the Indian Ocean the vessel encountered significant bad weather in the first monsoon of the season. The monsoon remained with them all the way to Salalah in Oman. The vessel passed through the Suez Canal, then when getting close to Spain, crew discovered a structural failure around the depth transducer. Bethune said the [...] "failure was a result of the constant pounding in crossing the Indian Ocean". Crew made temporary repairs and headed out to cross the Atlantic, however the repairs failed and Earthrace limped back to port in Málaga, Spain. Bethune decided to abandon the attempt.Captain Bethune returned to New Zealand to recover from what he said was [...] "a brutal ordeal". After meeting with some of his original sponsors, he assembled a new team. The vessel was repaired and departed from Sagunto, Spain, in another record attempt on 1 March 2008. The second record attempt also suffered a large number of setbacks. The auto-pilot system failed in the Atlantic crossing. This was repaired in Puerto Rico. There was a general strike in Panama Canal causing 3 days in delays waiting to transit the canal. In the leg between Hawaii and Marshall Islands, there was a problem with the <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> which was repaired in Majuro. The crew then had their biggest setback in Palau, when Earthrace hit a submerged log a few nautical miles offshore. The vessel limped back into Palau with extensive damage. A list of problems included a bent driveshaft, propeller damage, smashed P-Bracket, smashed engine mounts, broken gearbox, rudder damage, and a 5 meter gouge down the starboard side of the composite hull. Crew determined it would be almost impossible to repair the vessel quickly in Palau. They made temporary repairs and ran on one engine to Singapore. On arrival, the initial assessment was repairs would take at least 2 weeks, which would make the record almost impossible to get. Marine salvage company Posh Semco offered to help with haul-out, and the vessel was pulled from the water. Crew worked around the clock for 3 days. Earthrace was put back into the water with what Captain Bethune described as [...] "the ugliest composite repair" [...] he'd ever seen. Crew continued on their voyage towards their finish line in Spain. Captain Bethune finished at the Spanish port of Sagunto on 27 June. The journey was completed in 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes, beating the former record by over two weeks. Captain Bethune later confessed the reason they missed the record on the first attempt was his leadership was poor. He said the real difference in the second successful attempt was he did a better job in making decisions and running the team. He also claimed his team had been outstanding in Singapore. They had achieved a small miracle in getting Earthrace repaired so quickly, in very challenging circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> use high {{pressures}} to pump the fuel, even if at these conditions the liquid viscosity increases substantially over atmospheric levels. For the proper operation of these <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> {{the knowledge of}} fuels high-pressure viscosities becomes crucial to optimize the engine performance. This work reports new experimental data of high-pressure viscosities for three biodiesels (soybean, rapeseed and their binary mixture) measured at temperatures from 293. 15 K to 393. 15 K and pressures from atmospheric up to 140 MPa, and proposes a correlation capable of describing the experimental data. The predictions results are excellent for the biodiesels studied, presenting overall average relative deviations (OARD) of only 3. 9 % in the entire ranges of pressures and temperatures studied. This correlation was also extended to describe the viscosities of biodiesels mixtures with diesel with an OARD of just 3. 3 %. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
