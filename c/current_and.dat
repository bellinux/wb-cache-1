40|$|Totally {{symmetric}} arbitrary spin {{fields in}} AdS space, conformal fields, conformal <b>currents,</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields in flat space are studied. Light-cone formulation for such fields, <b>currents,</b> <b>and</b> shadows is obtained. Use of the Poincare parametrization of AdS space {{allows us to}} treat fields in flat and AdS spaces on equal footing. Light-cone gauge realization of relativistic symmetries for fields, <b>currents,</b> <b>and</b> shadows is also obtained. The light-cone formulation for fields is obtained by using the gauge invariant Lagrangian which is presented {{in terms of the}} modified de Donder divergence, while the light-cone formulation for <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadows is obtained by using gauge invariant approach to <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadows. This allows us to demonstrate explicitly how ladder operators entering the gauge invariant formulation of fields, <b>currents,</b> <b>and</b> shadows manifest themselves in the light-cone formulation for fields, <b>currents,</b> <b>and</b> shadows.

40|$|Conformal totally {{symmetric}} arbitrary spin <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow {{fields in}} flat space-time of dimension {{greater than or}} equal to four are studied. Gauge invariant formulation for such <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields is developed. Gauge symmetries are realized by involving the Stueckelberg fields. Realization of global conformal boost symmetries is obtained. Gauge invariant differential constraints for <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields are obtained. AdS/CFT correspondence for <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields and the respective normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of massless totally symmetric arbitrary spin AdS fields is studied. The bulk fields are considered in modified de Donder gauge that leads to decoupled equations of motion. We demonstrate that leftover on-shell gauge symmetries of bulk fields correspond to gauge symmetries of boundary <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields, while the modified de Donder gauge conditions for bulk fields correspond to differential constraints for boundary conformal <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields. Breaking conformal symmetries, we find interrelations between the gauge invariant formulation of the <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields and the gauge invariant formulation of massive fields.

40|$|Conformal low-spin {{anomalous}} <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow {{fields in}} flat space-time of dimension {{greater than or}} equal to four are studied. Gauge invariant formulation for such <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields is developed. Gauge symmetries are realized by involving Stueckelberg and auxiliary fields. Gauge invariant differential constraints for anomalous <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields and realization of global conformal symmetries are obtained. Gauge invariant two-point vertices for anomalous shadow fields are also obtained. In Stueckelberg gauge frame, these gauge invariant vertices become the standard two-point vertices of CFT. Light-cone gauge two-point vertices of the anomalous shadow fields are derived. AdS/CFT correspondence for anomalous <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> shadow fields and the respective normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of massive low-spin AdS fields is studied. The bulk fields are considered in modified de Donder gauge that leads to decoupled equations of motion.
