50|$|Attacking {{with the}} weapon usually entailed {{swinging}} the weighted chain {{in a large}} <b>circle</b> <b>over</b> one's <b>head,</b> and then whipping it forward to entangle an opponent's spear, sword, or other weapon, or immobilizing his arms or legs. This allows the kusarigama user to easily rush forward and strike with the sickle.|$|R

In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which <b>circled</b> <b>over</b> the <b>heads</b> of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.|$|R
60|$|As Peter {{sat there}} staring and {{wondering}} a trim little head {{appeared at the}} entrance to one of those holes. It was a trim little head with a very small bill and a snowy white throat. At first glance Peter thought it was his old friend, Skimmer the Tree Swallow, and he was just on the point of asking what under the sun Skimmer was doing in such a place as that, when with a lively twitter of greeting the owner of that little hole in the bank flew out and <b>circled</b> <b>over</b> Peter's <b>head.</b> It wasn't Skimmer at all. It was Banker the Bank Swallow, own cousin to Skimmer the Tree Swallow. Peter recognized him the instant he got a full view of him.|$|R
50|$|Stealth {{mechanics}} {{have been}} reworked. An eye icon squints or opens to denote the player's level of detection by the enemy. Enemy soldiers {{will also have}} a <b>circle</b> meter <b>over</b> their <b>heads</b> to indicate alert status. Players are also forced to relocate periodically to prevent detection with a white ghost image to mark their last known position and the enemy will search a wider area. As in the previous game, loud sounds {{may be used to}} mask sniper shots.|$|R
6000|$|... [1] Since {{these words}} were written I {{have seen the}} cone move. In the {{presence}} of another medium, with {{no one in the}} room but myself, I held the psychic's hands what time the horn <b>circled</b> <b>over</b> my <b>head.</b> It shone like a golden rod as it moved. I could see the gleam of light along its entire side. At last it came softly down and laid itself across my shoulder. In order to satisfy myself of its presence, I bent and touched it with my forehead. The touch seemed to disturb conditions, to break the current, for it dropped instantly to the floor. Twice it answered to my request in this manner until my doubts were satisfied. It seemed to move with the swiftness of a dragonfly as silent and horizontal it hung in the air about my head.|$|R
60|$|Jack was right. I {{observed}} {{a very fine}} fish-hawk <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the <b>head</b> {{of one of the}} pelicans. Its head and neck were white, and its body was of a reddish chocolate colour. Just as we came in sight, the pelican caught a fine fish, which it stowed away safe in the pouch under its chin. The sly hawk, which had been watching for this, immediately made a descent towards its victim, making a considerable noise with its wings as it came down. Hearing this, the pelican looked hastily up, and supposing that a terrible and deadly assault was about to be made, opened its mouth and screamed in terror. This was just what the hawk wanted. The open bill revealed the fish in the pouch. Down he swooped, snatched it out, and then soared away with his ill-gotten gains in his talons.|$|R
60|$|When {{they came}} to Dermott's house it was late afternoon, and Lough Gara lay down below them, blue, mirror-like, and deserted; and though they had seen, when at a distance, dark figures moving about the door, the house {{appeared}} not less deserted than the Lough. The door stood half open, and Costello knocked upon it again and again, so {{that a number of}} lake gulls flew up out of the grass and <b>circled</b> screaming <b>over</b> his <b>head,</b> but there was no answer.|$|R
60|$|A great {{crowd was}} {{assembled}} in the market-place, waiting for the hour when an eagle should be let loose from a cage, for it had been settled that on whose-soever house the eagle alighted, the owner of that house should become ruler of the town. At last the hour arrived; the eagle was set free, and all eyes were strained to see where it would alight. But <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the <b>heads</b> of the crowd, it flew straight {{in the direction of}} a young man, who was at that moment entering the town. This was none other than Bobino, who had awakened soon after his companions had left him, and had followed in their footsteps. All the people shouted and proclaimed that he was their future ruler, and he was conducted by a great crowd to the Governor's house, which was for the future to be his home. And here he lived happily, and ruled wisely over the people.|$|R
5000|$|A coin-collecting minigame called [...] "Code Red" [...] becomes {{available}} if the player's park contains at least 5 carnivorous dinosaurs. In the minigame, the carnivores rampage during a violent storm. A <b>circle</b> appears <b>over</b> their <b>heads</b> and fills up with color from green to blinking red. The brighter the color, the more coins are earned. The player must {{tap on the}} dinosaur before the circle completely fills to earn the coins. If a circle above any carnivore's head fills completely, the carnivore escapes and the minigame is over. The objective is to earn as many coins as possible and prevent any dinosaurs from escaping.|$|R
60|$|This {{commission}} {{filled me}} {{with the spirit of}} the soldier. Proudly walking my rounds I menaced the flocks as they <b>circled</b> warily <b>over</b> my <b>head,</b> taking shot at them now and again as they came near enough, feeling as duty bound and as martial as any Roman sentry standing guard over a city. Up to this time I had not been allowed to carry arms, although I had been the companion of Den Green and Ellis Usher on their hunting expeditions in the coulee--now with entire discretion over my weapon, I loaded it, capped it and fired it, marching with sedate and manly tread, while little Frank at my heels, served as subordinate in his turn.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the morning}} I watched the geese {{from the door}} through the mist, sailing {{in the middle of}} the pond, fifty rods off, so large and tumultuous that Walden {{appeared}} like an artificial pond for their amusement. But when I stood on the shore they at once rose up with a great flapping of wings at the signal of their commander, and when they had got into rank <b>circled</b> about <b>over</b> my <b>head,</b> twenty-nine of them, and then steered straight to Canada, with a regular honk from the leader at intervals, trusting to break their fast in muddier pools. A [...] "plump" [...] of ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in the wake of their noisier cousins.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, at night, as you drift {{along the}} shore in your canoe, sifting the night sounds and smells of the wilderness, when all harsher cries are hushed and the silence grows tense and musical, like a great {{stretched}} chord over which the wind is thrumming low suggestive melodies, a sudden rush and flapping in the grasses beside you breaks noisily into the gamut of half-heard primary tones and rising, vanishing harmonics. Then, as you listen, and before the silence has again stretched the chords of her Eolian harp tight enough for the wind's fingers, another sound, a cry, comes floating down from the air--Quoskh? quoskh-quoskh? a wild, questioning call, as if the startled night were asking who you are. It is only a blue heron, wakened out of his sleep on the shore by your noisy approach, that you thought was still as the night itself. He <b>circles</b> <b>over</b> your <b>head</b> for a moment, seeing you perfectly, though you catch never a shadow of his broad wings; then he vanishes into the vast, dark silence, crying Quoskh? quoskh? as he goes. And the cry, with its strange, wild interrogation vanishing away into the outer darkness, has given him his most fascinating Indian name, Quoskh the Night's Question.|$|R
60|$|Before the tendril is mature, the {{terminal}} branchlets cohere, and the hooks are curled closely inwards. At this period no part {{is sensitive to}} a touch; {{but as soon as}} the branches diverge and the hooks stand out, full sensitiveness is acquired. It is a singular circumstance that immature tendrils revolve at their full velocity before they become sensitive, but in a useless manner, as in this state they can catch nothing. This want of perfect co-adaptation, though only for a short time, between the structure and the functions of a climbing-plant is a rare event. A tendril, as soon as it is ready to act, stands, together with the supporting petiole, vertically upwards. The leaflets borne by the petiole are at this time quite small, and the extremity of the growing stem is bent to one side so as to be out of the way of the revolving tendril, which sweeps large <b>circles</b> directly <b>over</b> <b>head.</b> The tendrils thus revolve in a position well adapted for catching objects standing above; and by this means the ascent of the plant is favoured. If no object is caught, the leaf with its tendril bends downwards and ultimately assumes a horizontal position. An open space is thus left for the next succeeding and younger tendril to stand vertically upwards and to revolve freely. As soon as an old tendril bends downwards, it loses all power of movement, and contracts spirally into an entangled mass. Although the tendrils revolve with unusual rapidity, the movement lasts for only a short time. In a plant placed in the hot- house and growing vigorously, a tendril revolved for not longer than 36 hours, counting from the period when it first became sensitive; but during this period it probably made at least 27 revolutions.|$|R
