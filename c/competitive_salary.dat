40|$|Recent {{cross-country}} empirical {{analysis has}} found that privately produced ratings {{of the performance of}} the central government bureaucracy in areas such as corruption and red tape are significant predictors of economic performance. We argue that several relatively simple, easily identifiable structural features constitute the key ingredients of effective state bureaucracies and should help to predict these ratings: <b>competitive</b> <b>salaries,</b> internal promotion and career stability, and meritocratic recruitment. We collect a new data set on these features for bureaucracies of 35 less developed countries. Controlling for country income, level of education, and ethnolinguistic diversity, we find that our measures of bureaucratic structure are statistically significant determinants of ratings supplied by two of three country risk agencies. Meritocratic recruitment is the most important structural feature for improving bureaucratic performance, followed by internal promotion and career stability.

40|$|In a Shapley-Shubik {{assignment}} {{problem with}} a supermodular output matrix, we consider games in which each firm makes a take-it-or-leave-it salary offer to one applicant, and a match is made only when the offer is accepted by her. We consider both one-shot and multistage games. In either game, we show {{that there can be}} many equilibrium salary vectors which are higher or lower than the minimal <b>competitive</b> <b>salary</b> vector. If we exclude artificial equilibria, applicants' equilibrium salary vectors are bounded above by the minimal <b>competitive</b> <b>salary</b> vector, while firms' equilibrium payoff vectors are bounded below by the payoff vector under the minimal <b>competitive</b> <b>salary</b> vector. This suggests that adopting the minimal <b>competitive</b> <b>salary</b> vector as the equilibrium outcome in decentralized markets does not have a strong justification. ...|$|E
40|$|Schools need {{to offer}} <b>competitive</b> <b>salaries</b> for both new and {{experienced}} teachers {{to recruit and}} retain qualified teachers. Previous research indicates that charter schools may have less qualified teachers than traditional public schools. One explanation for this qualification disparity is that charter schools do not pay teachers <b>competitive</b> <b>salaries.</b> This paper explores teacher salaries in charter and traditional public schools using the 1999 - 2000 Schools and Staffing Survey. Specifically, it compares beginning teacher salaries and the return to experience in these schools. The Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) technique used in this paper allows me to account for teachers being clustered within school systems and to examine factors that may strengthen or weaken the relationship between salary and years of experience. The main findings imply that while salaries for first-year teachers are similar in charter and traditional public schools, teachers in charter schools receive a lower return to experience. This results in sizeable salary differences for teachers {{with more than a}} couple years of experience in charter schools compared to their traditional public school counterparts. These findings suggest that charter schools may have difficulty retaining teachers. While charter schools may be able to compete with traditional public schools in initial teacher hiring, charter schools may lose teachers to public schools as teachers gain experience...|$|R

40|$|We analyze a {{decentralized}} trading {{process in}} a basic labor market where heterogeneous firms and workers meet directly and randomly, and negotiate salaries with each other over time. Firms and workers {{may not have a}} complete picture of the entire market and can thus behave myopically in the process. Our main result establishes that, starting from an arbitrary initial market state, there exists a finite sequence of successive myopic (firm-worker) pair improvements, or bilateral trades, leading to a stable matching between firms and workers with a scheme of <b>competitive</b> <b>salary</b> offers. An important implication of this result is that a general random process where every possible bilateral trade is chosen with a positive probability converges with probability one to a competitive equilibrium of the market.
