5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which they <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> their newspaper. The writer-scorers were tasked with making {{objective}} decisions that could impact the statistics of the team they were writing about.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Christian Cage and Sting against the team of Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown. The {{duration}} of the encounter was 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Jarrett was accompanied by Gail Kim. Cage and Brown started the match before they both quickly tagged in their partners. Kim interfered by distracting the referee, allowing Jarrett to hit Cage in the groin and throw him to the ringside mat. Kim then assaulted Cage in the ringside area. After several minutes of Jarrett and Brown having the advantage over a beaten Cage, Sting was tagged into the match and placed Jarrett in his signature Scorpion Deathlock submission maneuver. Jarrett submitted to the maneuver, but the referee was unconscious. Team Canada then interfered in the bout, attacking Cage and Sting. Jarrett bashed Sting {{in the face with}} the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> a near-fall once the referee regained consciousness. Afterwards, Sting forced Jarrett's head into the ring mat with his trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver and <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> {{an extended period}} of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take {{a long period of time}} to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E

5|$|Christian Cage fought Monty Brown next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This bout lasted 12 minutes and 32 seconds. In the beginning the two fought at ringside, until Cage jumped {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto Brown with an aerial splash. After this, Cage removed the padding from one of the turnbuckles. Brown gained a two-count on Cage after slamming him against the mat with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver and <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> the pin, but the referee had a delayed reaction. Later, Cage caused Brown to run into the exposed turnbuckle, he then followed by forcing Brown's face into the mat with his signature Unprettier maneuver.

5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} sewers were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the sewers, along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E

5|$|On 11 May 1985, one of {{the worst}} {{sporting}} disasters occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was engulfed by fire. The fire started 40minutes into the club's final game of the 1984–85 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986–87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the £2.6million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a £1.46million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> the first time and increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1–0 to Derby County.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was defended in a Raven's Rules match by Raven against Rhino in {{the eighth}} {{encounter}} on the card. A contest conducted under Raven's Rules means there are no count-outs or no disqualifications, and weapons are provided for the environment; {{the only way to}} win is by pinfall or submission. Raven used a pizza cutter early on in the bout to cut open Rhino's forehead, causing him to bleed heavily. Later, Raven's forehead was also cut open due to being hit by a trashcan. Rhino used a staple gun during the contest; Rhino placed several staples in Raven's forehead. Cassidy Riley, Jeff Hardy, and Jeff Jarrett interfered in the bout. Riley interfered by accidentally distracting the referee during a pin attempt by Raven, whom Riley was attempting to aid. Jarrett came down to the ring near the end trying to bash Raven in the face with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, but was stopped by Hardy. Raven then performed his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver on Jarrett, forcing his head into the ring mat. Afterwards, Raven performed the Raven Effect DDT on Rhino and <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> the pinfall victory to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at 14 minutes and 28 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. The added stipulation to this bout was if Joe lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire from professional wrestling forever. Frank Trigg provided commentary for this match. The match was primarily technical, with each combatant switching through various holds and submission maneuvers. One such submission was the Figure-Four Leglock, which Angle applied to Joe. Angle was forced to release the hold when Joe grabbed the bottom rope. Joe then applied a Boston Crab, before switching to an STF, which Angle countered into an Ankle Lock. Following the hold being broken, Angle performed his signature Olympic Slam maneuver on Joe for a near-fall. Later, Joe applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission on Angle, which was forced to be released when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. The match finally came to a conclusion when Joe lifted up Angle and slammed him to the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> the pinfall at 17 minutes and 45 seconds to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} Main Stand, {{built in}} the early 1950s, used a propped cantilever roof design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' view of the pitch. Floodlights were installed, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in October 1956. By the early 1960s, a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, a new roof erected over the Kop, and the Tilton Road end <b>covered</b> <b>for</b> the first time. A scoreboard and clock were installed at the City end of the ground in memory of Birmingham and England player Jeff Hall, who died of polio during the 1958–59 season. In the 1970s, the Asda chain proposed to share {{the cost of a}} new stand as part of a supermarket development on land behind the Kop made vacant by slum clearance; in the face of opposition from commercial rivals, the proposal fell through.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Covers</b> <b>for</b> finite groups, a {{generalization}} of logarithmic signatures, {{form the basis}} of the ElGamal-like public-key cryptosystem MST 2. A relevant and open problem about the practical use of covers is {{the question of how to}} generate random <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> groups of large order. In this paper we show the connection between this problem and the classical occupancy problem. As a consequence, we can solve the problem of generating random <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> arbitrarily large finite groups completely. We also present several experimental computer results about covers and uniform <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> some alternating groups. These results provide useful hints for generating uniform random covers...|$|R
