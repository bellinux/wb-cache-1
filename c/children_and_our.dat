5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, {{while we}} shut our <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> {{chickens}} up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools {{of the future}} must be provided with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E

500|$|When the {{legislation}} that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the American Medical Association (AMA) warning that such legislation would {{mean the end of}} freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, [...] "we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."

500|$|Rev. D. James Kennedy of The Center for Reclaiming America for Christ and Coral Ridge Ministries {{claims that}} Darwin was {{responsible}} for Adolf Hitler's atrocities. In Kennedy's documentary and the accompanying pamphlet with the same title, Darwin's Deadly Legacy, Kennedy states that [...] "To put it simply, no Darwin, no Hitler." [...] In his efforts to expose the [...] "harmful effects that evolution is still having on our nation, our <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> world," [...] Kennedy also states that, [...] "We have had 150 years {{of the theory of}} Darwinian evolution, and what has it brought us? Whether Darwin intended it or not, millions of deaths, the destruction of those deemed inferior, the devaluing of human life, increasing hopelessness." [...] The Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture fellow Richard Weikart has made similar claims, as have other creationists. The claim was central to the documentary film [...] (2008) promoting intelligent design creationism. The Anti-Defamation League describes such claims as outrageous misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, and as trivializing the [...] "...many complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry. Hitler did not need Darwin or evolution to devise his heinous plan to exterminate the Jewish people, and Darwin and evolutionary theory cannot explain Hitler's genocidal madness. Moreover, anti-Semitism existed long before Darwin ever wrote a word." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{shortage}} of school nurses could put children's lives at risk. [...] Fiona Smith of the RCN said, “Children with {{conditions such as}} asthma, epilepsy or allergies could experience a life-threatening emergency at any time. [...] Without the right training, guidance and support from school nursing services, teachers could be completely unprepared {{for this kind of}} situation - putting children’s lives at serious risk.

2500|$|On April 30, 2008, Iolani Palace was {{overtaken}} {{by a group}} of native Hawaiians who called themselves the Hawaiian Kingdom Government to protest what they view as illegitimate rule by the United States.

[...] "The Hawaiian Kingdom Government is here and it doesn't plan to leave. This is a continuity of the Hawaiian Kingdom of 1892 to today," [...] Kahau said. Friends of Iolani Palace released a statement stating: [...] "We respect the freedom of Hawaiian groups to hold an opinion on the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, we believe that blocking public access to Iolani Palace is wrong and certainly detrimental to our mission to share the Palace and its history with our residents, our keiki (<b>children),</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> visitors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edwards went on {{to define}} the two Americas he claimed to exist, one {{for the rich and}} one for the poor, and {{repeated}} several times that [...] "It doesn't have to be that way." [...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> grandchildren." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Dewey was alarmed {{by many of}} the [...] "child-centered" [...] excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much {{reliance}} on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, [...] "we must take our stand with the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" [...] (Dewey, 1902, pp.13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.|$|R

We are that little baby, the radiant <b>child,</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> name, what we are to become, is outside us and we must become “Judy Rifka” or “Jean-Michel” the way I became “Rene Ricard.” The untitled acrylic painting on plywood, {{in the collection of the}} Honolulu Museum of Art, demonstrates the artist's use of plywood as a substrate for painting. Artist and writer Mark Bloch called her work [...] "imaginative surfaces that support experimental laboratories for interferences in sensuous pigment."
