50|$|On 15 March 1926 however, {{shortly before}} the {{completion}} of shaft number 2 six men fell to their death when the Capstan engine controlling the scaffolding upon which they were working upon malfunctioned. It was described in local papers with headlines such as ‘Mysterious Mishap’, as the full cause of the tragedy was unknown. It {{was not the first}} loss of life at the pit but was to be ultimately the most costly. The incident was the largest loss of life in a mine in the United Kingdom in 1926. The six men who lost their lives are as follows; Edmund Thorley, age 33 - 1st <b>Chargeman</b> sinker, John Hansbury, age 34 - 2nd <b>Chargeman</b> sinker, John William Barley, age 51 - Sinker, Charles H.

50|$|After leaving school, Rashid {{travelled}} {{and sought}} employment, {{ending up in}} Cameron Highlands, Pahang.

50|$|One notable {{employee}} at the Thirroul Depot {{in its early}} days was Harry Starling. He was the roundhouse <b>chargeman</b> who was employed in this position between 1918 and 1934.

However, in 1914 he was badly injured while driving a steam train when the gauge glass of the engine burst and he lost the sight of one eye.

5000|$|Firstly, {{it should}} be noted that much of the {{accepted}} information about Babajan appears to have been established solely on the authority of Meher Baba, a fact acknowledged by Dr Abdul Ghani Munsiff, who in 1939 wrote the first life-sketch of Babajan. According to Ghani, [...] "the information gleaned from different sources is meagre, since Babajan herself was never communicative to anyone with regard to her life history. The facts of her early life and those relating to her spiritual career have all been confirmed by Hazrat Meher Baba, her chief disciple and spiritual <b>Chargeman</b> (Khalifa)". Yet Meher Baba appears to have provided/endorsed two different versions of Babajan’s life.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, the Government {{appointed}} barrister Mr J Roskill to scrutinise the evidence. Roskill in his September 1894 report {{submitted to}} the Home Secretary was {{of the opinion that}} the explosion was caused by the blasting of timbers which ignited an accumulation of gas, which ignited the coal dust. Roskill concluded the risk was increased by dangerous working practices, including blasting of timbers during shifts, inadequate watering of the mine to lay dust and new Saturday shift patterns, so that there was no interval for clearing dust between shifts. Roskill recommended prosecuting the Albion Coal Company, but eventually only fines of £10 and £2 were imposed against manager Phillip Jones and <b>chargeman</b> William Anstes.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the number}} of anime-industry notables who worked with Knack over the years (including Go Nagai, Ken Ishikawa, Kazuyuki Okasako, Masayuki Kojima, Tetsuro Amino, Shun'ichi Yukimuro, Yoshikata Nitta, and Fumio Ikeno), the studio {{developed}} a dubious reputation for the low quality of its productions, particularly in regard to animation quality and to copying the premises of other, more popular shows. Nevertheless, {{a number of the}} studio's productions did become internationally successful, including the children's anthropomorphic cartoon series Don Chuck Monogatari; The Adventures of the Little Prince; and Attacker You!, a volleyball drama which achieved a staggering level of popularity when exported to Italy and France. The studio's children's comedies Manga Sarutobi Sasuke and Cybot Robotchi were also released in the U.S. as direct-to-video feature-length edits titled Ninja the Wonder Boy and Robby the Rascal, respectively. In more recent years, the studio's 1974 series <b>Chargeman</b> Ken! has become an online sensation, due to mockery of its limited production values.|$|E
