40|$|Forty {{patients}} with 42 temporal bone <b>chemodectomas</b> {{were treated with}} radiotherapy alone (37 tumors) or subtotal resection and irradiation (5 tumors) at the University of Florida between 1968 and 1992. Thirty-three lesions were previously untreated, whereas 9 had undergone prior treatment (surgery, 6 lesions; radiotherapy, 1 lesion; or both, 2 lesions) and were treated for locally recurrent disease. All 3 patients who received prior radiotherapy had been treated at other institutions. Patients had minimum follow-up times as follows: 2 years, 40 patients (100 %); 5 years, 31 patients (78 %); 10 years, 21 patients (53 %); 15 years, 16 patients (40 %); 20 years, 9 patients (23 %); and 25 years, 2 patients (5 %).

40|$|Introduction: Schwannomas of the {{descending}} loop of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} are very rare. They are slow-growing tumors that may masquerade a carotid body tumor. Presentation of case: A 60 -year-old female was referred for a latero-cervical mass appearing as a <b>chemodectoma</b> at CT-scan. At operation, a 2  cm mass {{arising from the}} descending loop of the hypoglossal nerve was resected en bloc with the loop itself and a functional lymphadenectomy was associated. Post-operative course was uneventful and the patient is free from disease recurrence at one year follow-up. Discussion: En bloc resection remains the real curative treatment of Schwannomas, ensuring unlimited freedom from disease, although causing functional impairment which may be significant. Nonetheless recurrence should be prevented as, beside requiring reintervention, it may harbor a malignant evolution towards sarcoma. Conclusion: Schwannomas of the descending lop of the hypoglossal nerve may masquerade a <b>chemodectoma</b> of the carotid bifurcation and can be curatively resected without any functional impairment...|$|E

It is a generic term applied to tumors of paraganglia regardless of the location. In rare instances, paragangliomas present around and involve the pancreas, thereby mimicking {{any one of the}} more common primary pancreatic lesions. Pancreatic paraganglioma is an extremely rare tumor. It grows slowly, so radical resection is recommended to achieve curability with good prognosis. These neoplasms present considerable diagnostic difficulty not only for the clinician and radiologist but also for the pathologist. Here, we report a case of a 55 -year-old woman who presented with a left-sided abdominal swelling for 3 months duration, initially having clinical suspicion of an ovarian tumor.

40|$|Paragangliomas of {{the head}} and neck (glomus tumours) can occur in a {{hereditary}} pattern and may be hormonally active as well as being associated with paragangliomas elsewhere. A number of these tumours may be present without symptoms. To detect the presence of subclinical paragangliomas we screened 83 members of a family at risk of developing hereditary paragangliomas using whole body MRI and urinary catecholamine testing. In eight previously diagnosed members, eight known glomus tumours of which one functioning, and two unknown glomus tumours and one unknown pheochromocytoma were present. Six unsuspected members showed ten glomus tumours and one pheochromocytoma. It has been suggested that the manifestation of hereditary glomus tumours is determined by the sex of the transmitting parent. There were no tumours in the descendants of female gene carriers. Comparing the likelihood of inheritance with genomic imprinting versus inheritance without genomic imprinting we found an odds ratio of 23375 in favour of genomic imprinting.

Biopsy is to be avoided as {{it is very likely}} to cause massive bleeding and because of the high percentage of false negatives.

There was also one patient with a false-positive test for bilateral carotid-body tumors. Angiographie and/or surgical confirmation was obtained in all cases but one. A significant incidence of complication during contrast angiogra-phy was noted (two cases of transient hemiparesis). The radionuclide angiogram proved safer than contrast angiography and more reliable than clinical examina tion; it therefore appears to be the method of choice as the primary screening test in patients with suspected carotid-body and glomus-jugulare tumors. J NucÃ-Med 24 : 475 - 478, 1983 <b>Chemodectomas</b> are rare tumors of the chemorecep-tor system, occurring {{in various parts of the}} body but most frequently in the head and neck.

40|$|The neuro{{endocrine}} {{system is}} a diffuse {{system in which the}} nervous system and the hormones of the endocrine glands interact. The neuroendocrine organs of the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system are called paraganglia. These organs usually manifest as anatomically discrete bodies, which derive from the neural crest and produce catecholamines and various peptides. Various localizations of paraganglia in the human body are known, including the adrenal gland, organs of Zuckerkandl, and carotid and aortic bodies. Paraganglia are divided into two functional groups, i. e. the sympathoadrenal and the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic paraganglia are predominantly located in the prevertebral and paravertebral sympathetic trunks, and along the fibers of the hypogastric plexus, innervating pelvic and retroperitoneal organs. Parasympathetic paraganglia are almost exclusively located in the region of cranial as well as thoracic branches of the of the glossopharyngeal nerves and vagal nerves. The principal glossopharyngeal paraganglia are the tympanic (located in the wall of the middle ear), and the carotid bodies (Figure 1). Neoplasms of the paraganglia are called pheochromocytomas (PCC), sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas. The name PCC is derived from the Greek synonym “dark colored tumor”, because it was first described by Pick as a chromium salt-reactive tumor which lead to dark coloration. PCC are tumors which originate in the adrenal medulla. Sympathetic paragangliomas (sPGL), in the literature often described as extra-adrenal PCC, usually produce catecholamines and occur in the abdominal cavity and the aorticopulmonary bodies, but not in the adrenal medulla. Parasympathetic paragangliomas, also called head and neck paraganglioma, usually do not produce catecholamines and are situated in the wall of the middle ear, along the vagal nerve, and the carotid and jugular bodies. In the literature they are still often referred to as <b>chemodectomas,</b> glomus tumors, or carotid body tumors...|$|R
40|$|General aspectsParaganglia {{are small}} neuroendocrine organs, that usually {{manifest}} as anatomically discrete bodies, the parenchymal cells {{of which are}} neural crest-derived, and produce catecholamines and various peptides. One group of paraganglia is aligned to the sympathoadrenal {{and the other to}} the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system. 1, 2 Sympathetic paraganglia are distributed along the pre- and paravertebral sympathetic chains and follow the sympathetic innervations of the pelvic and retroperitoneal organs. Their exact locations are somewhat variable, {{with the exception of the}} adrenal medulla and the organs of Zuckerkandl. Parasympathetic paraganglia are almost exclusively located in the region of the cranial and thoracic branches of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves. The principal glossopharyngeal paraganglia are the tympanic paraganglia, situated in the wall of the middle ear, and the carotid bodies (Figure 1). Neoplasms of the neuroendocrine cells found within the sympathetic or parasympathetic paraganglionic axes are designated pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. The name pheochromocytoma – the Greek synonym of black colored tumor – is derived from the so- called chromaffi n reaction, resulting from oxidation of stored catecholamines. Adrenal tumors are usually referred to as pheochromocytomas (because of a positive chromaffi n reaction), whereas the extra-adrenal ones are alternatively designated extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, the latter name usually being reserved for parasympathetic or nonfunctional (i. e., non catecholamine-secreting) sympathetic tumors. Paraganglioma is also used to describe the parasympathetically aligned tumors. However, since these neoplasms are otherwise indistinguishable, and the chromaffi n reaction appeared to be a poor indicator of catecholamine storage, the terminology may be confusing. For this reason, in this thesis, all sympathicoadrenal neoplasms will be referred to as pheochromocytomas. Additional designations (e. g., nonfunctional, extra-adrenal, or malignant) will be used when appropriate. Neoplasms arising from parasympathetic paraganglionic tissues will be referred to as paragangliomas. In the literature, some of the latter may have been referred to as <b>chemodectomas,</b> glomus jugulare, or carotid body tumors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Carotid body tumours (CBTs) {{are very}} rare lesions {{which should be}} treated as soon as {{possible}} even when benign since small tumour size permits easier removal and lower incidence of perioperative complications and recurrence. Malignant forms are rare and they can be identified by lymph node invasion and metastases in distant locations. The need of reliable and effective diagnostic modalities for both primary CBTs and its metastases or recurrence is evident. The present study reviews our experience and attempt to define the role of colour coded ultrasound (CCU) and Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) with Indium-III-DTP-Apentetretide (Octreoscan (R)) using both planar and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of these uncommon lesions within a multidisciplinary approach. Methods: From 1997 to 2008, 12 patients suffering from 16 CBTs (4 bilateral) were investigated by CCU and SRS-SPECT before and after surgery. All tumours were grouped according to Shamblin's classification in order to assess the technical difficulties and morbidity of surgical resection on the ground of their size and relationship with the carotid arteries. Intraoperative radiocaptation by Octreoscan (R)) was also carried out in all cases to evaluate the radicality of surgery. All perioperative scans were evaluated by the same nuclear medicine physician. Results: Preoperatively CCU showed CBTs (four were not palpable) with a sensitivity of 100 %. Radioisotope imaging identified the CBTs as <b>chemodectomas</b> in 15 cases while no radioisotopic uptake was detected in 1 vagus nerve neurinoma. No evidence of metastasis or multicentricity were seen by total body radioisotopic scans. Combined data from CCU and SRS-SPECT allowed to determine tumour size in order to select 7 larger tumours which were submitted to selective preoperative embolization. Intraoperatively Octreoscan demonstrated microscopic tumour leftovers promptly removed in 1 case and an unresectable remnant {{at the base of the}} skull in another case. During follow-up CCI and radioisotope scans showed no recurrence in 14 cases and a slightly enlargement of the intracranial residual as detected during surgery in 1 patient. Conclusion: CCU may allow an early and noninvasive detection of CBTs and hence safer operations. The combined use of CCU and SRS-SPECT provide useful data to identify those tumours and to evaluate their extent and carotid arteries infiltration. Radioisotope imaging is a sensitive modality to detect metastases and lymph node involvement that are markers of CBT malignancy. After surgery CCU and SRS-SPECT can be accurate modalities for surveillance for an early detection of CBTs recurrence...|$|R
