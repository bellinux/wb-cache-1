50|$|Conotoxins are hypervariable {{even within}} the same species; the genes that encode them do not act endogenously, and thus are less conserved {{and more likely to}} {{experience}} gene duplication events and nonsynonymous mutations which lead to the development of novel functions.

Variability in <b>conotoxin</b> components reduces the likelihood that prey organisms will develop resistance; thus cone snails are under constant selective pressure to maintain polymorphism in these genes because failing to evolve and adapt will lead to extinction (Red Queen hypothesis).|$|E

40|$|Venoms of predatory marine {{gastropods}} of {{the genus}} Conus show amazing levels of inter-specific diversity and are comprised of a cocktail of peptide neurotoxins, termed conotoxins, that are encoded by large gene families. <b>Conotoxin</b> gene family evolution is characterized by gene duplications and high rates of nonsynonymous substitution among paralogues; yet, what controls the differentiation of venoms among species is not clear. We compared four-loop <b>conotoxin</b> transcripts of six closely related Conus species to examine <b>conotoxin</b> expression patterns among species.

Some loci also appear to exhibit coordinated expression patterns.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The venoms of Conus snails contain small, disulfide-rich inhibitors of voltage-dependent sodium channels. <b>Conotoxin</b> GS is a 34 -residue {{polypeptide}} {{isolated from}} Conus geographus that {{interacts with the}} extracellular entrance of skeletal muscle sodium channels to prevent sodium ion conduction. Although <b>conotoxin</b> GS binds competitively with μ <b>conotoxin</b> GIIIA to the sodium channel surface, the two toxin types have little sequence identity with one another, and <b>conotoxin</b> GS has a four-loop structural framework rather than the characteristic three-loop μ-conotoxin framework. The structural study of <b>conotoxin</b> GS will {{form the basis for}} establishing a structure–activity relationship and understanding its interaction with the pore region of sodium channels. Results: The three-dimensional structure of <b>conotoxin</b> GS was determined using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The protein exhibits a compact fold incorporating a β hairpin and several turns. An unusual feature of <b>conotoxin</b> GS is the exceptionally high proportion (100 %) of cis-imide bond geometry for the three proline or hydroxyproline residues. The structure of <b>conotoxin</b> GS bears little resemblance to the three-loop μ conotoxins, consistent with the low sequence identity between the two toxin types and their different structural framework. However, the tertiary structure and cystine-knot motif formed by the three disulfide bonds is similar to that present in several other polypeptide ion channel inhibitors. Conclusions: This is the first three-dimensional structure of a ‘four-loop’ sodium channel inhibitor, and it represents a valuable new structural probe for the pore region of voltage-dependent sodium channels. The distribution of amino acid sidechains in the structure creates several polar and charged patches, and comparison with the μ conotoxins provides a basis for determining the binding surface of the <b>conotoxin</b> GS polypeptide...|$|E
40|$|Conotoxins are the peptidic {{components}} of the venoms of marine cone snails (genus Conus). They are remarkably diverse in terms of structure and function. Unique potency and selectivity profiles {{for a range of}} neuronal targets have made several conotoxins valuable as research tools, drug leads and even therapeutics, and has resulted in a concerted and increasing drive to identify and characterise new conotoxins.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Conotoxin</b> {{has been}} proven to be {{effective}} in drug design and could be used to treat various disorders such as schizophrenia, neuromuscular disorders and chronic pain. With the rapidly growing interest in <b>conotoxin,</b> accurate <b>conotoxin</b> superfamily classification tools are desirable to systematize the increasing number of newly discovered sequences and structures. However, despite the significance and extensive experimental investigations on <b>conotoxin,</b> those tools have not been intensively explored. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose to consider suboptimal alignments of words with restricted length. We developed a scoring system based on local alignment partition functions, called free score. The scoring system plays the key role in the feature extraction step of support vector machine classification. In the classification of <b>conotoxin</b> proteins, our method, SVM-Freescore, features an improved sensitivity and specificity by approximately 5. 864 % and 3. 76 %, respectively, over previously reported methods. For the generalization purpose, SVM-Freescore was also applied to classify superfamilies from curated and high quality database such as ConoServer. The average computed sensitivity and specificity for the superfamily classification were found to be 0. 9742 and 0. 9917, respectively.

40|$|Peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) are {{ubiquitous}} {{proteins that}} catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of prolines.

Marine cone snails synthesize a wide array of cysteine-rich peptides, called <b>conotoxins,</b> many of which contain one or more prolines or hydroxyprolines. To identify whether PPIase-associated cis-trans isomerization of these residues affects the oxidative folding of <b>conotoxins,</b> we identified, sequenced, and expressed three functionally active isoforms of PPIase from the venom gland of Conus novaehollandiae, and we characterized their ability to facilitate oxidative folding of <b>conotoxins</b> in vitro. Three <b>conotoxins,</b> namely μ-GIIIA, μ-SIIIA, and ω-MVIIC, derived from two distinct toxin gene families were assayed. Conus PPIase significantly increased the rate of appearance of the native form of μ-GIIIA, a peptide containing three hydroxyprolines. In contrast, the presence of PPIase had no effect on the folding of μ-SIIIA and ω-MVIIC, peptides containing no or one proline residue, respectively.

40|$|Ion {{channels}} are intimately linked to all neurotransmission and neurotransmitter release processes, but in disease states often contribute adversely to disease pathology. The diversity {{and distribution of}} ion channel types and subtypes being uncovered {{through the use of}} molecular biology and toxin probes present an exciting opportunity for the discovery of new, more selective drugs. Among ion channels targeted by cone shell venom peptides (<b>conotoxins)</b> are the voltage-sensitive sodium, calcium, and potassium channels which open and then close (inactivate) in response to membrane depolarization, and thus regulate neurotransmission and the neurotransmitter release process. <b>Conotoxins</b> also target ligand-gated ion channels, including the NMDA-glutamate channel and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel. The diversity of subtypes, especially those subtypes upregulated in disease states, makes ion channels a rapidly expanding therapeutic area. <b>Conotoxins</b> represent some of the most selective inhibitors of ion channel subtypes and have often been used as the defining ligand. In this overview, the structures and therapeutic potential of <b>conotoxins</b> active at ion channels an highlighted.
