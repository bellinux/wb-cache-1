2500|$|During the First Serbian Uprising (1804–15), the Serbian {{rebels were}} joined by Greeks and Greek-Aromanians, among others, with notable {{examples}} being fighter Giorgakis Olympios, diplomat Petar Ičko, secretary Naum Krnar, fighter Konda Bimbaša, and others. Greek armatolos Nikotsaras (d. 1807) planned to <b>cross</b> <b>Mount</b> Olympos to join the Serbian rebels. Military cooperation {{between the two nations}} was forged in the semi-autonomous Danubian Principalities, which were governed mostly by Phanariote Greek voivodes. There are indications that communication and cooperation between Serbs and Greeks of the Greek mainland had also been established early. For example, in 1806 the French consul in Thessaloniki reported that [...] "the Turks are very furious against the Greeks because of their communications with the Serbs". It was reported that many Slav and Greek peasants were arrested suspected of aiding the Serbian rebels. The klephts and armatoloi were encouraged by the Serbian rebels and Russian actions. The Serbian rebels were important allies to the Greeks; after the suppression of the First Uprising, Karađorđe fled to Bessarabia, where he joined the Greek national liberation movement Filiki Eteria, becoming an active member. The Greeks were primarily interested in using the Serbian lands as base of the Greek operations. Miloš Obrenović, the leader of the Second Serbian Uprising (1815–17) was fully uncooperative. The first historian of the Serbian Revolution was a Greek, Triantafillos Doukas. Many Serbs joined the Greek War of Independence (1821–29), such as Hadži-Prodan and Vasos Mavrovouniotis.|$|E
60|$|She {{took out}} the letter, {{with a sort of}} prayer pushed it through the slit of the door, heard it fall into its wire cage; then slowly descended the stairs to the outer passage into Temple Lane. It was thronged with men and boys, {{at the end of the}} day's work. But when she had nearly reached the Strand, a woman's figure caught her eye. She was walking with a man on the far side; their faces were turned toward each other. Gyp heard their voices, and, faint, dizzy, stood looking back after them. They passed under a lamp; the light glinted on the woman's hair, on a trick of Summerhay's, the lift of one shoulder, when he was denying something; she heard his voice, high-pitched. She watched them <b>cross,</b> <b>mount</b> the stone steps she had just come down, pass along the railed stone passage, enter the doorway, disappear. And such horror seized on her that she could hardly walk away.|$|E

Failing that last, he must let the outlaws alone to bide their time in Ord, to be free to ride on to their new job in Val Verde. In the mean time he must plan to arrest Longstreth. It was a magnificent outline, incredible, alluring, unfathomable in its nameless certainty. He felt like fate. He seemed to be the iron consequences falling upon these doomed outlaws.|$|E

50|$|In grappling, {{side control}} (often also called side mount, <b>cross</b> <b>mount</b> or {{sometimes}} scarfhold) is a dominant ground grappling position where the top combatant is lying perpendicularly over the face-up bottom combatant {{in such a}} way that the legs are free and he or she exerts no control over the combatant on the bottom. The top combatant is referred to as having side control, and is in a stable position, with the other combatant pinned beneath him or her. From there the top combatant can proceed with elbows, knees, various submissions, or transition into a mounted position. It is high priority for the bottom combatant to sweep the top combatant or otherwise escape the position, for instance by entangling the opponent's free legs and trying to obtain the half guard or guard.|$|E

5000|$|Mount Tamalpais (locally {{referred}} to as Mt. Tam) and the surrounding areas in Marin County, California are recognized as the birthplace of modern mountain biking. In the 1970s, mountain biking pioneers such as Gary Fisher, Otis Guy, Charlie Kelly and Joe Breeze were active. The 2006 film Klunkers chronicled their story, solidifying Mount Tamalpais' legendary status as a mountain biking destination, as did Frank J. Berto's book The Birth of Dirt.The area is popular for mountain bikers due to Mount Tamalpais’ proximity to a highly populated geographic region, ease of access, beautiful and varied terrain, and magnificent views. Many trailheads surround the mountain, and the paved and dirt fire roads that <b>cross</b> <b>Mount</b> Tamalpais and adjacent foothills provide many options for people of all fitness levels. Most offroad cyclists reach Mount Tamalpais through the towns of Ross, Fairfax or Mill Valley, and the less used access points that exist through the towns of Larkspur and Kentfield. The Old Railroad Grade fire road that begins in Mill Valley, once the right-of-way of the Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railroad, is the easiest route to traverse up the mountain to its peak of 2,571 feet (784 m) at East Peak.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{shortest}} paths on {{the surface}} of a convex polyhedron can be grouped into equivalence classes according to the sequences of edges, consisting of n-triangular faces, that they <b>cross.</b> <b>Mount</b> (1990) [7] proved that the total number of such equivalence classes is Θ(n 4). In this paper, we consider descending paths {{on the surface}} of a 3 D terrain. A path in a terrain is called a descending path if the z-coordinate of a point p never increases, if we move p along the path from the source to the target. More precisely, a descending path from a point s to another point t is a path Π such that for every pair of points p=(x(p),y(p),z(p)) and q=(x(q),y(q),z(q)) on Π, if dist(s,p) <dist(s,q) then z(p) ⩾z(q). Here dist(s,p) denotes the distance of p from s along Π. We show that the number of equivalence classes of the shortest descending paths {{on the surface of}} a convex terrain is Θ(n 4). We also discuss the difficulty of finding the number of equivalence classes on a convex polyhedron...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{network of}} {{continuous}} GPS stations has been installed in NW Iran since 2005 {{to complement the}} survey GPS network already existing in the region. We present the 1999 - 2009 GPS-derived velocity field for this region based on the continuous and survey-mode observations. The results confirm a right lateral slip of 7 +/- 1 mm/yr for the North Tabriz fault, in agreement with previous studies. This rate is consistent with earthquakes of magnitude 7 - 7. 3 and recurrence times of 250 - 300 yr. The higher spatial coverage of the new network shows that deformation is localized {{in the vicinity of}} the Chalderan, south Gailatu-Siah Cheshmeh-Khoy fault and the North Tabriz fault. However the eastern end of the North Tabriz fault appears to <b>cross</b> <b>Mount</b> Bozgush rather than following its southern foothills. This new velocity field does not indicate the 8 mm/yr of NNE-SSW extension suggested earlier for the region, but rather shows lower extension of 1 - 2 +/- 1 mm/yr across the eastern segment of the North Tabriz fault and the Talesh. To the west, the Chalderan and the western North Tabriz fault segment act like pure strike slip faults without significant extension or compression. The denser network in the Rudbar earthquake region (Ms 7. 3, 1992) shows no significant motion across the fault, suggesting that the recurrence time of earthquakes like the Rudbar event must be very long. The lack of substantial compressive strain and the sharp azimuth change of the velocity vectors in the transition zone from Arabia to Lesser Caucasus motion imply that processes other than "extrusion", possibly related to old subduction or delamination, contribute to active deformation...|$|E
