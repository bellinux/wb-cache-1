Adams plotted the first one the horizontal axis and the latter, multiplied by 0.4, on the vertical axis.

40|$|AbstractThe Jameson and Hurvich opponent-colors {{model of}} hue and {{saturation}} was tested for spectral and non-spectral lights. Four observers described {{the color of}} lights by scaling hue and saturation. The lights ranged from 440 to 640 nm and consisted of five purities: 1. 0, 0. 80, 0. 60, 0. 40 and 0. 20. Admixtures of monochromatic and a xenon-white light yielded the different <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purities.</b> For each subject, chromatic response functions were measured by the method of hue cancellation at each purity, and an achromatic response function {{was measured by the}} method of heterochromatic flicker photometry for spectral lights. Chromatic response functions measured for a particular purity and the achromatic response function were used to predict hue and saturation for that purity. The model successfully predicted hue at each level of purity, but failed to predict precisely the Abney effect. The model made relatively poor predictions of saturation, tending to overstimate short-wave lights and underestimate long-wave lights. An additional experiment found that stimulus parameters that favor rod contribution weaken the model's predictions of saturation, while stimulus parameters that do not favor rod contribution improve the model's predictions of saturation...|$|R

During this time he “… made monumental contributions to the science of colorimetry.” In addition to his work in research and standardization related to color he represented the United States in international commissions on color science. He was the US’s representative in colorimetry in eight meetings of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) from 1931 to 1967 and thereby a key force {{in the development of the}} CIE standard system of colorimetry, with its definitions of standard observers in 1931 and 1964, standard illuminants B and C, work resulting in upgraded daylight illuminants like D6500, definition of <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> and other matters. Largely responsible for the coining of the term “psychophysics” he wrestled throughout his career with the relationship between color stimuli and color perception.|$|E
40|$|Chromatic {{luminance}} carries both wavelength and radiance of light, is {{the source}} of all psychophysical dimensions and all color attributes, and is a key to understand their relations. It has long attracted research, hindered in the past by flawed definitions of <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> (pc), remedied in a recent article. This article investigates relations between luminous reflectance Y (i. e., total luminance, chromatic plus achromatic), chromatic luminance (calculated from Y per pc), and chroma/colorfulness. Relations are clarified, illustrated by formulas and graphs including three-dimensional schemas of luminance Y, chromatic luminance, and color solids. A useful new term, relative chromatic luminance, is introduced. Munsell chroma is shown to resemble inverted log luminance much more closely than inverted log <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> as claimed by previous researchers. The relationship is used in Part II to model chroma, colorfulness, and brightness. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Chromatic {{luminance}} (i. e., luminance of a monochromatic color) is {{the source}} of all luminance, since achromatic luminance arises only from mixing colors and their chromatic luminances. The ratio of chromatic luminance to total luminance (i. e., chromatic plus achromatic luminance) is known as <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity,</b> and its measurement has long been problematic for nonspectral hues. <b>Colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> (pc) is a luminance metric in contrast to excitation purity, which is a chromaticity-diagram metric approximating saturation. The CIE definition of pc contains a fallacy. CIE defines maximum (1. 0) pc for spectral stimuli as monochromatic (i. e., optimal) stimuli, and as the line between spectrum ends for nonspectrals. However, this line has < 0. 003 lm/W according to CIE colorimetric data and is therefore effectively invisible. It only represents the limit of theoretically attainable colors, and is of no practical use in color reproduction or color appearance. Required is a locus giving optimal rather than invisible nonspectral stimuli. The problem is partly semantic. CIE wisely adopted the term <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity,</b> rather than the original spectral luminance purity, to permit an equivalent metric for spectrals and nonspectrals, but the parameter of equivalence was never clear. Since 1 pc denotes optimal aperture-color stimuli for spectrals, arguably 1 pc should denote optimal stimuli consistently for all stimuli. The problem reduces to calculating optimal aperture-color stimuli ("optimal" in energy efficiency in color-matching) for nonspectrals, shown to comprise 442 + 613 nm in all CIE illuminants. This remedy merely requires redefinition of 1 pc for nonspectrals as the line 442 - 613 nm, and gives meaningful pc values over the hue cycle allowing new research of chromatic luminance relations with color appearance. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInfants show {{spontaneous}} looking preferences among isoluminant chromatic stimuli [Adams, R. J. (1987). An {{evaluation of}} color preferences in early infancy. Infant Behavior and Development, 10, 143 – 150; Bornstein, M. H. (1975). Qualities of color vision in infancy. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 19 (3), 401 – 419. ]. These differences in preference {{have often been}} called “hue” or “color” preferences, and attributed to differences in hue, but there are alternative explanations. Spontaneous preference variations remain after stimuli are equated for adult brightness, and thus cannot be attributed to adult-like brightness differences [Teller, D. Y., Civan, A., & Bronson-Castain, K. (2004). Infants’ spontaneous color preferences are not due to adult-like brightness variations. Visual Neuroscience, 21 (3), 397 – 401]. In the present paper, we address three more alternative explanations: colorimetric purity; infant detection thresholds; and adult-like variations in saturation. Three experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1 we measured infants’ spontaneous preferences for each of 22 different chromatic stimuli of varying dominant wavelength and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity,</b> each paired against the same white standard. In Experiment 2, we measured infants’ chromatic detection thresholds. In Experiment 3, adult subjects made saturation matches between a blue-green standard and each of five other chromatic stimuli. Infant detection thresholds accounted for 34 % {{of the variance in}} infant “hue” preferences, much more than <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> (2. 4 %) or adult saturation judgments (3 %), but none of the three variables accounted {{for the majority of the}} variance. In our view, the most likely remaining option is that infants’ spontaneous “hue” preferences indeed arise from preferences for the hues of stimuli that adults see as blue, purple and red...|$|E

Our results obtained with one hundred observers, eighty color samples of NCS, and two illuminants indicate that: (a) the shifts that are produced in the dominant wavelength with memory depend on the familiar object considered; (b) <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity,</b> as a measure of saturation, of the remembered objects {{is not the same as}} that of the familiar objects; (c) in the SVF representation space, with illuminant D 65 and regardless of experience in color matching of the observer, the color that was best remembered was purple aubergine and the worst remembered was brown chestnut.

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{chromatic}} adaptation {{is derived from}} Parts I and II, and presented in terms of relative wavelength, purity, and radiant power, leading directly to a predictive model of corresponding hue, chroma, and lightness. Considering that even simple animals have effective color vision and color constancy, {{the aim was to}} develop a simple model of complete adaptation. The model is tested against well-known data sets for corresponding colors in illuminants D 65, D 50, and A, and for small and large visual fields, and performs comparably to CIECAM 02. Constant hue is predicted from Part I’s mechanism of color constancy from invariant wavelength ratios, where constant hues shift wavelength linearly with reciprocal illuminant color temperature. Constant chroma is predicted from constant <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity.</b> Constant lightness is predicted from chromatic adaptation of spectral sensitivity represented by power ratios of complementary colors (rather than cone responses which lack spectral sharpening). This model is the first of its type and is not formatted for ease of computation. 18 page(s...|$|E

Although the {{spectral}} saturation discrimination function {{has been well}} documented for young observers, it has not been systematically investigated as a function of age. Kraft and Werner demonstrates significant age-related losses in <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> discrimination sensitivity. The differences between discrimination at 10 and 250 td was relatively small for the younger group but larger for the older group, indicating a selective performance decrement for older observers at low light levels. We talk about simultaneous color matching when this takes place between juxtaposed color samples and the gap time is zero. Successive, or memory, color matching takes place when we make comparisons between color stimuli separated by time, trying to match a present color to a memorized one, which obliges us to use memory. There is a lot of research related to color in memory. The aim of this work is to study the effect of age changes on chroma of 5 reference tests, using the methods of simultaneous and memory color matching...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} used similar {{methods to}} investigate the pigeon's perception of saturation of monochromatic lights. This trial-wise procedure consisted of brief presentations {{of positive and negative}} stimuli in random sequence. Pecks to the positive stimuli were occasionally reinforced on a low fixed-ratio schedule. The first study determined absolute thresholds for "white" and monochromatic lights by establishing a discrimination between lights of various radiances and a dark key. Experiment II investigated generalization from a white light to various monochromatic lights under conditions that minimized the use of luminance as a cue. The third experiment examined discrimination of various monochromatic lights along a <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> continuum; responses to white light were reinforced, while responses to lights that combined white and monochromatic lights in various proportions were not. The results indicated that lights of different wavelength differ in saturation, but that all are discriminable from white. Wavelengths between 550 and 600 nm are least saturated for the pigeon, and saturation increases markedly as wavelength decreases below this region of the spectrum...|$|E

The integration of information from these two separate systems is crucial for the visual system to produce a coherent percept. To investigate how luminance and color lights are perceived in time, we measured the perceived duration of light stimuli with and without colors in a paradigm involving simultaneous perception with presentation of two successive stimulus frames. Luminance contrast and color contrast of the stimuli were set with a chromatic substitution technique. In Experiment 1, the perceived duration of both chromatic stimuli and achromatic stimuli increased as the luminance contrast decreased. Experiment 2 tested if the duration of the percept was influenced by color contrast which was defined by <b>colorimetric</b> <b>purity</b> of the stimuli, when luminance contrast was set as low as practically possible. The result showed that the duration of the percept decreased with increasing color contrast of the stimuli. Moreover, Experiment 3 demonstrated that the trend of perceived duration was consistent with the four primary colors, provided that the effective color contrast of stimulus was corrected based on the contrast sensitivity to the color. These experiments indicate that, with a high luminance contrast level, perceived duration of a stimulus is predominantly defined by luminance contrast, whereas in low luminance contrast conditions, the duration depends on the color contrast. The perceived duration of color stimuli showed an " inverse color contrast effect", similar to the well-known " inverse intensity effect" for luminance stimuli.
