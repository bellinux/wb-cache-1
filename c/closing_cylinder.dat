The data were saved and evaluated considering system is working perfectly and faults are predetermined. These faults include having no bottle, a nonworking cap <b>closing</b> <b>cylinder</b> B, a nonworking bottle cap <b>closing</b> <b>cylinder</b> C, insufficient air pressure, water not filling and {{low air pressure}} faults. The signals of six sensors were collected during the entire sequence and the 18 most descriptive features of the data were encoded {{to present to the}} ANNs. Two different ANNs were applied for interpretation of the encoded signals. The ANNs tested in the study were learning vector quantization (LVQ) and radial basis network (RBN). The performance of LVQ and RBN was found to be fine with the presented procedures for a system having very repetitive sequential data...|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{artificial}} neural network is developed to find an error rapidly on pneumatic system. Also the ANN prevents the system versus the failure. The error on the experimental bottle filling plant can be defined without any interference using analog values taken from pressure sensors and linear potentiometers. The sensors and potentiometers are placed on different places of the plant. Neural network diagnosis faults on plant, where no bottle, cap <b>closing</b> <b>cylinder</b> B is not working, bottle cap <b>closing</b> <b>cylinder</b> C is not working, air pressure is not sufficient, water is not filling and low air pressure faults. The fault is diagnosed by {{artificial neural network}} with LVQ. It is possible to find an failure by using normal programming or PLC. The reason offing Artificial Neural Network is to give a information where the fault is. However, ANN {{can be used for}} different systems. The aim is to find the fault by using ANN simultaneously. In this situation, the error taken place on the pneumatic system is collected by a data acquisition card. It is observed that the algorithm is very capable program for many industrial plants which have mechatronic systems...|$|E

40|$|We give an {{estimate}} of the mean curvature of a complete submanifold lying inside a <b>closed</b> <b>cylinder</b> B(r) ×^ℓ in a product Riemannian manifold N^n-ℓ×^ℓ. It follows that a complete hypersurface of given constant mean curvature lying inside a <b>closed</b> circular <b>cylinder</b> in Euclidean space cannot be proper if the circular base is of sufficiently small radius. In particular, any possible counterexample to a conjecture of Calabion complete minimal hypersurfaces cannot be proper. As another application of our method, we derive a result about the stochastic incompleteness of submanifolds with sufficiently small mean curvature. Comment: First version (December 2008).

40|$|In {{reciprocating}} gas handling machinery, {{there is}} both a net or average heat transfer over many cycles between the gas and the environ-ment, and an instantaneous heat flux {{back and forth between}} the gas and the cylinder wall within each cycle. The latter phenomenon occurs both in open cylinder processes and in <b>closed</b> <b>cylinder</b> processes, where it results in what is sometimes referred to as "gas spring loss". This thesis addresses the instantaneous heat transfer as it occurs in a <b>closed</b> <b>cylinder</b> without combustion. In order to evaluate the effect of the heat transfer on the thermodynamic cycle of the gas taken as a whole, the heat transfer is spatially averaged over the boundary of the gas space. The T-S diagram, based on the mixed mean temperature and entropy of the gas, is shown to be an excellent indicator of instantaneous heat transfer process at the wall. The T-S diagram can be derived from measure-ments of pressure and volume for a fixed mass of gas, without any knowledg...|$|R

40|$|We {{compute the}} finite {{temperature}} Casimir energy for massive scalar field with general curvature coupling subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary {{conditions on the}} walls of a <b>closed</b> <b>cylinder</b> with arbitrary cross section, located in a background spacetime of the form M^d_ 1 + 1 ×N^n, where M^d_ 1 + 1 is the (d_ 1 + 1) -dimensional Minkowski spacetime and N^n is an n-dimensional internal manifold. The Casimir energy is regularized using the criteria that it should vanish in the infinite mass limit. The Casimir force acting on a piston moving freely inside the <b>closed</b> <b>cylinder</b> is derived and it is shown that it is independent of the regularization procedure. By letting one of the chambers of the cylinder divided by the piston to be infinitely long, we obtain the Casimir force acting on two parallel plates embedded in the cylinder. It is shown that if both the plates assume Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, the strength of the Casimir force is reduced by the increase in mass. Under certain conditions, the passage from massless to massive will change the nature of the force from long range to short range. Other properties of the Casimir force such as its sign, its behavior at low and high temperature, and its behavior at small and large plate separations, are found to be similar to the massless case. Explicit exact formulas and asymptotic behaviors of the Casimir force at different limits are derived. The Casimir force when one plate assumes Dirichlet boundary condition and one plate assumes Neumann boundary condition is also derived and shown to be repulsive. Comment: 28 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
