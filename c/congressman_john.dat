Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days to empanel a jury.

5|$|Goebel {{challenged}} the vote returns in several counties. While the challenges were being adjudicated, Goebel {{was shot by}} an unknown assassin; Goebel was ultimately declared {{the winner of the}} election, but died of his wounds two days after being sworn into office.

Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a conviction in July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in that city. He was the namesake of, but not related to, 20th century Kentucky <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> Y.

5|$|In the 1936 senatorial {{contest in}} Kentucky, {{incumbent}} Democrat Marvel Mills Logan {{was seen as}} vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W.

Brown, Sr., who believed that, {{in exchange for his}} support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler's political enemy {{for the rest of his}} political career.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{officials}} began to consider constructing a new station to serve both Amtrak trains and the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority, which {{had taken over}} private bus services {{in the area in}} 1974. Between 1993 and 1999, BRTA administrator Diane Smith worked to advance plans for an intermodal transit center. A study completed in January 1998 provided cost-benefit analysis and preliminary costs and recommended eight sites for further study. Based on this, <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> W. Olver obtained $8.615 million in federal earmarks to fund the project; the state provided the 20% local match to reach the full $11 million cost.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Marshall and Innes {{continued}} during Marshall's {{tenure in}} the legislature. When Innes, {{acting on a}} recommendation from an advisory jury, dismissed an unrelated fraud case brought by Marshall in Innes' district court, Marshall retaliated by convincing <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> Rowan to file an impeachment petition against Innes in the House of Representatives. Innes countered by having his son-in-law, Thomas Bodley, pursue a censure of Marshall in the state House. Rowan's petition against Innes failed, but Bodley's against Marshall succeeded, and Marshall was expelled from the House in 1808, only to be re-elected the following year.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E

5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E
5|$|In Paducah, Barkley {{worked as}} a law clerk for Charles K. Wheeler, an {{attorney}} and congressman for the district, accepting access to Wheeler's law library as payment for his services. Despite their political differences – Wheeler supported William Jennings Bryan and Free Silver, while Barkley identified with the Gold Democrats – he hoped that being acquainted with and taught by Wheeler would aid him in his future endeavors, but congressional duties frequently kept Wheeler away from the office. After two months, Barkley accepted an offer to clerk for Judge William Sutton Bishop and former <b>congressman</b> <b>John</b> Kerr Hendrick, who paid him $15 per month. He read law while completing his duties and {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1901. Barkley practiced in Paducah where a friend of Hendrick's appointed him reporter of the circuit court.

5|$|Willkie became {{active in}} the Akron Democratic Party, {{becoming}} prominent enough while still with Firestone to introduce the Democratic presidential nominee, Ohio Governor James M. Cox, {{when he came to}} town during the 1920 campaign. He was a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention, and supported New York Governor Al Smith through the record 103 ballots, when the nomination fell to former West Virginia <b>congressman</b> <b>John</b> W. Davis. More important to Willkie, though, was a fight against the Ku Klux Klan, which had become powerful in much of the nation and in the Democratic Party, but he and other delegates were unsuccessful in their attempt to include a plank in the party platform condemning the Klan. He also backed a proposed plank in support of the League of Nations that ultimately failed. In 1925, Willkie led a successful effort to oust Klan members on the Akron school board.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1820, Pierce entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, one of {{nineteen}} freshmen. He {{joined the}} Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside Jonathan Cilley (later elected to Congress) and Nathaniel Hawthorne (the author), {{with whom he}} formed lasting friendships. Last in his class after two years, he worked hard to improve his grades and in 1824 graduated in fifth place in a graduating class of fourteen. In Pierce's junior year, John P. Hale, a later political ally and then rival of Pierce's, also enrolled at Bowdoin. That year, Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company, the Bowdoin Cadets, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house until the noise caused him to demand it halt. The students rebelled and went on strike, an event Pierce was suspected of leading. During his final year at Bowdoin, he spent several months teaching at a school in rural Hebron, Maine, where his students included future <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> J. Perry, and he earned his first salary.|$|E
5|$|The rift in the Democratic party {{caused by}} the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's {{supporters}} were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement. The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower. Fundraising {{continued to be a}} major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions. The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts <b>Congressman</b> <b>John</b> F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father. John Kennedy indicated that he could not endorse Nixon, but {{that he would not be}} heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career. Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist.|$|E
