25|$|The proneural genes {{also have}} an {{important}} role in the development of distinct types of sensory organs, namely chordotonal organs (proprioceptorsthat detect mechanical and sound vibrations) and external sensory organs. Members of achaete-scute complex, such as achaete and scute, as well as ‘’atonal’’ and ‘’daughterless’’ confer to ectodermal cells the ability to become sensory mother cells (SMCs). In the development of sensory organs there are two main phases: determination and differentiation that may not be mechanistically separable. Proneural proteins are involved in both processes, through the activation of the downstream “differentiating genes” that in turn regulate the induction of sensory-organ-subtype characteristics. The specification of sensory organs by proneural genes is a complex process, since they elicit different cellular contexts. For instance, in Drosophila, atonal (ato) can promote the development of chordotonal organs, for the receptors of olfactory sense organs, depending on the imaginal disc in which it is expressed. In Drosophila’s embryogenesis, the proneural gene achaete is expressed in well-determined regions as in the endoderm, being responsible for the formation of particular sensory organs in the adult and larvae. According to Ruíz-Gomes and Ghysen (1993), this expression occurs in two distinct phases: a <b>competent</b> <b>state,</b> in which the proneural gene is expressed in a cell cluster; a determined state, in which a specific cell accumulate high levels of ‘’ac’’ transcripts, originating a neural precursor. The function of each of the ASC complex genes varies with the development state (larvae or adult). For example, in the adult state the ac and sc genes promote the differentiation of two sets of complementary sensory organs and ase gene as a minimal function, while in the larvae state ac and sc genes affect the same set of sensory organs and ase is responsible for the determination of a complementary set.|$|E

50|$|The catalytically <b>competent</b> {{protonation}} <b>state</b> (CCPS) is the catalytically active protonation {{state of}} an enzyme.An enzyme is a protein, which catalyzes a chemical reaction. Proteins and enzymes consist of amino acids, {{some of which}} are titratable (i.e. they can alter their charge when the pH of the solution changes), and an enzyme commonly needs a set of specific residues in its active site to occupy a specific protonation state to be catalytically active. An example of this phenomenon is provided by Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL) - a Lysozyme, which has two acidic residues in its active site that are important for catalytic activity: Glu35 and Asp 52. For HEWL to be catalytically active, Glu35 must be neutral (i.e. be protonated), whereas Asp 52 must be negatively charged (i.e. it has lost its proton).The protonation state Glu35H,Asp52- is thus the catatlytically <b>competent</b> protonation <b>state</b> of HEWL, where H denotes the protonated form of the Glu.|$|R

In the war that would engulf the National Party, the attack of the Queenslanders would be met with an equally determined defence in NSW. This would prove fundamental in breaking the Joh push.

The NSW National Party central executive supported Sinclair's leadership, the federal coalition, and the independence of the federal National Party.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} evidences {{have shown that}} protein function, regulation and degradation are intrinsicallylinked to the dynamic and fluctuating nature of protein ensembles. However, the effect of missense mutations on catalytic performance are often interpreted from conformational analyses derived from X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics and modeling, while effects on conformational fluctuations at the active site {{as the source of}} catalytic defects are rarely investigated. Here, we explore the role of conformational fluctuations in the catalytic efficiency of WT and three missense mutations in the UDP-Galactose 4 ´-epimerase (GALE) protein causing type III galactosemia. Using comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations and small angle X-ray scattering we correlate low NAD+ binding affinity in some mutants with an increased population of non-competent conformations for NAD+ binding. Proteolysis studies combined with thermodynamic calculations reveal that mutations affecting GALE catalytic performance favor larger conformational fluctuations at the N-terminal domain and NAD+ binding site, shifting the equilibrium towards non-binding <b>competent</b> <b>states</b> in the native ensemble. Therefore, we provide a novel ensemble-based thermodynamic mechanism to explain catalytic defects caused by missense mutations that links large and transient conformational fluctuations and loss of catalytic efficiency and substrate/coenzyme affinity. In the context of this mechanism, we propose that allosteric ligands aimed at modulating these transient conformational fluctuations might correct catalytic defects in inherited metabolic diseases, representing a different approach to current small ligand therapies which target the low stability, but notcatalytic defects, of mutations...|$|R

Thus, we hypothesize that these interactions, which also make the protein structure less flexible, help to lower the thermodynamic barrier of the DraIII-DNA complex to achieve the cleavage <b>competent</b> <b>state.</b> The low thermodynamic barrier allows the DraIII-star substrate complex to reach the cleavage <b>competent</b> <b>state</b> with less favorable binding interactions, hence the relatively high star activity of DraIII.
