5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is {{the optimum}} way of forming a <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E

40|$|The self-consistent Density Functional + Continuum QRPA {{approach}} (DF+CQRPA) {{provides a}} good description of the recent experimental beta-decay half-lives and delayed neutron emission branchings for the nuclei approaching to (and beyond) the neutron <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> N = 28; 50; 82.

5|$|Since {{there is}} no way to reach N = 184 close to the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the proton number past 118, but that also greatly diminishes the cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow the production of the more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the <b>closed</b> <b>shell.</b> 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way of reaching the centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha daughters are near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E
25|$|Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due {{to large}} overlap with {{neighboring}} wave functions {{means that there}} will be a large Fermi velocity; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> inner electrons simply wins from the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{algorithm}} using {{speech recognition}} technology {{was developed to}} distinguish pistachio nuts with <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> from those with open shells. It was observed that upon impact with a steel plate, nuts with <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> emit different sounds than nuts with open shells. Features extracted from the sound signals consisted of mel−cepstrum coefficients and eigenvalues obtained from the principle component analysis (PCA) of the autocorrelation matrix of the sound signals. Classification of a sound signal was performed by linearly combining the mel−cepstrum and PCA feature vectors. An important property of the algorithm {{is that it is}} easily trainable, as are most speech−recognition algorithms. During the training phase, sounds of nuts with <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> and with open shells were used to obtain a representative vector of each class. During the recognition phase, the feature vector from the sample under question was compared with representative vectors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{free vibration}} analysis of open and <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> with arbitrary boundary conditions using a spectro-geometric-Ritz method. In this method, {{regardless of the}} boundary conditions, each of the displacement components of open and <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> is represented simultaneously as a standard Fourier cosine series and several auxiliary functions. The auxiliary functions are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the series expansion and eliminate all the relevant discontinuities with the displacement and its derivatives at the boundaries. The boundary conditions are modeled using the spring stiffness technique. All the expansion coefficients are treated equally and independently as the generalized coordinates and determined using Rayleigh-Ritz method. By using this method, a unified vibration analysis model for the open and <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> with arbitrary boundary conditions can be established without the need of changing either the equations of motion or {{the expression of the}} displacement components. The reliability and accuracy of the proposed method are validated with the FEM results and those from the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{explanation of the}} spin-orbit coupling, in heavy nuclei, by second-order ·effects of the tensor forces is investigated. The various second order terms are described by 4 graphs, {{in the case of}} one particle outside <b>closed</b> <b>shells.</b> The main contribution comes from an exclusion effect: two particles of the <b>closed</b> <b>shells</b> cannot, by mutual excitation, jump into the orbit which is already occupied by the outside particle. This effect could account, at least partially, for the observed spin-orbit splitting. The case of a hole is also investigated, and shows the same kind of agreement.

25|$|For larger nuclei, {{the shells}} {{occupied}} by nucleons begin to {{differ significantly from}} electron shells, but nevertheless, present nuclear theory does predict the magic numbers of filled nuclear shells for both protons and neutrons. The closure of the stable shells predicts unusually stable configurations, analogous to the noble group of nearly-inert gases in chemistry. An example is {{the stability of the}} <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> of 50 protons, which allows tin to have 10 stable isotopes, more than any other element. Similarly, the distance from shell-closure explains the unusual instability of isotopes which have far from stable numbers of these particles, such as the radioactive elements 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium), each of which is preceded and followed by 17 or more stable elements.|$|E

2500|$|Möbius {{aromaticity}} {{occurs when}} a cyclic system of molecular orbitals, formed from pπ atomic orbitals and populated in a <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> by 4n (n is an integer) electrons, is given a single half-twist to form a Möbius strip. A π system with 4n electrons in a flat (non-twisted) ring would be antiaromatic, and therefore highly unstable, due to the symmetry of the combinations of p atomic orbitals. By twisting the ring, the symmetry of the system changes and becomes allowed (see also Möbius–Hückel concept for details). Because the twist can be left-handed or right-handed, the resulting [...] Möbius aromatics are dissymmetric or chiral. [...] But as of 2012, no Möbius aromatic molecules had been synthesized. Aromatics with two half-twists corresponding to the paradromic topologies were first suggested by Johann Listing. In carbo-benzene the ring bonds are extended with alkyne and allene groups.|$|E

2500|$|Pauli {{looked for}} an {{explanation}} for these numbers, which were at first only empirical. At {{the same time he}} was trying to explain experimental results of the Zeeman effect in atomic spectroscopy and in ferromagnetism. He found an essential clue in a 1924 paper by Edmund C. Stoner, which pointed out that, for a given value of the principal quantum number (n), the number of energy levels of a single electron in the alkali metal spectra in an external magnetic field, where all degenerate energy levels are separated, is equal to the number of electrons in the <b>closed</b> <b>shell</b> of the noble gases for the same value of n. This led Pauli to realize that the complicated numbers of electrons in closed shells can be reduced to the simple rule of one electron per state, if [...] the electron states are defined using four quantum numbers. For this purpose he introduced a new two-valued quantum number, identified by Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck as electron spin.|$|E
