5|$|Abbott asked Donen {{to appear}} in the <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He quickly became the show's {{assistant}} stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister.|$|E

In 1943, Daffy Duck sang a <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> it in Yankee Doodle Daffy.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six {{movements and}} scored it for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboes, strings and continuo.

5|$|I wish I could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on was the sense that one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E

2500|$|The choral {{lyrics of}} Alcman {{were meant to}} be {{performed}} within the social, political, and religious context of Sparta. Most of the existing fragments are lines from partheneia. [...] These hymns are sung by <b>choruses</b> <b>of</b> unmarried women, but it is unclear how the partheneia were performed. The Swiss scholar Claude Calame (1977) treats them as a type <b>of</b> drama by <b>choruses</b> <b>of</b> girls. He connects them with initiation rites.|$|R

5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov became {{especially}} appreciated within The Five, {{and among}} those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest.|$|E

5|$|Calleia {{began his}} stage career on Armistice Day. After World War I he found only limited success in vaudeville. He earned his living stoking the furnace at a {{department}} store, {{and got a}} night job washing and repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> the musical comedy, Have a Heart. The following season he had a bit part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour. Calleia supplemented his salary by working as assistant stage manager and repairing trunks at $3 each.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first, The Voyevoda, {{based on a}} play by Alexander Ostrovsky, premiered in 1869. The {{composer}} became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript. Undina followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed. Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called Mandragora, to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> Flowers and Insects.|$|E

5|$|Evancho saw {{the film}} version of the musical The Phantom of the Opera and liked it so much that her mother {{purchased}} the DVD; Evancho began singing the songs at home. Her parents have said that they did not recognize that her voice was unusual until her first talent competition, which she entered just before her 8th birthday. In the competition, Kean Idol, Evancho finished in second place. She began taking voice lessons and singing at various events, churches and nursing homes, mostly in Pennsylvania. She also started a YouTube channel, sang in the Children's Festival <b>Chorus</b> <b>of</b> Pittsburgh (now Pittsburgh Youth Chorus) during its 2008–09 season, and performed the title role in a 2009 school musical version of Little Red Riding Hood.|$|E
5|$|Fay Ripley (born 26 February 1966) is an English {{actress and}} recipe author. She is a {{graduate}} of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1990). Her first professional role was in the <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> a pantomime version of Around the World in 80 Days. Ripley's early film and television appearances were limited, so she supplemented her earnings by working as a children's entertainer and by selling menswear door-to-door. After her scenes as a prostitute were cut from Frankenstein (1994), Ripley gained her first major film role playing Karen Hughes in Mute Witness (1995).|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Boston was {{the site}} of the National Peace Jubilee, a massive gala to honor {{veterans}} and to celebrate the return of peace. Conceived by composer Patrick Gilmore, who had served in an army band, the celebration was held in a colossal arena in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood designed to hold 100,000 attendees and specifically built for the occasion. A new hymn was commissioned for the occasion, written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and set to American Hymn by Matthais Keller. Spanning five days, the event featured a <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> nearly 11,000 and an orchestra of more than 500 musicians. It was the largest musical gathering on the continent up to that time.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century there already existed several Romani <b>choruses</b> consisting <b>of</b> Ruska Roma who were servants.
