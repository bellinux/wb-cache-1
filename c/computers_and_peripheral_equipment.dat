40|$|The {{utilization}} {{and application}} of a desk-top micro-computer based system is described for data acquisition and control/or use in the velocity measurements in open channel flow. The technique of mea-suring point velocities along three axes simultaneously is approached in two phases: Firstly, recording of the velocity data, and secondly reproducing the velocity data. The system involves utilization of voltage data recorder which can translate the flow velocities obtained by sensor probes picking up the acoustic interference. A data acquisition control unit, a desk-top <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipments</b> which con-sist of distribution channels, printer and plotter terminals provide the necessary interpretation of the flow behaviour. When fluid flow through a curved open channel, {{there will be a}} steady redistribution of the velocities due to the interaction of the frictional, centrifugal and inertial forces. Secondary currents both in the lateral and vertical directions are pronounced than their existence in the straight channels, thus affecting the magnitude and direction of longstream velocities.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a project established in an out-of-school environment to study children using digital media, incorporating <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipment</b> such as digital cameras, in fun and informal ways. In this setting {{the students are}} supported {{to create their own}} digital media resources such as movies, web pages and animations. The project is an iteration of "The Fifth Dimension" - a world-wide network of similar sites in USA, Brazil, Mexico, Scandinavia and also in Barcelona, Spain. The Fifth Dimension (5 D) sites operate as diverse educational settings where researchers, teachers, students/pre-service tea-chers and children collaborate to create and sustain their community and activities. The concept of the Fifth Dimension evolved from research [1] dedicated to developing inclusive learning contexts where children who may not be successful in traditional classrooms could experience success in learning. This model of learning differs significantly to traditional schooling as it emphasises children’s potential as learners, teachers and active participants in their learning community. The use of technologies in informal learning settings is of considerable interest to educational research. It is commonly identified that children naturally access and use new technologies as part of their everyday lives [2] and therefore it is important to educators to find out how and what children learn through the informal use of digital technologies. Further, it is likely that we can learn from observing these interactions and use these ideas to help design new approaches to formal educatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{economy has}} shown a {{surprising}} decline {{in the rate of}} the nation’s energy intensity over the past three years. Measured as the number of Btu’s per dollar of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the average annual rate of change is about- 3. 4 percent for the period 1996 - 99. In absolute terms this is significantly greater than the- 2. 6 percent rate of change in the 1973 - 86 “oil crisis ” period. It is all the more surprising given the absence of any significant price signals or policy initiatives. Several recent papers have attempted to explain the change. One group of analysts cites the weather as the major contributor to the reduction in the nation’s energy intensity while a second group references structural change as a primary driver. The latter refers to major shifts away from the energy-intensive industries as a source of economic well being, toward the less energy-intensive commercial services and light manufacturing segments of the economy. This preliminary analysis is a further inquiry into this issue. The draft analysis extends the idea of structural change by examining the specific influence of the explosive growth within the information and communication technology (ICT) sectors. Preliminary evidence suggests that the growth in the ICT sectors — including the production of <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipment,</b> software and programming services, communication services, and electronic commerce — may explain {{a significant part of the}} sharp decline in energy intensity. Moreover, continued growth in these sectors may lessen the growth in energ...|$|E
40|$|Health {{informatics}} is the multidisciplinary {{field of}} study that uses computing and information technology (IT) to collect, store, interpret, and deliver health information to doctors, patients, and consumers. Health informatics applications have historically been limited by the computing and IT capabilities of the time, whether it be equipment cost, size, processing abilities or general availability. However, {{in the past two}} decades, personal <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipment</b> overcame these hurdles enabling an abundant amount of Electronic Healthcare (eHealth) applications, such as patient/doctor communication via telecommunication, electronic health record management, emergency information delivery, and medical data transmission. Furthermore, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming a dominant computing source in the consumer market with over 1 billion smartphone and tablet sales in 2013 alone. Because of their prevalence, inexpensive costs, processing power, and small form factor, mobile devices are also becoming primary computing devices in Health Informatics, satisfying Mobile Healthcare (mHealth) applications. This thesis discusses 4 mHealth applications and the corresponding tablet-apps developed to handle the health information. Specifically, each tablet-app has a particular focus in either the collection, interpretation, or delivery of health information. The applications of the 4 mHealth apps are: surveying youth in Swaziland, Africa to research the connections between relationship-oriented, psychological development and impoverished environments, pain classification for pain treatment of veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D), pressure ulcer prevention training for occupational therapists working with veterans with SCI/D, and self-health reporting and information delivery for senior citizens prescribed to anticoagulant medications. These apps aim to yield more extensive surveys and research studies, more standard diagnosis suggestions, less prevalence of pressure ulcers, and healthier senior citizens...|$|E

Following an introduction that distinguishes between relatively simple problems and those that are more complex, the paper first discusses techniques for managing group processes for complex problem-solving, including the complexity of the problem, the communication among the participants in the problem-solving, and the resources available to the group. Next, the paper identifies necessary components of group facilitation for complex problem-solving, including definite control of group process; problem identification preceding generation of alternatives; and use of tested, behaviorally and technically balanced group methodologies. The paper then analyzes five variables in the interactive management process, including <b>computer</b> hardware, software, <b>and</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> a specially designed room.

In the beginning of this decade, the Brazilian government created incentives to foster the acquisition of <b>computers,</b> <b>peripherals</b> <b>and</b> telecommunications <b>equipment</b> by allowing the importation of electronics devices at lower taxation rates. In 1991, the RNP started to expand and in 1992 its backbone covered 11 cities with 9.6 and 64  kbps links. In 1994, the RNP backbone covered all the Brazilian regions. Due to the Internet expansion during the beginning of this decade, the Brazilian Government created the Internet Steering Committee in Brazil (CGI.br—Comitê Gestor da Internet no Brasil) to coordinate and integrate all Internet initiative services in the country, promoting technical quality, innovation and dissemination of the services offered. The year 1995 was a milestone {{for the development of the}} commercial Internet. The Ministries of Communications, Science and Technology allowed the establishment of private Internet Service Providers (ISP), thus enabling the first commercial operations in Brazil. In 1999 the UOL launched the first Brazilian instant messenger software, called ComVC. In the end of this decade, the number of Internet users was more than 2.5 million. We can note that during this decade the Internet access started to become more democratic in Brazil, when all regions of the country became covered by the main backbone and also due to the development of the commercial Internet.|$|R
