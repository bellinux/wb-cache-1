50|$|In 1991, Tinklenberg {{headed the}} North Metro Mayors Association, which worked {{to improve the}} {{transportation}} systems and business opportunities of its member communities. During that time, he gained a reputation as an expert of transportation and infrastructure issues, which led to his appointment as Transportation Commissioner by then Governor Jesse Ventura in 1998. In that role, Tinklenberg worked with Ventura to support aggressive construction and improvement of highways statewide. He worked with the Minnesota State Legislature to create bipartisan support for a regional <b>commuter</b> <b>plan</b> for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

40|$|One {{potential}} {{solution to}} reducing peak hour congestion {{has been to}} identify a role for the employer in reducing car-based travel to work and promoting more sustainable alternatives through comprehensive 'employee travel plans' (Rye, T., 1995. Employee Transport Plans [...] An Easy Means to Cut Congestion? The 23 rd European Transport Forum, Proceedings of Seminar B, Planning for Sustainability, PTRC, pp. 229 - 241). In the UK such plans have seen a steady increase in interest since the early 1990 s culminating in their recognition in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions DETR, 1998 (DETR, 1998. A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone, The Government's White Paper on the Future of Transport, HMSO, London) Transport White Paper as a policy tool for reducing car-based travel. Despite their inclusion as a policy tool little information exists on the views of employers towards such plans (Rye, T., 1995. Employee Transport Plans [...] An Easy Means to Cut Congestion? The 23 rd European Transport Forum, Proceedings of Seminar B, Planning for Sustainability, PTRC, pp. 229 - 241; Rye, T., MacLeod, M., 1998. An Investigation of Employer Attitudes to Employer Transport Plans, AET European Transport Conference 1998, Policy Planning and Sustainability Seminar (Seminar C), vol. 2, PTRC). This is of considerable concern given that employers by default are the key implementers. Studies to date on employers' attitudes have concentrated on {{the views of the}} large employer (over 100 employees). The Transport White Paper however suggests that there is also a role for the small employer. This paper therefore investigates the attitudes and policy of the small employer (under 100 employees) towards staff travel and green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans.</b> The paper is based on the analysis of data collected in 1998 from 352 small Oxfordshire employers. The research was funded under the DETR's Seedcorn Research Programme. The paper outlines selected findings of this research, and concludes by suggesting that while ultimately there should be a role for the small employer in developing green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans</b> it is the large firms that are more likely to implement green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans</b> in the short term. In policy terms, the continuing focus of green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans</b> on large employers is therefore the best way forward. In the long term however consideration needs to be given to the role that the small employer can play in reducing employee travel. ...|$|R

A {{structural}} equations model is developed to examine <b>commuter's</b> <b>planning</b> decisions about activities and modes during a work day. The model is applied to the problem of selecting commuter rail in the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina. On a typical weekday, a commuter's mode choice is affected by activities at the destination. However, when the commuter is faced with a mix of travel modes over time, the mode choice becomes a significant predictor of non-work/school activities.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{energy efficiency}} in the EU, {{both in terms}} of reductions in energy intensity and in terms of physical indicators, looking at the differences among sectors and among Member States. We test econometrically the existence of convergence in energy intensity across Europe. We find a sensible catching–up of less performing countries, particularly in the agricultural and in the industrial sectors. Against this background, we analyse the role played by energy policies in EU Member States and we identify the most effective classes of policies and measures by means of a panel analysis of the EU- 15 and Norway. It turns out that, in the residential sector, energy efficiency is particularly affected by heating regulations, by subsidies as well as tax reductions; in the transport sector, effective policies are tax reductions, incentives to eliminate old and polluting cars, car sharing, <b>commuter</b> <b>plan</b> and traffic management; in the industrial sector, mandatory technology standards, financing at low interest rate, information activities, education and outreach proved to be effective. ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{agencies}} offer discounted tolls to E-ZPass customers.

Many of these plans are available only to customers whose tags are issued by the agency that owns the toll facility in question (reciprocity applies to tag acceptance, not to discounts). Eight authorities in the Northeast (Maine, the Massachusetts Turnpike, the New Hampshire Turnpike, Rhode Island, the NYC TBTA, the New Jersey Turnpike, DelDOT) and Maryland restrict their general discounts to their own respective tagholders.
