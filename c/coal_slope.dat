40|$|Use of coal ash as {{structural}} fill {{to support}} footings in low-lying areas {{can be a}} cost-effective solution to ash disposal problems. In some applications, especially when footings are constructed near {{the crest of the}} ash fill slope, this ash disposal solution may not meet the foundation requirements due to poor load-bearing capacity. Inclusion of horizontal geosynthetic reinforcements within the fill {{may be one of the}} most viable solutions in improving the loadbearing capacity of <b>coal</b> ash <b>slope.</b> Most information available in the literature for reinforced soil slope is based on small-scale laboratory model tests but field tests on prototype foundations give more realistic results. In view of the difficulties in accurately modeling full-scale behavior with small-scale laboratory models, practitioner generally does not adopt this result in the field. Therefore in the present investigation, large-scale model footing tests on reinforced <b>coal</b> ash <b>slope</b> were conducted in the laboratory. Prototype geogrid was used as reinforcement.

40|$|The use of coal ash in {{structural}} fills {{to support}} footings and pavements in low lying areas {{can be one}} of the cost effective and environmentally friendly solutions to disposal problems related to coal ash, because wastes can be consumed in large quantities in such applications. The difficulty with this ash disposal solution is that the structural fills may not meet the foundation requirements for bearing capacity and settlement, especially when footings and pavements are constructed near the crest of the ash fill slope. Inclusion of geosynthetic reinforcements as horizontal sheets within the fill may be one of the most viable techniques for improving the load bearing capacity of the <b>coal</b> ash <b>slope.</b> Most technical information available in the literature on the load bearing capacity of footings resting on the slopes is based on small scale laboratory model tests; hence practicing engineers cannot generally adopt the information realistically. Therefore, in the present study as described in this paper, large scale model footing tests were conducted in the laboratory to find out the effectiveness of use of single and multilayer geosynthetic reinforcements in improving the load bearing capacity of <b>coal</b> ash <b>slope.</b> The results were found to be encouraging and they may have practical applications...|$|R

5000|$|According to Steam{{locomotive}}.com, By the mid-1800s, most {{steam locomotive}} tenders {{consisted of a}} fuel bunker (that held coal or wood) surrounded by a [...] "U" [...] shaped (when viewed from the top) water jacket. The overall shape of the tender was usually rectangular. The bunker which held the <b>coal</b> was <b>sloped</b> downwards toward the locomotive providing easier access to the coal. The ratio of water to fuel capacities of tenders was normally based on two water-stops to each fuel stop because water was more readily available than fuel. One pound of coal could turn six pounds of water (0.7 gallons) to steam. Therefore, tender capacity ratios were normally close to 14 tons of coal per 10,000 gallons of water.|$|R

Bureau of Mines (USBM) report {{summarizes}} a field {{demonstration of}} pneumatic backfilling technologies {{conducted at the}} abandoned Hillside <b>Coal</b> and Iron <b>Slope</b> in Vandling, P A. Researchers demonstrated two pneumatic backfilling technologies recently developed under the USBM's Abandoned Mine Reclamation Research Program, the Pneumatic Pipefeeder and the High-Efficiency Ejector. Both systems had previously been evaluated at the USBM's subsidence abatement investigation laboratory near Fairchance, P A. The objective of the demonstration was to fill 100 % of the abandoned tunnel with backfill stone to prevent further subsidence. The Pneumatic Pipefeeder was used for 21 days, {{at a rate of}} 63 to 124 t/ d (69 to 136 st/d), to fill 88 % of the tunnel. The High-Efficiency Ejector was used for 2 days, at a rate of 125 to 132 t/d (138 to 146 st/d) to fill the remaining 12 % of the tunnel. The backfill placed by both systems was tightly compacted. The major problem encountered was wear on the polyethylene pipeline from the abrasion of the high-velocity backfill. The use of heavier steel pipe minimized the problem.

50|$|In 1978, Kealy Mines {{commenced}} explorations in the area. The name {{derived from}} the surnames of its two principals, Patrick Keating, a civil engineer originally from Ballylooby in Tipperary and Gilbert Howley, a native of Co. Mayo. As a student, Keating had worked for O'Brien at the Gurteen pit before emigrating {{to work on the}} M1 motorway in England. He returned to Ireland in the early sixties and later became involved with Howley in the latter's civil engineering and excavation business. They reopened workings at Lickfinn, near the village of New Birmingham, which accessed the <b>coal</b> by <b>slope</b> mining. Initially the mines employed 34 miners and the Electricity Supply Board expressed an interest in using Ballingarry coal for the generation of power and so reduce its dependence on imported oil. However, in preliminary testing at a power station designed to burn peat, the high temperatures produced by the anthracite caused its fire-grates to overheat. Coal dust was supplied to the Irish Sugar processing plant at Thurles and they became an important customer. Financing also proved a difficulty for Kealy Mines, and it was acquired by a Canadian consortium in 1982. Flair Resources Ltd., trading as Tipperary Anthracite was headed by John Young, a Tipperary emigrant to Canada. The new company expanded the workforce to 80 and transferred surface processing such as washing, screening and bagging to the old pithead at Gurteen. It also opened a second underground 'cutting' and investigated exploiting the more marginal No. 1 seam. An electrically powered coal-cutter was employed and investment allowed some further modernisation of plant. Extraction concentrated on the No. 2 seam, with its reserves estimated at that time to be 3 million tonnes. By 1985, Tipperary Anthracite was also in receivership. Financial irregularities regarding IDA grants were investigated by the Gardaí and highlighted on RTÉ current affairs programme 'Today Tonight'. In 1989, Emereld Resources was granted a licence to reopen the mines and for a while sporadic work continued at Lickfinn-Earl's Hill.|$|R
40|$|Mining {{operations}} at Nanyang-Slope Coal Mine are considerably challenging. The Nanyang- <b>Slope</b> <b>Coal</b> Field has a complex tectonic structure; having major faults, large fissures and fracture- zones, and great changes in coal-seam thickness. Mine tunnel-way 301 traverses multiple complex faults with developed fractures, broken surrounding rock, and high tectonic stresses. The original rectangular-section tunnel design using anchor-bolt-mesh retainment {{was prone to}} rib-spalling, and the problem could not be controlled by use of additional encryption anchors on the tunnel sides. The mud-rock above the tunnel-ceiling is soft and argillized, which expands and softens on contact with water. This caused problems with the epoxy bonding agent failing to effectively secure bolt-anchors to the rock, resulting in anchor-bolt-mesh failure. In consideration of the complex geological conditions, a tunnel construction utilizing a curved wall arch-section and anchor-bolt- mesh-concrete spray was proposed. MJ- 40 anchor-rod dynamometers were {{used to measure the}} forces in the tunnel rock-anchor bolts; and tunnel-rock deformation and surface displacement was monitored {{over the course of several}} weeks using a measuring station. Results show that the construction design effectively lowers the effects of the tectonic stresses on any one part of the tunnel, and demonstrates the safety and reliability of the tunnel-retainment and support design. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rock mass {{in nature}} {{tend to be}} unideal, for it is heterogeneous, {{anisotropic}} and has discontinuity. The discontinuity makes anisotropic strength and stress in the rock mass, and also controls {{the changing of the}} elastic properties of rock mass. This condition results to disruptions in the rock mass strength balance, and finally drives the slopes to collapse. This study aims to determine the slope failure mechanisms in the area of case study, as well as its variations based on the Rock Mass Rating (RMR), Geological Strength Index (GSI), Slope Mass Rating (SMR), kinematic analysis, numerical analysis and monitoring approach slope movement in a <b>coal</b> mine <b>slope</b> applications. The site investigations were implemented to obtain information about slope collapse. Prior to the collapse, the slope inclination was 38 ° with of 94 meters height, strike slope of N 245 E and direction of slope surface of 335 °. After the collapse, the slope was became 25 º; and after the collapse materials were cleared, it was 35 º. The discontinuity mapping obtained 5 sets of discontinuities, and the data were developed to obtain the value of RMR. The result of piezometer measurements was that at occurrence of collapse, slope elevation was 44. 40 m. Displacement value from monitoring SSMR showed that when the slope was collapsing in two stages, the first stage value was 70. 61 cm (a more critical condition, the value was rounded down to 70 cm to the implementation in modelling) and the second stage value was at 124. 25 cm. The value of RMR 89 in this study was greater than the value of GSI and SMR. As for the average value, it was obtained 34. 67 for RMR 89 value and 29. 67 for GSI value, these rocks then can be classified into Poor Rock class number IV. The result of kinematic analysis found that sliding planar failure at dips 36 °, and wedge failure at dips 36 °, 35 ° and 34 °. Acquisition SMR value obtained at 25, 27, 28 and 29. The SMR values classified the rock mass quality into class number IV, the description of the rock mass was relatively poor, the slope stability was low or unstable and the collapse manifold was planar or wedge failure. The result from the analysis of the model with its criteria obtained was that un-collapse conditions at angle 29 °. It is recommended to use 29 ° angle to repair the slopes, and also recommended for overall high wall slope angle. Type of collapse that occurred on the slope failure mechanisms in all of the analysis that has been done, it is known that the mechanisms involved are complex types (combine of wedge failure, planar failure, and step-path failure) or classified into large scale rock slope failure surface...|$|R
