5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking. A player <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> the Kinect sensor {{to control the}} protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets and other features from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have {{included}} all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, boats, jet-skis, fixed-wing aircraft, and military vehicles. Reviewers have compared these games {{based on the number}} of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The {{co-monomer}} {{is typically}} dioxolane but ethylene oxide <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used.</b> Dioxolane is formed by reaction of ethylene glycol with aqueous formaldehyde over an acid catalyst. Other diols <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used.</b>|$|R

5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, but they <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} with adventure elements. The basic {{mechanics of the}} games are largely {{the same as their}} predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is viewed from a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III in a post-apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which {{survivors}} {{from the war}} have gathered. The player assumes the role the eponymous female protagonist, Angel, as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend. The game is played from a bird's eye view as the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles. Players can find more powerful guns to attach {{to the car and}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylamine <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thionine is a {{strongly}} staining metachromatic dye, which {{is widely used}} for biological staining.

50|$|Bootstrapping {{approaches}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used.</b>|$|R
5|$|Metroid: Other M is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to feature melee attacks. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques, such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range. Unlike other Metroid games, enemies do not drop items, with the {{restoration}} of health and ammo occurring either by using the Navigation Booths, or employing of the Concentration technique, where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health. Players <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> the Navigation Booths to save their progress. While there are power-ups scattered around the Bottle Ship, a few items are already equipped by Samus, but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes her to do so. Players can find items that will augment Samus's abilities, such as Energy and Missile Tanks.|$|E
5|$|Mission {{objectives}} vary {{in quantity}} and length {{depending on the}} difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings also affect enemy accuracy and damage, {{and the availability of}} the game's optional automatic aiming assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K can be used with or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a laser beam to open locks. In some missions, the player <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> night vision or X-ray vision glasses to outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
50|$|Sleep logs {{are often}} {{hand-drawn}} on graph paper, {{as a rule}} one week per page. Specialized software for creating sleep logs is also available; a spreadsheet or database software <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used.</b> Online services <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> to track daily sleep patterns.|$|R
50|$|It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> on billboards.|$|R
50|$|Rear-wheel drive (RWD) {{typically}} {{places the}} engine {{in the front}} of the vehicle, with a driveshaft running the length of the vehicle to the differential transmission. However, mid engine and rear engine layouts <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E
5|$|Shantae is a {{platform}} adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas {{in order to}} stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her hair like a whip. Shantae <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life-restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them. In order to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing in the background, and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas or find hidden items.|$|E
5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E
50|$|It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> as a {{mouthwash}} when diluted, and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> as {{a general}} disinfectant. A Pfizer representative in South Africa stated that if diluted, {{it can be used}} as a vaginal douche, although the safety of this has not been fully ascertained.|$|R
5000|$|ATM cards <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> on improvised ATMs such as [...] "mini ATMs", merchants' card {{terminals}} {{that deliver}} ATM features without any cash drawer. These terminals <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> as cashless scrip ATMs by cashing the receipts they {{issue at the}} merchant's point of sale.|$|R
50|$|Uvular fluttertonguing <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> when an {{alveolar}} trill is {{not appropriate}} to achieve the effect of fluttertonguing, e.g. in the low range of the flute, or when a faster fluttertongue is desired. Fluttertonguing <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> {{in conjunction with other}} types of articulation.|$|R
5|$|The Majin Tensei {{titles are}} {{strategy}} {{games in which}} the player takes {{the role of a}} human character who battles against demons. They navigate a field – seen in a top-down perspective in Majin Tensei and in a three-quarters perspective starting in Majin Tensei II – with characters represented by small, stick figure-like sprites, and switch to scenes with large, detailed characters when engaging in battle; in the first Majin Tensei, only the opponent is shown in battle scenes, while Majin Tensei II uses a split-screen presentation to show both sides. Ronde is an exception, and instead uses 3D graphics with a scrolling camera. On the field, the player can access pools that regenerate their energy, and starting in Majin Tensei II, they can use the terrain to gain an advantage in battles, increasing their defense rating. The player <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> items, which are bought using money they earn from battles. To attack enemies or support allies, the player needs to move their units on the field so that they are adjacent to the target of the action.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in NOLF was significantly advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following the footprints for example, and can sound alarms or call for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery. Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The combat of {{the game}} borrows {{multiple}} elements from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, with players having the ability to free-aim Lara's bow and the guns she salvages, engage in close-quarter combat and perform stealth kills. Players <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>use</b> Survival Instinct, an ability in which enemies, collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players. The game also incorporates RPG elements: as players progress through the game, they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in-game challenges linked with hunting, exploring and combat: this enables players' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways, such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition. Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island. There is also a character progression mechanic in the game: better items, weapons and equipment are gained as players progress, though the appearance of most of these items is closely linked to events in the story. In addition to the main story, players can complete multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit locations, and search for challenge tombs.|$|E
