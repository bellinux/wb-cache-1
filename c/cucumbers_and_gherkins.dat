According to the 2012 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization, Iran has been among the world's top five producers of apricots, cherries, sour cherries, <b>cucumbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkins,</b> dates, eggplants, figs, pistachios, quinces, walnuts, and watermelons.|$|E
5000|$|Lebanon {{produces}} {{a variety of}} primary products for both export and domestic consumption. Lebanese agricultural exports are mainly concentrated in the Arab League countries. In 2003, exported commodities had an approximate amount of 350,000 metric tons to the surrounding region (mainly Saudi Arabia) with potatoes being the most growing vegetable (30% of total exports). Other regions that import Lebanese agricultural products include the North American countries (3,123 metric ton and 1% of total exports in 2003) mainly USA which imports products such as almonds, apricots, beans, <b>cucumbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkins,</b> nuts edible and orange juice along with other EU members.

40|$|The performance, competitiveness, major {{destinations}} <b>and</b> {{determinants of}} <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkin</b> export from India have been studied.

It has been observed that India has made tremendous progress in the export of <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkin</b> products during the past 15 years (1990 - 2005). The export has increased by about 128. 5 -times with an impressive annual compound growth rate of 37. 46 per cent, as against only 4. 38 per cent in the world market.

The major export destinations for <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkin</b> have been identified as France, USA, Russia, Belgium and Spain. An increasing and high value of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) and a positive and increasing value for revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA) have indicated high potential in their export, particularly for the provisionally-preserved and prepared/preserved products. One per cent increase in volume of international trade in <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkin</b> may increase the demand from India by 5. 96 per cent. This indicates that India is highly competitive in export of <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkin</b> <b>and</b> has ample scope to further increase its export. The study has also revealed that exchange rate is a more dominant determinant of export from India than price of commodity. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
50|$|According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> <b>gherkin</b> {{production}} in 2013, China produced 76% {{of the global}} output, followed by Turkey, Iran, Russia and Ukraine (table).|$|R
5000|$|ZYMV affects all {{cucurbits}} including pumpkins, squashes, vegetable marrows, courgettes, melons, watermelons, <b>cucumbers,</b> <b>gherkins</b> <b>and</b> various gourds especially zucchinis. The {{effects are}} severe leaf mosaic, yellowing and eventually [...] "shoestring" [...] symptoms in the leaves. The fruits are stunted, twisted and deformed by raised protuberances, which reduces yield {{and makes them}} unmarketable in some cultures. In cultivated crops plants cease producing marketable fruits within 1-2 weeks of infection and serious financial losses can occur, particularly in courgette and marrow crops.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{was used to}} investigate the effects of changes in root temperature, {{of changes in the}} area of root in contact with culture solution and of day/night rhythm on the water balance of a <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> a <b>gherkin</b> plant. Results are discussed in terms of water potential, flow rate and resistance using a previously presented model of water balance. As long as water uptake alone is varied, flow rate and water content (or potential) will change in the same direction. In contrast, from that model it is predicted that changes in transpiration will affect flow rate and water content in opposite ways. An experimental verification of this prediction was given in the previous paper. Results obtained by the NMR method are compared to those determined using a dendrometer. The results demonstrate that the NMR method is a valuable tool to study plant water balance and that it can serve as a technique for discriminating between changes in plant water balance that are due to changes in water uptake by roots and those due to changes in transpiration...|$|R

30|$|The {{productivity}} {{increased as}} re-cropping years increasing, but the yield decreased obviously after 5 yrs re-cropping, this indicted that {{degradation of soil}} quality was occurred. The increase of fungus and bacteria number became main factors of soil degradation as re-cropping years increasing. The cropping models of <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> greengrocery, <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> cowpea showed significant higher cucumber yield, the second higher yield appeared in the cropping models between <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> maize for green manure, <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> tomato, <b>cucumber</b> <b>and</b> kidney bean. Therefore, that was effective method to use different cropping rotation models for decreasing number of microbe in soil, to prevent from soil degradation in greenhouse to fallow three or four month or to plant leguminous during summer season after winter-spring season cucumber harvested.|$|R
