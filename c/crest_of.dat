5|$|Although not {{represented}} {{in the form of}} a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. The <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire, however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.|$|E

5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post {{for much of the}} day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the hill {{that made up the}} pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} pterosaurs {{featured}} elaborate crests. The first and {{perhaps best known}} {{of these is the}} distinctive backward-pointing <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> some Pteranodon species, though a few pterosaurs, such as the tapejarids and Nyctosaurus, sported extremely large crests that often incorporated keratinous or other soft tissue extensions of the bony crest base.|$|E

5|$|The hollow <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Hypacrosaurus {{most likely}} had social functions, {{such as a}} visual signal {{allowing}} individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises.
