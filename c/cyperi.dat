40|$|The mutual-assistance {{compatibility}} of <b>Cyperi</b> Rhizoma (Xiangfu, XF) and Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui, DG), Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Chuanxiong, CX), Paeoniae Radix Alba (Baishao, BS), or Corydalis Rhizoma (Yanhusuo, YH), {{found in}} a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) named Xiang-Fu-Si-Wu Decoction (XFSWD), can produce synergistic and promoting blood effects. Nowadays, XFSWD has been proved {{to be effective in}} activating blood circulation and dissipating blood stasis. However, the role of the herb pairs synergistic effects in the formula were poorly understood. In order to quantitatively assess the compatibility effects of herb pairs, mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics studies were performed. The plasma and urine metabolic profiles of acute blood stasis rats induced by adrenaline hydrochloride and ice water and administered with <b>Cyperi</b> Rhizoma—Angelicae Sinensis Radix (XD), <b>Cyperi</b> Rhizoma—Chuanxiong Rhizoma (XC), <b>Cyperi</b> Rhizoma—Paeoniae Radix Alba (XB), <b>Cyperi</b> Rhizoma—Corydalis Rhizoma (XY) were compared. Relative peak area of identified metabolites was calculated and principal component analysis (PCA) score plot from the potential markers was used to visualize the overall differences. Then, the metabolites results were used with biochemistry indicators and genes expression values as parameters to quantitatively evaluate the compatibility effects of XF series of herb pairs by PCA and correlation analysis. The collective results indicated that the four XF herb pairs regulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. XD was more prominent in regulating the blood stasis during the four XF herb pairs. This study demonstrated that metabolomics was a useful tool to efficacy evaluation and compatibility effects of TCM elucidation...|$|E

40|$|During December/January 1996 / 97 typical summer {{syndrome}} (hyperthermia and a 30 % drop in milk yield) {{occurred in}} succession in two Holstein dairy herds (n = 240 and n = 150 milking cows, respectively) on the South African Highveld. These farms are {{situated in the}} midst of the prime maize and dairy farming areas of South Africa where this condition had never been diagnosed before. The individual components of the concentrate on both farms were negative for ergot alkaloids. Endophytic fungi and/or ergot infestation of teff and other grasses fed to the cows were then suspected of being involved, but neither endophytes nor ergot alkaloids could be implicated from these sources. By measuring the serum prolactin levels of groups of sheep (n = 5) fed the first farm's total mixed ration (TMR) or its three individual fibre components for a period of 11 days, the source of the ergot alkaloids was identified. A statistically significant decrease in the level of this hormone occurred only in the group on maize silage (which constituted 28 % on dry matter base of the TMR). The involvement of the maize silage was further chemically confirmed by the high levels of total ergot alkaloids, predominantly ergocryptine, found by LC-MS in the silage as well as in the TMR (115 - 975 ppb and 65 - 300 ppb, respectively). The ergot alkaloid content (mainly ergocryptine) of the maize silage on the second affected farm was 875 ppb. Withdrawal of contaminated silage resulted in gradual recovery of stock on both farms. Nut sedge (Cyperus esculentus and Cyperus rotundus of the family Cyperaceae) has a world-wide distribution and is a common weed in annual crops, and can be parasitized by Claviceps <b>cyperi.</b> Careful examination of the maize silage from both farms revealed that it was heavily contaminated with nut sedge and that it contained minute sclerotia, identified as those of Claviceps <b>cyperi,</b> originating from the latter. Nut sedge was abundant on both farms and it is believed that late seasonal rain had resulted in mature, heavily ergotised nut sedge being cut with the silage. Claviceps <b>cyperi</b> sclerotia, collected on the affected fields in the following autumn contained 3 600 - 4 000 ppm ergocryptine. That the dominant alkaloid produced by this particular fungus was indeed ergocryptine, was confirmed by negative ion chemical ionization MS/MS. In one further outbreak in another Holstein herd, teff hay contaminated with ergotised nut sedge and containing 1 200 ppb alkaloids, was incriminated as the cause of the condition. This is the first report of bovine ergotism not associated with the Poaceae infected with Claviceps purpureum or endophytes but with the family Cyperaceae and this particular fungal phytopathogen. </span...|$|E
40|$|Xiang-Qi-Tang (XQT) is a Chinese {{medicine}} containing Rhizoma <b>Cyperi</b> (40 g), Andrographis paniculata (30 g) and Astragalus membranaceus (30 g). The {{purpose of}} this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of XQT on Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) -infected chickens. The chickens were pretreated with XQT 12 h before being inoculated with 108 colony forming unit (CFU) of APEC by subcutaneous injection, and then the mortality and the indexes of health status of chicken in each group were detected. The results showed that high dosage and middle dosage of XQT could significantly decrease the mortality of the chickens challenged with APEC. We further found that XQT improved the infected chickens’ health status through improving the water consumption, feed intake, bodyweight gain, routine blood parameters and decreasing the incidences of pericarditis and perihepatitis. The results of present study suggest that XQT can effectively treat chicken colibacillosis as a potential agent. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of <b>Cyperi</b> Rhizoma extracts (CRE) using in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of CRE against 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity using tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry (IHC) in primary rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. In addition, the effect of CRE was evaluated in mice PD model induced by 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). For evaluations, C 57 bl/ 6 mice were orally treated with CRE 50 mg/kg for 5 days and were injected intraperitoneally with MPTP (20 mg/kg) at 2 h intervals on the last day. To identify the CRE affects on MPTP-induced neuronal loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum of mice, the behavioral tests and IHC analysis were carried out. Also, we conducted nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) assay in dopaminergic neurons and IHC using glial markers in SNpc of mice to assess the anti-inflammation effects. Results: In primary mesencephalic culture system, CRE protected dopaminergic cells against 10 µM MPP+-induced toxicity at 0. 2 and 1. 0 µg/mL.

Shuan-Tong-Ling is a formula used to treat brain diseases including ischemic stroke, migraine, and vascular dementia. Shuan-Tong-Ling attenuated H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in rat microvascular endothelial cells. However, the potential mechanism involved in these effects is poorly understood. Rats were intragastrically treated with 5. 7 or 17. 2 mL/kg Shuan-Tong-Ling for 7 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced. The results indicated Shuan-Tong-Ling had a cerebral protective effect by reducing infarct volume and increasing neurological scores. Shuan-Tong-Ling also decreased tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 1 β levels in the hippocampus on the ischemic side. In addition, Shuan-Tong-Ling upregulated the expression of SIRT 1 and Bcl- 2 and downregulated the expression of acetylated-protein 53 and Bax. Injection of 5 mg/kg silent information regulator 1 (SIRT 1) inhibitor EX 527 into the subarachnoid space once every 2 days, four times, reversed the above changes. These results demonstrate that Shuan-Tong-Ling might benefit cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing inflammation and apoptosis through activation of the SIRT 1 signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{systematically}} {{assess the}} clinical effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) {{in the treatment}} of functional dyspepsia (FD) of liver-stomach disharmony syndrome by meta-analysis. MethodsRandom controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from databases, including Pubmed, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Information, and the Cochrane Library. Trials were selected according to inclusion criteria. The effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) versus prokinetic agents {{in the treatment of}} functional dyspepsia (FD) of liver-stomach disharmony syndrome were compared by meta-analysis. RevMan 5. 0. 24 was used for data analysis. The effective rate was assessed by odds ratios (ORs), and 95 % confidence intervals (Cls) were calculated. The cure rate was analyzed by the Peto OR. Simple statistical analysis was chosen to assess the frequency of prescribed Chinese herbs in treating this syndrome. ResultsThirteen trials were included, involving 1153 patients, and these were of poor methodological quality. Twelve studies mentioned the effective rate and cure rate. TCM therapy showed a better clinical effect rate compared with that with prokinetic agents [OR: 3. 2, 95 % CI (2. 27, 4. 51) ]. The TCM group also had a better cure rate than that in the group of prokinetic agents [Peto OR: 2. 26, 95 % CI (1. 61, 3. 18) ]. With regard to the frequency of Chinese herbs used in these 13 trials, Baishao (Radix Paeoniae), Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri), and Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) were mostly prescribed, followed by Xiangfu (Rhizoma <b>Cyperi),</b> Zhishi (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus), Zhiqiao (Fructus Aurantii), Foshou (Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis), and Chenpi (Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae). No serious adverse effects were reported. ConclusionTCM therapy shows a superior effective rate and cure rate compared with those in prokinetic agents in the treatment of FD of liver-stomach disharmony syndrome. However, further strictly designed RCTs are required because of the poor quality of included trials...|$|E

40|$|FUNGI, GRASSES AND SEDGES INVOLVED: Festuca spp. (Neotyphodium coenophialum) Lolium spp. (Claviceps purpurea) Cyperus esculentus (Clacviceps <b>cyperi).</b> DISTRIBUTION: Cyperus esculentus Yellow nutsedge (English), Geeluintjie (Afrikaans). Grows in moist, {{disturbed}} places. Festuca spp. Fescue grass (English / Afrikaans). Lolium spp. Annual {{rye grass}} (English), Eenjarige raaigras (Afrikaans). BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Cyperus esculentus Yellow nutsedge (English), Geeluintjie (Afrikaans). General: This grass-like herb has perennial rhizomes with roundish tubers. Grows up to 600 mm. The annual aerial stems are 3 -angled. Young plants are yellowish-green. Leaves: Shiny leaves {{that look like}} grass. Flowers: Branched head with 3 - 5 leaf-like bracts and light brown spikelets in clusters. July - May. Festuca spp. Fescue grass (English) Swenkgras (Afrikaans). General: This is a tufted perennial grass. Leaves: Leaves often have a small lobe or ear at the base, and old leaf sheaths usually split into fibres. Flowers: The inflorescence is an open or contracted panicle. The spikelets are laterally flattened. Lolium spp. General: An annual, dense, tufted, soft grass. Leaves: The leaves are green and shiny and the culms usually unbranched. Flowers: The inflorescence is flat with the spikelets evenly arranged {{on either side of}} the central axis. The size of the awns is up to 10 mm, which distinguishes it from Lolium perenne. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: The Claviceps spp. form ergots, which contain different ergot alkaloids of which ergotamine and ergocryptine are the most important. • The endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum also produces ergot alkaloids such as ergovaline. Mechanism of action: • The ergot alkaloids induce peripheral vasoconstriction, which prevents heat loss and results in hyperthermia (summer syndrome) during hot weather and hot spells. Not seen during cool weather. • During winter the existing vasoconstriction is exacerbated causing ischaemia of the extremities (tail, feet, ears), necrosis and dry gangrene. • A decrease in serum prolactin has also been reported. SYNDROME: Summer syndrome, Fescue foot. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Cardiovascular system. CLINICAL SIGNS: Clinical signs of hyperthermia: • High morbidity • Hyperthermia • Breathing with an open mouth, with the tongue protruding, • Increased respiratory rate • Excessive salivation • Inappetance • Excessive intake of water with resulting polyuria • Overgrowth of hair in the summer • Reddish-brown discolouration of black patches in Holsteins. • Cattle look for shade and attempt to cool themselves by standing or lying in water or even in the dampness caused by the excessive urination. • Drop in milk production (a decrease in serum prolactin concentration as well as a decreased feed intake). • Reproductive problems (prolactin is required for the maintenance of the corpus luteum). NECROPSY: Nothing specific. TREATMENT: Fescue foot: Dry gangrene (during winter). For Summer Syndrome: • Cool down the animals (hose down or spray with water), keep them in shade. • Dopamine-receptor blockers i. e. domperidone, phenothiazine tranquillizers (?). CONTROL: • Avoid feeding screenings. • Permissible level < 0, 05 % m/m. • Prevent seeding of ryegrass by heavy grazing in early growth stage or the use of herbicides. • Clear lands of nut sedge, eradicate with herbicides. • Cut maize stalks higher when making silage. • Analyse fescue grass to ascertain if endophytes are present and/or producing ergot alkaloids. • Limit the intake of fescue especially during seeding.

40|$|Geographically, Taiwan is an Island and {{situated}} in the northeast of Asia, {{on the western side}} of the Pacific Basin, at the southeast of main China, south of Japan, and north of the Philippines. The main topographic character is the longitudinally oriented mountainous area. More than 200 peaks rise above 3000 m. They departed Taiwan into two lowland areas, an eastern and western plain. Taiwan is departed into subtropical (north area) and tropical zone (south area), which have a warm and humid climate, due to the Tropic of Cancer passing through. The average annual temperature in the lowland amounts to 28 °C (7 ~ 38 °C). The temperate climate also presents in the mountainous areas. The tropical typhoons usually come in summer and bring heavy rain, while the monsoon seasons have an important effect on the regional rainfall distribution. The mean annual rainfall of Taiwan is about 2600 mm (1000 ~ 6700 mm); the mountainous areas receive more rain than the lowlands. In Taiwan, according to different temperature and vegetation, the ecological environments were given rise to vertical biotic zonations, and form five major types: highland snowfield, highland meadow, coniferous forest, deciduous forest, and tropical forest. Six National Parks in Taiwan are located in the mountainous areas, in the north, the south, and on Jinmen Island. The National Parks represent about 8. 4 % of the country area. In this study, the collection sites are {{situated in}} Yangmingshan, Shei-Pa, Yushan, and Kenting National Park. Due to the island isolation, the proportions of endemic species are great in Taiwan, which also presents a high biodiversity. There are 4255 species of vascular plants including 1133 endemic. 5936 species in 1276 genera of fungi are hitherto reported in Taiwan. Among them, 233 Corticiaceae species were recorded, over one third (79 species) of them are known only from Taiwan. The first fungal report in Taiwan is about Phytophthora <b>cyperi,</b> published by the Japanese researcher T. Kawakami in 1904. Therefore, the history of research about fungi in Taiwan is more than one hundred years old. An eminent Japanese mycologist K. Sawada made an intensive survey from 1919 to 1959, and reported 2464 fungi species in his eleven volumes of “Descriptive Catalogue of Formosan Fungi”. However, only a few species (21 species in 9 genera) of Corticiaceae were recorded. From 1973, Chen and Lin resumed the study on Corticiaceae, and also some other foreign mycologists contributed for this field after 1980. The German research group lead by Franz Oberwinkler from Tübingen University collected in Taiwan several times. They published a number of new species and new records. Since 1989, S. H. Wu, a Taiwanese mycologist, has published a great amount of reports on corticioid fungi from Taiwan. Corticioid fungi were made up by the large and heterogeneous unnatural family Corticiaceae and other resupinate fungi belonging to other natural families in the Agaricomycetes. Molecular studies have shown that corticioid genera are distributed across all major clades of Agaricomycetes indicating that the corticioid fungi represent a polyphyletic group. They have resupinate fruitbodies and similar habitats. Species are characterized by simple fruitbody, more or less effused, and present smooth, porioid, grandinioid to odontioid hymenial surface. The fruitbodies are differently colored and usually soft to tough. Most of the Corticiaceae species are wood-saprobic organisms and gain the energy from the decomposing of wood-substrate such as cellulose or lignin. Materials for this study were collected by the author and other mycologists in Taiwan during surveys in April and May 1996, and March 2007, using the spring season with its high humidity and warm climate which are optimal conditions for the development of fungi. For assembling, the convenience sampling method was used in this study. This approach was chosen because it enables to detect a high biodiversity in a short time, and also to find species with rare or patchy distribution. The collecting sites from the North to the South include four National Parks and some preserved forests. They cover many different habitats such as low lands and high mountains. Fresh specimens were dried and analysed with a light microscope. 265 specimens belonging to Corticiaceae were studied in this research. Among them, 50 species in 21 genera including 11 new records and 10 new species were described with text and drawing. Four new species are belonging to Hyphodontia (H. sp. nov. 1, H. sp. nov. 2, H. sp. nov. 3, and H. sp. nov. 4), four to Schizopora (Sch. sp. nov. 1, Sch. sp. nov. 2, Sch. sp. nov. 3, and Sch. sp. nov. 4), one in Trechispora (T. sp. nov. 1), and one in Tubulicrinis (T. sp. nov. 1). Species recorded as new are Aleurodiscus amorphus, Botryohypochnus isabellinus, Hyphodontia cineracea, Hyphodontia palmae, Hypochnicium vellereum, Merulius tremellosus, Metulodontia nivea, Paullicorticium ansatum, Phlebia radiata, Phlebiella ardosiaca, and Xylobolus frustulatus. Besides, Botryohypochnus, Merulius, Metulodontia, Paullicorticium, and Xylobolus are also newly recorded genera in Taiwan. The genus Hyphodontia presents the highest diversity with 20 out of 50 species recorded. The second important genus is Hyphoderma, however with only 5 species. This indicates that Hyphodontia and Hyphoderma have a higher ability to develop in variable environments and approximately shows the predominance of these two genera in Taiwanese Corticiaceae. There are 11 new records out of the 50 species recorded, representing 22 %. Some species, e. g. Hypochnicium vellereum and Paullicorticium ansatum were in the past recorded only in Europe and North America with cold and temperate climate. The samples of them are for the first time found in the subtropical belt, and display some difference from those of temperate regions. These collections should be molecularly investigated to clarify if they represent the same species of temperate areas. Patchily distributed species, for example Phlebiella ardosiaca, previously known only in Europe, and Hyphodontia palmae collected only in Brazil, were first recorded in different continents. Two possibilities are indicated by these new records: they are worldwide species but very rare to be found, or the Taiwanese specimens are taxonomically different. More survey from other continents and molecular study for these collections should be done in the future to solve this question. The distribution of Corticiaceae in Taiwan presents the variations in the north, central, and south areas and shows the diversity in lowlands and high mountains. The results of this study provide the evidence that the temperate Corticiaceae species displays a wider distribution. Subtropical and tropical taxa probably have also high dispersal capacities, and could possibly be found in the future in neighboring areas such as China, Japan, Korea or South Asia, but this needs further researches. In the total of 50 species, 10 new taxa were described in this study, giving about 20 %. Some new species (e. g. Hyphodontia sp. 1, Hyphodontia sp. 2, and Hyphodontia sp. 3) are very similar to known species (Hyphodontia sambuci and Hyphodontia formosana), and the distinctive characters of Schizopora sp. nov. 1 are intermediate between those of Schizopora paradoxa and Hyphodontia flavipora. Thus, these small differences between the new and known species, suggest that the speciation occurred when the fungi migrated into Taiwan, due to the high diversity of environment, and amounts of the endemic plants. Taiwan is an intermediate place for the south (tropical) fungal species to migrate and adapt to north (temperate) regions. The middle and high altitude environments in Taiwan offer good conditions for the fungal speciation and possibly the occurrence of physiological changes to adapt to the temperate climate. Thus Taiwan has an important position for the biogeography of Asia mycobiota. 5936 known species in Taiwan represent about only 20 % of the estimated number (24000) of Taiwanese fungal taxa. In this study, the findings (22 % new records and 20 % new species) indicate that amounts of unknown fungi species are expected in Taiwan. The lack of knowledge indicates that many new species are awaiting description, and fungal survey in Taiwan remains in a Pioneer phase. The last three wide surveys of Corticiaceae researches took place 20 years before this study (Chen & Lin 1977, Lin & Chen 1989, Wu 1990). After previous important contributions, the present taxonomic study comprising 21 genera is the most extensive on Corticiaceae of Taiwan...|$|E
