25|$|In December 2011 the {{outgoing}} Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of health <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> is waste.

25|$|Health {{insurance}} benefits are an attractive way for employers {{to increase the}} salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace. Additionally, most economists agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance, leading some to claim that it is {{largely responsible for the}} rise in health <b>care</b> <b>spending.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Office of the Actuary (OACT) of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes data {{on total}} health <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> in the United States, {{including}} both historical levels and future projections. In 2007, the U.S. spent $2.26 trillion on health care, or $7,439 per person, up from $2.1 trillion, or $7,026 per capita, the previous year. Spending in 2006 represented 16% of GDP, {{an increase of}} 6.7% over 2004 spending. Growth in spending is projected to average 6.7% annually over the period 2007 through 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) {{reported}} that U.S. {{health care costs}} rose 5.8% to reach $3.2 trillion in 2015, or $9,990 per person. As measured by CMS, {{the share of the}} U.S. economy devoted to health <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> was 17.8% GDP in 2015, up from 17.4% in 2014. Increases were driven by the coverage expansion that began in 2014 {{as a result of the}} Affordable Care Act (i.e., more persons demanding healthcare or more healthcare units consumed) as well as higher healthcare prices per unit.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis B {{accounts}} for a much larger percentage of health <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> in endemic regions like Asia. In 1997 it accounted for 3.2% of South Korea's total health care expenditures and resulted in $696 million in direct costs. A large majority of that sum was spent on treating disease symptoms and complications. Chronic hepatitis B infections are not as endemic in the United States, but accounted for $357 million in hospitalization costs in the year 1990. That number grew to $1.5 billion in 2003, but remained stable as of 2006, which may be attributable {{to the introduction of}} effective drug therapies and vaccination campaigns.|$|E

25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} the health of {{immigrants}} and the associated cost to the public has been largely discussed. On average, per capita health <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> is lower for immigrants {{than it is for}} native-born Americans. The non-emergency use of emergency rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay, yet some studies allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care by immigrants. For this and other reasons, there have been various disputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public health system. University of Maryland economist and Cato Institute scholar Julian Lincoln Simon concluded in 1995 that while immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take out, {{this is not the case}} for elderly immigrants and refugees, who are more dependent on public services for survival.|$|E
