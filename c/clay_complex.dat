The method is based on the exchange of the exchange-able cations against large organic cations; for the latter, cetyltri-methyl ammonium bromide (lissolamine) was used.

In general one can recognize a lower and an upper aquifer both consisting {{of sand and}} gravel, and an intermediate <b>clay</b> <b>complex</b> isolating the two aquifers. In this study, the "Weisses Moor" pumping test data are used to obtain information about the hydraulic properties of the Gorleben system. The interpretation of the Weisses Moor pumping test {{will be carried out}} in steps of increasing difficulty. This report contains the results of the first step of modelling. It is assumed that the variations in the salt concentration can be neglected and that the porous medium is homogeneous and isotropic. Under such circumstances, the drawdowns observed in the observation wells due to a pumping test can be described by the Theis solution. The AQ-AT code, developed at RIVM, is used to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and theoretical drawdown to obtain optimal values of storativity and transmissivity. It appears that there are significant differences between the optimal values calculated for various observation wells. Therefore, the assumptions of homogeneity, isotropy and/or constant salt concentration do not apply. These assumptions will be relaxed in the following modelling steps in order to obtain more satisfactory results...|$|E

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of this work a brief idea was given on what is understood as "clay", on the scientific methods applied {{to the study of the}} matter "clay" as well as on its conception with regard to the edaphic studies. A description is given of the methods of total and natural mechanical analyses which were employed in the agro-geological Department. The work is illustrated by a graphic showing the fractions of the mechanical analysis of the chief great soil types of the State of São Paulo. The fraction clay is then studied by chemical way in the following sequence : 1. ° total chemical analysis, 2. ° partial chemical analysis, 3. ° chemical analysis of the Helmholz layer and 4. ° study of the fixation of the ion Ca+ + in the already mentioned Helmholz layer. The first analysis separates and attacks the hydrated aluminium silicates, the hydrated oxyds of iron and aluminium, manganese, etc. In this analysis the relationship between silica and sesquioxyds was determined. The second type of attack or chemical analysis does not affect the hydrated silicates of aluminium, all others go in dissolution. In this analysis were determined chiefly the sesquioxyds in their free form in the <b>clay</b> <b>complex.</b> For the study of the Helmholz layer, i. e. the determination of changeable ions, solutes of NH 4 Cl N/l, HNO 3 N/ 5, KCl N/l, etc. were used, percolation of these liquids being made through a layer of air dried soil. The relationship between soil and liquid was always 1 : 10. In this analysis, principally the cations K+, Ca++, Mg++, Al+ + +, H+ etc. were determined. With such determinations the calculations of the following values were obtained: S = sum of the changeable bases in ME; T = total value in ME of the sorptive power of the complex in each 100 g dried soil at 110 ° C. and V = percentage of saturation of the complexes with bases. Finally, the qualitative radiographic analysis of the fraction clay was carried out by means of the Debye-Scherrer-Hull method. For these studies the Siemens-Berlin apparatus was used, the transformer of which runs with all 0 - 220 volts 60 -cycle alternating current. The bulb has a copper anti-cathode and is fed by a current of 13 m. A. of intensity and the difference of potential is of 30, 000, 35, 000 and 47, 000 volts. The flash of X-rays goes through the nickel filter in order to free it of the b irradiations which are deleterious. In this way, inciding vertically on the preparation, radiations CuK a with l = 1, 539 A are obtained. The sensible film used was a Lawe-Film-Agfa, with an exposure going from 11 / 2 to 2 hours with 35, 000 V. The chassis has a diameter of 57 mm. More than 500 radiographs of soil samples were taken, of those proceding from all districts of the State, 79 of which are presented in the present work. With this material the different constituents of the clay minerals contained in our soils were known. Thus, in the soils over the Archean geological formation, kaolinite is represented most frequently and abundantly; the hydrargillite also appears commonly. The soils over the Glacial formation contain the same representatives and oscillations as those just mentioned. In the Corum-batai formation, quartz is the most important constituent. The Botucatu formation (lava) is that which gave origin to our legitimate red soils; the mineralogical clay constituents of these soils are : 1. ° large amount of hydrated oxyds of iron up to 35 % of Fe 2 O 3 for each 100 g of soil at 110 ° C.; 2. ° hydrargillite and 3. ° kaolinite. The amount of the latter in the <b>clay</b> <b>complex</b> ranges between 9 and 25 %. The sandy soils existing in the geological formations of lower and upper Baurú bear in their clays the following mineralogical constituents : 1. ° kaolinite, 2. ° montmorrillonitic type (on the upper Baurú only), 3. ° hydrargillite (more common on the lower Baurú) and 4. ° quartz, generally, in small percentages. These researches made it evident that the constituents of the clay fraction of our soils commonly have a small sorptive power related to the cations; it follows hence that they do not show a great power of retention of manure with the exception of the montmorrillonitic type...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} overexploitation {{of water}} resources is observed {{on a global scale}} in the previous decades; this trend involves the coastal regions of Mediterranean Basin (Van Beynen et alii, 2012). As an effect of increasing groundwater discharge from coastal aquifers, the phenomenon of seawater intrusion is becoming a serious problem for most of the coastal aquifers, especially in the Mediterranean area (COST, 2003; COST, 2005). The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the modeling of a coastal porous aquifer located in the complex plain of Sibari (Southern Italy), a plain deeply modified as an effect of reclamation works realized after thirties. The model was implemented using piezometric historical data (from thirties) to establish the effect of seawater intrusion when the well discharge was negligible (natural conditions), the modification in subsequent decades, to be used for forecasting purpose and for evaluate the evolution of groundwater resource. The area actually represents a landscape with anthropic equilibrium based on the works of a land reclamation project (1960 s- 1990 s). Study area is about 365 km 2 for a coastline of about 35 km, about which an hydrogeological conceptual model was defined. The area can be conceptualized into three hydrogeological complexes (from the top) : sand complex, a <b>clay</b> <b>complex</b> and a sand and conglomerate complex, constituting the deep aquifer, the bottom of which is not well-defined. Shallow aquifer is predominantly fed by direct rainwater infiltration. Deep aquifer is fed by outflows of the mountainous aquifers as the case of limestone aquifer of Pollino Mount,and of shallow granitic aquifer of the Sila massif (Guerricchio and Melidoro, 1975). The maximum piezometric levels of the deep aquifer are equivalent to approximately 40 m asl, so in some areas it presents artesian feature. The computer codes selected for numerical groundwater modelling were MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1998) and SEAWAT (Guo and Langevin, 2002). This groundwater flow modelling is based on the concept of a equivalent homogeneous porous medium by which it is assumed that the real heterogeneous aquifer can be simulated as homogeneous porous media within cells or elements (Anderson, 2002). The modeled aquifer area was uniformly discretized, using Peclet number, into a finite difference grid of 97, 735 cells of 240 m x 350 m. For the vertical discretization, model was divided into five layers of variable thicknesses, defined on the basis of a multi-methodological geological survey. Climatic, hydrological and agricultural data were processed to defines inputs for the numerical model based on the variable-density flow. An hydrological balance using monthly and annual of 13 thermo-pluviometric stations falling in the study area, in the time period 1930 - 1975, was done (Polemio and Casarano, 2008, Polemio et alii, 2013). The numerical model was calibrated with PEST code with a correlation coefficient equal to 0, 90. Preliminary results of steady flow and of groundwater salinity spatial are now available and shows it is not sustainable in the case of shallow aquifer and it can be improved in the case of deep aquifer...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} soil K {{fertility}} {{was investigated in}} two typical steepland pastures, located in the southern North Island of New Zealand. The parent materials of soils {{in this area are}} predominantly derived from sedimentary rocks. The soils have medium to high K reserves, and K fertilisers are not normally applied to the areas of steepland pasture. The study sites are part of well-established mixed stock grazing farms and have received regular aerial topdressing with superphosphate for at least 30 years. Grazing animals in steepland tend to favour the flatter areas, which are mainly on the crests of the ridges, and to spend relatively short periods of time grazing the steep slopes. Concerns have arisen as to the development of K deficiencies on the steep slopes, as stock are expected to graze these areas, and then to excrete most of the K ingested in the herbage onto the flatter areas. Two surveys were made of the K fertility patterns in two steepland paddocks. The first study was made over one paddock, by collecting soil samples along vectors of random direction, from points that were between 0. 25 m and 25 m apart. The second survey targeted the main trends, sampling at regular intervals along the ridge crests and down the transects of the main slopes, at two paddocks The tests on the soil samples included exchangeable K (Quick test K), acid extractable K and {{the difference between the two}} factors, which was thought to provide a measure of plant available nonexchangeable K (Step K). The Quick test K values in one pasture alone ranged from 0. 07 to 1. 34 mg K/g soil, which was a range between very low and extremely high values for New Zealand soils. There was a similar wide range of values for other parameters. The frequency distributions of the soil test values were skewed, so that the arithmetic mean of the results was higher than 60 - 70 % of the values. Spatial variability was at a maximum at a sampling distance of 0. 25 m. The results indicated that the bulking of soil samples was a poor practise when sampling for exchangeable and plant available nonexchangeable K at these sites. Some relationships could be discerned between the soil K fertility patterns and the position of the topsoil in a steepland landscape, despite the high spatial variability. On the steep slopes, the Step K value of a soil was related to the soil moisture pattern, as determined by aspect and water seeps, and also to the pattern of the soil parent materials. Quick test K had no similar relationship to position in the landscape on the steep slopes. The spatial variability of both tests increased as the ground slope decreased. The mean and variability of Quick test K increased sharply on both well drained shoulder slopes and ridge-tops that were animal campsites. In contrast, the mean and variability of Step K increased markedly only on the well drained ridge-top campsites The different behaviour of cattle and sheep, the relatively large amounts of K deposited in excreta compared to P, and the slower rate of breakdown and dispersal of excreta in drier conditions, were all thought to contribute to these effects. The mineralogy of the topsoils at the two sites was also investigated. The clay mineralogy was dominated by a complex of 2 : 1 layer silicates, accompanied by lesser quantities of quartz, feldspars and kandites. The topsoils formed a sequence, which ranged from a 2 : 1 layer silicate <b>clay</b> <b>complex</b> that was dominated by mica and interlayered mica smectite (MS), to a 2 : 1 layer silicate <b>clay</b> <b>complex</b> that was dominated by vermiculite and hydroxy interlayered vermiculite (HIV). There was a very strong relationship between the Step K value and the mica content of a soil on the steep slopes. The relationship indicated that the dominance of either mica and MS, or vermiculite and HIV, in the clay fraction of a soil on the steep slopes depended on the original composition of the soil parent materials, the age of the soil profile, and the soil moisture conditions. On the shoulder slope and ridge-tops, there was a similar range of clay mineralogy, but Step K value now had a poor relationship to the mica content. This effect was mainly associated with soils under the well drained animal campsites, which had a distinctive mica and irregularly interstratified MS dominated clay mineralogy. The results were consistent with a reversal of the 2 : 1 layer silicate weathering processes under well drained animal campsites. Concentrations of total K and P were investigated in the topsoils of the two steepland pastures. The average difference between the total P of slope and ridge-top samples was about 200 kg P/ha, indicating a relatively small accumulation of P on the ridge-tops after many years of aerial topdressing and grazing. The expected accompanying increase in total K was not found. The marked effect of animal transfer processes on the plant available chemistry and mineralogy of the well drained ridge-top soils was thought to be a disproportionate indicator of the relatively small extent of total nutrient accumulation that appeared to have occurred on the ridge-top campsites. The plant response to K fertiliser was measured at the two steepland pastures sites. No K uptake response or growth response was identified at either site, despite low exchangeable K values in some areas and a low K content in some of the pasture samples, even after fertiliser was applied. In contrast, an exhaustive pot trial, using a selection of soils from the two sites, revealed a considerable range in the ability of the soils to supply K. Cation and anion concentrations were measured in the leachates of "stove pipe" soil cores collected from the ridge-tops and steep slopes. K concentration in the leachates of soil from the steep slopes were relatively low and reasonably consistent over time, compared to the Ca and Mg concentrations that were more sensitive to changes in the ionic strength. K concentration in the leachate of soils from different ridge-top locations varied markedly between the different locations. The increased leaching of K under animal campsites was identified as a significant loss mechanism for the K that is transferred to these areas. However, it was thought that an exact quantification of this process would be difficult, because the spatial variability of the concentration of K leaching from the topsoil into the subsoil under campsites was expected to be even higher than the spatial variability of exchangeable K in these soils. In conclusion, animal transfer losses of K from the steep slopes to the flatter areas at these sites appeared to be in the low range for New Zealand steepland pastures. No significant depletion of the K fertility appeared to have developed on the steep slopes, although the measurements were confounded by the very high degree of spatial variability found in all aspects of the K fertility patterns. The current conventional practice of not applying K fertiliser to these and similar sites was thought to be sustainable...|$|E

Isotherm shape was similar for all supports studied. Adsorption of imazethapyr varied with pH for montmorillonite and for Cu-humic acid-montmorillonite complex. The pH had no apparent effect on imazethapyr adsorption to the Cu-montmorillonite complex. This might be due to imazethapyr retention at high pH by Cu ions linked to the clay. Imazethapyr adsorption kinetics was faster for Cu-montmorillonite (15 min) and Cu-humic acid-montmorillonite (30 min) than for montmorillonite (240 min). The copper-humic acid complexes with montmorillonite might be used to detoxify water contaminated with imazethapyr...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the herbicide 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) with decylammonium-montmorillonite (C 10 M) and decylammonium-vermiculite (C 10 V) was studied by measuring 2, 4 -D adsorption at different pH levels, and by preparing herbicide-organic <b>clay</b> <b>complexes</b> which were characterized by x- ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The adsorption of 2, 4 -D at different pH values indicated that the undissociated form was preferentially adsorbed on C 10 M, whereas the anionic form was adsorbed by C 10 V. The adsorption of 2, 4 -D was much greater for C 10 V than for C 10 M. X-ray diffraction diffractograms and FT-IR spectra of C 10 M did not show any changes after exposure to 2, 4 -D, indicating adsorption on external surfaces by weak lyophilic, aromatic ring-alkylchain(tail), bond. The d 001 values of the two C 10 V samples expanded after 2, 4 -D exposure from 2. 1 to 2. 9 nm and from 2. 4 to 3. 3 nm, indicating interlayer adsorption of the herbicide. The FT-IR spectrum of herbicide-C 10 V complex showed {{the presence of a}} small amount of the molecular form of 2, 4 -D weakly adsorbed on external surfaces by lyophilic (ring-tail) bonding, but most of the herbicide molecules were adsorbed at the interlayer spaces by hydrogen bonds between carbonyl group (ν(C= 0) at 1634 cm- 1) of 2, 4 -D and ammonium group of the interlayer organic cations. Some 2, 4 -D molecules in C 10 V complex appeared to be dissociated as suggested by two bands at 1590 and 1330 cm- 1, which corresponded to the unsymmetrical and symmetrical vibrations, respectively, of the COO- groups.

40|$|An updated {{conceptual}} model of groundwater flow of carbonate fractured aquifers of Apennine basin of the Chienti River (Marche Region) has been developed. This model {{derives from the}} application of classical hydrogeological approach, {{which is based on}} a detailed field survey, by upscaling methodology, aimed to localize the main spring locations (15 springs) and to evaluate their mean discharge (total discharge of about 3280 L/s). Acquired data have been combined with the hydrogeological evaluation of the geologicalstructural setting, for defining the hydrogeological role of the lithological complexes and of the structural setting (faults and thrusts), conditioning groundwater flow direction and amount. The geologicalstructural setting is typical of Central Apennine in the Umbria- Marchean succession. The bottom carbonate unit corresponds to the carbonate platform, overlapped by calcareous complexes having marly beds and marly-clayed complexes of pelagic facies, by a total thickness of about 2500 - 3000 m. Compressive tectonic processes, in a E-verging thrust-and-fold belt, combined with intense translational movements gave rise to significant overthrusts at regional scale. The cores of anticlines host large basal aquifers, hydraulically separated by low-permeability boundary due to marly and <b>clay</b> <b>complexes,</b> respect with the surrounding Scaglia aquifers. Groundwater flow moves mainly along N-S direction, parallel to the main thrusts, which act as no-flow limit. The proposed hydrogeological model includes seven local aquifers. There are two independent basal aquifers, feeding a deep groundwater flow in the basal carbonate complexes, including areas out of the hydrographic basin of Chienti River. Spring fed by these basal aquifers have a mean discharge of 1460 L/s. Additional five aquifers characterized by less deep and more local groundwater flow correspond to the Scaglia complexes, with a mean discharge of about 1820 L/s. The extension and the limits of all these aquifers have been verified by the evaluation of effective infiltration values, to define the recharge area of each spring group. The resulting {{conceptual model}} has been independently validated by chemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater, which confirmed or require modification of the preliminary model obtained by the hydrostructural approach...|$|R

For the purpose, under laboratory conditions, humus acid preparations (humic acid and b-humus fulvic acid fraction) were made, at various quantitative ratios, with clay minerals (micamontmorillonite, Na-montmorillonite, kaolinite), in the presence of Fe and Ca, at pH 4 and 2. 5.

The loading of 3 wt% lipase into the lumen of halloysite clay nanotubes was enhanced with an electrostatic interaction. 10 wt% of lipase-nanotubes were dispersed in an aqueous chitosan solution and cast as a coating. The enzymatic chitosan-halloysite membranes displayed increased pH, temperature stability and long-term usability for the catalytic decomposition of lipids: 90 % of the initial activity was preserved at 80 degrees C, 70 % of the functionality remained at the high pH of 9, and 85 % of the activity was sustained after ten continuous cycles of use. The placement of the second antimicrobial enzyme-lysozyme at the outer surface of the clay nanotubes allowed for a synergistic increase in {{the activity of the}} composite antibacterial formulation.

40|$|International audienceStructural {{characterization}} of soil clay minerals often remains limited despite their key influence on soil properties. In soils, <b>complex</b> <b>clay</b> parageneses {{result from the}} coexistence of clay species with contrasting particle sizes and crystal-chemistry and from the profusion of mixed layers with variable compositions. The present study aimed at characterizing the mineralogy and crystal chemistry of the < 2 μm fraction along a profile typical of soils from Western Europe and North America (Neo Luvisol). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were nterpreted using i) the combination of XRD pattern decomposition and indirect identification from peak positions commonly applied in soil science and ii) the multi-specimen method. This latter approach implies direct XRD profile fitting and has recently led to significant improvements in the structural {{characterization of}} clay minerals in diagenetic and hydrothermal environments. In contrast to the usual approach, the multi-specimen method allowed the complete structural characterization of <b>complex</b> <b>clay</b> parageneses encountered in soils together with the quantitative analysis of their mineralogy. Throughout the profile, the clay paragenesis of the studied Neo Luvisol systematically includes discrete smectite, illite and kaolinite in addition to randomly interstratified illite-smectite and chlorite-smectite. Structural characteristics of the different clay minerals, including the composition of mixed layers, did not vary significantly with depth and are thus indicative of the parent material. The relative proportion of the < 2 μm fraction increased with increasing depth simultaneously with smectite relative proportion. These {{results are consistent with}} the leaching process described for Luvisols in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A new Early Cretaceous flora is {{described}} from the Lusitanian Basin in the Estremadura region (western Portugal) {{based on a}} combined study of mesofossils and palynomorphs. The fossil specimens were extracted from samples collected in the Chicalhão <b>clay</b> pit <b>complex,</b> {{near the village of}} Juncal from sediments belonging to the Figueira da Foz Formation. The plant bearing sequence is considered to be of Late Aptian–Early Albian age. Palynomorphs and mesofossils are generally well-preserved and include about 63 taxa. The palynoflora is dominated by conifer pollen and fern spores. Angiosperm pollen is also present, but subordinate among the palynomorphs. In contrast, angiosperms completely dominate the mesofossil flora and are mainly represented by fruits and seeds. Four taxa of angiosperm flowers were also identified. The combined palaeobotanical and sedimentological evidence indicates seasonally dry climate and an open vegetation consisting of a mixed conifer forest with an understorey and ground cover of ferns and angiosperms and with patchy occurrences of lycophytes and plants of the Bennettitales–Erdtmanithecales–Gnetales (BEG) group. Angiosperms probably inhabited moister areas bordering rivers and lakes...|$|R
