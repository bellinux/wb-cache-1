For the homopolymerisation of MestOx an increased propagation rate constant was observed compared to MeOx and EtOx while the copolymerization of MestOx with MeOx or EtOx unexpectedly revealed slower incorporation of MestOx. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that nearby MestOx residues in the living chain can activate both the oxazolinium chain end and the attacking monomer, stabilizing the propagation transition state, leading to faster homopolymerisation of MestOx.

Chapter Two focuses on ethene/styrene and ethene/tert-butylstyrene <b>copolymerisations</b> using commercially available metallocene catalysts, {{with the goal of}} increasing styrenic co-monomer incorporation without sacrificing productivity.

30|$|CGC {{catalysts}} have {{outstanding performance}} in ethylene polymerisation and in <b>copolymerisations</b> with higher Î±-olefins.

The amido group acts as a maximum three-electron donor, cf. cyclopentadienyl (five-electron donor), which yields a highly electrophilic metal centre and thus results in its high productivity as a catalyst.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate Cu(0) -mediated living radical polymerisation and explore the potential and the limitations of this system with the ultimate goal to maximise the end-group fidelity and enable the synthesis of multiblock copolymers. Careful optimisation of the ligand and catalyst concentration was shown to be vital for preservation of end-group functionality, which can be exploited for post-polymerisation modifications. High molecular weight multiblock copolymers were obtained for the first time, although the weaknesses and limitations of the technique were also revealed and discussed. At the same time, a new, novel polymerisation protocol was discovered, exploiting photo-activation {{in the presence of}} a cupric precursor CuII(Me 6 -Tren) Br 2 and an excess of an aliphatic tertiary amine ligand Me 6 -Tren. For the first time under UV irradiation (Î» 360 nm) near-quantitative conversions and narrow dispersities for a range of targeted molecular weights were achieved while the scope of this technique was expanded to a range solvents and monomers.

Several di-magnesium catalysts bearing a symmetrical N 4 O 2 macrocyclic ligand and different co-ligands (acetate, trifluoroacetate, benzoate, aryl oxide and bromide) were explored. These investigations revealed that both metal centres of the catalyst {{are involved in the}} <b>copolymerisation</b> reaction and that the rate determining step {{is likely to be the}} carbonate attack on the metal bound epoxide. CO 2 insertion is relatively fast. Additionally, there seems to be a co-ligand effect on the rate of <b>copolymerisation,</b> with an optimum activity observed with the acetate co-ligand. These findings support the hypothesis that one co-ligand remains bound to the catalyst during <b>copolymerisation</b> reactions.

However, this mixed catalyst system has an improved activity in cyclohexene oxide or propylene oxide/CO 2 <b>copolymerisation</b> reactions, compared to the di-zinc and di-magnesium counterparts alone or in combination. This suggests that the heterodinuclear catalyst promotes the enhanced activity observed with the mixed catalyst system.

Under carefully optimised conditions, a simple and highly efficient one-pot polymerisation procedure (full conversion for each block and no intermediate purification required) will be developed allowing access to iterative monomer additions, fast polymerisation rates and high level of control. As a result, complex microstructures (such as hexablocks) can be achieved in a quantitative manner in a matter of few hours, which consists the fastest synthesis of such material up to date. However, the loss of the halide chain end will be shown to be the main limitation of the in situ chain extensions and block <b>copolymerisations</b> of acrylamides in water. In order to assess the effect {{of the nature of the}} monomer to the loss of the end group fidelity, a further investigation into the monomer nature and the lifetime of the Ï-Br chain end will be conducted further highlighting the importance to monomer structure and sequence in poly(acrylamide) s multiblocks in order to maximise the retention of the bromine chain end.

The role of the Cu(0) on the polymerisation kinetics and will be extensively investigated differentiating Cu(0) -wire from the in situ generated Cu(0) particles. The extent of disproportionation and comproportionation reactions in aqueous, organic and aqueous/organic mixtures will be also evaluated and the effect of the monomer on these reactions will also be shown demonstrating a completely different behaviour between organic and aqueous media.

Four main types of liquid crystalline conjugated polymers were investigated: l Polymers without liquid crystal groups attached 2 Polymers with laterally attached liquid crystal groups 3 Polymers with terminally attached liquid crystal groups 4 Polymers with terminally attached liquid crystal groups that have potential negative dielectric anisotropy A large variety of suitable thiophene-substituted precursors with potential liquid crystalline properties was synthesised and investigated by optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Williamson ether synthesis and boronic acid coupling chemistry were mainly used to synthesise the polymer precursors. Some of these monomers proved difficult to homopolymerise due to the large bulky. laterally attached moieties, therefore <b>copolymerisations</b> with 3 -alkylthiophenes were carried out. Cyclic voltammetry of the liquid crystalline substituted thiophene precursor was investigated but even when redox peaks were observed. no polymer film was formed. Therefore these liquid crystalline conjugated polymers/copolymers were chemically synthesised by free radical polymerisation using FeCh and then synthetically modified. The polymers obtained were fully characterised by spectroscopic analysis and the physical properties of these potentially liquid crystalline conjugated polymers were investigated. Comparative studies of the laterally-attached liquid crystalline conjugated copolymers,poly[(I-(3 -thiophenemethoxy) - 6 -(4 -n-hexoxy- 2 -oxybenzoic acid) hexane-co-(3 -hexylthiophene) ] and of its terminally attached analogue poly[(I-(3 -thiophenemethoxy) - 6 -(4 -oxybenzoic acid) hexane) -co-(3 - hexylthiophenej], revealed that the conductivity of the former was {{much greater than the}} latter. Also observed was the noticeable increase in conductivity when the copolymers were converted from the ester form poly[(I-(3 - thiophenemethoxy) - 6 -(methyl 4 -n-hexoxy- 2 -oxybenzoate) hexane) -co-(3 - hexylthiophene) ] to the liquid crystal acid form poly[(I-(3 -thiophenemethoxy) - 6 - (4 -n-hexoxy- 2 -oxybenzoic acid) hexane) -co-(3 -hexylthiophene) ]. It became evident that an alkyl spacer was necessary to attach the lateral liquid crystal group. as the alkyl chains provided enough space for the bulky group to orientate into position. However copolymer ratio studies revealed that the ratio of alkyl chain to liquid crystal groups did not significantly affect the overall conductivity of the copolymers for this class of compounds. Also the electrical conductivities as a function of temperature for some undoped LC copolymers of poly[(I-(3 - thiophenemethoxy) - 6 -(4 -n-hexoxy- 2 -oxybenzoic acid) hexane) -co-(3 - hexylthiophene) ] increase with increasing temperature.

The storage modulus is higher above T-G in samples with cholesteric superstructure. Optical rotations and vibrational circular dichroism spectra (VCD) depend strongly on the surface state of the substrates. From the VCD spectra it is concluded that the <b>copolymerisation</b> leads to different superstructures depending on the rub directions of the substrates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{adaptive}} calorimetric method, {{coupled with}} state estimators for emulsion <b>copolymerisation</b> {{is shown to}} provide accurate, on-line information {{on the evolution of}} the composition and kinetics of an emulsion <b>copolymerisation</b> reactor. This method was evaluated for the emulsion <b>copolymerisation</b> of MMA-VAc under non-isothermal conditions. In addition to providing on-line {{estimates of the number of}} moles of each polymerising species in the reactor, the state estimator provides a value for a lumped kinetic parameter proportional to the product of Np. This information can be combined with off-line measurements to study the evolution of polymerisation kinetics, and to explain the trends observed for the molecular weight distribution and glass transition temperatures. Values of were found to vary from 0. 5 to 30 for the homopolymerisation of MMA. However, the presence of VAc in the copolymerising system drastically reduces. This can lead to an dramatic increase in the average molecular weight of the copolymer since it alters the ratio of propagation to termination in the polymerising particles...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Copolymers of {{acrylic acid}} (AA) are {{important}} {{materials for the}} preparation of glass ionomer cements. <b>Copolymerisation</b> of AA is widely used to alter the acid strength of the material and {{to increase the number}} of salt bridges formed in cements. In this paper we report the <b>copolymerisation</b> of AA with n-butyl vinyl ether (BVE) to form unique copolymers of the hemiacetal ester and with BVE incorporated into the main chain. RESULTS: AA and BVE undergo a spontaneous reaction to form a hemiacetal ester which can itself undergo free radical <b>copolymerisation.</b> The kinetics of this reaction in the bulk state have been examined. In addition, under these conditions BVE is incorporated into the polymer main chain via a free radical mechanism. CONCLUSION: Novel copolymers of the hemiacetal ester and BVE have been prepared in this study. The hemiacetal side chains are labile under moderate heating, being converted back to the acid analogue.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the <b>copolymerisation</b> {{behaviour}} of acrylonitrile with the monomers methyl acrylate and vinylidene chloride respectively. The project arose from reports by workers at Courtauld's Ltd. that the lengths of the sequences of the monomer units in certain copolymers of acrylonitrile and vinylidene chloride were longer than predicted by statistical considerations. The <b>copolymerisation</b> of methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile was studied to examine the possibility of a preferential swelling of polymer particles by one monomer during polymerisation. <b>Copolymerisation</b> was carried out in three different solvents, and unsuccessful attempts were made to measure the sequence lengths in the polymers directly using NMR spectroscopy. Only compositional analysis was possible by this means, but measurements of the thermal properties of the polymers indicated that the sequence lengths were short in all cases. It was found that the Alfrey-Lewis <b>copolymerisation</b> equation was obeyed when the reaction was carried out homogeneously in dimethylformamide, but it was not obeyed when it was carried out heterogeneously in hexane or butanol. The <b>copolymerisation</b> of acrylonitrile with vinylidene chloride was studied in several different solvents, and also in mixed solvent systems. Sequence lengths were measured by NMR spectroscopy, and were found to be short for all methods of preparation. In no case was the Alfrey-Lewis copolymer equation obeyed, even in those solvent systems for which the reaction was homogeneous. The preparation of copolymers homogeneously in dimethylformamide showed the least deviation from the simple copolymer equation; for some of the systems used the results could be fitted to the equation derived by Merz et al. in which the effect of the penultimate group in the polymer chain is considered. The problems in setting up a model for heterogeneous polymerisation have been discussed...|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{chemical}} permeation {{properties and}} water vapour transmission properties of temperature sensitive poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) grafted N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM) (NIPAAM-g-PVDF) copolymer membranes as a smart barrier layer in chemical protective clothing are studied in this research. Both modified thermally induced method and modified plasma induced method are employed to oxidise PVDF polymer for its <b>copolymerisation</b> with NIPAAM monomers. In the thermal induced method, NIPAAM-g-PVDF polymer materials are synthesised via the <b>copolymerisation</b> of ozone activated PVDF polymer with NIPAAM monomers below a lower critical solution temperature of NIPAAM (30 Â°C). An effective {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} drying method is used as an alternative drying method to remove the solvent from the ozone activated PVDF polymer in conventionally <b>copolymerisation</b> is successfully applied and a new direct <b>copolymerisation</b> route by adding NIPAAM polymer into ozone activated PVDF in solutions without the drying process of the activated PVDF polymers. The NIPAAM-g-PVDF made by the new <b>copolymerisation</b> process is much simpler than the conventional method and the processing time needed is much shorter. In the oxygen plasma induced <b>copolymerisation</b> method, the porous PVDF membranes produced from the phase inversion method are treated oxygen plasma before they were copolymerised with NIPAAM monomer in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent aqueous solution below the lower critical solution temperature of NIPAAM (30 Â°C). The structural characteristics of heat-pressed NIPAAM-g-PVDF nanoporous membranes produced from the above two methods are investigated. The influence of the microstructure of the nanoporous copolymer membranes on both their water vapour transfer properties and dynamic permeation rate has been studied. The mechanisms of liquid/vapour permeation through the thermal sensitive copolymer nanoporous membranes are analysed and investigated. In this study, {{it is found that}} the breakthrough time and permeation rate of nanoporous NIPAAM-g-PVDF membranes are influenced by the proportion of NIPAAM components, the membrane thickness, the crystallinity and the porous structure of the NIPAAM-g-PVDF membranes. It is also found that the water vapour permeability of the heat-pressed NIPAAM-g-PVDF membranes at both 20 Â°C and 40 Â°C are influenced by the membrane thickness, the total pore volume and the porosity of the membranes. The water vapour permeability coefficient of the NIPAAM-g-PVDF nanoporous membranes is determined by both the proportion of thermal sensitive NIPAAM components and associated porous structure of the copolymer membranes...|$|E
