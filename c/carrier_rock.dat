According to a palynologic investigation the recovered sediments cover the whole Holocene and the late Pleistocene reaching back to about 17 ka. IRM acquisition experiments, hysteresis loop and back field as well as thermomagnetic measurements revealed magnetite in the pseudo-single domain range as the only remanence <b>carrier.</b> Sharp <b>rock</b> magnetic boundaries occur at 20 and 745 cm sub-bottom depth that are clearly linked to shifts in the median grain size of the magnetite.

Within the anoxic section, magnetites are characterized by significantly larger median grain sizes but within a very narrow grain size range. The shift from fine grained magnetite within the oxic sediments to coarse grained magnetite is interpreted as the result of dissolution of the finest magnetite grains within the anoxic sediments.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{and magnetic}} properties of accessory Fe-Cr-spinels from the Kytlym massif of the Urals platinum-bearing belt were studied. Atypical Fe-Cr-spinels {{in the form}} of magnetic microareas in grains of primary nonmagnetic Fe-Cr-spinel have been revealed {{for the first time in}} the bed dunites of the Kytlym multiphase concentrically zoned massif, North Urals. These spinels are responsible for the magnetic properties of the dunites. It has been established that the microareas are separations in solid solution Fe 2 +(Cr 2 -xFe x 3 +) O 4, which are enriched in Fe 3 + and are probably an intermediate product of the transformation of primary accessory Fe-Cr-spinel during the formation of the dunite massif. These are magnetic microphases with particular chemical composition, cation distribution, and corresponding reversed crystal lattice, which determine the main magnetic properties of the microarea: the magnitude and direction of magnetization vector and Curie temperature.

Pyroxene gneiss {{and the majority}} of the garnet gneisses have unstable natural remanent magnetization (NRM), whose directions are similar to the present geomagnetic field in the Syowa Station area. These unstable NRMs can be related to the existence of pyrrhotite. Hornblende gneiss, the other garnet gneisses, granite, amphibolite, silicious rocks and pegmatite dykes have stable NRM.

40|$|Earthquake-related {{luminous}} phenomena (also {{known as}} earthquake lights) {{may arise from}} (1) the stress-activation of positive hole (p-hole) charge <b>carriers</b> in igneous <b>rocks</b> and (2) the accumulation of high charge carrier concentrations at asperities in the crust where the stress rates increase very rapidly as an earthquake approaches.

40|$|International audienceEarthquakes are feared {{because they}} often strike so suddenly. Yet, there are innumerable reports of pre-earthquake signals. Widespread {{disagreement}} exists in the geoscience community how these signals can be generated in the Earth's crust and whether they are early warning signs, related to the build-up of tectonic stresses before major seismic events. Progress in understanding and eventually using these signals has been slow because the underlying physical process or processes are basically not understood. This has changed with the discovery that, when igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks are subjected to deviatoric stress, dormant electronic charge carriers are activated: electrons and defect electrons. The activation increases the number density of mobile charge <b>carriers</b> in the <b>rocks</b> and, hence, their electric conductivity. The defect electrons {{are associated with the}} oxygen anion sublattice and are known as positive holes or pholes for short. The boundary between stressed and unstressed rock acts a potential barrier that lets pholes pass but blocks electrons. Therefore, like electrons and ions in an electrochemical battery, the stress-activated electrons and pholes in the "rock battery" have to flow out in different directions. When the circuit is closed, the battery currents can flow. The discovery of such stress-activated currents in crustal rocks has far-reaching implications for understanding pre-earthquake signals...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} model seismo-electromagnetic phenomena, {{we focus on}} one {{specific}} defect as an alternative source of charge <b>carriers</b> in igneous <b>rocks.</b> These charge <b>carriers</b> are defect electrons in the O 2 – sublattice that are chemically equivalent to O – in a matrix of O 2 – and are known as positive holes (p-holes). They are activated from peroxy defects: O 3 X–OO–XO 3 (X = Si, Al etc.) that are known as positive hole pairs (PHPs). Stressed igneous rocks behave like p-type semiconductors. In order to examine the contributions of p-holes to seismo-electromagnetic phenomena, we conducted two series of uniaxial loading tests using air-dry tiles of several types of rocks (granite, anorthosite, gabbro, limestone, and marble) and glass. We observed that the igneous rock tiles under centrally loading generated (1) a positive current, carried by holes and flowing from the central stressed volume through the surrounding unstressed volume {{to the edges of}} the tiles and (2) a negative current, carried by electrons and flowing from the central stressed volume into the load pistons. In addition, a positive potential appeared {{on the surface of the}} unstressed portion of the igneous rock tiles. On the other hand, limestone con-taining small amounts of silicate grains generated lower currents. Marble containing no silicate grains and glass generated much lower and no currents, respectively.

Small-scale geochemical and Sr-Nd isotope heterogeneities were established {{for the first time}} in basalts and their glasses. It was shown that some samples have significant nonsystematic differences in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio between basalts and their chilled glasses and less significant difference in e-Nd; higher Sr ratios can be observed both in glasses and basalts of the same lava fragments. No significant correlation is observed between isotope characteristics of samples and their geochemistry; it was also shown that seawater did not affect Sr and Nd isotope compositions of the chilled glasses from the studied pillow lavas. It is suggested that such differences in isotope ratios are related to small-scale heterogeneity of melts owing to incomplete homogenization during their rapid ascent to the surface. Heterogeneity of basaltic melts is explained by their partial contamination by older plutonic rocks (especially gabbroids) of the lower oceanic crust, through which they ascended to the surface of the ocean floor. The wider scatter of the Sr isotopic ratios relative to Nd ones is related to presence of xenocrysts of calcic plagioclase; correspondingly, absence of a Nd mineral <b>carrier</b> in the <b>rocks</b> results in less distinct Nd isotope variations. It was shown that all studied basalts define a single trend along the mantle correlation array in the Sr-Nd isotope diagram. Causes of this phenomenon remain unclear...|$|R

40|$|Despite their modest modal abundances, Fe-Ti oxides are {{important}} accessory minerals in igneous rocks. They are major <b>carriers</b> of <b>rock</b> magnetism and petrologic indicators of temperature and redox conditions during the magmatic stage (Buddington & Lindsley, 1964). The titanomagnetite-ilmenitess (Tmt-Ilmss) thermo-oxybarometer {{has been widely}} used to retrieve information, e. g. on redox states in the Earth’s mantle, processes in magma chambers, or the crystallisation conditions of lunar or martian basalts. Current thermodynamic formulations of the Tmt-Ilmss thermo-oxybarometer (Andersen & Lindsley, 1988; Ghiorso & Sack, 1991) fail to reproduce experimental results, in particular at the high T relevant for basaltic assemblages. This is shown by applying the formulations to experimental literature data. The shortcomings of the existing models are {{partly due to the}} limited T-fO 2 -range of experiments used for the original calibrations. The effect of small contents of Mg, Al, etc. typical for natural Tmt and Ilmss was only partly evaluated, and non-stoichiometry of the phases (in particular Tmt) was not considered at all. To support a revised version of the Tmt-Ilmss thermo-oxybarometer we have synthesised Tmt+Ilmss assemblages in the system Fe-Ti-Mg-Al-O at 1 bar, 1000 - 1300 °C and under a large range of fO 2 (NNO- 5 to + 5). A large data set has also been provided for Ilmss coexisting with pseudobrookitess (Psbss). This forms the basis for an experimental calibration of a thermodynamic Ilmss-Psbss (thermo-) oxybarometer model. The data base on Tmt coexisting with Ilmss used to calibrate the previous models has now been extended towards higher T (i. e. 1000 - 1300 °C) and to a larger range of fO 2. The compositions of coexisting Fe-Ti oxides in the system Fe-Ti-O have been determined by EMP as a function of T and fO 2. The experimental data derived within this study has been compared to the existing models. The structural transition within the ilmenite-hematite solid solution series causes an abrupt change of the slope of the experimentally determined isotherms, which gets increasingly pronounced with decreasing T. Andersen & Lindsley (1988) did not account for the transition, and consequently their model isotherms do not show the related bend. Ghiorso & Sack (1991) in contrast did account for the Ilm-Hem transition, however their model heavily relies on old experimental data involving sample compositions that were not controlled by microanalytical methods. Synthetic Tmt compositions are generally Ti-richer than predicted from the models. At low fO 2 and high T, the discrepancies between synthetic Tmt data and the models are presumably due to non-stoichiometric (i. e. cation vacant) Tmt. Tmt non-stoichiometry has been investigated in the system Fe-Ti-O at 1100 - 1300 °C for Tmt in assemblages in which maximum (Tmt+Ilmss) versus minimum (Tmt+Wus, Tmt+Fe) vacancy concentration (v. c.) is expected. Three methods have been used to detect and quantify v. c. : (1) Because cation deficiency involves a decrease of Tmt cell dimensions at constant Ti/(Ti+Fe), lattice parameters have been determined by Rietveld analysis. (2) At constant Ti/(Ti+Fe), cation vacancies are associated with higher Fe 3 +/Fetot. The latter have been determined by electron energy-loss spectroscopy on selected samples. (3) Annealing of a non-stoichiometric high-T Tmt at lower T (950 °C) under oxygen-conserving conditions induces vacancy relaxation. This comes along with compositional changes in the phases, which result in the formation of Ilmss exsolution lamellae and rims in Tmt, i. e. an increase in the Ilmss proportion. The results of the three approaches indicate that Tmt coexisting with Ilmss has only low v. c. or is very close to stoichiometry at XUsp 0. 7, v. c. increases with increasing XUsp and T to about 2 cat% for 1300 °C at XUsp close to 1. At T<= 1100 °C, i. e. at T relevant for crystallisation conditions of basic rocks, Tmt is close to stoichiometry for all XUsp. As the revised version of the Tmt-Ilmss thermo-oxybarometer also will involve high-T calibration data, it is important to account for Tmt non-stoichiometry in its solid solution models. To approach natural compositions, Tmt+Ilmss assemblages have been produced in the system Fe-Ti-Mg-Al-O. Mg-Al bearing Fe-Ti oxide compositions have been projected onto the Ilm-Hem and Mag-Usp binaries. X’Usp and X’Ilm of Mg-Al bearing phases are in reasonable agreement with the system Fe-Ti-O. The experimental isotherms determined for the system Fe-Ti-O can in principle also be applied to Mg-Al bearing samples. This provides a new, preliminary and graphical version of the Tmt-Ilmss thermo-oxybarometer, which has been tested on experimental data by Toplis & Carroll (1995). Compared to the T-fO 2 estimates derived with the previous models, the new, graphical thermo-oxybarometer brings significant improvements, especially in the T estimates...|$|R
