40|$|Objective. To {{validate}} the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set {{for individuals with}} spinal cord injury (SCI) in the early post-acute and long-term context from the perspective of physical therapists. Setting. International. Methods. Physical therapists experienced in the treatment of SCI were asked about problems, resources and aspects of the environment treated by them, in a three-round electronic mail survey using the Delphi technique. Responses were linked to the ICF by two researches; ?-coefficient was calculated as statistical measure of agreement. Results. In all, 81 experts from 27 countries named 3694 concepts. They were linked to 187 ICF categories for the early post-acute context. Three ICF categories from the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> function, five ICF categories from the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> structures and two ICF categories from the component activities and participation were not represented in the ICF Core Set for the early post-acute context.

To {{analyze the}} content of outcome {{measures}} commonly used to assess health in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) by linking the items of the instruments with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in order to evaluate the adequacy of currently used measures. Methods. Questionnaires used in FM were identified in a structured literature search. All concepts included in the items of the questionnaires were linked to ICF categories, according to previously published linking rules, by 2 independent health professionals. The percentages of linked ICF categories addressing the different ICF components were calculated. Results. Generic and symptom-specific instruments were included. From the 296 items contained in all 16 instruments, 447 concepts were extracted and then linked to 52 ICF categories of the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> functions, 1 category of the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> structure, 40 categories of the component activities and participation, and 9 categories of the component environmental factors.

40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a novel approach for nonlinear state estimation, named pi-IUKF (Invariant Unscented Kalman Filter), {{which is based on}} both invariant filter es-timation and UKF theoretical principles. Several research works on nonlinear invariant observers have been led and provide a geometrical-based constructive method for design-ing filters dedicated to nonlinear state estimation problems while preserving the physical properties and systems symmetries. The general invariant observer guarantees a straight-forward form of the nonlinear estimation error dynamics whose properties are remarkable. The developed pi-IUKF estimator suggests a systematic approach to determine all the symmetry-preserving correction terms, associated with a nonlinear state-space representa-tion used for prediction, without requiring any linearization of the differential equations. The exploitation of the UKF principles within the invariant framework has required the definition of a compatibility condition on the observation equations. As a first result, the estimated covariance matrices of the pi-IUKF converge to constant values due to the symmetry-preserving property provided by the nonlinear invariant estimation theory. The designed pi-IUKF method has been successfully applied to some relevant practical prob-lems such as the estimation of Attitude and Heading for aerial vehicles using low-cost AH reference systems (i. e., inertial/magnetic sensors characterized by low performances).

To {{identify}} and quantify {{the differences in}} functioning of individuals with tetraplegia versus paraplegia using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a frame of reference. Setting. International. Methods. Functional problems of 1048 participants {{with spinal cord injury}} in 16 study centers in 14 countries were recorded using ICF categories. The level of significance and odds ratios (OR) for experiencing each of these functional problems were reported for individuals with tetraplegia and paraplegia. Regression models were adjusted for age, age squared, early post-acute or long-term context, gender and for world regions. Results. Persons with tetraplegia are more at risk than persons with paraplegia to have difficulties in 36. 4 % categories of the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> functions. In the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> structures, 40 % of the categories show significant differences. Individuals with tetraplegia indicate problems in three categories, whereas individuals with paraplegia are more likely to indicate problems in one category. Most categories indicating difficulties (56. 6 %) for persons with tetraplegia were found for the component activities and participation. The component with the highest congruency was the environmental factors. Overall, 3. 7 % categories (of the persons with tetraplegia as experienced, 2. 4 % of the categories as barriers, whereas 4. 9 % were experienced to be facilitators) obtained OR, indicating individuals with tetraplegia having more difficulties.

It was observed that the soccer players showed markedly lower total impedance compared to the non-athletes. In both legs, it was particularly noted that there were significant differences between the right and left sides. The soccer players showed a higher skeletal muscle mass and lean/ideal lean × 100 % compared to the non-athletes. Furthermore, the soccer players had a lower rheobase and higher chronaxie.

Objectives: The {{specific}} aims of {{the study}} were (1) to identify problems of individuals with SCI in the early post-acute and the long-term context, respectively, addressed by health professionals and (2) to summarize these problems using the ICF. Setting: International. Methods: Physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers and psychologists were asked for problems in the functioning and contextual factors of individuals with SCI using open-ended questions. All answers were translated (‘linked’) to the ICF based on established rules. Absolute and relative frequencies of the linked ICF categories were reported stratified by the context. Results: Out of 243 selected experts, 144 (59. 3 %) named 7. 650 different themes, of which 78. 8 % could be linked to ICF categories. In the early post-acute context, 30. 7 % of the 88 categories belonged to the <b>component</b> <b>Body</b> Functions, 14. 8 % to Body Structures, 30. 7 % to Activities and Participation and 23. 9 % to Environmental Factors.

40|$|Children {{with chronic}} {{conditions}} often experience a long treatment {{which can be}} complex and negatively impacts the child's well-being. In planning treatment and interventions for children with chronic conditions, {{it is important to}} measure health-related quality of life (HrQoL). HrQoL instruments are considered to be a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) and should be used in routine practice. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the content dimensions of HrQoL instruments for children's self-reports using the framework of ICF-CY. Method: The sample consist of six instruments for health-related quality of life for children 5 to 18 years of age, which was used in the Swedish national quality registries for children and adolescents with chronic conditions. The following instruments were included: CHQ-CF, DCGM- 37, EQ- 5 D-Y, KIDSCREEN- 52, Kid-KINDL and PedsQL 4. 0. The framework of the ICF-CY was used as the basis for the comparison. Results: There were 290 meaningful concepts identified and linked to 88 categories in the classification ICF-CY with 29 categories of the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> functions, 48 categories of the component activities and participation and 11 categories of the component environmental factors. No concept were linked to the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> structures.

Conclusions: In conclusion, the results confirm that ICF-CY provide a good framework for content comparisons that evaluate similarities and differences to ICF-CY categories. The results of this study revealed the need for greater consensus of content across different HrQoL instruments.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{recognition of}} the patient perspective and, more specifically, functioning and health, {{has led to an}} impressive effort in research to develop concepts and instruments to measure them. Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) represent two different perspectives from which to look at functioning and health. Therefore, it is expected that both will often be used concurrently in clinical practice, research and health reporting. The objective of our {{study was to examine the}} relationship between six HRQOL instruments (the SF- 36, the NHP, the QL-I, the WHOQOL-BREF, the WHODASII and the EQ- 5 D) and the ICF. All six HRQOL instruments were linked to the ICF separately by two trained health professionals according to ten linking rules developed specifically for this purpose. The degree of agreement between health professionals was calculated by means of the kappa statistic. Bootstrapped confidence intervals were calculated. In the 148 items of the 6 instruments a total of 226 concepts were identified and linked to the ICF. The estimated kappa coefficients range between 0. 82 and 0. 98. The concepts contained in the items of the HRQOL instruments were linked to 91 different ICF categories, 17 categories of the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> functions, 60 categories of the component activities and participation, and 14 categories of the component environmental factors. Twelve concepts could not be linked to the ICF at all. In the <b>component</b> <b>body</b> functions, only emotional functions are covered by all examined instruments. In the component activities and participation, all instruments cover aspects of work, but the half of them scarcely cover aspects of mobility.
