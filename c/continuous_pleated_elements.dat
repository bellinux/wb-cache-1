40|$|Final Master‘s degree project {{contains}} of 15 originally made {{cotton dress}} collection, which reveals the tendencies of perspective fashion with <b>pleated</b> <b>elements</b> {{that are used}} quite often. A source of inspiration of this collection – interwar fashion of Kaunas city. Literature of the project review includes analysis of technological ways that textile is decorated and influence on features of materials. A new estimation method of pleats sharpness and stability was created according to review of technique of tightness and wrinkle. Using such technique, technological processing (washing at home conditions, moisturing, tightening, washing and softening at home conditions, industrial washing and softening) influence on quality of <b>pleated</b> <b>elements</b> was evaluated. It was observed, that the least suitable method on the formation of <b>pleated</b> <b>elements</b> is the industrial washing and softening, while the sharpest pleats were formed using tightening process. The research results of impact of technological decoration on sharpness of cotton clothing pleats were represented during conference of youth scientists called „Industrial engineering 2015 “ using a stand report and also published in the conference report material. In realising the practical part of research of the project, analysis of model analogues was accomplished and technical sketch of the main model of collection was presented. A dress was created, which contains of stature and parts of pleated skirt. Basic and fashionable construction of dress (stature and skirt) was designed, technology and process of production was projected, technological devices were chosen, terms and costs of the production were designated. The results of the project are summarized with conclusions and practical recommendations...|$|R

40|$|A lightweight, battery {{construction}} {{for lead}} acid batteries in which biplates are formed from a continuous strip of thermoplastic material, one face of the strip being provided with a plurality of electrically isolated lead strip arrays, each having a transverse axis about which the strip is folded or pleated to provide pleated biplate walls. The <b>pleated</b> <b>continuous</b> strip is sealed along edge longitudinal portions to provide chambers for receiving a plurality of non-conductive thermoplastic separator-plates and to contain electrolyte liquid. Separator-plates support resilient yieldable porous glass mats and scrim fabric in which active material is carried. The assembly of pleated biplates and separator-plates is maintained in pressure relation by exterior resilient means. A method of making such a <b>continuous</b> <b>pleated</b> biplate construction and of assembling one or more battery modules which may be connected in series or in parallel. A biplate construction having continuously wound lead stripes attached to a substrate...|$|R
500|$|The {{sporophyte}} at maturity {{is between}} 4 and 11mm tall. The spore capsule is attached {{at the top}} of the stalk and is distinctive, being asymmetric in shape and oblique in attachment. [...] As with most other Bryopsida, the opening through which the spores are released is surrounded by a double peristome (diplolepidious) formed from the cell walls of disintegrated cells. [...] The exostome (outer row) consists of 16 short articulated [...] "teeth". [...] Unlike most other mosses, the endostome (inner row) does not divide into teeth, but rather is a <b>continuous</b> <b>pleated</b> membrane around the capsule opening. [...] Only the genus Diphyscium has a similar peristome structure, although that genus has only 16 pleats in its endostome, in contrast to the 32 pleats in Buxbaumia. [...] Diphyscium shares with Buxbaumia one other oddity of the sporophyte; the foot (stalk base) ramifies as a result of outgrowths, so much so that they may be mistaken for rhizoids.|$|R

50|$|Most fuel {{injected}} vehicles use a <b>pleated</b> paper filter <b>element</b> {{in the form}} of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the throttle body with ductwork. Older vehicles that use carburetors or throttle body fuel injection typically use a cylindrical air filter, usually a few inches high and between 6 in and 16 in in diameter. This is positioned above the carburetor or throttle body, usually in a metal or plastic container which may incorporate ducting to provide cool and/or warm inlet air, and secured with a metal or plastic lid. The overall unit (filter and housing together) is called the air cleaner.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pleated</b> {{paper filter}} <b>elements</b> are the nearly {{exclusive}} choice for automobile engine air cleaners, {{because they are}} efficient, easy to service, and cost-effective. The [...] "paper" [...] term is somewhat misleading, as the filter media are considerably different from papers used for writing or packaging, etc. There is a persistent belief amongst tuners, fomented by advertising for aftermarket non-paper replacement filters, that paper filters flow poorly and thus restrict engine performance. In fact, {{as long as a}} pleated-paper filter is sized appropriately for the airflow volumes encountered in a particular application, such filters present only trivial restriction to flow until the filter has become significantly clogged with dirt. Construction equipment engines also use this.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} two high efficiency steel filters in the exhaust of an uranium oxide grit blaster at the Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee. The filters were installed in a specially designed filter housing with a reverse air-pulse cleaning system for automatically cleaning the filters in-place. Previous tests conducted on the same filters and housing at LLNL under controlled conditions using Arizona road dust showed good cleanability with reverse air pulses. Two high efficiency steel filters, containing 64 <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>elements</b> housed in the standard 2 {prime} x 2 {prime} {times} l{prime} HEPA frame, were evaluated in the filter test housing using a 1, 000 cfm slip stream containing {{a high concentration of}} depleted uranium oxide dust. One filter had the pleated cartridges manufactured to the authors specifications by the Pall Corporation and the other by Memtec Corporation. Test results showed both filters had a rapid increase in pressure drop with time, and reverse air pulses could not decrease the pressure drop. The authors suspected moisture accumulation in the filters was the problem since there were heavy rains during the evaluations, and the pressure drop of the Memtec filter decreased dramatically after passing clean, dry air through the filter and after the filter sat idle for one week. Subsequent laboratory tests on a single filter cartridge confirmed that water accumulation in the filter was responsible for the increase in filter pressure drop and the inability to lower the pressure drop by reverse air pulses. No effort was made to identify the source of the water accumulation and correct the problem because the available funds were exhausted...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to develop and {{validate}} a computer model for the design of pleated cartridge filters. Mathematical modelling of incompressible creeping flow and low permeability Darcy flow are well established and a number of reliable schemes for the simulation of these regimes are available in the literature. In the context of the present studies a computer model for modelling of combined Stokes/Darcy flows encountered in pleated cartridge filters has been developed. A two-dimensional simulation code that can model fluid hydrodynamics in permeable media as in dead-end pleated cartridge filters has been developed in FORTRAN. The developed code named as ACFAMP- Aircraft Cartridge Filter Analysis Modelling Program has been used to evaluate the performance and design of <b>pleated</b> cartridge filter <b>elements.</b> The governing equations of the flow model can be well represented by the Continuity, Stokes and Darcy equations respectively. Viscosity variations and non-Newtonian effects have been introduced to model the behaviour of shear-thickening fluids used in aircraft hydraulic circuits. The governing equations of the flow model are solved by using a weighted residuals finite element method. Two separate modelling approaches have been adopted in the model development. The first approach is based on modelling of flow through porous media by employing a slightly compressible form of continuity equation utilising nine-noded Lagrangian elements for domain discretisation in conjunction with a U-V -P finite element scheme. The second strategy is based on modelling of coupled Free/Porous regimes making the model industrially complaint. This scheme utilises the stabilised C 0 continuous Taylor-Hood element, which generates stable solutions for incompressible flows without any problems of numerical locking. Initial numerical experiments were based on simple geometries and the complexity of the geometries was finally extended to model the pleated cartridge filters. A permeability model that interprets medium compression effects and which is based on data obtained from flat sheets of the filter material used in the fabrication of the filter cartridge is incorporated within the main model. During pleating, bending and creasing the medium deforms and leads to a loss of permeability and/or effective filtering area results. The combined effects of compression and reduction in filtration area cause deviations from Darcy's law. The effects of medium compression, pleat deformation and pleat crowding have also been analysed. The present work is directed towards the prediction of accurate values of compression factors and percentage losses in the filtration area, which assist in designing <b>pleated</b> cartridge filter <b>elements.</b> The simulated results have been compared against the experimental data for purposes of validation.
