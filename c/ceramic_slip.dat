Industrial applied rheology attempts to relate fundamental properties to fitness-for-use of fluids of commerce. Architectural and industrial coatings, molded plastics, adhesives, personal care products and cosmetics, inks, cement, drilling muds, <b>ceramic</b> <b>slips,</b> solder pastes, foodstuffs and medicines are examples of rheologically complex fluids whose commercial viability depends on having the “right ” rheology. For such materials, the necessary rheological properties must be defined with due regard to the prevailing conditions of stress and strain rate in processing and application. Unfortunately, the predominant practice in industry with respect to rheological characterization is to rely on rugged but simple viscometers or “viscometry devices”. These typically measure within a limited range of stress or strain rate, generally returning arbitrary numbers of uncertain value. On the other hand, it is often very difficult to link fundamental rheological properties with “real-world ” performance. The challenge to the applied rheologist is to design experiments having relevance to the process at hand and then usefully apply the result- in other words, to bridge rheology and technology.

Therefore, significant advancements in materials technology are needed to raise turbine inlet temperatures above 2400 F to increase engine specific thrust and operating efficiency. Because of their low density and high-temperature strength and thermal conductivity, in situ toughened silicon nitride ceramics have received {{a great deal of}} attention for cooled structures. However, the high processing costs and low impact resistance of silicon nitride ceramics have proven to be major obstacles for widespread applications. Advanced rapid prototyping technology in combination with conventional gel casting and sintering can reduce high processing costs and may offer an affordable manufacturing approach. Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center, in cooperation with a local university and an aerospace company, are developing actively cooled and functionally graded ceramic structures. The objective of this program is to develop cost-effective manufacturing technology and experimental and analytical capabilities for environmentally stable, aerodynamically efficient, foreign-object-damage-resistant, in situ toughened silicon nitride turbine nozzle vanes, and to test these vanes under simulated engine conditions.

The homogeneous deaerated bodies with a solid content up to 70 % w (37 % vol) using hydroxyethylcellulose as binder were mixed in a vacuum dissolver to a reproducible viscosity. The shaping of the wet layers was made by means of a plunger extruder by variation of the volume flow, the gap height, and the mode of applying the formed layer onto the support belt. Only in a drawing mode the thickness of wet layers corresponded with the width of the slit forming tapes from 0, 13 to 0, 60 mm thickness. In the bead mode almost the thickness of the layers was independent of the conditions of extrusion, but seemed to depend on the wetting and rheological properties of the casting bodies. The workability of the pseudoplastic bodies was limited by the pressure characteristic of the extruder and by the homogenization process. Due to the expensive facilities relating to the doctor-blade-process the application of slip extrusion for making thin ceramic tapes should be restricted to the moduling of complicated bodies or of multilayer tapes by a simultaneous wet-in-wet-deposition of the extruded single layers.

This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of the European Ceramic Society [© Elsevier] and is available at: [URL] is well established that with advanced ceramic powders the use of dispersed slips can result in superior microstructures compared to those obtained,from partially or fully flocculated slips but at the cost of a signtjicantly slower casting rate. Recent published research has also indicated that bodies produced from coagulated slips have similar properties to those. from dispersed slips due to the lubricating nature of the hydrated layer surrounding the powder particles. However, little attention has been given to the possibility of accelerating the slow casting rate obtained with dispersed or coagulated advanced <b>ceramic</b> <b>slips</b> by the use of heating the slip. This paper investigates the effect of elevated temperature on the rheological properties and casting rates of four slips: one dispersed electrostatically, one dispersed electrosterically and two which are based on electrostatic dispersion followed by the addition of direrent salt levels to achieve coagulated slips. It is observed that the use of elevated temperatures results in increases in the casting rates in all cases, however the coagulated slips behave dofferently to dispersed slips. The latter display casting rates which increase linearly with increasing temperature whilst coagulated slips display an initial rapid increase after which the casting rate decreases signtcantly. This is believed to be due to the interaction between the permeability of the green body and the state of dispersion of the slip. A further observation arising from the work is that there is generally an enhanced casting rate when microwave energy is used to heat the slips compared to that achieved with a convection oven. The mechanism of acceleration is believed to be due to the rate of water movement through the cast being increased more than the rate of water uptake by the cast...|$|R

40|$|Both {{dense and}} porous {{construction}} materials {{are widely used}} in civil and industrial construction. For example, lightweight concrete, cellular concrete, foam concrete {{and other types of}} lightweight concrete are used almost as widely as conventional concrete. However, for the production of walls made of ceramic materials, bricks with dense structure and hollow bricks still are the most popular building materials. Lower expenses related to the production of building materials having necessary properties will lead to decreased production costs allowing to increase the production capacity due to the economy of raw materials, other materials and fuel. According to the calculations, today, when the thermal resistance for wall structures has increased 2. 5 - 3 times, having an average density of wall material 900 - 1100 kg/m 3 it is no longer possible to meet the requirements for the thermal resistance of the outer walls 460 - 520 mm in the climatic conditions of the Baltic region. It is necessary either to increase wall thickness or to use more efficient insulation materials which both are not cost-efficient solutions. One of the possible solutions for the given problem is reduction of the average density for the wall material. Economic efficiency due to the reduction of average density for the wall material is the following:production capacity of the material decreases, fuel consumption in the production process of blocks or bricks decreases, energy consumption on bricklaying for 1 m 2 of the outer wall decreases; less manual work, depending on the wall thickness, heat resistance in walls of the building increases.

40|$|A {{primary concern}} in modern fluid {{dynamics}} {{research is the}} experimental verification of computational aerothermodynamic codes. This research requires high precision and detail in the test model employed. Ceramic materials are used for these models because of their low heat conductivity and their survivability at high temperatures. To fabricate such models, slip casting techniques were developed to provide net-form, precision casting capability for high-purity ceramic materials in aqueous solutions. In previous slip casting techniques, block, or flask molds made of plaster-of-paris were used to draw liquid from the slip material. Upon setting, parts {{were removed from the}} flask mold and cured in a kiln at high temperatures. Casting detail was usually limited with this technique [...] detailed parts were frequently damaged upon separation from the flask mold, as the molded parts are extremely delicate in the uncured state, and the flask mold is inflexible. Ceramic surfaces were also marred by 'parting lines' caused by mold separation. This adversely affected the aerodynamic surface quality of the model as well. (Parting lines are invariably necessary on or near the leading edges of wings, nosetips, and fins for mold separation. These areas are also critical for flow boundary layer control.) Parting agents used in the casting process also affected surface quality. These agents eventually soaked into the mold, the model, or flaked off when releasing the case model. Different materials were tried, such as oils, paraffin, and even an algae. The algae released best, but some of it remained on the model and imparted an uneven texture and discoloration on the model surface when cured. According to the present invention, a wax pattern for a shell mold is provided, and an aqueous mixture of a calcium sulfate-bonded investment material is applied as a coating to the wax pattern. The coated wax pattern is then dried, followed by curing to vaporize the wax pattern and leave a shell mold of the calcium sulfate-bonded investment material.

40|$|AbstractThe Munsell {{color system}} is almost universally used for {{measuring}} colors of archeological artifacts. In addition to recording soil colors, many use the Munsell system {{to record the}} colors of ceramic attributes, such as pastes, slips, glazes, and paints. These data are often used in both modal and typological analyses of ceramic style. Most often, however, Munsell color data are used in a purely descriptive fashion, and the quantitative potential of the information is not fully exploited. We propose here a new protocol for manipulating, analyzing, and interpreting Munsell color data that permits the statistical investigation of sets of Munsell observations as well as hypothesis testing. A Munsell color reading is composed of three continuous interval scale variables, and these data can be transformed into x, y, z coordinates that define a location in color space (D'Andrade and Romney, 2003). Once transformed into spatial coordinates, Munsell data can be analyzed using spatial analysis techniques, such as k-means cluster analysis, as well as non-spatial statistical methods. In our case, we chose to use logistic regression to study {{the degree to which}} color could differentiate ceramic types and varieties. We argue that logistic regression is an appropriate approach for testing common types of hypotheses that archeologists may pose with ceramic color data. We illustrate the approach on sets of Munsell data representing <b>ceramic</b> <b>slip</b> colors from Mayapán, Yucatán, México. We were able to show a clear separation between the Mama Red and Polbox Buff types. Using the techniques we suggest here, archeologists can significantly expand their modal analyses of ceramics because color is a common and easily measured attribute in most ceramic assemblages. The same techniques can easily be extended to other kinds of artifacts, including lithics and textiles, as well as soils, sediments, plants, and other objects studied by field scientists...|$|E

After Fantomex destroys Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it is noticed that there are two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII. After the battle, Fantomex's <b>ceramic</b> mask <b>slips</b> a bit and Jean Grey uses her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex is actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel. It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confesses to Jean Grey that he is not the master thief that he had claimed, but is now set out to earn that reputation. He assures Jean Grey that he refuses to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allows Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrive.|$|R
40|$|Ceramic {{industry}} {{represents an}} important sector {{of economic activity}} in the European countries and involves complex and numerous manufacturing processes. The unidirectional dry pressing process includes milling and stirring of raw materials (mainly clay and talc minerals) in aqueous suspensions, followed by spray drying to remove excess water obtaining spray-dried powders further subjected to dry pressing process (conformation). However, spray-dried ceramic powders exhibit an important variability in their performance when subjected to the dry pressing process, particularly in the adhesion to the mold and mechanical strength, affecting the quality of the final conformed ceramic products. Therefore, several synthetic additives (deflocculants, antifoams, binders, lubricants and plasticizers) are introduced in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>slips</b> to achieve uniform and homogeneous pastes, conditioning their rheological properties. However, an important variability associated with the performance of the conformed products is still reported. Exopolysaccharides or Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) are polymers excreted by living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae, which may confer unique and potentially interesting properties with potential industrial uses, such as viscosity control, gelation, and flocculation. Polysaccharides, such as pullulan, gellan, carrageenan and xanthan have found a wide range of applications in food, pharmaceutical, petroleum, and in other industries. The aim of this study was the assessment of exopolysaccharides as natural additives to optimize the performance of spray-dried ceramic powders during the unidirectional dry pressing process, replacing the synthetic additives used in the ceramic production process. Six exopolysaccharides, namely pullulan, gellan, xanthan gum, κappa- and iota-carrageenan, and guar gum were tested in steatite-based spray-dried ceramic powders at different concentrations. Subsequently, these ceramic powders were submitted to unidirectional dry pressing process (conformation) and the green conformed bodies were tested on the following properties: mechanical flexural strength and adhesion/disaggregation of the conformed material. The binding state of polysaccharides and mineral grains was evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Our data showed that xanthan gum and pullulan were the most effective polysaccharides in improving the performance of spray-dried ceramic powders during unidirectional dry pressing process, in comparison to the control steatite-based ceramic bodies containing synthetic additives. In addition, these polysaccharides yielded the best cost-benefit relationship, representing an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to synthetic additives used in technical ceramics industry. Hence, this study has contributed to define a new and sustainable strategy to improve the performance of ceramic materials during unidirectional dry pressing process, reduce production costs and minimize environmental impact.

40|$|Abstract. Slip is a semifluid clayey type of {{material}} used in the ceramic industry for coating earthware products, such as bricks and tiles, thus providing distinct surface colors or patterns. In the present work a characterization was conducted to identify the mineralogical as well the chemical and physical properties of geological materials existing in the slip used by industries in the north region {{of the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The basic natural materials composing a slip, namely clay and kaolin, are responsible for changes not only the slip plasticity but also in its viscosity and adhesion {{to the surface of the}} <b>ceramic</b> piece. The <b>slip</b> characterization was performed in terms of particle size analysis, Atterberg limits and actual grain density. The chemical composition was obtained by X-ray fluorescence and the thermal properties by differential thermal analysis. The results indicated that marked differences exist between slip from distinct origins. A few slip samples failed to present the required properties...|$|R
