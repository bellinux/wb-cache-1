A <b>controller</b> (<b>device)</b> is a device used to measure and regulate {{the speed of a}} machine, such as a motor (Greek: tele = far away (distant), tacho = speed, graphein = write). A tachograph is a card with a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes.|$|E

25|$|DJ {{software}} {{can be used}} to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a DJ <b>controller</b> <b>device</b> that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the computer keyboard & touchpad on a laptop, or the touchscreen on a tablet computer or smartphone. Many DJ controllers have an integrated sound card with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthesizer}} (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is {{an electronic}} musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often {{played with a}} musical keyboard, {{but they can be}} controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a <b>controller</b> <b>device,</b> often a MIDI keyboard or other controller.|$|E
50|$|The bulk {{of linear}} editing is done simply, with two {{machines}} and an edit <b>controller</b> <b>device</b> to control them. Many video tape machines {{are capable of}} controlling a second machine, {{eliminating the need for}} an external editing control device.|$|E
5000|$|Auto-configuration is the {{automatic}} configuration of devices without manual intervention, without {{any need for}} software configuration programs or jumpers.

5000|$|RTUs {{and other}} {{automatic}} <b>controller</b> <b>devices</b> were developed {{before the advent}} of industry wide standards for interoperability.

50|$|Digital {{sampling}} technology, {{introduced in}} the 1980s, has become a staple of music production in the 2000s. Devices that use sampling, record a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a piano or flute being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a <b>controller</b> <b>device</b> (e.g., an electronic keyboard, electronic drum pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various audio effects and audio processing. Sampling {{has its roots in}} France with the sound experiments carried out by Musique Concrete practitioners.|$|E
50|$|Within a micro {{instruction}} execution cycle, the CPU {{as well as}} an input / output controller is connected to an external 16 kByte huge random access memory device (RAM). Via the input-output <b>controller</b> <b>device,</b> communication with virtual input and output devices is supported by Direct Memory Access mode (DMA), Inter-Integrated Circuit Connection (I2C), and Interrupt request functionality (IRQ). A output port, a display, a timer, an event trigger, a digital-analog converter, a keyboard and data input / output channel is provided as virtual IC device for explaining didactically the communication with external devices.|$|E

50|$|Audio {{capabilities}} {{were provided}} by the DECaudio TURBOchannel option module, which contained two AMD 79C30A DSC (Digital Subscriber <b>Controller)</b> <b>devices</b> and a Motorola 56001 DSP. The two AMD 79C30A DSCs were used for voice-quality audio input and output, while the Motorola 56001 was used for high-quality audio.

5000|$|Like most synthesizers of the time, the JX-10 is {{programmed}} {{by selecting}} the desired parameter through a keypad and editing that parameter using a data wheel Roland dubbed the [...] "Alpha-Dial". Like the JX-8P, this editing technique can be bypassed by connecting a PG-800 device to the programmer port {{located on the}} back of the keyboard synthesizer, or on the front of the rack-mounted version. Alternatively the JX-10 and MKS-70 can be programmed over MIDI using a <b>controller</b> <b>device</b> such as the KiwiTechnics Patch Editor (a firmware update is required on the JX-10).|$|E

50|$|Although the {{mechanisms}} they use vary, all oscillating clocks, mechanical, digital and atomic, work similarly {{and can be}} divided into analogous parts. They consist of an object that repeats the same motion over and over again, an oscillator, with a precisely constant time interval between each repetition, or 'beat'. Attached to the oscillator is a <b>controller</b> <b>device,</b> which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to friction, and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of counter, and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of indicator displays the result in human readable form.|$|E
