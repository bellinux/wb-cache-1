5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in a <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap {{on the night of the}} disaster.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the Terran Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are in a <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions amongst themselves. Nevertheless, terran ingenuity and unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand {{as one of the}} three dominant species of the galaxy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{organizational}} thinking primarily saw organizations as a machine, which meant {{large amounts of}} bureaucracy, hierarchy, and standardization. An organization was a determinist, closed system. This approach was rejected In the mid-1900s, as organizations became {{to be seen as}} dynamic systems in <b>constant</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> change.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the fictional work conceived by Don DeLillo {{in the aftermath}} of September 11 th. It stresses its intimate dialogue with the coeval visual arts, and in particular with the traumatic nature of performance art. It also insists on the ability of the contemporary historical novel to provide a private and inner background to the most controversial events in American history. In so doing, DeLillo's factual fiction rivals other documentary and reproducible forms of historical representation in its attempt to go beyond the surface of things, and point to a media-conscious future willing to resist the <b>constant</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> emergency manufactured in the age of terror. <br /...|$|R

5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was a {{relatively}} new concept, but grew slowly before exploding {{with the advent of}} air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} Apache raids {{led to a}} <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> unease in San Antonio, and some {{families}} left the area, while others refused to leave {{the safety of the}} town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing threesoldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's last {{plan was}} to orchestrate a major war between the European powers and the Ottoman Empire. The border with the Empire was in a near <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> {{low-level}} warfare; some historians estimate {{that in the first}} half of the 17th century, Ottoman raids and wars resulted in the loss (death or enslavement) of about 300,000 Commonwealth citizens in the borderlands. The war, Władysław hoped, would also solve the problem of unrest among the Cossacks, a militant group living in the Ukraine, near the Ottoman border, who could find worth in such a campaign, and turn their attention to fighting for the Commonwealth, instead of against it. As usual, he failed to inspire the nobility, rarely willing to consider sponsoring another war, to agree to this plan. He received more support from foreign powers, from Rome, Venice and Muscovy. With the promise of funds for the war, Władysław started recruiting troops among the Cossacks in 1646. The opposition of the Sejm, demanding that he dismiss the troops, coupled with Władysław's worsening health, crippled that plan as well. Władysław still did not give up, and attempted to resurrect the plan in 1647, and with support of magnate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (who organized military exercises near Ottoman border), attempted unsuccessfully to provoke the Ottomans to attack.|$|E
40|$|A {{lipid bilayer}} {{provides}} a compartmentalized matrix within which embedded proteins and other macromolecules are in <b>constant</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> motion and redistribution—the {{processes that are}} essential to cellular mechanisms, such as metabolism, endocytosis and secretion, differentiation, locomotion, and signal transduction. A lipid bilayer in natural and reconstituted membranes imposes constraints that restrict the larger segmental and global motions of constituent molecules to the microsecond to millisecond time domains. This chapter discusses methods for analyzing such rotational and translation displacements based on the time-resolved emission {{of light in the}} form of fluorescence and phosphorescence. These techniques offer the sensitivity and selectivity required for the studies of relatively sparse cell-surface receptors or other membrane components in preparations examined in a microscope and in a suspension...|$|R

And in so doing, I offer some critiques about how popular constructions of what “love” and affection mean are always tentatively related to our relationship with and exposure to pornography. This research thus argues that our popular understanding of sexual desire, lust, and love are in <b>constant</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> flux as sex is commodified and sold to us in a proliferating daily diet within a media-saturated culture.

50|$|Emotional {{well-being}} is a {{term that}} has been used increasingly in recent decades. The implications of decreased emotional well-being are related to mental health concerns such as stress, depression, and anxiety. These in turn can contribute to physical ill-health such as digestive disorders, sleep disturbances, and general lack of energy. The profile of a person prone to emotional distress is usually someone with low self-esteem, pessimistic, very self-critical…, people who need to constantly assert themselves through their behavior. They also tend to be afraid, overly worried about the future, and focused on the past. As Dr. Marisa Navarro says in her book La Medicina Emocional (Emotional Medicine), “no one is safe from suffering this emotional state. It is a very serious problem that can result in <b>constant</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> anger, sadness, worry and even anxiety or depression”.|$|R
