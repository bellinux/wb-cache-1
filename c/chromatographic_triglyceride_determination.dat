40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the differences of gene expression profiles between intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes originated from the isolated preadipocytes in vitro. Cytosolic <b>triglyceride</b> <b>determination</b> indicated that subcutaneous adipocytes accumulated more lipid than intramuscular adipocytes did at the late stage of differentiation. Microarray assay revealed that 172 probes representing 133 genes were differentially expressed, among which 46 genes were highly expressed in intramuscular adipocytes and the other 87 genes were highly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes. Real-time PCR confirmed that genes related to lipid metabolism, such as LPL, FABP 4, FABP 5 and OSBPL 10, were predominantly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes, whereas BMP 4 and BMP 7 were highly expressed in intramuscular adipocytes. The results indicated that the accumulation of lipid mass in subcutaneous adipocytes might be due to the highly expressed genes related to lipid metabolism, and the high levels of BMP 4 and BMP 7 in intramuscular adipocytes suggested that BMPs might be involved in the differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes.

Also considered is the total lipid value calculated from the cholesteroland triglyceride concentrations. THE AVAILABLE SEMIAUTOMATED METHODS for the precise and accurate quantitation of serum cholesterol, phospholipids, and glycerides have vastly reduced the labor, laboratory equipment, space, and typical errors attendant to performing these studies. Still needed, however, is a procedure for total lipid assay which retains the analytic integrity of the gravimetric method and, at the same time, can be conveniently applied to quantitating a large number of serum samples. One solution to this problem is to perform the cholesterol, phospho-lipid, and triglyceride assays, and then calculate the total lipid concen-tration, from the values of the lipid fractions. The purpose of this paper, then, is to evaluate this summation meth-od as a useful tool in providing accurate and precise total lipid values for clinical use.

40|$|There is {{a burgeoning}} {{focus on the}} {{relation}} between serumcholesterol levels and psychiatric disorders, including depression and other anxiety disorders (1, 2). Information about the relation between serum lipid levels and sleep disor-ders is relatively limited in the psychiatric literature. In a pre-vious study, we found that serum cholesterol level was higher in patients with recurrent panic attacks, compared with panic disorder patients without sleep panic and with healthy sub-jects (3). In a recent study, we also examined the relation between serum lipid concentrations in subjects with sleep-related violent behaviours (4). Low serum cholesterol level was associated with violent behaviour during sleep. Nightmares are long, frightening dreams that wake the sleeper. They typically occur later in the night during REM sleep and produce vivid dream imagery, complete awaken-ings, autonomic arousal, and detailed recall of the event; they may cause psychological distress and social or occupational dysfunction (5). In this study, we aimed to examine the rela-tion between recurrent nightmares and serum lipid levels. Can J Psychiatry, Vol 50, No 6, May 2005 361 Objective: To examine {{whether there is a}} relation between nightmares and serum lipid levels. Methods: Fifteen subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of nightmare disorder and 15 healthy control subjects participated in the study. We used an enzymatic colorimetric method for cholesterol and <b>triglyceride</b> <b>determination.</b> We measured high-density lipoprotien (HDL) cholesterol using the direct HDL-cholesterol method.

40|$|Abstract Background N- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids, such as {{docosahexaenoic acid}} (DHA; 22 : 6 n- 3), has clinical {{significance in the}} prevention and reversal of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the precious mechanism underlying remains unclear. The inflammasome, a multiprotein complex formed by NOD-like receptor (NLR) family members, has been recently shown to be activated in NASH and promote the cleavage of the pro-inflammatory cytokines to their maturation forms. Methods HepG 2 cells were exposed to different dose of PA for 24 [*]h {{with or without the}} preincubation of 50 [*]μM DHA for another 24 [*]h and then lipid deposition was assessed with Oil red O staining and intracellular <b>triglyceride</b> (TG) <b>determination.</b> Secretory levels of inflammatory cytokines and Caspase- 1 activity were determined by ELISA assays. Gene expression and protein levels were determined by quantitative RCR and western blotting, respectively. Results Palmitate (PA) dose-dependently increased lipid accumulation, TG content and induced the secretion of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 18, TNF-α and MCP- 1 from HepG 2 cells. Preincubation with DHA significantly alleviated PA-induced lipid accumulation and inflammatory agents. DHA was also found to attenuate PA-induced NOD-like receptor protein 4 (NLRC 4) mRNA expression. Furthermore, PA induced caspase- 1 activation in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in exacerbating of procaspase- 1 and pro-IL- 1 β processing. Knockdown of NLRC 4 partially abrogated PA-induced caspase- 1 activation and IL- 1 β maturation and completely abolished these events in the presence of DHA. Conclusions Our findings indicate DHA attenuates PA-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation through suppressing NLRC 4 inflammasome activation, caspase- 1 activation and IL- 1 β cleavage. </p...|$|R

The results showed that IATU has association with all cardiovascular risk factors and has better specificity and accurately for CVD risk than waist circumference and sagittal diameter. The values of 7 cm for both sexes was the cut off lengths obtained by IATU to predict moderate CV risk; 8 and 9 cm were the cut off length obtained by IATU to predict high CV risk for men and for women respectively. The IATU is a useful way to determine visceral fat and seems to be predictive of cardiovascular risk...|$|R
