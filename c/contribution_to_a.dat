5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> deeper {{scientific}} curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden {{is defined by}} its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year is {{an award}} {{presented}} at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year award ceremony. The award is presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sport in that year. The award was decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panellist voted for their top two choices; their first preference was awarded two points, and their second preference was awarded one point. The winning sportsperson had the most total points. In the case of a points tie, the sportsperson chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared. In 2015 the public voted for this award.|$|E

25|$|Colour is {{the most}} obvious {{property}} of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except {{in the case of}} incandescence, which does not apply to minerals). Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mineral's colour is diagnostic. Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.|$|E

25|$|Perceived {{organizational}} support (POS) is {{the degree}} to which employees believe that their organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being and fulfills socioemotional needs.

This idea bloomed from Eisenberger and Rhoades' organizational support theory.|$|E

25|$|Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War began with a small commitment of 30 military advisors in 1962, and increased over the following decade to a peak of 7,672 Australian personnel following the Menzies Government's April 1965 decision to upgrade its military commitment to South Vietnam's security. By the time the last Australian personnel were withdrawn in 1972, the Vietnam War had become Australia's longest war, and was only recently surpassed by Australia's long term commitment of combat forces to the War in Afghanistan. It currently remains Australia's largest force <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> foreign conflict since the Second World War and was also the most controversial in Australian society since the conscription controversy during the First World War. Although initially enjoying broad support due to concerns about the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, a vocal anti-war movement developed in response to Australia's programme of conscription.|$|E
