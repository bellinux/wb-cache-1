5000|$|After {{the second}} annual survey in 2005, Duke CIBER {{launched}} collaborations with European research partners to expand the research initiative into a research network and to facilitate the recruiting of companies for the survey. [...] The third survey in 2006 was sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton and involved data collection from U.S. as well as European firms and public agencies, from Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and Spain. Since then, the project has been further extended and now includes research partners and organizations from Scandinavia, Belgium, Australia and Italy. In 2007, the Conference Board became a lead supporter of the ORN project, and the ORN team launched {{for the first time}} a <b>complementary</b> <b>survey</b> of service providers, mainly based in India, China and the United States. [...] In 2009, the ORN survey is being converted to a web-based application with a new benchmarking feature adding value to participating organizations. The findings from the annual research surveys have shifted the focus of ORN research over time. After its initial orientation to offshoring white-collar work, the ORN project has put more emphasis on the global search for talent and offshoring of higher-skilled tasks, in particular product development. Most recently, the ORN project has positioned itself as a research project focusing on studying companies in their transition to globalizing their business functions, processes and administrative services. Offshoring is understood as an intermediary step towards evolving new global organizational capabilities rather than an end in itself.|$|E
40|$|Tank bromeliads, {{frequently}} {{associated with}} ants, are considered 'biodiversity amplifiers' for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms, {{and thus have}} a high ecological value. The focal species of this study, Aechmea aquilega, sheltered the colonies of 12 ant species in a Guianese rural habitat where Odontomachus haematodus, associated with 60 % of these plants, was the most frequent. Unexpectedly, the ant species richness was higher in a compared urban habitat with 21 species, but two synanthropic and four invasive ants were noted among them. Consequently, we conducted baiting surveys (on the ground, on trees and on trees bearing A. aquilega) as well as <b>complementary</b> <b>surveys</b> using different sampling modes in urban areas to test if A. aquilega is a surrogate revealing the presence of certain invasive ants. During the baiting survey, we recorded four Neotropical and eight introduced invasive ants {{out of a total}} of 69 species. Of these 12 invasive species, five were noted by baiting A. aquilega (including two only noted in this way). A bootstrap simulation permitted us to conclude that A. aquilega significantly concentrates certain species of invasive ants. This was confirmed by <b>complementary</b> <b>surveys,</b> where we did not record further species. We conclude that baiting on trees bearing large epiphytes in human-modified, Neotropical areas is a relevant complement to the early detection of invasive ants. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
