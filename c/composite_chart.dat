40|$|Selecting and {{configuring}} {{control charts}} {{can be a}} difficult task. Literature has not provided evidence as to which type of <b>composite</b> control <b>chart</b> is best among composite moving average (CMA), composite exponentially weighted moving average (CEWMA) and composite cumulative sum (CCUSUM). Optimising three-component <b>composite</b> control <b>charts</b> was considered very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Additionally, a traditional method for comparing control charts across a domain of step shift sizes called the average ratio of average time to signal (ARATS), can lead to inconsistent conclusions. Thus, there have been insufficient methods and data published for an informed selection from <b>composite</b> control <b>chart</b> types and configurations. This study {{is the first to}} optimise and compare two and three-component <b>composite</b> control <b>charts.</b> Distribution parameters were assumed to be unknown and were estimated from 200 observations. Software was created to automatically configure <b>composite</b> control <b>charts</b> to achieve specifications for the in-control average time to signal (ICATS) and the contribution of each of the components to false alarms, or loadings. Detection time profiles were simulated for full factorial experiments of control chart parameters using averages of at least 1, 000, 000 chart runs per simulation. New performance and comparison measure were invented to complete the research. A new performance measure Mean Relative Loss (MRL) was defined and used for optimising control chart configurations. MRL compares the average time to signal (ATS) profile across a step shift domain to the profile of a reference CUSUM control chart. Average Difference Relative to the Average (ADRA) was defined to overcome the problem noted with ARATS. Three-component CCUSUM bettered three-component CEWMA (ADRA = 5. 0...|$|R

This paper evaluates the viability of an S chart configuration that uses probability limits and a Western Electric-type warning rule by comparing it to a standard S chart scheme that uses only probability limits. A Markov chain analysis using the concept of first passage time is used to define a warning zone on the <b>composite</b> S <b>chart</b> scheme such that the <b>composite</b> S <b>chart</b> has the same "in-control" average run length (ARL) as the non-composite S chart scheme. The performances of the two configurations are then simulated {{in order to obtain}} the ARL profiles as the process standard deviation increases from 1. The results of the simulation corroborate the underlying theory, i. e., the ARL decreases as the process standard deviation increases. Moreover, the simulation indicates that the <b>composite</b> S <b>chart</b> scheme (using warning limits) detects process standard deviation shifts more quickly than the non-composite configuration when the size of the shift is "small.

This project report evaluates the viability of an alternative S chart scheme using probability limits of [0. 00135, 0. 99865] and a WECO-type rule that increases {{the sensitivity of the}} chart by comparing it to a standard S chart scheme using only probability limits of [0. 005, 0. 995]. In chapter 2 Methodology of Analysis, a Markov chain analysis using the concept of first passage time (as described in [2]) is used to define a warning zone on the <b>composite</b> S <b>chart</b> scheme that gives the <b>composite</b> S <b>chart</b> scheme the same "in-control" average run length (ARL) as the non-composite S chart scheme.

The results of the computer simulation corroborate the theory described in [1], viz., ARL decreases as the process standard deviation shifts, d, increase. Moreover, the results indicate that the <b>composite</b> S <b>chart</b> scheme detects process standard deviation shifts more quickly when 0 d < 1. 50, and the non-composite S chart scheme detects process standard deviation shifts more quickly when d 1. 50. 3 Table of Contents ABSTRACT [...] 1 TABLE OF CONTENTS [...] 3...|$|R

Compared with other portions of the United States (e. g., the Great Plains), the frequency is relatively low.
