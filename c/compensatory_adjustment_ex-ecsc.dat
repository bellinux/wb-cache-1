The execution of reach actions {{in a virtual}} environment (VE) demonstrates similar characteristics to reaches performed in the real-world, however, {{it is unclear whether}} the VE itself significantly impacts movement planning or <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to directly compare the use of planning and adjustments to control extent for unconstrained reach actions performed in an immersive VE to those performed in an analogous real-world environment (RWE). 				 				 					 						Methods 					Five non-disabled adults (29 &# 8201;&# 177;&# 8201; 5 &# 160;years) reached with the dominant, right arm to six targets presented in two directions (+ 45 &# 176;, - 45 &# 176;) and three distances (8, 16, 24 &# 160;cm) in a VE and an analogous RWE. Position data were sampled at 120 &# 160;Hz from an electromagnetic marker on the index finger and differentiated to determine velocity and acceleration. The control of reach extent was compared between the two environments (paired t-test) as to the use of planning (correlation of peak acceleration with movement distance), <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> prior to peak velocity (correlation of time to peak velocity with movement distance), and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> after peak velocity (variance in movement distance accounted for by deterministic statistical model). 				 				 					 						Results 					Reach movements were relatively fast ( 92 % of the variance in movement distance across participants and environments. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					The VE did not impact movement planning or subsequent <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> for the control of reach extent when directly compared to an analogous RWE. An immersive VE is a valid environment for the study of unconstrained reach actions...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{was designed}} {{to determine the effects}} of unilateral sensorimotor stroke on the ability to use initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> for unconstrained reach actions. Three studies were organized to answer this question. First, because of the novel nature of the immersive virtual environment (VE), the measurement validity of the experimental paradigm was investigated. Second, to validate the VE for the study of unconstrained reach actions, task performance was compared between the VE and a real-world environment (RWE) in young, non-disabled adults. The final and most important study investigated the planning and adjustments of reach actions in individuals with sensorimotor stroke when moving with the ipsilesional and contralesional arm. To glean information about the perceived confidence of the performer, the relationship between reach performance and task-specific self-efficacy was examined.; After determination of the measurement validity of the VE, six young, non-disabled adults, 12 individuals with sensorimotor stroke (six with right brain damage and six with left brain damage), and six age-matched, non-disabled older adults were recruited. Participants performed goal-directed reach actions to six virtual targets that were presented in two directions (+ 45 ° and - 45 ° from center) and three distances (8, 16, and 24 cm) in a single data collection session. Younger, non-disabled participants reached with the right arm only but did so in two environments: the VE and an analogous RWE. Participants with mild to moderate motor impairment after stroke and the age-matched older, non-disabled adults reached separately with the right and left arms in the VE. Individuals rated their level of self-efficacy for reach accuracy and reach speed prior to each block of trials. Reach movement kinematics were used to characterize performance and to quantify the use of initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in all studies and participants.; Comparison of reach movements between the immersive VE and the RWE performed by younger, non-disabled participants revealed no significant difference in the control of these actions thereby validating the VE condition for future studies. Individuals relied on a control pattern that combined both anticipatory planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> to achieve the actual movement distance. A similar pattern of control was observed for goal-directed reaches performed with the right and left arm in the older, non-disabled participants in the VE. Goal-directed reaches performed with the ipsilesional arm resembled those of the control group in the use of initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments.</b> However, reach actions performed with the contralesional arm tended to rely less on an initial plan and more on feedback based <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> compared to the matched arm in non-disabled controls. This trend was evident in both stroke groups (right brain damage, left brain damage) but only statistically significant for the right brain damage group for reach actions across midline. Additionally, individuals with right brain damage demonstrated changes in reach kinematics with both arms that suggested they were slowing down the speed of movement to improve endpoint accuracy, a finding unique to the right brain damage group. As expected, self-efficacy for reach accuracy and reach speed was lower for the contralesional arm than for the ipsilesional arm in both the right brain damage and left brain damage groups.; Overall, the use of initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the ipsilesional arm after sensorimotor stroke did not differ from non-disabled controls. The contralesional arm demonstrated a decreased utilization of initial planning that was more significant in the right brain damage group than the left brain damage group. This change in control of goal-directed reach actions was reflected by a decrease in reach self-efficacy suggesting a perceptual awareness of paretic limb movement capability. Together, the findings of this dissertation provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of the control of goal-directed reach actions after stroke, the impact of training and practice conditions on that control, and the role of self-efficacy on the control and learning of these actions...|$|R

40|$|Reasons for the {{observed}} lag-time for clinical {{efficacy of the}} tricyclic antidepressant drug, protriptyline, have been investigated. Our results demonstrate that chronic protriptyline administration results in several compensatory neural mechanisms: (1) changes in endogeneous cytoplasmic norepinephrine levels, (2) changes in norepinephrine turnover rate/recovery rate following the last dose in a chronic series of test drug administrations and (3) adaptations of the pre-synaptic receptor. The time course for these adaptive changes parallel the time required for the onset of their clinical effectiveness. We propose that acutely {{the action of the}} tricyclics on norepinephrine re-uptake is largely negated by <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in turnover rate of the neurotransmitter; but with chronic administration, adaptations in pre-synaptic alpha-receptors occur. This phenomena in turn reduces {{the extent to which the}} norepinephrine neurons can offset or compensate for the blockade of norepinephrine re-uptake. Specifically, pre-synaptic alpha-receptors become hyposensitive, and receptor tolerance develops; not to the direct action of the tricyclic drug on neurotransmitter re-uptake, but to the <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>adjustments</b> which offset the action of the acute tricyclic administration and delay their clinical efficacy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze whether quiet {{standing}} posture is related to <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment.</b> INTRODUCTION: The latest data in clinical practice suggests that static posture may play a significant role in musculoskeletal function, even in dynamic activities. However, no evidence exists regarding whether static posture during quiet standing is related to postural adjustment. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants standing on a movable surface underwent unexpected, standardized backward and forward postural perturbations while kinematic data were acquired; ankle, knee, pelvis and trunk positions were then calculated. An initial and a final video frame representing quiet standing posture and the end of the postural perturbation were selected in such a way that postural adjustments had occurred between these frames. The positions of the body segments were calculated in these initial and final frames, together with the displacement of body segments during postural adjustments between the initial and final frames. The relationship between the positions of body segments in the initial and final frames and their displacements over this time period was analyzed using multiple regressions with a significance level of p < 0. 05. RESULTS: We failed to identify a relationship between the position of the body segments in the initial and final frames and the associated displacement of the body segments. DISCUSSION: The motion pattern during <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment</b> is not related to quiet standing posture or to the final posture of <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment.</b> This fact should be considered when treating balance disturbances and musculoskeletal abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Static posture cannot predict how body segments will behave during <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} clearly {{recognized}} that a low barometric pressure, when first encountered, {{may interfere with}} the normal workings of the human machine, but that later by compensatory responses the body may become adapted to the new conditions. The outstanding variable encountered in ascents to high altitudes by airplane, dirigible, free balloon, or mountaineering is the tenuousness of the atmospheric oxygen. Most of the bodily changes observed at high altitudes can be directly or indirectly attributed to the relative shortage of oxygen. Mankind differs greatly in sensitivity, and in ability to adjust, to the variations in the oxygen content of air caused by increasing altitude. The degree of disturbance {{and the extent of}} the <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> depend upon four conditions: (1) the speed of the ascent; (2) the height attained; (3) the length of the sojourn; and (4) to some extent, upon the physical condition of the individual. A few individuals fail to make any adjustments and so find themselves unable to tolerate even moderate heights. Others begin to make adjustive responses at altitudes as low as 3000 and 4000 feet; these gradually augment as the ascent is continued and so maintain mental and physical efficiency to altitudes of 20, 000 feet and more. There are certain responses to altitude which, even though immediately brought into action, are to be regarded as only temporary compensations. These may be looked upon as emergency adjustments, since they are the effect of the direct action of oxygen want on the nervous system, and since they subside during or very soon after descent from high altitudes. When a residence is maintained at a high altitude more enduring <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> are made which adapt the body to the new environment. These permanent adjustments not only give acclimatization but are of a kind that persist for days and weeks after descent.

Increased social connectivity was not driven by general disturbance or changes in foraging behavior, but by modifications to fine-scale social network connections in response to losing their associates. Therefore, the reduction in social connectedness expected by individual loss may be mitigated by increases in social associations between remaining individuals. Given that these findings demonstrate rapid adjustment of social network associations in response to the loss of previous social ties, future research should examine the generality of the <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> of social relations in ways that maintain the structure of social organization...|$|R

Whole blood from healthy donors was stained with combination of monoclonal antibodies, i. e., HLA-DR-FITC, CD 16 + 56 -PE, CD 4 -ECD, CD 19 -ECD, CD 8 -PC 5. 5, CD 3 -PC 7, CD 45 -APC (Beckman Coulter, USA) using a “no-wash” technology. To adjust the photomultiplier (PMT) voltage, we used the tubes {{with each of the}} tested monoclonal antibodies, PMT voltage was considered optimal when the negative population was located {{in the middle of the}} first decade at the logarithmic scale. The <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> was performed in automatic mode, using Navios software (Beckman Coulter, USA). We discuss an optimal gating strategy in order to assess the populations of interest: total T cells (CD 3 + CD 19 -), T helper cells (CD 3 + CD 4 +), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD 3 + CD 8 +), B cells (CD 3 - CD 19 +), NK cells (CD 3 - CD 16 + CD 56 +), NKT cells (CD 3 + CD 16 + CD 56 +), activated T lymphocytes (CD 3 + HLA-DR +).   </p...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Unlike {{temperate}} fishes, Antarctic fishes of the notothenioid suborder, {{whose body}} temperatures (� 2 to � 1 �C) {{conform to the}} Southern Ocean, must express their genomes in an extremely cold thermal regime. To determine whether these fishes have evolved <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> that maintain efficient gene transcription at low temperatures, we have initiated studies of the cis-acting regulatory elements that control globin gene expression in the Antarctic rockcod Notothenia coriiceps and in its close relative, the temperate New Zealand black cod N. angustata (habitat temperature �� 6 to� 15 �C). The genes encoding the major � 1 and � globins of these fishes are tightly linked in head-to-head (5 � to 5 �) orientation. The intergenic regions separating the globin genes in the two fishes, � 4. 3 kb in N. coriiceps and � 3. 2 kb in N. angustata, are highly similar in sequence, the major difference being {{the absence of a}} 1. 1 -kb, repeat-containing segment in the latter. To assess the promoter and enhancer activities of the intergenic regions, each was cloned into the luciferase-reporter vector pGL 3 -Basic, and the constructs were transfected into MEL cells. Upon DMSO induction of MEL cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Spatial hearing evolved {{independently}} in {{mammals and}} birds, and {{is thought to}} adapt to altered developmental input in different ways. We found, however, that ferrets possess multiple forms of plasticity that are expressed according to which spatial cues are available, suggesting that the basis for adaptation may be similar across species. Our results also {{provide insight into the}} way sound source location is represented by populations of cortical neurons. Sound localization mechanisms are remarkably plastic early in life, as demonstrated by the effects of monaural deprivation on the development of spatial hearing 1 - 6. Different forms of adaptation, however, have been demonstrated in different species 7. Barn owls show a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> in neuronal sensitivity to the binaural cues that are altered by hearing loss 3 - 5. In contrast, ferrets become more dependent on the unchanged spectral cues provided by the intact ear for horizontal localization 6. These results imply that the basis for developmental plasticity may vary across species, which is consistent with evidence that sound localization evolved independently 8 and differs in several respects 9 between mammals and birds. However, if the auditory system can express multiple forms o...|$|R
