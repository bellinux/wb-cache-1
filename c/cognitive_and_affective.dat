25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to}} gain insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when we die we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E

What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying {{is that it is not}} through isolated reflection upon personal <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|There are now {{sufficient}} data {{to conclude that}} immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – {{the death of a}} spouse. Theorists propose that stressful events trigger <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function. Potential health consequences are broad, but include rates of infection HIV progression cancer incidence and progression, and high rates of infant mortality.|$|E

The show's goals included both <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> objectives. Initially, the cognitive skills of its young viewers were stressed over affective skills, which were addressed indirectly because the producers, writers, and researchers believed that focusing on cognitive skills would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency.

Emotional detachment, as well as dissociation or [...] "numbing out", can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> impairment.

2500|$|As is {{the case}} the more {{generalized}} forms of social anxiety, intergroup anxiety has behavioral, <b>cognitive,</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory. Additionally recent {{research has found that}} implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction. Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or [...] antagonistic, behavior such as hostility. Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.|$|E

2500|$|Stuttering {{could have}} a {{significant}} negative <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> impact on the person who stutters. [...] It has been {{described in terms of}} the analogy to an iceberg, with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt are frequent in people who stutter, and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering. With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. Many perceive stutterers as less intelligent due to their disfluency; however, [...] as a group, individuals who stutter tend to be of above average intelligence. [...] A person who stutters may project his or her attitudes onto others, believing that they think he or she is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.|$|E
2500|$|PCS, which shares {{symptoms}} with {{a variety}} of other conditions, is highly likely to be misdiagnosed in people with these conditions. [...] <b>Cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> symptoms that occur following a traumatic injury may be attributed to mTBI, but in fact be due to another factor such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which is easily misdiagnosed as PCS and vice versa. [...] Affective disorders such as depression have some symptoms that can mimic those of PCS and lead to a wrongful diagnosis of the latter; these include problems with concentration, emotional lability, anxiety, and sleep problems. Depression, which is highly common in persistent PCS, can worsen other PCS symptoms, such as headaches and problems with concentration, memory, and sleep. PCS also shares symptoms with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and exposure to certain toxins. Traumatic brain injury may cause damage to the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, and deficiencies of pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism) can cause similar symptoms to post-concussion syndrome; in these cases, symptoms can be treated by replacing any hormones that are deficient.|$|E
