AC loss under non-uniform <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> is always higher than that for a uniformly distributed transport current in a conductor. Although the effect of non-uniformity is relatively insignificant in low transport current, AC loss increases substantially in high transport current regions as non-uniformity is enlarged.

40|$|This paper reports in-situ {{measurements}} of <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> in a Li-ion battery using a newly developed pouch cell with a segmented electrode. It is shown that <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> is non-uniform {{from the beginning}} of discharge and evolves dramatically as discharge proceeds. Initially, segments closer to the negative tab generate higher local currents, which is attributed to the ohmic potential drop along the negative current collector. However, toward the end of discharge the <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> reverses in pattern due to local SOC non-uniformity developed by uneven current production in early stages. <b>Current</b> <b>distribution</b> is more uniform at lower C rates and lower temperatures. In cells operated close to the equilibrium (e. g. at low C-rates or higher temperatures), <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> tends to be wavy as it is dominated by the SOC non-uniformity effect and reflective of multiple plateaus in the open-circuit voltage vs. SOC curve. In contrast, <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> exhibits a monotonic variation in cells operated at highly non-equilibrium as the ohmic potential drop along the current collector becomes more controlling. Local SOC distribution is calculated based on measured local <b>currents.</b> The SOC <b>distribution</b> is found not uniform, even at cutoff during high C rate discharge, suggesting strongly under-utilization of active materials...|$|R

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} non-uniform <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> in a large-format Li-ion cell on its overall energy density, five cell configurations with different positive tab numbers and locations were developed. This was enabled by a specially designed segmented cell with reconfigurable positive tabs on the outside. <b>Current</b> <b>distribution</b> and overall discharge performance were measured and correlated {{with each other for}} all five cell configurations. It is shown that tab number and location have significant effects on the performance and <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> of a Li-ion battery cell. Fewer tabs typically cause lower performance but excessive tabs do not help. The 1 -tab-co-located configuration causes both very non-uniform <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> and very low overall discharge performance, and should be avoided in tab design for cells bigger than ∼ 2. 4 Ah.
