5|$|Some {{types of}} organochlorides, though not all, have {{significant}} toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is {{burned in the}} presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as DDT, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals</b> in the upper atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the upper}} atmosphere, a {{particularly}} {{important source of}} radicals is the photodissociation of normally unreactive chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by solar ultraviolet radiation, or by reactions with other stratospheric constituents (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give off the <b>chlorine</b> <b>radical,</b> Cl•, which reacts with ozone in a catalytic chain reaction ending in Ozone depletion and regeneration of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>radical,</b> allowing it to reparticipate in the reaction (see – below). Such reactions {{are believed to be}} the primary cause of depletion of the ozone layer (the net result is shown in [...] below), and this is why the use of chlorofluorocarbons as refrigerants has been restricted.|$|R

50|$|Melting of sea ice {{releases}} molecular chlorine, which {{reacts with}} UV radiation to produce <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals.</b> Because <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals</b> are highly reactive, they can expedite {{the degradation of}} methane and tropospheric ozone and the oxidation of mercury to more toxic forms. Ozone production rises during heat waves, because plants absorb less ozone. It is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants {{is responsible for the}} loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006. A similar investigation to assess the joint effects of ozone and heat during the European heat waves in 2003, concluded that these appear to be additive.|$|E

50|$|A {{good example}} of a {{substitution}} reaction is halogenation. When chlorine gas (Cl-Cl) is irradiated, some of the molecules are split into two <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals</b> (Cl.) whose free electrons are strongly nucleophilic.

50|$|Photochlorination is a {{chemical}} reaction which is initiated by light, in which either hydrogen {{is replaced by}} chlorine in a hydrocarbon compound or chlorine is reacted via an addition reaction to an aromatic or olefinic hydrocarbon. Photochlorination is carried out in addition to thermal and catalytic chlorination on an industrial scale, usually in the liquid phase, sometimes {{in the presence of}} inert solvents.

50|$|The {{selectivity}} of photochlorination (with {{regard to}} substitution of primary, secondary or tertiary hydrogens) {{can be controlled}} by {{the interaction of the}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>radical</b> with the solvent, such as benzene, tert-butylbenzene or carbon disulfide. The complex formation between benzene and the chloride radical reduces its reactivity which increases the selectivity. By varying the solvent the ratio of primary to secondary hydrogens can be tailored to ratios between 1: 3 to 1: 31. At higher temperatures, the reaction rates of primary, secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms equallize. Therefore, photochlorination is usually carried out at lower temperatures.|$|R

50|$|The use of CFC as a {{refrigerant}} {{was once}} common, including the refrigerants R-11 and R-12 (sold under {{the brand name}} Freon-12). Freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties. When they are released accidentally or deliberately, these chlorine-bearing refrigerants eventually reach the upper atmosphere. Once the refrigerant reaches the stratosphere, UV radiation from the Sun homolytically cleaves the chlorine-carbon bond, yielding a chlorine radical. These <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals</b> catalyze the breakdown of ozone into diatomic oxygen, depleting the ozone layer that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical, forming a stable molecule and quenching the chain reaction.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{chemical}} precursor to TCA is TCP (2,4,6-Trichlorophenol), an anti-microbial agent used in processing wood. Molds (and some suspect bacteria such as Streptomyces) {{are able to}} de-toxify TCP by methylating the -OH to -OCH3, which is not toxic. Chlorinated phenols can form chemically when hypochlorous acid (HOCl-, one of the active forms of chlorine) or <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals</b> {{come in contact with}} wood (untreated, such as barrels or pallets.) The use of chlorine or other halogen-based sanitizing agents is being phased out of the wine industry in favor of peroxide or peracetic acid preparations. Chlorine dioxide has not been shown to produce these spontaneous chlorophenols. Chlorine dioxide is a relatively new agent being used in the wine industry due to its obvious advantages, pure chlorine dioxide has shown no evidence of the possibility for TCA to be created. Wine Spectator has reported that such California wineries as Pillar Rock Vineyard, Beaulieu Vineyard, and E & J Gallo Winery have had trouble with Systemic TCA.|$|E

Methyl chloride is detected in the gas phase but has no influence on the conversion of ethane to ethene.

5000|$|Chlorination is {{generally}} less selective than bromination. Fluorination {{is not only}} even less selective than chlorination, but also highly exothermic and {{care must be taken}} to prevent an explosion or a runaway reaction. This relationship is often used as a demonstration of the reactivity-selectivity principle and can be explained with the aid of the Hammond postulate. A bromine radical is not very reactive and the transition state for hydrogen abstraction has much radical character and is reached late. The reactive <b>chlorine</b> <b>radical</b> develops a transition state resembling the reactant with little radical character. When the alkyl radical is fully formed in the transition state it can benefit fully from any resonance stabilization present thereby maximizing selectivity.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, chlorine- and fluorine-bearing {{refrigerants}} {{reach the}} upper atmosphere when they escape. In the stratosphere, CFCs break up due to UV radiation, releasing their <b>chlorine</b> free <b>radicals.</b> These <b>chlorine</b> free <b>radicals</b> act as catalysts in the breakdown of ozone through chain reactions. One CFC molecule can cause thousands of ozone molecules to break down. This causes severe damage to the ozone layer that shields the Earth's surface from the Sun's strong UV radiation, and {{has been shown to}} lead to increased rates of skin cancer. The chlorine will remain active as a catalyst until and unless it binds with another particle, forming a stable molecule. CFC refrigerants in common but receding usage include R-11 and R-12.|$|R
50|$|On {{a global}} scale today, rockets have a {{negligible}} impact on destruction of the ozone layer. With the increase in rocket launches predicted {{to occur in the}} future, rockets may have a larger impact on the ozone layer. It is important to consider changes in fuel sources to minimize the effects. Advancements have been made to make liquid rocket fuel non nitrogen-based to reduce the effects of nitric oxide caused ozone loss. Using chlorine-free rocket fuel is another future approach to help eliminate the effect of <b>chlorine</b> <b>radicals</b> destroying ozone. Chlorine is shown to cause the most damage to the ozone layer from rocket fuel as well as overall due to it being used in a catalytic cycle of destruction. Eliminating chlorine from rocket fuel could have a large impact on protecting the ozone layer from future rocket launches. Solid fueled rockets contribute negligibly to ozone depletion on {{a global scale}} due to the understanding of its harmful affects on the ozone layer. With the increasing abundance of space exploration, the use of these solid fueled rockets should be taken into consideration, as they will increase the impact on the global ozone layer. Solid rocket motors cause over sixty times more damage to the ozone layer compared to liquid rocket engines. It is shown to be more efficient to use liquid rocket fueled compared to the traditionally used solid rocket fuel. Rocket emissions have remained unregulated. Rocket launches will continue to increase in abundance into the future and will cause future problems {{when it comes to the}} earth’s precious ozone layer. The chlorine-free rocket fuels will help decrease the destruction of ozone molecules in the atmosphere due to rocket launches.|$|E

40|$|The {{chlorine}} radical is {{a potent}} atmospheric oxidant, capable of perturbing tropospheric oxidative cycles normally controlled by the hydroxyl radical.

40|$|The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) {{measures}} microwave emission from ozone and chlorine monoxide, a major ozone destroying radical. Right after UARS was launched, MLS {{began to}} measure large concentrations of chlorine monoxide {{over the south}} pole. These dramatic images clearly showed {{the extent of the}} south polar ozone destruction and confirmed the connection between man-made chlorine and the formation to the Antarctic ozone hole. Why is so much chlorine monoxide found over the Antarctic? UARS measurements have confirmed that CFCs enter the stratosphere in the tropics. As they rise above the ozone layer, ultraviolet molecules release chlorine, which then can react with methane to form hydrogen chloride. Chlorine can also react with ozone forming the <b>radical</b> <b>chlorine</b> monoxide. Chlorine monoxide then combines with the radical nitrogen dioxide to form stable chlorine nitrate.
