40|$|Very {{few people}} in Latin America have {{constant}} access to an adequate water supply. To address this crisis, our project - sponsored by the AVINA Foundation - was to provide <b>construction</b> <b>guides</b> for water distribution systems that the local communities can implement to ensure sufficient water supply for the town. We contacted experts and conducted extensive research into different components of water distribution systems {{in an effort to}} understand the elements of the needed <b>construction</b> <b>guides.</b> We also created a simple questionnaire to help design customized <b>construction</b> <b>guides</b> for an appropriate water distribution system for each area so that, in the future, this project can affect all regions in need, regardless of geographical diversity. The basic <b>construction</b> <b>guides</b> and questionnaire have been sent to Paula Burt, Program Coordinator at the AVINA Foundation. Improved water distribution systems would cause many social benefits such as an enhanced quality of living, fewer health issues, and the security of a critical resource. Since local residents will be construction these systems themselves, there will be a stronger sense of self-sufficiency as {{they will be able to}} perform maintenance and build more systems on their own.

40|$|Abstract. Augmented Reality (AR) {{application}} development is still lacking advanced authoring tools – even the simple presentation of information, which should not require any programming, is not systematically addressed by development tools. Moreover, {{there is also}} a severe lack of agreed techniques or best practices for the structuring of AR content. In this chapter we present APRIL, the Augmented Presentation and Interaction Language, an authoring platform for AR applications which provides concepts and techniques that are independent of specific applications or target hardware platforms, and should be suitable for raising the level of abstraction at which AR content creators can operate. Figure 1 : The interactive furniture <b>construction</b> <b>guide</b> is an example for an application which was created with APRIL by undergraduate students.

30|$|The Athena Impact Estimator is a {{spreadsheet}} tool {{that is used}} to quantify the life cycle analysis of a residential building. This is a free tool that is available to the public. The tool was built in part to comply with LEED V 4, the International Green <b>Construction</b> <b>Guide</b> (IgCC), the California Green Building Standards Code, ASTM E 2921 – 2013, and EN 15978. The tool is very easy to use for almost anyone and breaks down the process of conducting an LCA by dividing each part of the house into its own section. The data input by the user is typically the materials that are being used and then the number and size of those materials. In this way it can also help show if there are certain materials or sizes that could be altered to create a better lifecycle impact for the building. A similar approach that identifies possibly fire issues would be extremely helpful and powerful. (Bowick et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|Semantic query {{optimization}} (SQO) is {{a promising}} {{approach to the}} optimization of increasingly complex query plans in global information systems. The idea of SQO is to use semantic rules about data to reformulate a query into an equivalent but less expensive one. Since {{it is difficult to}} encode required semantic rules, a complete SQO system also includes a rule induction system and a rule maintainer. To maximize the net utility of learning, a rule induction system needs to learn those rules that are effective in reducing the query execution cost while robust against data changes to minimize the rule maintenance cost. This paper focuses on this tradeoff between effectiveness and robustness in the rule induction for SQO. The solution is to explicitly estimate the degree of the robustness of rules. The system can use the estimated robustness to make decisions to guide rule <b>construction,</b> <b>guide</b> rule repair, and control the size of a rule set.

The administrative approach takes into consideration the internal planning procedures and the Project Management Institute´s good administration practices by means of the PMBOK ® guide. The technical emphasis considers the control tools. For construction procedures, many tools were made, as: flowcharts, evaluation sheets and verification lists.

40|$|Assistance to the Government's {{programme}} for village {{storage and}} tra ining {{began with a}} pilot project funded by FAO through the Action Programme for the Pr evention of Food Losses, project PFL/URT/ 001. Further assistance was provided {{within the framework of}} this Programme through projects GCPP/URT/ 052 /NET and GCPP/URT/ 059 /AGF, with contributions from the Government of the Netherlands and the Arab Gulf Fund. Under this assistance, over 40 villages stores were constructed, or brought to an advanced state of construction, in Arusha and Dodoma Regions. A follow-up project was proposed to extend the work to other regions, and TCP bridging assistance wa s requested to finalize the draft follow-up project document, and permit activities to be co ntinued until the new project could become operationalAn important activity during this bridging phase was training: a to tal of 21 district supervisors from the Department of Community Development participated i n a pilot training course in building construction and design. The course, which included both theoretical and practical instruction, involved the participants in the design a nd construction of a modified cooperative-type village store that was to be used as the headquar ters for the new project. Three overseas fellowships were provided for graduate engineers to attend a course on rural structures - crop storage techniques and management. The projec t prepared a <b>construction</b> <b>guide</b> for village stores in Tanzania that can also be used as a t raining manual, and detailed technical specifications for the storesAlthough most of the village stores had been completed {{by the end of the}} storage programme, substantial delays were encountered at a number of sites in f inalizing full design specifications. The project provided technical and supervisory assistanc e to expedite completion, and it was recommended that steps be taken to ensure that all stores are promptly completed to full design specifications to avoid time-consuming follow-up activi tiesThe TCP assistance created the necessary conditions for the effectiv e implementation of the follow-up project which is now operational as the UNDP/FAO project URT/ 86 / 016, `Reduction of Post-Harvest Losses through Rural Storage Structures'. The experience gained from the village storage programme in Arusha and Dodoma Region s was, initially, to be applied in six regions and 18 districts of the Southern Highlan ds, and Tabora and Shinyanga Regions.
