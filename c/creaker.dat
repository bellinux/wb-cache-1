60|$|<b>Creaker</b> chuckled, {{but he did}} {{not seem}} to be at all offended. Just then he heard Mrs. <b>Creaker</b> calling him and with a hasty {{farewell}} he spread his wings and headed for the Green Forest. Once in the air he seemed just plain black. Peter watched him out of sight and then once more headed for the dear Old Briar-patch.|$|E
60|$|Butcher the Shrike was not {{the only}} {{newcomer}} in the Old Orchard. There was another stranger who, Peter Rabbit soon discovered, was looked on with some suspicion by all the other birds of the Old Orchard. The first time Peter saw him, he was walking about on the ground some distance off. He didn't hop but walked, and at that distance he looked all black. The way he carried himself and his movements as he walked made Peter think of <b>Creaker</b> the Grackle. In fact, Peter mistook him for <b>Creaker.</b> That was because he didn't really look at him. If he had he would have seen at once that the stranger was smaller than <b>Creaker.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>Creaker</b> the Grackle. He {{was one of}} {{the first}} to arrive this spring and I'm ashamed of myself for not having called on him," [...] thought Peter, as he hopped out and started across the Green Meadows towards <b>Creaker.</b> [...] "What a splendid long tail he has. I believe Jenny Wren told me that he belongs to the Blackbird family. He looks so much like Blacky the Crow that I suppose this is why they call him Crow Blackbird." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Creaker's</b> {{yellow eyes}} began to twinkle. [...] "That {{is a very}} {{personal}} question," [...] said he. [...] "I won't {{go so far as}} to say I steal eggs, but I've found that eggs are very good for my constitution and if I find a nest with nobody around I sometimes help myself to the eggs. You see the owner might not come back and then those eggs would spoil, and that would be a pity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} think so," [...] replied <b>Creaker.</b> [...] "I'm {{not at all}} vain, but there are mighty few birds I would change coats with." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Creaker</b> {{shook his}} head. [...] "Not quite," [...] said he. [...] "She likes plain black better. Some of the {{feathers}} {{on her back}} shine like mine, but {{she says that she}} has no time to show off in the sun and to take care of fine feathers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Just then <b>Creaker</b> {{turned in}} such a way that the sun fell full on his head and back. [...] "Why! Why-ee!" [...] exclaimed Peter, rubbing his eyes with astonishment. [...] "He isn't just black! He's beautiful, simply beautiful, and I've always {{supposed}} he was just plain, homely black." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Over home," [...] replied <b>Creaker,</b> {{pulling a}} white grub {{out of the}} roots of the grass. [...] "We've got a nest over there in one of those pine-trees {{on the edge of the}} Green Forest and I expect any day now we will have four hungry babies to feed. I shall have to get busy then. You know I am one of those who believe that every father should do his full share in taking care of his family." ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently the {{stranger}} flew up {{in a tree}} and Peter saw that his tail {{was little more than}} half as long as that of <b>Creaker.</b> At once it came over Peter that this was a stranger to him, and of course his curiosity was aroused. He didn't have any doubt whatever that this {{was a member of the}} Blackbird family, but which one it could be he hadn't the least idea. [...] "Jenny Wren will know," [...] thought Peter and scampered off to hunt her up.|$|E
60|$|It was true. <b>Creaker</b> the Grackle {{with the}} sun shining on him was truly beautiful. His head and neck, his throat and upper breast, were a shining blue-black, while his back was a rich, shining brassy-green. His wings and tail were much like his head and neck. As Peter watched {{it seemed as if}} the colors were {{constantly}} changing. This changing of colors is called iridescence. One other thing Peter noticed and this was that Creaker's eyes were yellow. Just at the moment Peter couldn't remember any other bird with yellow eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Robins {{have lost}} their eggs!" [...] he cried excitedly. [...] "All four have been broken and eaten. Mrs. Robin left them {{to come over here}} to help drive away Mr. Blacksnake, and while she was here some one ate those eggs. Nobody knows who it could have been, because all the birds of the Old Orchard were over here at that time. It might leave been Chatterer the Red Squirrel, or it might have been Sammy Jay, or it might have been <b>Creaker</b> the Grackle, or it might have been Blacky the Crow. Whoever it was just took that chance to sneak over there and rob that nest when {{there was no one to}} see him." ...|$|E
60|$|Jenny {{turned her}} back on Peter and went to hunting worms. There being nothing else to do, Peter hopped over where he could {{get a good look at}} the {{stranger}}. The sun was shining full on him, and he wasn't black at all. Jenny Wren was right. For the most part he was very dark green. At least, that is what Peter thought at first glance. Then, as the stranger moved, he seemed to be a rich purple in places. In short he changed color as he turned. His feathers were like those of <b>Creaker</b> the Grackle--iridescent. All over he was speckled with tiny light spots. Underneath he was dark brownish-gray. His wings and tail were of the same color, with little touches of buff. His rather large bill was yellow.|$|E
