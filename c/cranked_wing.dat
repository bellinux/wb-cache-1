25|$|The SZD-6x Nietoperz (Bat) was {{designed}} and built to research tail-less aircraft, and the control of them. Main designers were Władysław Nowakowski and Justyn Sandauer. Built in a conventional fashion using wood throughout, fabric covering and steel for highly stressed parts and fittings the SZD-6x was a cantilever monoplane with the <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> attached to a short fuselage pod at the mid position. The inner portion of each wing was markedly swept forward out to approx. quarter-span, where the swept-back outer wing panels were attached. This is arrangement allowed for maximum distance between the centre of gravity and the vertical stabilizer, and placed the pilot at the centre of gravity, so that differing pilot weights had little impact on stability.|$|E
50|$|The Ha 140 was {{developed}} as a twin-engine floatplane, with an all-metal structure and a cantilevered upward <b>cranked</b> <b>wing,</b> different to the larger Ha 139, which wing was set following an inverted gull design. The crew consisted of a pilot and radio operator, with a gunner in a revolving turret in the nose or in a second gun position to the rear.The torpedo or bomb load was accommodated in an internal bomb bay. Three prototypes were built, but the design was not carried any further, as the similar Heinkel He 115 was selected for service.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{fuselage}} was an aluminium monocoque and {{the forward}} fuselage was alclad-skinned over a tubular steel structure. The pilot's open cockpit was situated over the wing at mid-chord. The Mercury engine was enclosed in a long-chord cowling. One {{advantage of the}} <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> was that it reduced {{the length of the}} undercarriage, making retraction easier. The main wheels of the Type 133 retracted fully into bath-type fairings under the wings; this was done hydraulically, using a handpump. Two of the four machine guns were fitted in the wing just outboard of the undercarriage fairing, the other two being {{on either side of the}} nose.|$|E
50|$|Another {{solution}} is to angle or <b>crank</b> the <b>wing</b> tip sections downward with significant anhedral, increasing the area {{at the rear of}} the aircraft when viewed from the side.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the hysteresis associated with various vortex flow transition points and to determine the effect of planform geometry. The transition points observed consisted of the appearance (or disappearance) of trailing edge vortex burst and the transition to (or from) flat plate or totally separated flows. Flow visualization with smoke injected into the vortices was used to identify the transitions on a series of semi-span models tested in a low speed tunnel. The planforms tested included simple deltas (55 deg to 80 deg sweep), <b>cranked</b> <b>wings</b> with varying tip panel sweep and dihedral, and a straked wing. High speed movies at 1000 frames per second were made of the vortex flow visualization in order to better understand the dynamics of vortex flow, burst and transition...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Avions Robin started {{design of}} a new range of {{all-metal}} single-engined light aircraft, {{with a wide range}} of variants planned with between two and four seats, various engines and a choice of fixed or retractable undercarriage. [...] The first prototype, a R.3140, a four-seater powered by a Lycoming O-320 flew on 8 December 1980, with the second prototype flying on 2 June 1981. [...] The R.3140 is a single-engined, low-wing monoplane with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. Its wings have a similar planform to the earlier wooden Robins such as the DR400, with tapered outer wing sections. But unlike the <b>cranked</b> <b>wings</b> of these earlier aircraft, the wings of the R.3140 have constant dihedral. A forward sliding canopy covers a four-seat cockpit, while the aircraft is fitted with a distinctive T-tail.|$|R
5000|$|Permission {{was granted}} to the {{producers}} to use the Royal Air Force Museum's Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bomber (one of only two that survive intact). The 1943 aircraft was repainted and slightly modified to resemble a 1940 model Ju 87. The engine {{was found to be}} in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it, but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was ultimately too costly for the filmmakers. Instead, two Percival Proctor training aircraft were converted into half-scale Stukas, with a <b>cranked</b> <b>wing,</b> as [...] "Proctukas" [...] though, in the film, they were not used on-screen. Instead, to duplicate the steep dive of Ju 87 attacks, large models were flown by radio control.|$|E

40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{investigation of}} wings suitable for supersonic fighter application was undertaken {{to understand the}} flow regions developed by these wings through flow visualization and to evaluate areas in which low-speed testing could provide information for extrapolation to higher Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers. This study involved <b>cranked</b> <b>wings</b> of highly-swept inboard panels and outboard panel of various sweeps with leading- and trailing-edge devices. Both theoretical and experimental results with flow visualization are presented. Flow visualization results show that a mixed flow condition (vortex flow on the highly-swept inboard section and attached flow on the cranked outboard section) is possible for wings with low sweep (20 deg) outboard cranked sections. Lift and drag measurements on the planar (no flap deflection) wings show good agreement with theoretical results for leading-edge vortex flow. There {{is little or no}} change in planar wing performance at maneuver conditions due to outboard sweep effects. Results also show that for cambered wings (flap deflected) only small improvements in performance over flat wings were obtained at high-lift maneuver conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{program has}} been {{conducted}} in the Langley 4 - by 4 -foot supersonic pressure tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of certain wing plan-form variations on the aerodynamic characteristics of wing-body combinations at supersonic speeds. The present report deals with the results of tests of a family of <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> plan forms in combination with an ogive-cylinder body of revolution. Tests were made at Mach numbers of 1. 41 and 2. 01 at corresponding values of Reynolds number per foot of 3. 0 x 10 (exp 6) and 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6). Results of the tests indicate that the best overall characteristics were obtained with the low-aspect-ratio wings. Plan-form changes which involved decreasing the aspect ratio resulted in higher values of maximum lift-drag ratio, in addition to large increases in wing volume. Indications are that this trend would have continued to exist at aspect ratios even lower than the lowest considered in the present tests. Increases in the maximum lift-drag ratio of about 15 percent over the basic wing were achieved with practically no increase in drag. The severe longitudinal stability associated with the basic <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> was no longer present (within the limits of the present tests) on the wings of lower aspect ratio formed by sweeping forward the inboard portion of the trailing edge...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} low-speed {{investigation of}} a 70 deg/ 46 deg cranked-wing planform was undertaken to evaluate two vortex-control concepts aimed at alleviating a severe pitch up which limits the usable lift well below the C(sub L,max) of the basic wing. One concept was a strake-like extension introduced across the wing crank, whose vortex helps to stabilize the outer-wing flow and alleviate tip stall. The other was a lower-surface cavity flap employed to trap a vortex just beneath the inboard leading edge, resulting in reduced vortex lift over the inner-wing panel. Each of these concepts was shown to eliminate the high-alpha pitch up, potentially raising the maximum usable lift of the <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> practically to its C(sub L,max) value...|$|E
40|$|A {{summary of}} some results from tests of a {{wing-body}} general research missile model is presented for a Mach number range up to 4. 63. A basic ogive-cylinder {{body with a}} length-to-diameter ratio of 10 was used to which was attached a series of wing planforms. The planforms included a family of delta wings and a family of rectangular wings having a constant root chord but varying spans so that wings of constant exposed area could be compared. In addition, a cranked-tip planform was included and a rectangular planform with reduced chord. Some results are presented for wing-body-tail configurations - one utilizing a <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> planform and one with wings having a constant root chord and span, but tip chords that were 0, 20, and 40 percent of the root chord...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation of fuselage incidence effects on two fighter aircraft models, which differed in wing planform only, {{has been conducted}} in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers of 1. 6, 1. 8, and 2. 0. Results were obtained on the two models at fuselage incidence angles of 0 deg, 2 deg, and 5 deg. The fuselage geometry included two side-mounted, flow-through, half-axisymmetric inlets and twin vertical tails. The two planforms tested were <b>cranked</b> <b>wings</b> with 70 deg/ 66 deg and 70 deg/ 30 deg leading-edge sweep angles. Experimental data showed that fuselage incidence resulted in positive increments in configuration lift and pitching moment; most of the lift increment {{can be attributed to}} the fuselage-induced upwash acting on the wing and most of the pitching-moment increment is due to the fuselage. Theoretical analysis indicates that linear-theory methods can adequately predict the overall configuration forces and moments resulting from fuselage upwash, but a higher order surface-panel method (PAN AIR) more accurately predicted the distribution of forces and resulting moments between the components...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to optimize the mean camber surface of a <b>cranked</b> slender <b>wing</b> having leading-edge vortex flow at transonic-maneuver conditions using the suction analogy. This type of flow was assumed because it was anticipated that the slenderness of the wing would preclude attached flow at the required lift coefficient. A constraint was imposed in that the camber deflections were to be restricted by a realistic structural-box requirement. The resulting application yielded mean-camber shapes which produced effective suction levels equivalent to 77 percent of the full-planar leading-edge value at the design lift coefficient...|$|R

Without the research input from ACA and EAP, the Eurofighter {{would not have been}} possible. While the similarity between the EAP and the Eurofighter/Typhoon is striking there are some important differences; the <b>cranked</b> delta <b>wings</b> of the EAP have been replaced with a straight delta, the size of the fin has been much reduced and the rectangular intake of the prototype has been replaced with one with a [...] "smiling" [...] configuration.|$|R

The potential of several aerodynamic devices, viz., fences, pylon vortex generators (PVG), mid-span strakes and cavity flaps, in delaying the pitch up onset on a 70 / 50 deg <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> was explored in low speed tunnel tests. Upper surface pressure measurements and low visualizations {{were conducted on}} a semi-span wing model to observe the vortex flow development with increasing angle of attack, and then to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} devices in controlling the collapse of vortex lift over the wing panel outboard of the crank.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{selected}} linearized-aerodynamic and vortex-flow methods {{as applied to}} aircraft design problems at high subsonic speeds. In particular, the NASA Vortex Lattice and Modified Multhopp methods are the linearized techniques employed, and the suction analogy is used to provide estimates associated with vortex-flow aerodynamics. Many examples are given as to how researchers at Langley have used these methods to design the high subsonic, wing-mean-camber shapes for various configurations such as a supersonic transport, high-aspect-ratio transport, trapezoidal fighter wing, strake wing, tandem wing, joined wing, delta wing, and slender <b>cranked</b> <b>wing.</b> Many of these have been built, tested, and have had their data compared with theory. In addition, a technique for defining efficiently performing strake planforms for use in strake-wing combinations is discussed, and further improvements in wing design are outlined.

This Ritz solution procedure is implemented efficiently into a computer program {{so that it can be}} used by rigorous optimization algorithms for application in early preliminary design. A direct method to interface this structural analysis procedure with aerodynamic programs for use in aeroelastic calculations is described. This equivalent plate analysis procedure is used to calculate the static deflections and stresses and vibration frequencies and modes of an example wing configuration. The numerical results are compared with results from a finite element model of the same configuration to illustrate typical levels of accuracy and computation times resulting from use of this procedure...|$|E

Tests were conducted on a baseline configuration and on several modified configurations. The results show that the baseline configuration exhibited a high level of maximum lift but displayed undesirable longitudinal and lateral-directional stability characteristics at high angles of attack. Various wing modifications were made which improved the longitudinal and lateral-directional stability characteristics of the configuration at high angles of attack.

40|$|Results from {{an ongoing}} supersonically-biased fighter wing-design study are summarized. The {{study has been}} {{conducted}} to explore the effects of supersonic aerodynamic performance, transonic maneuvering, low-speed/high angle-of-attack characteristics, and airframe system integration requirements on fighter aircraft wing design. The approach adopted involves the theoretical and experimental investigation of four advanced aircraft configurations which differ only in wing geometry.

The supersonic data show that the advanced cranked wings outperform the trapezoidal and delta wings at cruise and moderate lift conditions. Low-speed/high angle-of-attack results show that all wings have significant stability problems above an angle of attack of 20 deg.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} from {{a continuing}} {{effort to provide}} an equivalent plate representation for aircraft structural analysis are described. Previous work provided an equivalent plate analysis formulation {{that is capable of}} modeling aircraft wing structures with a general planform such as <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> boxes. However, the modeling is restricted to representing wing boxes having symmetric cross sections. Further developments, which are described in this paper, allow modeling of wing cross section having asymmetries that can arise from airfoil camber or from thicknesses being different in the upper and lower cover skins. An implementation of thermal loadings, which are described as temperature distributions over the planform of the cover skins, has been included. Spring supports have been added to provide for a more general set of boundary conditions. Numerical results are presented to assess the effect of wing camber on the static and dynamic response of an example wing structure under pressure and thermal loading. These results are compared with results from a finite element analysis program to indicate how well a cambered wing box can be represented with an equivalent plate formulation...|$|E
40|$|Four {{advanced}} fighter configurations, which {{differed in}} wing planform and airfoil shape, were investigated in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers of 1. 60, 1. 80, 2. 00, and 2. 16. Supersonic {{data were obtained}} on the four uncambered wings, which were each attached to a single fighter fuselage. The fuselage geometry varied in cross-sectional shape and had two side-mounted, flow-through, half-axisymmetric inlets. Twin vertical tails were attached to the fuselage. The four planforms tested were a 65 deg delta wing, {{a combination of a}} 20 deg trapezoidal wing and a 45 deg horizontal tail, a 70 deg/ 30 deg <b>cranked</b> <b>wing,</b> and a 70 deg/ 66 deg crank wing, where the angle values refer to the leading-edge sweep angle of the lifting-surface planform. Planform effects on a single fuselage representative of an advanced fighter aircraft were studied.

25|$|Consequently, the Panavia {{partners}} (MBB, BAe and Aeritalia) {{launched the}} Agile Combat Aircraft (ACA) programme in April 1982. The ACA {{was very similar}} to the BAe P.110, having a <b>cranked</b> delta <b>wing,</b> canards and a twin tail. One major external difference was the replacement of the side-mounted engine intakes with a chin intake. The ACA was to be powered by {{a modified version of the}} RB199. The German and Italian governments withdrew funding, and the UK Ministry of Defence agreed to fund 50% of the cost with the remaining 50% to be provided by industry. MBB and Aeritalia signed up with the aim of producing two aircraft, one at Warton and one by MBB. In May 1983, BAe announced a contract with the MoD for the development and production of an ACA demonstrator, the Experimental Aircraft Programme.|$|R

Aerodynamic force measurements and flow visualizations on the upper surface of the wing were made. The pitching moment characteristics indicate that there are two non-linear changes and the flow patterns which caused those changes are observed. The flow patterns indicate that the non-linear changes are caused both by the flow separation {{on the outside of the}} inboard vortex and by the one on the outside of the merging position of the inboard and outboard vortices. It was found that the inboard leading edge flap decreases the angle of attack when recovery from the first change occurs. The inboard leading edge flap also causes an increase in the magnitude of the second change...|$|R

40|$|Low aspect ratio, highly-swept cranked arrow wing planforms {{are often}} {{proposed}} for high-speed civil transports. These wing planforms offer low supersonic drag without suffering greatly from low lift/drag ratios in low-speed flight. They can, however, suffer from pitch-up at modest angles of attack (as low as 5 ˚) during low-speed flight due to leading edge vortex influence, flow separation and vortex breakdown. The work presented here describes an investigation conducted to study past {{research on the}} longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of highly-swept <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> planforms, {{the development of a}} new method to estimate pitch-up of these configurations, and the applications of this new method to the analysis of tail designs for trim at high lift coefficients. The survey of past research placed emphasis on 1) understanding the problem of pitch-up, 2) ascertaining the effects of leading and trailing edge flaps, and 3) determining the benefits and shortfalls of tail, tailless, and canard configurations. The estimation method used a vortex lattice method to calculate the inviscid flow solution. Then, the results were adjusted to account for flow separation on the outboard wing section by imposing a limit on the equivalent 2 -D sectional lift coefficient.

These 1996 flight data were documented and detailed the flight-flow physics of this aircraft through surface tufts and pressures, boundary-layer rakes and skin-friction measurements. The flight project was called the <b>Cranked</b> <b>Wing</b> Aerodynamics Project (CAWAP), due to its leading-edge sweep crank (70 degrees inboard, 50 degrees outboard), and served as a basis for the International comparisons to be made, called CAWAPI. This highly focused effort was one of two vortical flow studies facilitated by the NATO Research and Technology Organization through its Applied Vehicle Panel with a title of Understanding and Modeling Vortical Flows to Improve the Technology Readiness Level for Military Aircraft. It was given a task group number of AVT- 113 and had an official start date of Spring 2003. The companion part of this task group dealt with fundamentals of vortical flow from both an experimental and numerical perspective on an analytically describable 65 degree delta-wing model for which much surface pressure data had already been measured at NASA Langley Research Center at a variety of Mach and Reynolds numbers and is called the Vortex Flow Experiment - 2 (VFE- 2).

40|$|Grid {{generation}} and Euler flow about fighter aircraft are described. A fighter aircraft geometry is specified by an area ruled fuselage with an internal duct, cranked delta wing or strake/wing combinations, canard and/or horizontal tail surfaces, and vertical tail surfaces. The initial step before grid {{generation and}} flow computation is {{the determination of}} a suitable grid topology. The external grid topology that has been applied is called a dual-block topology which is a patched C (exp 1) continuous multiple-block system where inner blocks cover the highly-swept part of a <b>cranked</b> <b>wing</b> or strake, rearward inner-part of the wing, and tail components. Outer-blocks cover {{the remainder of the}} fuselage, outer-part of the wing, canards and extend to the far field boundaries. The grid generation is based on transfinite interpolation with Lagrangian blending functions. This procedure has been applied to the Langley experimental fighter configuration and a modified F- 18 configuration. Supersonic flow between Mach 1. 3 and 2. 5 and angles of attack between 0 degrees and 10 degrees have been computed with associated Euler solvers based on the finite-volume approach. When coupling geometric details such as boundary layer diverter regions, duct regions with inlets and outlets, or slots with the general external grid, imposing C (exp 1) continuity can be extremely tedious. The approach taken here is to patch blocks together at common interfaces where there is no grid continuity, but enforce conservation in the finite-volume solution. The key to this technique is how to obtain the information required for a conservative interface. The Ramshaw technique which automates the computation of proportional areas of two overlapping grids on a planar surface and is suitable for coding was used. Researchers generated internal duct grids for the Langley experimental fighter configuration independent of the external grid topology, with a conservative interface at the inlet and outlet...|$|E

A total of five strakes with various aspects ratios and shapes were tested at negative deflection angles of 5, 10, 15, and 20 deg through an angle of attack range up to approximately 50 deg. In addition, a <b>cranked</b> delta <b>wing</b> with 70 -deg sweep was tested with two different pivotable apex flaps.

The models considered are based on Duhamel’s superposition integral using indicial (step) response functions, Volterra theory using nonlinear kernels, radial basis functions, and a surrogate-based recurrence framework, both using time-history simulations of a training maneuver(s). Results are reported for the X- 31 configuration with a sharp leading-edge <b>cranked</b> delta <b>wing</b> geometry, including canard/wing vortex interactions.
