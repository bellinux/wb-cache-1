40|$|Abstract The {{technological}} and scientific advances have brought, {{in the context}} of public health policies, a relentless pursuit of the notion of well-being and the elimination of pain, a feeling which was not always conceived as an evil to be eradicated. Foucault, through the concept of biopolitics, indicated that actions from the medical domain were incorporated by the State in order to control the bodies, with the support of medicalization. Starting from a psychoanalytic approach - in which it is assumed that pain can fulfill a role for man as a speaking animal - we conclude that in cases of chronic pain, it is critical, before <b>curing</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> understand its purpose and to seek singular solutions...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement {{of rubber}} by cords {{is crucial for}} many {{applications}} such as high-pressure hoses and conveyor belts. However, the largest application of cord-rubber composites is the tyre. The carcass of the tyre contains a network of cords that gives the tyre its strength. Not only the type of cord material that is used determines the performance, but also the way the cords are positioned in the carcass, as described in Chapter 1. Since the cords absorb most of the forces where the tyre is subjected to, a good adhesion between cord and rubber is an absolute requirement. The coating which the cords need to obtain sufficient adhesion to rubber compounds is called the Resorcinol Formaldehyde Latex (RFL) treatment. Despite the importance of good adhesion {{and the fact that}} this RFL-treatment has been widely applied since the Second World War, and no better alternative has been found till today, the mechanism by which the adhesion is obtained has remained unclear. The relatively few publications on this technique are described in Chapter 2. Most of the research described was rather empirical: the many factors involved when dipping the cords in a RFL-dip and <b>curing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> rubber were varied and their influence on the adhesion was described. However, most of the publications lack a mechanistic approach to obtain more fundamental knowledge about this technique. With new fibre materials introduced in recent years, in particular aramid fibres, there is a renewed interest in the mechanism of adhesion of RFL-treated cords to rubber in order to utilise the properties of these high-performance fibres to their full extent in rubber compounds. In this thesis, an attempt is made to elucidate the adhesion between RFL-treated cords and rubber using a more systematic approach to obtain a mechanistic view on the chemical and physical processes involved...|$|E

40|$|Forty years ago, the Supreme Court of the United States deemed {{constitutional}} new {{death penalty}} laws intended {{to minimize the}} arbitrariness which led the Court to invalidate all capital sentencing statutes four years earlier in Furman v. Georgia. Over {{the last four decades}} the Court has — time and again — attempted to regulate the “machinery of death. ” Looking back over the Court’s work, many observers, including two current Supreme Court justices, have questioned whether the modern death penalty has lived up to expectations set by the Court in the 1970 s or if, despite 40 years of labor, the American death penalty continues to be administered in an unconstitutionally arbitrary manner. This Article presents data from South Carolina’s forty-year experiment with capital punishment and concludes that the administration of the death penalty in that state is still riddled with error and infected with racial and gender bias. It is — in short — still arbitrary after all these years. The authors maintain that the only true <b>cure</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> abolish South Carolina’s death penalty, although they do argue that lesser steps including additional safeguards and procedure may limit, but will not eliminate, some of the arbitrariness and bias which are present in the current imposition of South Carolina’s most extreme punishment...|$|R

Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used.

Restaurants, grocery stores, hospitals, and other businesses will be {{participating in the}} project with your school. Your school’s current waste service provider, Waste Management, will collect sorted organic materials, (primarily food and soiled or other paper that cannot be recycled or reused), and transport the material to the Wright County Compost facility near Buffalo, Minnesota.
