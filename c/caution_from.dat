5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a <b>caution</b> <b>from</b> the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E
25|$|At the Auto Club Speedway in California, Harvick {{blew his}} engine and it {{forced him to}} not finish the race, which {{resulted}} in his first DNF in 82 starts. Harvick won the first 2009 Nationwide Series race at Bristol, his 1st win in his own car. In addition, he won the Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway. During the season, Gil Martin became the new crew chief for Harvick as Childress decided to switch all team members of the No. 07 and No. 29 except the drivers and spotters, thus giving Casey Mears Harvick's crew chief Todd Berrier. In the first five races following the switch, Harvick finished {{with an average of}} 25.4, finishing 34th, 11th, 41st, 17th, and 24th respectively. A short time later, reports surfaced stating that Harvick had asked a release of his contract {{at the end of the}} 2009 season to secure a ride at Stewart Haas Racing for the 2010 season. Harvick did not comment publicly on the subject of where he would be driving in 2010. The first race after the story broke, Kevin finished 6th at the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His best race came at the Pep Boys Auto 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Harvick had the best car in a long run and led for most of the race, but was denied victory after a late race <b>caution</b> <b>from</b> which later eventual race winner Kasey Kahne took advantage of when he went past Harvick on the restart; he finished 2nd.|$|E

The Mazatlan government marine operator warned shipping to exercise extreme <b>caution</b> <b>from</b> Jalisco to Baja California Sur. The Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center noted the possibility of heavy rains and flooding across portions of the Baja California Peninsula.

[...] His sardonic sense of humour is evident throughout, as when, during {{his description of the}} Athenian plague, he remarks that old Athenians seemed to remember a rhyme which said that with the Dorian War would come a [...] "great death". [...] Some claimed that the rhyme was actually about a [...] "famine" [...] or [...] "starvation" [...] ( [...] , [...] ), and was only remembered as [...] "pestilence" [...] ( [...] , [...] ) due to the current plague.

2500|$|The {{question}} of Tibet's social history is therefore highly politicized, and Chinese claims {{in this respect}} are intrinsic to {{the functioning of the}} PRC, and not some free act of intellectual exploration. They have accordingly to be treated with <b>caution.</b> <b>From</b> a human rights point of view, the {{question of}} whether Tibet was feudal in the past is irrelevant. A more immediate question is why the PRC does not allow open discussion of whether Tibet was feudal or oppressive. Writers and researchers in Tibet face serious repercussions if they do not concur with official positions on issues such as social conditions in Tibet prior to its [...] "liberation," [...] and in such a restrictive climate, the regime's claims on this issue have little credibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haas's rival Leopold Nowak was {{appointed}} to produce a whole new critical edition of Bruckner's works. He and others such as Benjamin Korstvedt and conductor Leon Botstein argued that Haas's explanation is at best idle speculation, at worst a shady justification of Haas's own editorial decisions. Also, it has been pointed out that Bruckner often started work on a symphony just days after finishing the one before. As Cooke writes, [...] "In spite of continued opposition and criticism, and many well-meaning exhortations to <b>caution</b> <b>from</b> his friends, he looked neither to right nor left, but simply got down {{to work on the}} next symphony." [...] The matter of Bruckner's authentic texts and the reasons for his changes to them remains politicised and uncomfortable.|$|E

Although Mr. Wetherell had at one time been actually a resident of Boston, he received quite as many <b>cautions</b> <b>from</b> his neighbors as Monsieur Dumollet.

40|$|Recent neuroimaging {{research}} has encouraged {{a fundamental shift}} in psychological thinking about cognitive development in adolescence. Challenging the existing view that early childhood was the most critical period for intellectually hard-wiring the brain, findings led researchers to speculate that early adolescence might be the more important use-it-or-lose-it period. Despite <b>cautions</b> <b>from</b> critics and some neuroscientists themselves, the new story seems to be following its predecessor in acquiring the status of hard fact. An eclectic sampling of texts examines possible implications of the penetration of this hypothesis into educational discourse.

Because of the inadequate training and equipment of the A-20 light bomber complement of the XII Air Support Command and the tactical ineffectiveness of the French P-40 squadron attached, the burden of air support fell primarily on the understrength 33rd FG.
