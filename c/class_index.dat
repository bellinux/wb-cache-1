40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the safety {{management}} level of construction site, {{a new kind of}} safety evaluation method using the combination of fuzzy mathematics and the entropy theory was put forward. According to the hierarchical analysis, the evaluation index system of the safety management was firstly established. Then, the safety inspection table for the site was designed. At last, the weights and membership of the second <b>class</b> <b>indexes</b> were calculated and the membership matrix of the first <b>class</b> <b>indexes</b> was generated by fuzzy evaluation method. At the same time, the weights of the first <b>class</b> <b>indexes</b> were calculated using the entropy theory. Aimed at the evaluation results, some corresponding measures for improving the safety management level of the construction site was put forward. The results show that the hybrid method, which can overcome the shortcomings of each single method, is feasible, practical and operational in construction site safety assessment...|$|R

40|$|The maximum {{exploitation}} of local {{renewable energy sources}} is a key feature of DG (Distributed Generation) systems: to this aim, HPSs (Hybrid Power Systems), integrating renewable and non-renewable power sources with local energy storage may represent an effective solution, although they may require an optimum utilization of the different sub-systems, for example if including FCs (Fuel Cells). This work introduces a new definition of system efficiency, which is linked to a <b>class</b> <b>index</b> defined according to the local renewable energy availability. The system efficiency is also demonstrated {{as a function of}} two performance parameters describing the effectiveness, respectively, of renewable and fossil energy conversion. The new set of parameters is used to study an experimental DG hybrid system including photovoltaic panels and FCs, representing a detached house. A test facility has been used to validate numerical models. A full year period was then simulated, to single out that the new set of parameters could help evaluate the HPS environmental performance and the effective renewable energy exploitation; the <b>class</b> <b>index</b> also helps evaluating the real system efficiency and environmental performance, which strongly depends on the local renewable energy available.

40|$|Abstract—Motivated {{by recent}} {{advances}} in joint source– channel coding over networks, hybrid (analog/digital) coding has been proposed as a coding technique for discrete memoryless relay networks, whereby each relay transmits a symbol-by-symbol function of the received sequence at the channel output and its quantized version (analog-to-analog/digital interface). For a few simple channel models, it has been demonstrated that hybrid coding unifies both amplify–forward and noisy network coding and can strictly outperform both. This paper extends these results to the class of general layered relay networks and establishes the hybrid coding lower bound on the capacity for the <b>class.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Hybrid coding, Network Information Theory, Relay Networks...|$|E
