One, the <b>communalisation</b> <b>of</b> higher education, particularly of disci-plines such as history and philosophy; and two, the danger of institutions of religious education – be they ‘mathas’, ‘madarsas’, or missions – becoming the proponents of political ideologies and thus the breeding grounds of communally-minded subjects.

The period is generally agreed to have started at the Siege of the Alcázar, a highly symbolic Nationalist victory in Toledo in the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War, although anarchist communist thought was widely prevalent in such areas as Andalusia, the Levante, most of Aragon, as well as in Anarchist Catalonia.

40|$|This article explores {{political}} conflicts {{about the}} organisation of public services in Sweden c. 1900 – 1920. The authors argue that political decisions {{play a vital}} role in shaping the political economy of public services. The case studies analysed are the political debates about the <b>communalisation</b> <b>of</b> the tramway system in Stockholm, and the nationalisation of Sweden’s last private telephone company. In both cases, the transfer of the service to public organisation was a lengthy process, ending in the late 1910 s. This is explained using the concept of publicness. Drawing on three discursive chains, the argument is that the political development was affected by the politicians conception of the political community, the form of organisation and by perceptions of values such as equal access and modernity. In the case of the tramways, public organisation was seen as the best option to defend the public against corruption and self-interest. In the case of the telephones, free market competition was seen as a guarantee for an efficient and cost- effective service. The reason for this difference, is argued, was that the debate on the tramways articulated a clearer notion of publicness, where equal access and public opinion carried larger weight. ...|$|R
50|$|The opening {{years of}} the twentieth century were stormy. The {{political}} scenario was undergoing a change, and the British were beginning to feel a bit uneasy. Discontentment was brewing. Political discontent was growing from the inability of the government to organise effective relief during the period of plague and famine. To stem the discontent, the British played the political trump card with great aplomb. For the first time, they used their divide-and-rule political game with great force. From 1870 onwards, the British started inciting the Hindus and the Muslims to form their own political parties to establish their distinct religious identities. That was perhaps the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>communalisation</b> <b>of</b> politics. The British not only encouraged the two communities to form political parties along religious line but also took various constructive steps to create a situation in which Hindus and Muslims would be forced to think in a way as if their religious identity is at peril. That culminated in the partition of Bengal in 1905. The partition was made along communal lines. This partition provided an impetus to the religious divide and the All India Muslim League and All India Hindu Mahasabha were formed. Both organisations aimed at fanning communal passions.|$|R

Der ordnungspolitische Handlungsspielraum der Kommunen wird dabei von den Gemeindeordnungen der jeweiligen Bundeslaender festgelegt, die eine Fortentwicklung der ''Deutschen Gemeindeordnung'' von 1935 darstellen. Viele Gemeinden haben nicht gezoegert, diese Handlungsmoeglichkeiten insbesondere durch die Gruendung von eigenen Versorgungsunternehmen auszunuetzen. Die Kommunalisierung der Energieversorgung steht jetzt wieder im Mittelpunkt vieler Diskussionen, wobei nicht nur eine verstaerkte Gruendungsaktivitaet als solche, sondern darueber hinaus eine Dezentralisierung der Kraftwerksstruktur gemeint ist. (orig.) Points {{relating}} to economic {{policy in the}} German energy policy are shaped not only by national and supranational legislative powers, but also {{to a large extent}} by the local authorities. The areas under local authority are set out at a country level, illustrating a further development of the ''Germany law governing local authorities'' in 1935. Many areas have not hesitated to use their powers in establishing their own supply utilities. The <b>communalisation</b> <b>of</b> the energy supply brings it once again to the forefront of discussions; it represents strengthened founding opportunities as well as the decentralisation of the power plant structure. This study aims to illustrate and provide an economic interpretation of the fourth and fifth regulations on hindrances to competition against the background of the present intervention system and current market structure of the energy sector (chapter 2 and 3). Further to that, the improvements of local authority's opportunities to construct their own electricity production capacity in the new framework are explored, and the likely economic consequences (chapter 4).

40|$|The {{land rent}} {{is one of}} many factors that {{influences}} the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Manifestations <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent through the amount of the rent-charge and the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are very important for the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The large amount of the rent-charge influences negatively the development of social renting and. social purchase <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> In regions where the amount of the rentcharge is large the conditions for the development of social renting are less favourable, because social agricultural holdings have no economic interest for renting. As in these regions, as a rule, the prices <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are also high the conditions for socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from individual owners are not favourable too. This conclusion results from the negative correlation between the social renting and the amount of rent-charge (index of correlation: 0. 21443), and the negative correlation between the social purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the amount of the rent-charge (index of correlation: 0. 19005). Though the amount of the rent-charge is not identical with the real value <b>of</b> <b>land</b> rent because the first almost entirely depends on the supply and demand 2 ̆ 7 <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> stated correlations indicate that the large amount of the rent-charge negatively influences the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by renting and purchase <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The negative influence <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent on socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> manifests itself also through the negative influence of high prices <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The correlation between socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the high prices <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is negative (coefficient of correlation- 0. 180041, index: 0. 34380). But the price <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> in conditions <b>of</b> the domination of small peasants’ holdings, is not always identical with the capitalized land rent. It mostly depends on the supply and. demand <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> and therefore it appears that the negative influence of the large amount of the rent-charge on socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> through purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is not always sufficiently expressed. In agrarian overpopulated regions the price <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> as a rule, is considerably higher than the capitalized land rent. In our conditions the demand <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the interpeasants 2 ̆ 7 buying. and selling <b>of</b> <b>land</b> has a tendency of decrease, while the supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for sale has the tendency of increase due to the employment of rural population out of their holdings. So the supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from individual holdings and the demand <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from social holdings have become the important regulator of prices, especially in grain-growing regions. On the base <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent realized by the social holdings economical criteria in socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> can be established. The amount of the rent-charge can be a source of means for paying the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and can considerably influence not only the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> but also the orientation of agricultural organizations towards purchase <b>of</b> more fertile <b>land</b> which can bring the larger land rent...|$|R
