From this perspective, Europe tries {{to be at the}} forefront of promoting values such as human rights, democracy, sustainable development, and social justice, this with a clear preference for supporting international dialogue and cooperation in these areas, rather than for using trade sanctions. This special issue combines both aspects of the EU’s international role. More specifi cally, it concerns the social dimension of the EU’s trade policies. It raises the questions of how, why, and with what impact the EU has promoted social objectives through its <b>common</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>policies.</b> These three questions will be addressed in this introduction, followed by a brief summary {{of the way in which}} the different contributions of this special issue deal with them...|$|R

40|$|Using a duopoly {{model in}} which one home firm and one foreign firm compete in a third country market, this paper {{analyses}} how environmental regulation affects the optimal <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> and the strategic use of environmental policy. In particular, this paper reviews the typical outcome that environmental regulation reduces welfare {{in the absence of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> and that, in order to maximise welfare, a stronger <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> is required when firms compete in quantities, while when competition is in prices policy should be weaker. The paper also pays attention to the outcome that the strategic use of environmental policy consists of weakening it in the former case and strengthening it in the latter one. Considering that environmental regulation is determined by the bargaining between that sector of society concerned with the environment and the polluting firm, this paper proves that under price competition environmental regulation may be welfare improving in the absence of <b>commercial</b> <b>policy.</b> In such a case, the optimal policy is not necessarily an export tax but may be an export subsidy or, under particular conditions, free trade. strategic <b>commercial</b> <b>policy,</b> quantities competition, price competition, environmental regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary: This article {{examines}} how the substantive changes {{brought by the}} Lisbon Treaty {{with regard to the}} scope and nature of Community competence and to decision-making rules in the field of the <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> fulfil the need for balancing internal and external action and stand up to the requirements of international economic regulation. It is argued that the Lisbon Treaty, building upon the premises of the current regime, constitutes a benchmark {{in the evolution of the}} <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy.</b> The expansion of the scope of the <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> to trade in services, commercial aspects of intellectual property and, most importantly, foreign direct investment indicates that a common policy in the fields of goods, services, establishment and capital with regard to third countries is necessary in order to serve the goals of internal integration and to increase the competitiveness of Europe in the world. Furthermore, by “merging” the different aspects of the <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> and simplifying the provisions concerning the exercise of EU competence, the Lisbon Treaty ensures its effective application. However, the “merger” of the different aspects of the <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> does not affect the balance of powers that exists in the internal market with regard to the same areas of law. The only derogations from parallelism between internal and external powers concern the exclusive nature of EU competence and the role of the European Parliament. However, these are both necessary for preserving the effectiveness of Union policy and introducing legitimacy in the most important field of EU external relations...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the EU’s <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> (CCP) at {{the level}} of Treaty revision and particularly focuses on the last Treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Lisbon. The analysis is based on a revised neofunctionalist framework that the author developed in previous work. It draws on the following concepts: (i) functional spillover; (ii) cultivated spillover; (iii) social spillover; and (iv) countervailing forces. Insights into the dynamics and countervailing forces driving Treaty revisions considerably deepen our understanding of the <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy,</b> as EU external trade policy-making is substantially affected by the parameters set by the Treaty. The analysis indicates that the revised neofunctionalist framework can broadly account for the changes of the <b>Common</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> during the last Treaty revision. It is further suggested that integration in the area of trade policy cannot be explained exclusively by rational choice dynamics, such as utility maximizing actors with fixed preferences, but that socialization through deliberation also needs to be taken into account...|$|E
