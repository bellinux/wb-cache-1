The regulation sets forth requirements to address actual and potential conflicts that may arise, establishes responsibilities for contractors and financial agents in preventing conflicts from occurring, and outlines Treasury's process for reviewing and addressing conflicts. Treasury has developed a multifaceted process to manage and oversee potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest, which is managed by OFS's Office of the Chief Compliance Officer. The process includes reviewing proposed contracts and financial agency agreements, approving contractor and financial agent mitigation plans, addressing <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest inquiries, reviewing <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest certifications, and preparing feedback reports for contractors and financial agents.

40|$|Background: Financial and nonfinancial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> {{interest}} {{in medicine and}} surgery are troubling {{because they have the}} capacity to skew decision making in ways that might be detrimental to patient care and well-being. The recent case of the Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip provides a vivid illustration of the harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> {{interest in}} surgery. Discussion. We identify financial and nonfinancial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest experienced by surgeons, hospitals and regulators in the ASR case. These conflicts may have impacted surgical advice, decision-making and evidence gathering with respect to the ASR prosthesis, and contributed to the significant harms experienced by patients in whom the hip was implanted. Drawing on this case we explore shortcomings in the standard responses to <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest - disclosure and recusal. We argue disclosure is necessary but by no means sufficient to address <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest. Using the concept of recusal we develop remedies including second opinions and third party consent which may be effective in mitigating conflicts, but their implementation introduces new challenges. Summary. Deployment of the ASR hip is a case of surgical innovation gone wrong. As we show, there were multiple <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest involved in the introduction of the ASR hip into practice and subsequent attempts to gloss over the mounting body of evidence about its lack of safety and effectiveness. <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest in surgery are often not well managed. We suggest strategies in this paper which can minimise the <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest associated with surgical innovation. 9 page(s...|$|R
