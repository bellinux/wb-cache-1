500|$|Weak emergentism {{is a form}} of [...] "non-reductive physicalism" [...] that {{involves}} a layered view of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science. Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, while others maintain that higher-order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction. The latter group therefore holds a less strict, or [...] "weaker", definition of emergentism, which can be rigorously stated as follows: a property P of <b>composite</b> <b>object</b> O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration.|$|E

(The physics of very small particles, such as the electron, is more accurately described by quantum mechanics.)

50|$|Composition {{is a kind}} of {{association}} where the <b>composite</b> <b>object</b> has sole responsibility for the disposition of the component parts. The relationship between the composite and the component is a strong “has a” relationship, as the <b>composite</b> <b>object</b> takes ownership of the component. This means the composite is responsible for the creation and destruction of the component parts. An object may only be part of one composite. If the <b>composite</b> <b>object</b> is destroyed, all the component parts must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object. Composition enforces encapsulation as the component parts usually are members of the <b>composite</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{engineering}} and telecommunication applications, {{it is common}} to have <b>composite</b> <b>objects.</b> Existing object-oriented methods propose many approaches for modeling these objects. However, these approaches fail to capture the linkage between the structure and the behavior of <b>composite</b> <b>objects.</b> In [Ramazani 95 a], a conceptual framework for the description of <b>composite</b> <b>objects</b> prescribes how this linkage can be established by means of a set of fundamental concepts. In order to make this framework more usable in practice, this paper shows how OMT can be adapted and extended to describe <b>composite</b> <b>objects</b> according to this framework. A great deal of these adaptations and extensions require only minor notational and semantic changes to the method. This work also shows how more requirements in connection with <b>composite</b> <b>objects</b> can be captured, made explicit, and precisely stated using an extended OMT.

40|$|A recent {{evolution}} of computer simulations {{has led to}} the emergence of complex computer simulations. In particular, the need to formalize <b>composite</b> <b>objects</b> (those objects that are composed of other objects) has led to what the author suggests to call pluriformalizations, i. e. formalizations that are based on distinct sub-models which are expressed in a variety of heterogeneous symbolic languages. With the help of four case-studies, he shows that such pluriformalizations enable to formalize distinctly but simultaneously either different aspects or different parts or different scales of the same object or system. From an epistemological standpoint, he suggests that this kind of computer-aided complex formalization of <b>composite</b> <b>objects</b> renew the traditional relations between computer simulations, theoretical models and operational models...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{extension}} of ODMG (Object Data Management Group) standard for the Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS). The extension concentrates on <b>composite</b> <b>objects,</b> which provides a new paradigm, and also improves traditional OODBMS {{to meet the needs}} arising from the aggregation hierarchy. Currently in ODMG, the semantic of the aggregation relationship is explored at the modelling stage and is described in natural language. To formally specify and verify an aggregation relationship, the standardised ODL (Object Definition Language) and OIF (Object Interchange Format) must be utilised. <b>Composite</b> <b>objects</b> classes are defined in an extended ODL, and instance values are initialized with OIF. The proposed ODMG extension in this paper provides a formal foundation for the implementation of aggregation hierarchy in OODBMS. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method for solving {{electromagnetic}} scattering from a <b>composite</b> <b>object</b> at low frequencies using the method of moments (MoM) and loop-tree basis. Many applications involve composite objects which consist of several homogeneous regions. The loop-tree basis used for analyzing scattering from a homogeneous body at low frequencies could not be directly applied to analyze the low-frequency scattering from a <b>composite</b> <b>object.</b> In general, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find a set of loop-tree basis functions that is valid for the structures {{on both sides of}} the interfaces. In this paper, we treat a <b>composite</b> <b>object</b> as a limiting case of multibody problem so that we could setup the MoM equation using the loop-tree basis found on each single body. A process is then developed to eliminate the redundant unknowns. The proposed method makes it possible to analyze low-frequency scattering from an arbitrary <b>composite</b> <b>object.</b> The validity and applications are illustrated with representative numerical examples. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
