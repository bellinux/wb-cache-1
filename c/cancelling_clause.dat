50|$|A former Bojkovice {{railway station}} manager, he {{replaced}} Miloš Jakeš as Secretary General of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia after a swift election on 24 November 1989. The only important decision he made during his {{very short term}} was to <b>cancel</b> the <b>clause</b> of the Constitution which gave the Communist Party a monopoly of power, though Communist rule had effectively ended with Jakeš' resignation {{in the wake of}} the Velvet Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004-2005, Amorn {{called for}} the a [...] "Second Reform", noting that the strong Thaksin {{government}} resulted in a “tyranny by the majority” and “the worst kind of parliamentary dictatorship that this country has ever witnessed”.http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=11&id=97135&usrsess= He {{called for the}} establishment of a [...] "third alternative party" [...] which would push through another round of constitutional reform.

50|$|In {{the private}} discipline, some {{insurance}} companies attempt {{to include a}} clause in insurance contracts, in which the beneficiary agrees that polygraph results be admissible as evidence. In such cases, where the beneficiary has willingly agreed to such a clause, signed the contract, and taken the test, the courts will honor the contract, and take the polygraph results into consideration. However, it is common practice for lawyers to advise people who signed such contracts to refuse to take the test. Depending {{on whether or not}} the beneficiary signed an agreements clause, and whether the test was already taken or not, such a refusal usually has no ill effects; at worst, the court will simply order the person to take the test as agreed. At best, the court will <b>cancel</b> the <b>clause</b> and release the person from taking the test, or rule the evidence inadmissible.|$|R

50|$|Within {{the first}} week of holding office, Roosevelt closed the nation's banks, fearing gold {{hoarding}} and international speculation posed a danger to the national monetary system, basing his actions on the Trading with the Enemy Act. Congress quickly ratified Roosevelt's action with the Emergency Banking Act. The President soon afterward issued Executive Order 6102, requiring the surrender of all gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates to the government by May 1, 1933 in exchange for their value in U.S. dollars at the rate of $20.67 per troy ounce. Congress also passed a joint resolution <b>canceling</b> all gold <b>clauses</b> in public and private contracts, stating such clauses interfered with the power of Congress to regulate U.S. currency.|$|R
5000|$|In 1332 Alfonso IV of Aragon granted {{permission}} {{for a new}} marriage to Esther, the daughter of Astruc Caravita, a wealthy merchant of Girona. The marriage was turbulent however, and by 1337 Esther was demanding divorce, {{and the return of}} her dowry to her family. David refused to consider it, until Esther had all his books and instruments removed from his study and hidden. [...] "So dear were they to my eyes, that she could hardly have forced me and obligated me with any other kind of coercion better than my interest, desire and longing for them," [...] David complained. He duly presented the required statement of renunciation before the Jewish Beth Din at Perpignan; but then sought to <b>cancel</b> various <b>clauses</b> of the court's decision, presumably those relating to the dowry. David called in legal experts from the king of Majorca to try to sway the court; in response the authorities of Esther's home town, Girona, weighed in on her side. A long and noisy debate ensued, as rabbis {{from both sides of the}} Pyrenees came forward to have their say. Several documented reviews of the case survive; but eventually the original decision was upheld.|$|R
25|$|Economic {{regulation}} again {{appeared before}} the Supreme Court in the Gold Clause Cases. In his first week after taking office, Roosevelt closed the nation's banks, acting from fears that gold hoarding and international speculation posed {{a danger to the}} national monetary system. He based his actions on the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Congress quickly ratified Roosevelt's action with the Emergency Banking Act. A month later, the President issued Executive Order 6102, confiscating all gold coins, bullion, and certificates, requiring they be surrendered to the government by May 1, 1933 in exchange for currency. Congress also passed a joint resolution <b>cancelling</b> all gold <b>clauses</b> in public and private contracts, stating such clauses interfered with its power to regulate U.S. currency.|$|R
2500|$|The {{attack on}} the Jesuits was opened on April 17, 1762, by the Jansenist sympathizer the Abbé Chauvelin, who denounced the Constitution of the Society of Jesus, which was {{publicly}} examined and discussed in a hostile press. The Parlement issued its Extraits des assertions assembled from passages from Jesuit theologians and canonists, {{in which they were}} alleged to teach every sort of immorality and error. On August 6, 1762, the final arrêt was proposed to the Parlement by the Advocate General Joly de Fleury, condemning the Society to extinction, but the king's intervention brought eight months' delay and in the meantime a compromise was suggested by the Court. If the French Jesuits would separate from the Society headed by the Jesuit General directly under the pope's authority and come under a French vicar, with French customs, as with the Gallican Church, the Crown would still protect them. The French Jesuits, rejecting Gallicanism, refused to consent. On April 1, 1763, the colleges were closed, and by a further arrêt of March 9, 1764, the Jesuits were required to renounce their vows under pain of banishment. At the end of November 1764, the king signed an edict dissolving the Society throughout his dominions, for they were still protected by some provincial parlements, as in Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Artois. In the draft of the edict, he <b>canceled</b> numerous <b>clauses</b> that implied that the Society was guilty, and writing to Choiseul he concluded: [...] "If I adopt the advice of others for the peace of my realm, you must make the changes I propose, or I will do nothing. I say no more, lest I should say too much." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first-ever processing experiment on relativization in Avar, an ergative language with prenominal relatives. The results show no processing {{difference between the}} ergative subject gap and the absolutive object gap. The absolutive subject gap, however, is processed much faster. We propose a principled explanation for this result. On the one hand, Avar has a subject preference (cf. the Accessibility Hierarchy, Keenan and Comrie, 1977), which would make the processing of the ergative and the absolutive subject gap easier than the processing of the absolutive object gap. On the other hand, the ergative DP in a relative clause serves as a strong cue that allows the parser to project {{the remainder of the}} clause, including the absolutive object DP (cf. Marantz, 1991, 2000); such morphological cueing favors the absolutive object gap. Thus, two processing preferences, the one for subject relatives and the other for morphologically cued <b>clauses,</b> <b>cancel</b> each other out in terms of processing difficulty. As a result, reading time results for the ergative subject and absolutive object relative clauses are very similar. The overall processing results are significantly different from what is found in accusative languages, where subject preference and morphological cueing reinforce each other, leading to a strong transitive subject advantage...|$|R
40|$|From the jurist {{point of}} view the pratice of sliding scale clauses {{are opposed to the}} {{traditional}} nominalism of French monetary law Custom born of the jurisprudence of the last thirty years condemns the clauses of gold payment or gold value From analogy Courts of Justice <b>cancel</b> sliding scale <b>clauses</b> when they are bound to monetary phenomenous In fact all sliding scale clauses belong to monetary law Consequently is it certain that the imperative dispositions of law must lead to condemna tion of all sliding scale clauses Protection of national money is not tinal purpose in itself There is hierarchy of imperatives Some require ments of law and order can sometime be more powerful than those derived from customary monetary Notion of justice and economic necessities have led French legislators to interfere on several occasions to attest the validity of the clauses Such are the cases of some particular matters like contract of lease wages life annuities and more recently the allowance of indexation for national enterprises and local communities loans and for building-saving Thus there is tendency to set up juridical method authenticating sliding scale clauses when the imperatives of monetary law are not in keeping with necessities of economic life and necessities of credit Hence forth French jurisprudence has to go to this iwayHamel Joseph.
