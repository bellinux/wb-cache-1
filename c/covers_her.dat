5|$|In December 2014, Image {{published}} Saga Deluxe Edition Volume 1, a hardcover volume {{collecting the}} first 18 {{issues of the}} series, which comprise its first three story arcs. Because Vaughn sees Saga as a story about Hazel, he and Staples decided to have each new hardcover volume feature an original image of that character at a different stage of her life. Because the first volume <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> birth and infancy, its cover features a closeup of Hazel nursing from her mother's breast, set {{against the backdrop of}} Landfall and Wreath, which recalls the first issue's cover. Eric Stephenson warned Vaughn and Staples that some retailers and distributors would object to this cover image, thus limiting the series' audience, but after seeing Staples' rendition of the image, Stephenson decided that sales would not be a problem.|$|E

25|$|Being so {{thoroughly}} informed by social science perspectives on identity and society, Le Guin treats {{race and gender}} quite deliberately. The majority of her main characters are people of color, a choice made to reflect the non-white majority of humans, and one to which she attributes the frequent lack of character illustrations on her book <b>covers.</b> <b>Her</b> writing often makes use of alien (i.e., human but non-Terran) cultures to examine structural characteristics of human culture and society {{and their impact on}} the individual. In The Left Hand of Darkness, for example, she implicitly explores social, cultural, and personal consequences of sexual identity through a novel involving a human's encounter with an unpredictably androgynous race.|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> torso and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> right arm and hand, while armor <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering {{the right side of}} her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of the}} removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|E
