5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> in Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case.

Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.|$|E

5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. <b>Circuit</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department.|$|E
