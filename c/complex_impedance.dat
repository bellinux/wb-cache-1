5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (<b>complex</b> <b>impedance)</b> laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a driving point impedance, that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} impedance in AC circuit is justified by {{the fact that there are}} two additional impeding mechanisms to be taken into account besides the normal resistance of DC circuits: the induction of voltages in conductors self-induced by the magnetic fields of currents (inductance), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors (capacitance). The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as reactance and forms the imaginary part of <b>complex</b> <b>impedance</b> whereas resistance forms the real part.|$|E
40|$|The Digital Vector Impedance Meter (DVIM) is an {{instrument}} {{designed to measure}} <b>complex</b> <b>impedances.</b> Since <b>complex</b> <b>impedances</b> have both a magnitude and a phase angle (the phase difference between the voltage and current phasors), they are also called vector impedances. This instrument, therefore, consists primarily of a magnitude meter (basically an A/D converter) and a phase meter. Furthermore, since <b>complex</b> <b>impedances</b> vary with frequency, this instrument must operate over {{a broad range of}} frequencies (in this case, from 1 kHz to 100 kHz). For ease of use, an internal frequency counter is also included in the instrument. This design is accurate to within 0. 7 degrees in the phase meter, and within 0. 02 volts in the magnitude meter, which means that the magnitude of the unknown impedance can be measured to within 1. 6 kΩ, and the phase shift of the unknown can be measured to within 0. 7 degrees. The frequency counter is only accurate to within +/- 400 Hz...|$|R

500|$|Once {{the basics}} of {{electrical}} network analysis began to be established, {{it was not long}} before the ideas of <b>complex</b> <b>impedance</b> and filter design theories were carried over into mechanics by analogy. Kennelly, who was also responsible for introducing <b>complex</b> <b>impedance,</b> and Webster were the first to extend the concept of impedance into mechanical systems in 1920.
