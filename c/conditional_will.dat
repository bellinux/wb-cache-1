40|$|In {{this article}} I define a strong {{conditional}} for classical sentential logic, and then extend it to three non-classical sentential logics. It {{is stronger than}} the material conditional and {{is not subject to}} the standard paradoxes of material implication, nor is it subject to some of the standard paradoxes of C. I. Lewis’s strict implication. My conditional has some counterintuitive consequences of its own, but I think its pros outweigh its cons. In any case, one can always augment one’s language with more than one conditional, {{and it may be that}} no single <b>conditional</b> <b>will</b> satisfy all of our intuitions about how a conditional should behave. Finally, I suspect the strong <b>conditional</b> <b>will</b> be of more use for logic rather than the philosophy of language, and I will make no claim that the strong conditional is a good model for any particular use of the indicative conditional in English or other natural languages. Still, it would certainly be a nice bonus if some modified version of the strong conditional could serve as one. I begin by exploring some of the disadvantages of the material conditional, the strict conditional, and some relevant conditionals. I proceed to define a strong conditional for classical sentential logic. I go on to adapt this account to Graham Priest’s Logic of Paradox, to S. C. Kleene’s logic K 3, and then to J. Łukasiewicz’s logic Ł, a standard version of fuzzy logic...|$|E
40|$|Lee Archie {{argued that}} if any truth-values are {{consistently}} assigned to a natural language conditional for which modus ponens and modus tollens are valid argument forms and affirming the consequent is invalid, this <b>conditional</b> <b>will</b> have the same truth-conditions of a material implication. This argument is simple and it requires few and relatively uncontroversial assumptions. We show {{that it is possible}} to extend Archie´s argument to three and five-valued logics and still vindicate the same conclusion. This defense is simpler because it requires fewer assumptions: even if you do not believe in bivalence and the classical negation operator you still have good reasons to accept that natural language conditionals and the material implication are logically equivalent...|$|E

In particular, it will be argued that a relevance approach to conditionals is better motivated than the suppositional theory currently enjoying wide endorsement. In {{the course of this}} discussion, an argument will be presented of why failures of the epistemic relevance of the antecedent for the consequent should be counted as genuine semantic defects (as opposed to be relegated to pragmatics).

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{entertain}} possibilities and draw inferences {{about them is}} essential to human intelligence. We examine the hypothesis that conditional if-then statements trigger a mental simulation process in which people suppose the antecedent (if statement) to be true and evaluate the consequent (then statement) in that context. On the assumption that supposing an event to be true increases belief that the event has occurred or will occur, this hypothesis {{is consistent with the}} claim that evaluating a <b>conditional</b> <b>will</b> heighten belief in its antecedent more than in its consequent. Two experiments, employing conditionals of the form If animal A has property X, then animal B will have property X, in which X was a property that people could not readily relate to the animals, supported this claim. The effect was stronger following the evaluation of conditionals with dissimilar animal categories. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of many {{alliance}}s is to deter attacks on members of the alliance by potentially antagonistic states. Yet some alliances can increase the probability of conflict that may be initiated by alliance members. Cognizant of that possibility, states that wish to sustain peace may nevertheless intentionally form alliance commitments with revisionist leaders of other states. Faced with the partially conflicting goals of deterring antagonistic states {{while at the same}} time restraining allies, leaders often include in alliance treaties conditions that oblige allies to provide military assistance only if a member of the alliance is attacked by a state outside the alliance. However, other treaties may contain unconditional obligations to come to the defense of members of the alliance. Such alliances tend to arise from situations where some members of the alliance feel that their alliance partners need to have the flexibility even to engage in provocative behavior in order to deter the target of the alliance. Our analysis of alliance formation processes in the context of priorities that compete with each other provides a basis for two hypotheses. The first is that revisionist states with unconditional commitments from members of their alliance to come to their defense are more likely to initiate militarized conflict than states without such unconditional commitments. The second hypothesis is that revisionist states in alliances whose treaties stipulate that commitments to defend are <b>conditional</b> <b>will</b> be less likely to initiate militarized conflict than such states with allies who are committed to come to thei...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} orthomodular lattice and its {{relationships}} {{that depend on}} s-map and conditional states definitions has shown in several types of probabilistic relations. An orthomodular lattice with a conditional states can be applied and defined {{as a model for}} non-compatible events. Studying of s-maps or conditional states on an orthomodular lattice helps us to describe such properties of random events, which are difficult to be described by Boolean algebra.

50|$|Branch {{prediction}} {{is not the}} same as branch target prediction. Branch prediction attempts to guess whether a <b>conditional</b> jump <b>will</b> be taken or not.

50|$|The early {{implementations}} of SPARC and MIPS (two of {{the first}} commercial RISC architectures) use single-direction static branch prediction: they always predict that a <b>conditional</b> jump <b>will</b> not be taken, so they always fetch the next sequential instruction.

Thus to determine the evolution of this conditional state under continuous-in-time monitoring requires an expensive numerical calculation. In this paper we demonstrating a numerical technique based on linear measurement theory that allows us to determine the conditional state using only pure states. That is, our technique reduces the problem size by a factor of N, the number of basis states for the system. Furthermore we show that our method can be applied to joint classical and quantum systems as arises in modeling realistic measurement. Comment: 16 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|In {{everyday}} conversation &quot;if &quot; {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently used conjunctions. This dissertation investigates what meaning an everyday conditional transmits and what inferences it licenses. It is suggested that the nature of the relation between the two propositions in a conditional might play a major role for both questions. Thus, in the experiments reported here conditional statements that describe a causal relationship (e. g., &quot;If you touch that wire, you will receive an electric shock&quot;) were compared to arbitrary conditional statements in which there is no meaningful relation between the antecedent and the consequent proposition (e. g., &quot;If Napoleon is dead, then Bristol is in England&quot;). Initially, central assumptions from several approaches to the meaning and the reasoning from causal <b>conditionals</b> <b>will</b> be integrated into a common model. In the model the availability of exceptional situations that have the power to generate exceptions to the rule described in the conditional (e. g., the electricity is turned off), reduces the subjective conditional probability of the consequent, given the antecedent (e. g., the probability of receiving an electric shock when touching the wire). This conditional probabilit...|$|R
