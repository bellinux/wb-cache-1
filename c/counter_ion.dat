40|$|A {{series of}} ionic polythiophenes, in {{homopolymer}} and random copolymer configurations, is prepared via the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization protocol and subsequent substitution on the bromohexyl side chains with N-methylimidazole. The introduced structural variations - comonomer ratio, side chain composition, <b>counter</b> <b>ions</b> - allow tuning of the thermal properties and solution {{behavior of the}} resulting conjugated polymers. As expected, the solubility depends majorly {{on the number of}} ionic groups and the <b>counter</b> <b>ions.</b> The most peculiar behavior is observed for the P 3 HT-P 3 (MIM) HT-Br 50 / 50 random copolymer, which shows organization of the polymer chains in solution and thin film dependent on the preparation conditions. Dynamic light scattering studies confirm that the ordered solid-state structure is somewhat maintained when the copolymer is dissolved in a bad solvent mixture. The ionic (co) polythiophenes are generally more resistant to thermal degradation than their precursors. The precursor polymers all show a clear semi-crystalline behavior, with a decrease in crystallinity upon decreasing the number of regular 3 -hexylthiophene units. On the other hand, the studied ionic (co) polythiophenes are fully amorphous. Changes in the <b>counter</b> <b>ions</b> have dramatic effects on the thermal properties. Bromine <b>counter</b> <b>ions</b> render the polymers strongly hygroscopic. The novel materials are of particular appeal in the field of organic photovoltaics, in which the imidazolium-substituted (co) polythiophenes can be beneficially applied as constituents of either active layers or electron transport layers. Their processability from green solvents is also of major importance for the field. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
