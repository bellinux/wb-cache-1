[...] Boston UniversityIt is {{difficult}} to understand petitions as a particular aspect <b>of</b> the <b>Trusteeship</b> System without knowledge of the historical forces which helped to shape the modern concept <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship.</b> It is easy, in fact, to think <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> as a purely contemporary phenomenon. The opening statement of the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the first session <b>of</b> the <b>Trusteeship</b> Council highlights this point: "This is an occasion of historic significance. For {{the first time in}} the world's history a permanent international body, whose membership is composed solely of official representatives of Governments, is assembled to deal exclusively with the problems of non-self-governing peoples. " The statement of the Secretary-General is, of course, correct, but it does not tell the lay reader any of the precedents behind the formation of this August body. If one accepts the principle that the protection of native rights is the cornerstone <b>of</b> modern <b>trusteeship,</b> there is evidence that ever since the 16 th century there seems to have been a logical progression toward the evolution of the philosophy eventually advanced in the Covenant of the League of Nations and presently in the Charter of the United Nations.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that the office <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> is an onerous one. The {{traditional}} image <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> would suggest a number of important duties, both positive and negative, are imposed upon trustees. A trustee is obliged to discharge these duties with utmost diligence in order to escape personal liability for breach of trust. Standing in a fiduciary relationship to his beneficiary, a trustee is expected to observe the highest standards of integrity and an objective standard of care when managing the trust. An increasingly important question in trust law is whether {{and the extent to which}} it is possible to exempt a trustee from liability from liability for breach of trust.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how ideals <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> influenced British {{administration of the}} Palestine mandate. The Covenant of the League of Nations described the mandate system as a 'sacred trust of civilisation'; because of this, the powers who held mandates were obligated to govern the territories they occupied during the First World War with the long-term aim of establishing them as independent {{members of the international}} community. British fulfilment of that trust drew on wider influences that had informed its rule elsewhere in the colonial empire; notions of liberalism, utilitarianism, and rationalism, core elements in a British philosophy of colonial rule, profoundly shaped British governance in Palestine. In utilising a model <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> to explore the Palestine mandate, this study also explores how colonial policy-making was shaped by Orientalist representations. Cultural preconceptions enabled the basic premise <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> by providing a binary image of 'backward', inferior subject populations in need of assistance and of progressive, superior Western powers capable of delivering the required 'tutelage'. The influence <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> and Orientalism in Palestine is examined in five key administrative areas: self-government, immigration, land, education, and law and order. Under <b>trusteeship,</b> various forms <b>of</b> local and communal self-government were advanced to provide administrative experience and create a foundation for eventual participation in national self-government; reform ofland tenure and the facilitation of Jewish immigration were intended to promote economic growth and increase prosperity amongst all sections of the population; the government school system was expanded to encourage basic levels of mass literacy and develop vocational knowledge of modern agricultural techniques; and the mandatory administration sought to create local, self-sufficient civilian forces to uphold public security. Such policies allowed British officials to justify their presence in Palestine through discourses of 'progress' and 'improvement', which were required irrespective of any British commitments made to support Zionism...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. South Africa {{is faced}} with {{extraordinary}} challenges {{when it comes to}} managing its water resources. To redress the results of discrimination caused by Apartheid and its political antecedents, the modern constitutional state sought to address the issues of access to water resources and sanitation services by introducing section 24 of the Constitution, which provides for the right to an environment that is not harmful to one's health or well-being. In addition, section 27 seeks to entrench the right of access to sufficient water. Consequently, the National Water Act 36 of 1998 was introduced, which caters for the administration of water resources. The Water Services Act 108 of 1997, which seeks to ensure the provision of water and sanitation services completes the statutory framework. This framework provides for the state to be either the trustee or the custodian of our water resources. However, the terms 'trustee' and 'custodian' are not defined by either statutes. The legal framework nevertheless sets the parameters for state trusteeship and/or custodianship. This may be gleaned from the constitutional provisions, the National Water Act and the Water Services Act, as well as their accompanying regulations and policies. Despite oversights and inconsistencies, it is argued, the legislative framework very clearly provides the statutory content <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> and custodianship. The state is expected to manage water in accordance with the prescribed constitutional mandate. The nature of the terminology used in the legislation has prompted a comparison by academic authors <b>of</b> modern <b>trusteeship</b> with the Roman and Roman-Dutch law classifications of res publicae. Alternatively, the public trust doctrine {{has been used as a}} comparator for evaluating the functioning <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship.</b> However, there are numerous problems with both of these comparisons. Neither facilitates a clear, meaningful understanding <b>of</b> <b>trusteeship</b> or custodianship. The thesis set out here is that, as trusteeship and custodianship are both statutory creatures, the nature of their content must be sought in the legal framework itself. In particular, the National Water Resource Strategy provides insight into the duties of the state. The Strategy aims to give effect to this legal framework, and provides that there are three values that water management aims to achieve: sustainability, equity and efficiency...|$|R
