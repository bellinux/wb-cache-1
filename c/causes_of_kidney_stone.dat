40|$|Background: Calcium oxalate is one {{the most}} {{significant}} causes of human kidney stones. Increasing oxalate uptake results in increased urinary oxalate. Elevated urinary oxalate is one the most important <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> formation. This study aims to evaluate oxalate-degrading capacity of lactic acid bacteria {{and its impact on}} incidence of kidney stone. Materials and Methods: This case-control study was conducted on serum, urinary, and fecal samples. The research population included a total of 200 subjects divided in two equal groups. They were selected from the patients with urinary tract stones, visiting urologist, and also normal people. The level of calcium, oxalate, and citrate in the urinary samples, parathyroid and calcium in the serum samples, and degrading activity of fecal lactobacillus strains of all the subjects were evaluated. Then, data analysis was carried out using SPSS- 11. 5, χ 2 test, Fisher’s exact test, and analysis of variance. Results: The results revealed that the patients had higher urinary level of oxalate and calcium, as well as higher serum level of parathyroid hormone than normal people. In contrast, urinary level of citrate was higher in normal people. In addition, {{there was a significant difference}} between the oxalate-degrading capacities of lactobacillus isolated from the patients and their normal peers. Conclusion: Reduction of digestive lactobacillus-related oxalate-degrading capacity and increased serum level of parathyroid hormone can cause elevated urinary level of oxalate and calcium in people with kidney stone...|$|E

40|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> and {{is responsible for the}} damage to kidneys and other organs observed in inherited disorders of oxalate metabolism. Most oxalate produced in the body is derived from its metabolic precursor, glyoxylate. Thus, any means of scavenging glyoxylate to a non-toxic product, thereby diverting it away from oxalate synthesis, has considerable therapeutic implications. Here we show that aminoguanidine, a compound with a proven safety record and used for many years to prevent long-term complications of diabetes, binds glyoxylate covalently and reduces its conversion to oxalate by human liver- and lymphocyte-derived cell lines by > 90 %. We propose that scavenging glyoxylate with aminoguanidine or its congeners may provide a means of reducing oxalate production in vivo, and advocate the tissue culture system described here as a convenient means for testing such agents in vitro.

METHODS: Organic syntheticprocedures were used to prepare radiation-protective compounds having a variety of sulfur-containingfunctionalgroups, and to prepare amphetamine derivativeshaving electron-attracting sulfur functions. In the case <b>of</b> the <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> causation research, isolationof urinary mucopolysaccharides (MPS) from recurrentlystoneformingpatients was carried out and the extent of sulfation of the MPS was determinedby electrophoresis. RESULTS: Whole-lxxlyradiation-protective agents {{with a high degree of}} protectionagainst lethaldoses of gamma-radiationin mice were found in a series of quinoliniumand pyrldinium bis(methylthio) and methylthioamino derivatives. Mechanism studies showed that the copper complexesof these agents mimicked the beneficialaction of superoxidedismutase. Electron-attracting sulfur-containing functionson amphetaminenitrogen,as well as 4 '-amino nitrogen providedamphetaminederivativeswith good appetite-suppressant effectsand few or no adverse behavioraleffects. Higher than normal levelsof sulfationof the urinary MPS of stone formers suggesteda cause for recurrentkidney stone formation.

40|$|Abstract Cystinuria (OMIM 220100) is an inborn {{congenital}} disorder characterised by {{a defective}} cystine metabolism {{resulting in the}} formation of cystine stones. Among the heterogeneous group <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> diseases, cystinuria is the only disorder which is exclusively caused by gene mutations. So far, two genes responsible for cystinuria have been identified: SLC 3 A 1 (chromosome 2 p 21) encodes the heavy subunit rBAT of a renal b 0,+ transporter while SLC 7 A 9 (chromosome 19 q 12) encodes its interacting light subunit b 0,+ AT. Mutations in SLC 3 A 1 are generally associated with an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance whereas SLC 7 A 9 variants result in a broad clinical variability even within the same family. The detection rate for mutations in these genes is larger than 85 %, but it is influenced by the ethnic origin of a patient and the pathophysiological significance of the mutations. In addition to isolated cystinuria, patients suffering from the hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome have been reported carrying deletions including at least the SLC 3 A 1 and the PREPL genes in 2 p 21. By extensive molecular screening studies in large cohort of patients a broad spectrum of mutations could be identified, several of these variants were functionally analysed and thereby allowed insights in the pathology of the disease {{as well as in the}} renal trafficking of cystine and the dibasic amino acids. In our review we will summarize the current knowledge on the physiological and the genetic basis of cystinuria as an inborn <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> and the application of this knowledge in genetic testing strategies. </p...|$|R

This species is isolated from individuals in long-term care facilities and hospitals and from patients who are immunocompromised or suffering from underlying disease. P. penneri was isolated significantly more often from stools of patients with diarrheal disease than from healthy patients, so P. penneri {{may play a role}} in some diarrheal disease. The invasive potential of this microorganism has also been demonstrated in a case of P. penneri bacteremia and concomitant subcutaneous thigh abscess in a neutropenic patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia [...] and in nosocomial urosepsis in a diabetic patient from whom the organism was also subsequently isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and a pulmonary catheter tip. Furthermore, in an experiment conducted in India, P. penneri strains were isolated as the sole pathogen in all patients having underlying disease postoperatively. Most isolates of P. penneri from the experiment were found to be multiple drug-resistant including resistance to amoxy-clavulanic acid combination. In another study, P. penneri was found to be more resistant to the penicillins and cephalosporins than P. mirabilis and mostly in patients with urogenital infections. Moreover, the urease enzyme of P. penneri is thought to be a significant <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> formation. Consistent with this belief, the organism has been isolated from the center of a stone removed from a patient with persistent P. penneri bacteriuria.

40|$|Dinuclear metal {{complexes}} {{provide a}} route to interesting structure and reactivity. Two common uses of dinuclear metal complexes are sensing and activation of small molecules. Herein we describe {{a series of}} dinuclear metal complexes capable of sensing of oxalate and activation of carbon disulfide. Sensing of oxalate is of great interest because high oxalate concentration (hypooxaluria) is a major <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones.</b> Dinuclear metal complexes can act as sensors for oxalate because the oxalate can bridge between the metal centers. Herein we describe a colorimetric oxalate sensor capable of regeneration. Upon addition of oxalate to a pink solution of a L 1 Ni 2 Br 4 complex (L 1 = (1 E, 1 ′E) -N,N′-(1, 4 - phenylenebis(methylene)) bis(1 -(6 -(2, 4, 6 -triisopropylphenyl) pyridin- 2 -yl) methanimine) to a green solution of L 1 Ni 2 (C 2 O 4) Br 2. Due to this color change UV-vis titration {{was used to determine}} the binding constant of oxalate to be 5. 2 (5) x 102 M- 1. Addition of CaBr 2 to the green solution leads to the regeneration of the sensor by precipitation of Ca(C 2 O 4). Therefore we report the first example of an oxalate sensor capable of colorimetric detection of oxalate coupled with regeneration. The synthesis of di-zinc macrocycles featuring bis(imino) pyridine chelating units linked by p-xylylene or m- xylylene linkers. Characterization of the compounds by NMR and X-ray structure determination revealed that the complexes were highly symmetrical (C 2 v or D 2 h). Cyclic voltammertry revealed that the combination of a redox-noninnocent ligand with a redox inactive metal stilled allowed the ligand to accept electron density. Oxalate extraction was unsuccessful with acetic acid, EDTA, and TMSCl. Attempts at extraction with CaBr 2 lead to transformation of μ 2 -κ 2,κ 2 -bound oxalate into the μ 2 -κ 1,κ 2 - bound form. The addition of aqueous HCl to a macrocyclic complex showed oxalate free macrocycles by ESI-MS but any product was only transient and unable to isolated. Activation of CS 2 is of great interest because it is isoelectronic to CO 2 and thus should similar reactivity. Herein we report the synthesis of a series of di-Ni complex capable of binding and activating CS 2. DFT and X-ray revealed that the bound CS 2 was two electron reduced, thus in order to induce reductive coupling of the two CS 2 fragments oxidation was attempted with FeCp 2 (PF 6). This however lead to liberation of the dinucleating ligand. Di-Cu(I) complexes were also synthesized however they showed no reactivity with CS 2. More soluble mononuclear Ni(0) analogues were also synthesized that were also able to bind and activate CS 2 however, reduction or oxidation by one electron yielded liberation of the free ligand as in the dinuclear complexes...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between gout and nephrolithiasis in men: The Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study. Approximately 10 million {{adults in the}} United States have experienced the passage <b>of</b> a <b>kidney</b> <b>stone,</b> and up to 5 million {{have been diagnosed with}} gout by a physician. Previous reports have suggested that gout increases the risk for the development <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> but there are no prospective data. We used data from a cohort of 51, 529 male health care professionals to examine the independent {{association between}} gout and <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease. In a cross-sectional analysis <b>of</b> gout and <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease reported on the 1986 baseline questionnaire, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease was almost twofold higher in men with history of gout compared to those without (15 % vs. 8 %). After adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), a history of gout remained significantly associated with <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease (OR 1. 88; 95 % CI 1. 68 to 2. 11). We then prospectively examined the risk <b>of</b> incident <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in men with and without a confirmed diagnosis of gout after excluding men who reported a history <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease or gout on the baseline questionnaire. A confirmed diagnosis of gout increased the multivariate relative risk <b>of</b> incident <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> (RR 2. 12; 95 % CI 1. 22 to 3. 68). In contrast, a history <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease was not associated with increased risk of gout (RR 1. 05; 95 % CI 0. 54 to 2. 07). In conclusion, a history of gout independently increases the risk for incident <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in men. Physicians should provide dietary counseling, such as increasing fluid intake and decreasing salt consumption, to subjects with gout in addition to other risk factors, such as family history <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> in order to decrease the likelihood of stone formation...|$|R

The epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> {{is not completely}} understood and may vary substantially based on geographic, socioeconomic and clinical factors; the present study aims at defining the prevalence and diagnostic patterns <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in a cohort representative {{of the general population}} in Florence, Italy. A sample of 1, 543 adult subjects, all Caucasians, was randomly selected from a population of over 25, 000 subjects followed by 22 general practitioners (GPs). Subjects were administered a questionnaire requesting the patient's age and sex, any history <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> and/or colics and the prescription <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> ultrasound (US) examination. GPs data-bases were also interrogated. Crude and adjusted prevalence proportions and ratios (PRs) with corresponding 95  % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Furthermore, the association between the practice pattern of each physician with respect to US prescription and the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> was investigated. The overall prevalence <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> was 7. 5  % (95  % confidence interval 6. 2, 8. 9  %), increasing with age until 55 - 60  years and then decreasing.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the role of genetic factors in <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease by examining the heritability of the trait in Icelandic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records at all major hospitals and imaging centres in Iceland were searched for diagnostic codes indicative <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> yielding a cohort of 5954 incident patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease. The list of patients was cross-matched with a genealogy database that covers the entire Icelandic nation. The risk ratio (RR) and kinship coefficient (KC) were calculated to determine the risk <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in relatives <b>of</b> stone formers and the relatedness among <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> patients. RESULTS: The risk <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> among family members of stone formers was significantly higher than in the general population. In 2959 patients with radiopaque stones, the RR ranged from 2. 25 (p< 0. 001) for first degree relatives of probands (such as parents or siblings) to 1. 07 (p< 0. 01) in fifth degree relatives. Moreover, for confirmed recurrent stone formers the RR <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in parents and offspring was in excess of 10 (p< 0. 001). The KC analysis shows that Icelandic patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease are significantly more related to each other than is the average Icelander, even when considering only relatives separated by four meioses or more (p< 0. 05).
