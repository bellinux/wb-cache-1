50|$|The {{principle}} of magnetic actuation {{is based on}} the Lorentz Force Equation. When a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> is placed in a static magnetic field, the field produced around the conductor interacts with the static field to produce a force.

50|$|An {{electric}} motor uses electrical energy to provide mechanical work, usually through {{the interaction of}} a magnetic field and <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors.</b> By the interaction of mechanical work on an electrical conductor in a magnetic field, electrical energy can be generated.|$|R
50|$|The charge {{carriers}} of a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> {{placed in a}} transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; {{this results in a}} charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the Hall effect.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} one of two ways of {{inducing}} an electromotive force, the other being the relative motion of a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> within a magnetic field. This method relies on a conductor and magnetic field moving relative to one another, leading to a rate of change of flux, dΦ/dt. This can be explained further by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and refined by Lenz's Law.|$|E

[...] The most important example of a functional earth is the neutral in an electrical supply system when it is a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> connected to the earth electrode at the source of electrical power. Other examples of devices that use functional earth connections include surge suppressors and electromagnetic interference filters.|$|E
50|$|In {{different}} materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not {{constant in}} temperature, {{and so a}} spatial gradient in temperature {{can result in a}} gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This Thomson effect was predicted and subsequently observed by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) in 1851.It describes the heating or cooling of a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> with a temperature gradient.|$|E
50|$|Any <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor,</b> {{including}} a cable, radiates an electromagnetic field. Likewise, any conductor or cable {{will pick up}} energy from any existing electromagnetic field around it. These effects are often undesirable, {{in the first case}} amounting to unwanted transmission of energy which may adversely affect nearby equipment or other parts of the same piece of equipment; and in the second case, unwanted pickup of noise which may mask the desired signal being carried by the cable, or, if the cable is carrying power supply or control voltages, pollute them to such an extent as to cause equipment malfunction.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to measure the power in a three-phase system using two transducers {{when there is no}} neutral, or three transducers when there is neutral. Blondel's theorem states that the number of measurement elements required is one less than the number of <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In typical {{magnetic}} sail designs, {{the magnetic}} field is generated by a loop of superconducting wire. Because loops of <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors</b> tend to be forced outwards towards a circular shape by their own magnetic field, the sail could be deployed simply by unspooling the conductor and applying a current through it.|$|R
50|$|This type of sensor {{relies on}} the {{mechanical}} motion of the MEMS structure due to the Lorentz force acting on the <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> in the magnetic field. The mechanical motion of the micro-structure is sensed either electronically or optically. The mechanical structure is often driven to its resonance {{in order to obtain}} the maximum output signal. Piezoresistive and electrostatic transduction methods can be used in the electronic detection. Displacement measurement with laser source or LED source can also be used in the optical detection. Several sensors will be discussed in the following subsections in terms of different output for the sensor.|$|E
50|$|The Z-pinch is an {{application}} of the Lorentz force, in which a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> in a magnetic field experiences a force. One example of the Lorentz force is that, if two parallel wires are carrying current in the same direction, the wires will be pulled toward each other. In a Z-pinch machine the wires are replaced by a plasma, which {{can be thought of}} as many current-carrying wires. When a current is run through the plasma, the particles in plasma are pulled toward each other by the Lorentz force, thus the plasma contracts. The contraction is counteracted by the increasing gas pressure of the plasma.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A brushed DC {{electric}} motor generating torque from DC power supply {{by using an}} internal mechanical commutation. Stationary permanent magnets form the stator field. Torque is produced by the principle that any <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> placed within an external magnetic field experiences a force, known as Lorentz force. In a motor, {{the magnitude of this}} Lorentz force (a vector represented by the green arrow), and thus the output torque,is a function for rotor angle, leading to a phenomenon known as torque ripple)Since this is a single phase two-pole motor, the commutator consists of a split ring, so that the current reverses each half turn ( [...] 180 degrees).|$|E
50|$|Also {{available}} in smaller conductor sizes are versions containing three <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors</b> and a circuit protective (earth) conductor.

5000|$|Being {{magnetic}} devices, audio transformers {{are susceptible}} to external magnetic fields such as those generated by AC <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors.</b> [...] "Hum" [...] is a term commonly used to describe unwanted signals originating from the [...] "mains" [...] power supply (typically 50 or 60 Hz). Audio transformers used for low-level signals, such as those from microphones, often include magnetic shielding to protect against extraneous magnetically coupled signals.|$|R
50|$|In a {{symmetric}} {{three-phase power}} supply system, three conductors each carry an alternating current {{of the same}} frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third the period. The common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor</b> called the neutral. Due to the phase difference, the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle {{after one of the}} other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor. This phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load. It also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers (for instance, a two phase system using a Scott-T transformer).|$|E

5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a bootleg {{ground is}} an electrical ground that is wired from the neutral {{side of a}} receptacle or light fixture in an older 2-wire home. This essentially connects the neutral side of the receptacle to the casing of an appliance or lamp. It can be a hazard because the neutral wire is a <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductor,</b> which means the casing can become energized. In addition, a fault condition to a bootleg ground will not trip a GFCI breaker or a receptacle that is wired from the load side of a GFCI receptacle. Bootleg grounding is illegal and against code in many places. A safer alternative Sec. 406.4(D)(2)(b) if a grounding connection is not practicable (where a local electrical code allows it) is to install a GFCI and leave the grounding terminal screw unconnected, then place a label that says [...] "No Equipment Ground" [...] on the GFCI and a marking that states “GFCI Protected” and “No Equipment Ground” on all downstream receptacles.|$|E
50|$|Electric motors convert {{electrical}} energy into mechanical motion, usually through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields and <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors.</b> Electric motors are found in numerous diverse applications, such as fans, blowers, pumps, machines, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives.

50|$|Two-phase {{circuits}} typically use {{two separate}} pairs of <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors.</b> Alternatively, three wires may be used, but the common conductor carries the vector {{sum of the}} phase currents, which requires a larger conductor. Three-phase can share conductors so that the three phases can be carried on three conductors of the same size. In electrical power distribution, a requirement of only three conductors, rather than four, represented a considerable distribution-wire cost savings due to the expense of conductors and installation.|$|R

[...] Blondel's theorem states that for any system with N <b>current-carrying</b> <b>conductors,</b> that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy.

When a product is operated under normal conditions, environmental factors such as humidity, dirt, vibration, shock and contaminants can close these small gaps and allow current to flow. This condition can create a shock hazard if the defects are not corrected at the factory. No other test can uncover this type of defect {{as well as the}} Dielectric Withstand test.|$|R
