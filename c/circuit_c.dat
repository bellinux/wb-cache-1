40|$|In this work, {{we study}} indistinguishability {{obfuscation}} and functional encryption for general circuits: Indistinguishability obfuscation requires that given any two equivalent <b>circuits</b> <b>C</b> 0 and C 1 of similar size, the obfuscations of C 0 and C 1 should be computationally indistinguishable. In functional encryption, ciphertexts encrypt inputs x and keys are issued for <b>circuits</b> <b>C.</b> Using the key SKC to decrypt a ciphertext CTx = Enc(x), yields the value C(x) {{but does not}} reveal anything else about x. Furthermore, no collusion of secret key holders {{should be able to}} learn anything more than the union of what they can each learn individually. We give constructions for indistinguishability obfuscation and functional encryption that supports all polynomial-size circuits. We accomplish this goal in three steps: • We describe a candidate construction for indistinguishability obfuscation for NC 1 circuits. The security of this construction is based on a new algebraic hardness assumption. The candidate and assumption use a simplified variant of multilinear maps, which we call Multilinear Jigsaw Puzzles. • We show how to use indistinguishability obfuscation for NC 1 together with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (with decryption in NC 1) to achieve indistinguishability obfuscation for all circuits...|$|R
