25|$|The <b>choux</b> pastry paste is piped {{through a}} pastry bag or dropped {{with a pair}} of spoons into small balls and baked to form largely hollow puffs. After cooling, the baked profiteroles are {{injected}} with filling using a pastry bag and narrow piping tip, or by slicing off the top, filling them, and reassembling. For sweet profiteroles, additional glazes or decorations may then be added.|$|E
25|$|First, {{the chef}} must prepare <b>choux</b> pastry dough, a light pastry dough {{used to make}} profiteroles, croquembouches, éclairs, French crullers, beignets, St. Honoré cake, quenelles, Parisian gnocchi, dumplings, gougères, chouquettes and craquelins. It {{contains}} only butter, water, flour and eggs. Instead of a raising agent, it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The pastry is used in many European and European-derived cuisines.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltarian cuisine is {{the result}} of a long {{relationship}} between the Andalusian Spaniards and the British, as well as the many foreigners who made Gibraltar their home over the past three centuries. The culinary influences include those from Malta, Genoa, Portugal, Andalusia and Britain. This marriage of tastes has given Gibraltar an eclectic mix of Mediterranean and British cuisine. Profiteroles, a French <b>choux</b> pastry ball with a sweet filling of whipped cream, is considered to be Gibraltar's national dish. These are often served after a meal including Calentita, a baked bread-like dish made with chickpea flour, water, olive oil, salt and pepper.|$|E

Although there were no categorised climbs during the stage, the final kilometre of the stage– {{at the end of}} a [...] long stretch of road– was uphill, reaching a gradient of 4% in certain places. However, the stage was still designed to suit the sprinters, with the uphill finish also aiding the chances for the puncheurs.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{headwinds}} were prominent {{during the}} stage, although {{this did not}} stop three riders attacking in the opening kilometre; Kris Boeckmans of [...] was joined by 's Mads Christensen and 's Gatis Smukulis, and the trio remained together until Les <b>Choux,</b> when Boeckmans elected {{to return to the}} main field after winning the intermediate sprint. Smukulis and Christensen soldiered on with a lead of around four minutes, but the peloton were back together by the [...] mark, as [...] established the pace of the group, to keep the overall leader Nacer Bouhanni out of danger.

[...] continued to set the pace on the front, bringing the lead gap to around a minute with [...] remaining.|$|E

2500|$|Partly because English {{has never}} had any {{official}} regulating authority for spelling, such as the Spanish Real Academia Española, the French Académie française, and the German Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung, English spelling, compared to many other languages, is quite irregular and complex. Although French, among other languages, presents a similar degree of difficulty when encoding (writing), English is more difficult when decoding (reading), as there are clearly many more possible pronunciations {{of a group of}} letters. For example, in French, the [...] sound (as in [...] "food", but short), can be spelled ou, ous, out, or oux (ou, nous, tout, <b>choux),</b> but the pronunciation of each of those sequences is always the same. In English, the [...] sound can be spelled in up to 18 different ways (see the Sound-to-spelling correspondences section below), including oo, u, ui, ue, o, oe, ou, ough, and ew (food, truth, fruit, blues, to, shoe, group, through, grew), but all of these have other pronunciations as well (e.g. as in flood, trust, build, bluest, go, hoe, grout, rough, sew). The Spelling-to-sound correspondences section below presents a summary of pronunciation variations. Thus, in unfamiliar words and proper nouns the pronunciation of some sequences, ough being the prime example, is unpredictable to even educated native English speakers.|$|E
2500|$|Lawson met {{her future}} husband Francis William Lionel Collings Beaumont while filming the 1936 film Toilers of the Sea, a film {{adaption}} of Victor Hugo's 1866 novel Les Travailleurs de la mer. Hugo's book {{is set in the}} British Crown Dependency Guernsey in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy, which includes the island of Sark, a feudal territory ruled by the Seigneur of Sark. Beaumont's mother, Dame Sibyl Mary Collings Beaumont Hathaway, who was the ruling 21st Seigneur of Sark, wrote in her autobiography that the scenes from the film were shot on Sark and that her son provided backing for the film, along with French director/producer Jean Choux; in the film credits the production company L. C. Beaumont is mentioned, but not <b>Choux.</b> At this time Beaumont was married and had a son, the future 22nd Seigneur of Sark. It is uncertain when the affair between Lawson and Beaumont began, but Beaumont's wife purchased an announcement in the edition of 30 November 1937 of The Times asking for a [...] "dissolution" [...] of their marriage [...] "on the ground of his adultery with Miss Mary Lawson." [...] That year the Beaumonts were divorced, and on 22 June 1938 Beumont and Lawson were married in Chelsea. In her memoirs, Hathaway makes no mention of her son's second wife, rather she praises his first wife as a [...] "charming girl" [...] and states that [...] "on account of behaviour of my sons … there have been many heartbreaking blows." [...] Upon marriage Lawson legally changed her name to Mary Elizabeth Beaumont, but she continued to use Mary Lawson as her stage name.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Choux</b> pastry : <b>Choux</b> pastry is a {{very light}} pastry that is often filled with cream. Unlike other types of pastry, <b>choux</b> is in fact closer to a dough before being cooked which gives it {{the ability to be}} piped into various shapes such as the éclair and profiterole. Its name {{originates}} from the French <b>choux,</b> meaning cabbage, owing to its rough cabbage-like shape after cooking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Choux</b> pastry {{is usually}} baked but for beignets it is fried. In Spain and Latin America, churros {{are made of}} fried <b>choux</b> pastry, sugared and dipped in a thick hot {{chocolate}} for breakfast. In Austrian cuisine, one variation of Marillenknödel, a sweet apricot dumpling cooked in simmering water, uses <b>choux</b> pastry; in that case it does not puff, but remains relatively dense. <b>Choux</b> pastries are sometimes filled with cream after baking to make cream puffs or éclairs.|$|E

Over time, the recipe of the dough evolved, and the name changed to pâte à popelin, which was used to make popelins, small cakes made {{in the shape of a}} woman's breasts. Then, Avice, a pâtissier in the eighteenth century, created what were then called <b>choux</b> buns.
