25|$|Best {{management}} practices (BMPs) to control weeds may help delay resistance. BMPs include applying multiple herbicides with different modes of action, rotating crops, planting weed-free seed, scouting fields routinely, <b>cleaning</b> <b>equipment</b> {{to reduce the}} transmission of weeds to other fields, and maintaining field borders. The most widely planted GM crops are designed to tolerate herbicides. By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate {{some of the same}} herbicides. Palmer amaranth is a weed that competes with cotton. A native of the southwestern US, it traveled east and was first found resistant to glyphosate in 2006, less than 10 years after GM cotton was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Biogas {{may require}} {{treatment}} or 'scrubbing' to refine it {{for use as}} a fuel. Hydrogen sulfide, a toxic product formed from sulfates in the feedstock, is released as a trace component of the biogas. National environmental enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the English and Welsh Environment Agency, put strict limits on the levels of gases containing hydrogen sulfide, and, if the levels of hydrogen sulfide in the gas are high, gas scrubbing and <b>cleaning</b> <b>equipment</b> (such as amine gas treating) will be needed to process the biogas to within regionally accepted levels. Alternatively, the addition of ferrous chloride FeCl2 to the digestion tanks inhibits hydrogen sulfide production.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{idea for}} the DVD came to percussionist Shawn Crahan, {{three weeks before the}} band entered The Mansion in 2003, where they would work on their third studio album [...] Crahan {{received}} help from the band's record label Roadrunner, who supplied them with tapes, camera <b>cleaning</b> <b>equipment</b> and funds to hire people to operate the cameras when Crahan himself couldn't. Recording began when Slipknot entered The Mansion and continued until they had finished touring in 2005, reportedly covering 28 months of the bands time together. Crahan's intentions were to capture as many different Slipknot situations as he could, so when the opportunity to produce a DVD came, he would {{be in a position to}} begin work immediately. During the period in which the footage was being shot, Crahan began making little tests of the footage and revealed them to his fellow band mates, judging their reactions to help him establish areas of interest from them. The whole recording process produced over 300 60-minute tapes of footage.|$|E

2500|$|In 1886 Sloss {{retired and}} sold the company {{to a group of}} investors who reorganized it in 1899 as the Sloss-Sheffield Steel and Iron Company. New blowers were {{installed}} in 1902, new boilers in 1906 and 1914 and the furnaces completely rebuilt with modern equipment between 1927 and 1931. In 1909 James Pickering Dovel had become the superintendent of construction. For the next 21 years, Sloss was Dovel's workshop for invention. He developed gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>equipment,</b> modified the design of the furnaces, and improved the linings of the furnaces. In all, some 17 patents are credited to Dovel. Sloss's No. 2 Furnace, rebuilt in 1927, included many of these inventions, earning Dovel and Sloss a national reputation for innovation. Through this aggressive campaign of modernization and expansion, including furnace and mining and quarrying operations all around Jefferson County, Sloss-Sheffield became the second largest seller of pig-iron in the district and among the largest in the world. During this period the company built 48 small cottages for black workers near the downtown furnace — a community that became known as [...] "Sloss Quarters" [...] or just [...] "the quarters".|$|E
2500|$|A key step in {{managing}} weeds in any pasture system is identification. [...] Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management {{can be implemented}} to control weed populations. [...] It {{is important to recognize}} that no single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and chemical control methods can be combined in an integrated weed management plan. [...] Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, <b>cleaning</b> <b>equipment</b> after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures. [...] Mechanical controls such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding can also be used to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant. [...] These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production. [...] Although these methods for managing weeds greatly reduces reliance on herbicides, weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary. [...] Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used. [...] Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of chemical control.|$|E
