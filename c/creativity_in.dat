5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and <b>creativity</b> <b>in</b> beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E
