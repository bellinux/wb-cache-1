40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{submitting}} what kind of use TO is really used by about the conditional sentence that I used connective particle TO for. For a study method, I gathered example sentences, 609 examples of TO from criticism, and set a <b>classification</b> <b>item</b> of 36 items that could appear and arranged it and considered it. As a result, actually it shared the items which occupied the majority, very few items, the items where it did not appear {{at all of the}} number of the examples that there was inclination in the way of appearing in. I can expect that TO of literary Japanese has basically some causation by a consequent from inclination of way of appearing in the uses and character of a use. In addition, as a future problem, there is necessity to submit whether there are what kind of relations characteristics for existing “some relations” as a general idea to distinguish from “causation” in TO. Furthermore, I was able to point out problems in these <b>classification</b> <b>item</b> setting because the relations that were close to “reaction” each during “discovery” “expression” “time” were seen by this investigation.

40|$|Abstract. The National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation (NIAD-UE) in Japan awards {{academic}} degrees {{based on}} the accumulation of credits. An applicant who wishes to be awarded a degree from NIAD-UE must classify his credits according to pre-determined criteria for each disciplinary field. The criteria are constructed by several items. A sub-committee of experts in the relevant field judges whether the course credit classification by the applicant is appropriate or not paying attention on the first item in the criteria. Recently, the Active Course Classification Support (ACCS) system has been proposed to support the course classification by the sub-committee. By being entered the <b>classification</b> <b>item</b> number into ACCS, ACCS indicates the course that belongs to the set of <b>classification</b> <b>item</b> number. However, the problem of deciding appropriate item numbers remains. This study aims to improve the method of determining item numbers, which should {{be judged by the}} sub-committee, by using machine learning. We use Exploitation-oriented Learning as the learning method for improving ACCS, and present a numerical example to show the effectiveness of our proposed method...|$|R

40|$|A {{learning}} {{management system}} (LMS) {{plays an important}} role in e-learning. It provides educational services to manage learner profiles and learning contents. One of the core processes of an LMS is the computer adaptive testing (CAT), which helps teachers evaluate student’s knowledge capability. Although many CAT systems have been introduced to LMSs, they do not provide the efficient <b>item</b> <b>classification</b> algorithm that supports interoperability. Such interoperability makes systems feasible to efficiently interact with each other. Thus, this paper proposes a CAT framework supporting interoperability by using web service. In this framework, the service of the CAT system is to generate an optimal item set for an item selection module of a CAT web application. For this reason, an <b>item</b> <b>classification</b> module is redesigned and implemented by a web service. Inside this module, there are two significant components for cooperation. The former is an <b>item</b> <b>classification</b> algorithm proposed by means of a triangle-decision tree (TDT) collaborating with genetic algorithms (GAs) for generating the optimal item set, whereas the latter is the web service for making the optimal item set interoperable.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} an association between dyslexia and implicit learning deficits. It {{has been suggested that}} the weakness in implicit learning observed in dyslexic individuals may be related to sequential processing and implicit sequence learning. In the present article, we review the current literature on implicit learning and dyslexia. We describe a novel, forced-choice structural "mere exposure" artificial grammar learning paradigm and characterize this paradigm in normal readers in relation to the standard grammaticality classification paradigm. We argue that preference classification is a more optimal measure of the outcome of implicit acquisition since in the preference version participants are kept completely unaware of the underlying generative mechanism, while in the grammaticality version, the subjects have, at least in principle, been informed about the existence of an underlying complex set of rules at the point of classification (but not during acquisition). On the basis of the "mere exposure effect," we tested the prediction that the development of preference will correlate with the grammaticality status of the <b>classification</b> <b>items.</b> In addition, we examined the effects of grammaticality (grammatical/nongrammatical) and associative chunk strength (ACS; high/low) on the classification tasks (preference/grammaticality). Using a balanced ACS design in which the factors of grammaticality (grammatical/nongrammatical) and ACS (high/low) were independently controlled in a 2 × 2 factorial design, we confirmed our predictions. We discuss the suitability of this task for further investigation of the implicit learning characteristics in dyslexia...|$|R
