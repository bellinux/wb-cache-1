5000|$|A raft {{of changes}} {{included}} a launch control system, stiffer engine and transmission mounts and retuned suspension. The suspension gained stiffer upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> <b>bushes,</b> stiffer upper strut mounts and retuned dampers at the front, with the rear gaining higher spring rates, retuned dampers, a larger anti-roll bar and reinforced lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The rear also gained a 9-inch wider wheel package shod with 275/35 R19 tyres and revised toe-link settings. This [...] "R-Spec" [...] also {{ended up being}} a louder car than the regular GT and GT-P despite no particular changes to that effect. The R-Spec split public and owners on not only looks but the package as well. For {{the first and only}} time Ford/FPV produced a car with major changes in drive and handling. Many existing FPV owners were quick to down play what was actually quiet a good package which significantly improved drive and performance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reverse {{modeling}} of vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is studied. Firstly, {{the data of}} vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is acquired. Secondly, the scanning point cloud data is processed. Then 3 D model of vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is reconstructed. Finally, model’s deviation is analyzed {{to find out the}} deficiencies and to improve the accuracy of the model. Reverse modeling based on CATIA can make up the shortage of traditional modeling method and solve the problem of gaining the data of complex curved surface parts. It also can shorten the innovation and improvement cycle of the vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and reduce the production cost and enhance enterprise competitiveness...|$|R

5000|$|The Magna Sports was {{available}} in only four colours: Paris White, Calypso Red, Nautilus Blue (deep blue), and Frontier Green (deep green), the latter two colours being new to the TF series. This new model carried all the standard features of the Executive model on which it was based, plus a deck lid spoiler, red side strip, 16-inch alloy wheels (same as the Verada Ei, but polished), and unique interior trims such as a metal-style instrument cluster fascia. Its V6 was standard as on all Magnas, however, only the Sports could be optioned with a manumatic Sports Mode four-speed automatic transmission featuring {{for the first time}} on an Australian-built car, a manual shifting function (via a second transmission gate plane to the right of standard gear positions, with [...] "push-forward" [...] upshifts and [...] "push-back" [...] downshifts). The Sports had improved handling characteristics thanks to the addition of an 18 mm rear swaybar (a rear bar swaybar was not fitted to the standard Magna), 11 percent firmer rear springs, firmer upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and trailing <b>arm</b> <b>bushes,</b> and suspension height lowered by 10 mm. Options included dual airbags and ABS. This specific model represented MMAL's foray into the Australian sporty family passenger car sector, as well as an initial and long overdue departure from the more conservative Japanese product planning. The Sports' production ceased after September 1998.|$|R

30|$|Guideline-based {{medication}} regimens {{which included}} statin therapy were reportedly used at baseline, during the trial, or throughout follow-up, in 24 (34 %) of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> comparisons. In a further seven comparisons (10 %), statin therapy was not explicitly reported but probable given {{the dates of}} participant recruitment. Lipid-lowering therapy was either not begun in the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> or reported as not used, in 17 comparisons (24 %) and was unlikely used in a further 24 comparisons with recruitment and follow-up periods preceding 1994. Overall, this resulted in statin use in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (matched with comparable use in the intervention arm) for 40 % of comparisons, 56 % of comparisons without statin use in either arm and three trials [46, 48, 60] in which the intervention arm included a specific pharmacological lipid-lowering strategy compared to the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (Table  1).|$|R

5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} {{upper and lower}} <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coilover shocks. A common misconception with this platform is that the front end has struts; however, since there is an upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> they are actually coilover shocks. Brakes were a vented rotor / single-piston caliper with Sport model Thunderbirds receiving a larger diameter rotor. The rear suspension consisted of upper and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coil spring and shock. Varying sway bar diameters were used among the different models of Cougar and Thunderbird. All MN12 cars shipped from the factory with a 5 x 4.25" [...] (5x108mm) lugnut bolt pattern.|$|R
2500|$|Also new, the {{double-wishbone}} front suspension had ball joints, {{upper and}} lower <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs and shock absorbers above the upper control arms; as well as trailing struts on the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The [...] "Magnum 500" [...] road wheels were now standard, but the new [...] "Machine" [...] 15x7inch slot-styled wheels were optional.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{proposes a}} {{structural}} design method {{for the upper}} <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> installed at the rear side of a SUV. The weight of <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> can be reduced by applying the design and material technologies. In this research, the former includes optimization technology, and the latter the technologies for selecting aluminum as a steel-substitute material. Strength assessment {{is the most important}} design criterion in the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> At the proto design stage of a new <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> FE (finite element) analysis is often utilized to predict its strength. This study considers the static strength in the optimization process. The inertia relief method for FE analysis is utilized to simulate the static loading conditions. According to the classification of structural optimization, the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is included in the category of shape optimization. In this study, the kriging interpolation method is adopted to obtain the minimum weight satisfying the strength constraint. Optimum designs are obtained by ANSYS WORKBENCH and the in-house program, EXCEL-kriging program. The optimum results determined from the in-house program are compared with those of ANSYS WORKBENCH...|$|R

50|$|The B5 S4 is {{fitted with}} 4-wheel {{independent}} suspension. The front suspension is a multi-link design with four individual <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> per wheel. The rear suspension is an unequal length double wishbone design; the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> are mounted to a subframe which also carries the differential housing. Shock absorbers, coil springs, and anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear.|$|R
40|$|The Lower <b>Control</b> <b>arm</b> is {{the most}} vital {{component}} in a suspension system. It is usually a steel bracket that pivots on rubber bushings mounted to the chassis. The other end supports the lower ball joint. Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the lower ball joint bush. Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC. NASTRAN and ABAQUS analysis. Multi-axial Fatigue analysis using NEiNASTRAN and WINLIFE is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{a change in}} tumour characteristics and applied treatments over time in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> of all centres of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and to compare this with similar data of the screening arm. Methods: Between 1993 and 2003, 182, 160 men, aged 50 - 74 years, were randomised to the screening arm (N = 82, 816) and the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (N = 99, 184). Men in the screening arm were offered Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing every 4 years whilst men in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> received usual care. Tumour characteristics and treatment were evaluated in all men diagnosed with prostate cancer up to December 2006 or the third screening round. Data on the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> were divided into 3 periods: 1994 - 1998, 1999 - 2002 and 2003 - 2006. Results: Tumour characteristics were more favourable over time in both the control and the screening arm, with especially increasing proportions of T 1 C tumours with 29 % in 1994 - 1998 versus 50 % in 2003 - 2006 and 48 % at the initial screening round versus 75 % at the third screening round, respectively. Tumour characteristics observed in the last period of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> were comparable to tumour characteristics in the initial screening round. In the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> treatment changed over time with surgery as the most common treatment in the entire observed period, but almost doubling of expectant management and the combination of hormone therapy and radiotherapy over time. In the initial screening round, surgery {{was the most common}} treatment (42 %), changing over time to expectant management as the most frequently applied treatment in the third screening round (33 %). Conclusion: Tumour characteristics in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> became more favourable over time and show similarity with prostate cancer cases detected at the initial screening round. The most prominent change in treatment over time was an increase of application of expectant management in both arms of the ERSPC. These observations reflect an increasing rate of opportunistic testing over time in men randomised to the <b>control</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R
