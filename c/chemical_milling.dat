5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>milling.</b> Typically, <b>chemical</b> <b>milling</b> is used {{to slowly}} remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{regarding}} the <b>chemical</b> and <b>milling</b> characteristics {{of some of}} the various varieties of wheat grown in the State have been carried on since the season of 1904. This is, however, the first report of the investigations that has been published. The work was started with the hope of assisting in the determination of the varieties of wheat best adapted to the State. While, of course, the variety which does not yield well but which has excellent <b>chemical</b> and <b>milling</b> characteristics is not desirable, yet on the other hand, as has already been so often pointed out, neither is the variety desirable which yields well but has poor <b>chemical</b> and <b>milling</b> characteristics. The ideal which we must strive to obtain is the high yielding variety, having the best <b>chemical</b> and <b>milling</b> characteristics. Of course yield commands the first attention but it must not be forgotten that the wheat is to be converted into flour which must have the necessary strength to produce a good loaf of bread. Quality of product must be combined with high yielding properties in order that our farmers may command the best price for their product...|$|R

5000|$|The maskant {{to be used}} is {{determined}} primarily by the chemical used to etch the material, and the material itself. The maskant must adhere {{to the surface of}} the material, and it must also be chemically inert enough with regards to the etchant to protect the workpiece. Most modern <b>chemical</b> <b>milling</b> processes use maskants with an adhesion around 350 g cm−1; if the adhesion is too strong, the scribing process may be too difficult to perform. If the adhesion is too low, the etching area may be imprecisely defined. Most industrial <b>chemical</b> <b>milling</b> facilities use maskants based upon neoprene elastomers or isobutylene-isoprene copolymers.|$|E

50|$|The {{processes}} that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: traditional processes, non-traditional processes, and finishing treatments. Traditional processes {{are defined as}} processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: grinding, turning, and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples {{of this type of}} process include EDM, electrochemical machining, and <b>chemical</b> <b>milling.</b> These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. Finishing treatments are defined as {{processes that}} negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity. For example, compressive residual stress can be enhanced via peening or roller burnishing or the recast layer left by EDMing can be removed via <b>chemical</b> <b>milling.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bio{{machining}} is {{the machining}} process of using lithotropic bacteria to remove material from metal parts, contrasted with chemical machining {{methods such as}} <b>chemical</b> <b>milling</b> and physical machining methods such as milling. Certain bacteria, such as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans, which are also used in the mineral refinement process of bioleaching, utilize the chemical energy from oxidation of iron or copper to fix carbon dioxide from the air. A metal object, when placed in a culture fluid containing these metal-metabolizing bacteria, will have material removed from its surface over time.|$|E

In this study, the methane potential of brown, oxygen delignified and bleached pulp were evaluated {{in order to assess}} the potential of converting traditional fibers; as well as microcrystalline cellulose and filtrates; to energy. Results showed that high yields (380 mL CH 4 /gVS) were achieved with bleached fibers which correlates with the lower presence of lignin. Filtrates from the hydrolysis process on the other hand, had the lowest yields (253 mL CH 4 /gVS) due to the high amount of acid and lignin compounds that cause inhibition. Overall, substrates had a biodegradability above 50 % which demonstrates that they can be subjected to efficient anaerobic digestion.
