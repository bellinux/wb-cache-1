40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Washington State UniversityBioavailable {{antibiotic}} residues from treated animals likely {{contribute to}} the persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in agricultural systems. To determine {{the magnitude of this}} effect, we evaluated changes in the number of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in the soil of <b>calf</b> <b>pens</b> after administration of therapeutic course of antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment resulted in a ~ 3 -log (ceftiofur) and ~ 5 -log (florfenicol) {{increase in the number of}} antibiotic-resistant E. coli in the pen soil and these resulting “reservoirs” remained stable for at least 20 days. To determine is antibiotic residues or fecal shedding of resistant bacteria is more important in this process, treated and untreated calves were introduced into pens that had been pre-sprayed with a GFP-labeled strain of E. coli. Results demonstrated that antibiotic residues were responsible for a 10 -fold greater effect than fecal loading. We also estimated the “infectious dose 50 ” (ID 50 = 2. 83 log/g) for antibiotic-resistant E. coli within the first ten days of exposure (Chapter I). To determine if reservoirs of this magnitude exist under “real-world” conditions, we examined the density of soil-borne, antibiotic-resistant E. coli on 14 working farms in Washington State. A high proportion of soil samples from <b>calf</b> and heifer <b>pens</b> (32 - 61 %) exceeded the predicted contact-dependent ID 50 for transmission of antibiotic-resistant E. coli from soil to calves. Hospital pens (25 - 36 %) also regularly exceeded this threshold, but this was much less common in lactating (1. 5 - 3 %), fresh (2 - 17 %) and dry lot soils (0. 8 - 6 %). A one-year longitudinal study indicated that the abundance of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in soil is positively correlated with monthly average high and low temperature (r = 0. 58 to 0. 7, P = 0. 04 to 0. 01). In a separate 16 s-rDNA study, we observed a transient (10 days) microbiome change in the feces of animals after antibiotic treatment (P 0. 05). Although pen soil community structure changed over time, if there were any antibiotic treatment effects these were masked by other factors (Chapter II). The presence of discrete and robust reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in predictable locations presents a new opportunity for mitigating and reducing antibiotic resistance in food-animal production environments.

5000|$|Changes in {{construction}} are {{noted in the}} same period. Instead of building the structure around the heavy wooden frame of the window, you would see structures built with openings into which pre-fabricated windows were installed. The earliest examples I've seen date from around 1810 and utilized a very nice variation on the strap hinge. Instead of mounting the pintle {{to the surface of}} the structure a new form was designed. This pintle was a flat plate of about two inches high and notched to one half of its height and formed to a female barrel. Holes were punched in the side of the pintle and it was screwed directly to the side of the window before the window was installed on the structure. The strap hinges were modified to match the new pintles… the hinge was of the same width as the pintle and notched to one half of its height. A pin to mate with the female pintle was welded in the hinge. Examples of this type proved to be very durable and were in very regular and widespread use through the 1870s. If you look in any older town you can still see tons of examples of the female [...] "cup" [...] pintles still installed on the windows. (Often when the shutters were removed - usually in the 20th century - cast type pintles were hit with a hammer and broken off flush with the edge of the window. The shutters often found their way into the basements of the home to provide coal bins for newly installed central heat - or, as on our old farm, were nailed up in the barn to partition off pig sties or <b>calf</b> <b>pens).</b>|$|R
40|$|Some {{factors that}} {{contribute}} to variation in the responses of Bali cattle calves to dry season supplementation before weaning were examined on-farm in 10 villages located in three districts in East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia from June to December 2008. The altitudes of the three districts were 0100, 400 and 800 m above sea level. A total of 199 Bali (Banteng, Bos sondaicus) calves were offered a concentrate supplement from 1 month after birth (or June for calves born before May) at a level of 2 % liveweight. The supplement consisted of grass hay and concentrate (rice bran, corn meal, leucaena leaf and fish meal) containing 18. 6 % crude protein. The supplement was offered to calves in the morning while confined to <b>calf</b> <b>pens</b> when the dams were released for grazing. Calves were reunited with the cows during the night. The effects of districts, herd size and month of birth on mortality rate, liveweight gain (LWG) and growth in supplemented calves were examined. Mortality rate averaged 1. 0 % and was not affected by month of birth, herd size or districts. The month of calving varied from March to September, but was mostly concentrated during June and July (55 %). Month of birth did not significantly affect (P > 0. 05) LWG of the calves, but the heart girth of calves born early (May) did increase at a slower rate (P < 0. 05) than calves born late (August) (10 mm/day versus 27 mm/day). LWG of supplemented calves was faster (P < 0. 05) in herds of 10 or less cow-calf pairs (220 g/day) than in herds of more than 10 cow-calf pairs (160 g/day). Altitude affected LWG (P < 0. 05) of supplemented calves; gains were 170, 210 and 280 g/day for the three districts with altitudes of 1100, 400 and 800 m, respectively. Implications of the factors affecting response to supplementation are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Since 1994, Irish cattle {{have been}} exposed to greater risks of {{acquiring}} Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection {{as a consequence of the}} importation of over 70, 000 animals from continental Europe. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported clinical cases of paratuberculosis in Ireland. This study examines the prevalence of factors that promote the introduction and within-herd transmission of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) on selected Irish dairy farms in the Cork region, and the association between these factors and the results of MAP screening tests on milk sock filter residue (MFR). A total of 59 dairy farms, selected using non-random methods but apparently free of endemic paratuberculosis, were enrolled into the study. A questionnaire was used to collect data about risk factors for MAP introduction and transmission. The MFR was assessed on six occasions over 24 months for the presence of MAP, using culture and immunomagnetic separation prior to polymerase chain reaction (IMS-PCR). Furthermore, blood samples from all entire male and female animals over one year of age in 20 herds were tested by ELISA. Eighteen (31 %) farms had operated as closed herds since 1994, 28 (47 %) had purchased from multiple sources and 14 (24 %) had either direct or indirect (progeny) contact with imported animals. Milk and colostrum were mixed on 51 % of farms, while 88 % of farms fed pooled milk. Thirty (51 %) herds tested negative to MFR culture and IMS-PCR, 12 (20 %) were MFR culture positive, 26 (44 %) were IMS-PCR positive and seven (12 %) were both culture and IMS-PCR positive. The probability of a positive MFR culture was significantly associated with reduced attendance at calving, and with increased use of individual <b>calf</b> <b>pens</b> and increased (but not significantly) if mulitiple suckling was practised. There was poor agreement between MFR culture and MFR IMS-PCR results, but moderate agreement between MFR culture and ELISA test results. This study highlights a lack of awareness among Irish dairy farmers about the effect of inadequate biosecurity on MAP introduction. Furthermore, within-herd transmission will be facilitated by traditional calf rearing and waste management practices. The findings of viable MAP in the presence of known transmission factors in non-clinically affected herds could be a prelude to long-term problems for the Irish cattle and agri-business generally. </p...|$|R

40|$|Relationships between air quality, {{a variety}} of {{environmental}} risk factors, and calf respiratory health were studied in 13 naturally ventilated calf barns during winter. A minimum of 12 preweaned calves were randomly selected and scored {{for the presence of}} respiratory disease in each barn. An air sampling device was used to determine airborne bacteria colony-forming units per cubic meter (cfu/m 3) of air in calf pens and central alleys within the barns. Airborne bacteria samples were collected on sheep blood agar (BAP) and eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar plates. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded in each <b>calf</b> <b>pen,</b> the barn alley, and outside the barn. Samples of bedding were collected in each pen and DM was measured. Pen bedding type and a calf nesting score (degree to which the calves could nestle into the bedding) was assigned to each barn. Calf numbers, barn and pen dimensions, ridge, eave, and curtain openings, and exterior wind speed and direction were determined and used to estimate building ventilation rates. Factors that were significantly associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease were reduced pen bacterial counts (log 10 cfu/m 3) on BAP, presence of a solid barrier between each <b>calf</b> <b>pen,</b> and increased ability to nest. Individual <b>calf</b> <b>pen</b> bacterial counts were significantly different from barn alley bacterial counts on both BAP and EMB.

Pre-weaned dairy calves are typically separated from their dam immediately after birth and housed alone, but no work to date has addressed the effect of individual housing on cognitive performance of these animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of individual versus social housing on two measures of cognitive performance: reversal learning and novel object recognition. Holstein calves were either housed individually in a standard <b>calf</b> <b>pen</b> (n = 8) or kept in pairs using a double pen (n = 10). Calves were tested twice daily in a Y-maze starting at 3 weeks of age. Calves were initially trained to discriminate two colours (black and white) until they reached a learning criterion of 80 % correct over three consecutive sessions. Training stimuli were then reversed (i. e. the previously rewarded colour was now unrewarded, and vice-versa). Calves from the two treatments showed similar rates of learning in the initial discrimination task, but the individually housed calves showed poorer performance in the reversal task. At 7 weeks of age, calves were tested for their response to a novel object in eight tests over a two-day period. Pair-housed calves showed declining exploration with repeated testing but individually reared calves did not.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of three resuscitation procedures on respiratory and metabolic adaptation to extra-uterine life during the first 24 h after birth in healthy newborn calves. Twenty-four newborn calves were randomly grouped into four categories: six calves did not receive any specific resuscitation procedure and were considered as controls (C); six received pharyngeal and nasal suctioning immediately after birth by use of a hand-powered vacuum pump (SUC); six received five litres of cold water poured over their heads immediately after birth (CW) and six were housed in a <b>calf</b> <b>pen</b> with an infrared radiant heater for 24 h after birth (IR). Calves were examined at birth, 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after birth and the following measurements were recorded: physical and clinical examination, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary function tests using the oesophageal balloon catheter technique, arterial and venous blood acid-base balance analysis, jugular venous blood sampling for determination of metabolic, haematological and passive immune transfer variables. SUC was accompanied by improved pulmonary function efficiency and by a less pronounced decrease in body temperature. The "head shaking movement" and the subsequent temporary increase in total pulmonary resistance as well as the greater lactic acidosis due to CW were accompanied by more efficient, but statistically non-significant, pulmonary gas exchanges. IR allowed maintenance of higher body temperature without requiring increased catabolism of energetic stores. IR also caused a change in breathing pattern which contributed to better distribution of the ventilation and to slightly improved gas exchange. The results indicate that use of SUC, CW and IR modified respiratory and metabolic adaptation during the first 24 h after birth without side-effects. These resuscitation procedures should be recommended for their specific indication, i. e. cleansing of fetal fluid from upper airways, hypothermal stimulation of breathing and prevention of heat losses.

Furthermore consumers pay increasing attention to animal health and housing conditions in livestock husbandry today. The occurrence and severity of factor-associated diseases is substantially influenced by management practices. The objectives of this study were to determine management practices in farms in northeastern Germany that can compromise calf health and welfare. Besides, we wanted to identify risk factors that are linked to high calf mortality and poor growth in young dairy replacement heifers. A case-control study was performed in 50 herds, which were selected based on acceptance to participate in the study. Each herd was visited once between 2012 and 2014. A questionnaire on farm management practices, morbidity and calf mortality was completed by in-person interview. Furthermore colostral, blood und fecal samples were collected. Heart girth measurements were conducted to assume average daily weight gain of calves. Additionally a score concerning calf welfare was determined. The epidemiological associations between these factors with calf mortality and with poor growth were estimated by using two regression models including 16 and 25 preselected factors each. The calf mortality ranged between 0. 0 and 17. 7 %. The factors significantly associated with high calf mortality (> 5. 0 %) were the application of Halofuginone (OR: 10. 0) and a high rate of calves with failure of passive transport (OR: 8. 1). The access to hay {{in the first week of}} life compared to those offered no hay before weaning was linked to a lower calf mortality rate (OR: 0. 2). On herd-level the average daily weight gain in calves three month of age was 675 grams per day and ranged between 414 and 1027 grams. The risk factors significantly associated with poor growth were relocating calves more than twice from birth until weaning (- 119 g), having an incidence of milk fever under 5 % (- 115 g), offering hay before weaning (- 142 g), collecting first colostrum later than two hours after parturition (- 142 g), the amount of concentrates consumed at weaning (+ 160 g per kilogram concentrates), changing the bedding in the <b>calf</b> <b>pen</b> at least once every two weeks (- 96 g), relocating calves more than twice from birth until weaning (- 93 g), feeding less than three liters of first colostrum to newborn calves (- 88 g) and leaving the farm more than two hours per day unattended (- 84 g). These results indicate that management practices like colostrum, feeding and husbandry management {{have an impact on}} calf health and animal welfare. Furthermore they give an overview of current management practices in the examined region. With this new knowledge systematic advice can be given to farmers who want to improve calf mortality rates, growth of dairy heifer calves and animal welfare.
