5|$|To {{show his}} {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the best-known}} advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, his Secretary of State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York <b>Custom</b> <b>House,</b> which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president forty years earlier. Sherman was not a civil service reformer, but he went along with Hayes's instructions. The foremost enemy of reform—and Hayes—was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and it was to Conkling's spoilsmen that Hayes first turned his attention. At Hayes's direction, Sherman ordered John Jay to investigate the New York <b>Custom</b> <b>House,</b> which was stacked with Conkling's appointees.

5|$|St. Joseph's Church {{was built}} by German {{immigrants}} in 1859–60 and is the oldest wooden church building in Galveston and the oldest German Catholic Church in Texas. The church was dedicated in April 1860, to St. Joseph, {{the patron saint of}} laborers. The building is a wooden gothic revival structure, rectangular with a square bell tower with trefoil window. The U.S. <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> began construction in 1860 and was completed in 1861. The Confederate Army occupied the building during the American Civil War, In 1865, the <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> was the site of the ceremony officially ending the Civil War.|$|E

It {{is one of a}} group of <b>Customs</b> <b>Houses</b> built in Queensland at the turn of the century to the design of innovative and skilful architects of the Public Works Department. The architect responsible for the design of the Rockhampton <b>Customs</b> <b>House</b> is thought to be Thomas Pye with the assistance of George Payne.|$|R
50|$|<b>Customs</b> <b>House</b> Area The <b>customs</b> <b>house</b> area {{includes}} Lincoln and Water Streets, comprising {{a mixture}} of commercial and residential structures, chiefly of stone construction and dominated by a brick family compound at Zaragoza and Estrella.

50|$|By the 1890s, the 1861 <b>customs</b> <b>house</b> was deteriorating {{and this}} was more rapid after a flood in 1893. Soon after this, a {{decision}} was made to construct a new <b>Customs</b> <b>House.</b> A large new Brisbane <b>customs</b> <b>house</b> was constructed in 1889 and the high quality and substantial nature of this building inspired many of the <b>customs</b> <b>houses</b> built in the federation period, which included that at Maryborough, and others at Rockhampton, Townsville, Bundaberg and Mackay.|$|R
5|$|After their arrest, law {{enforcement}} officials investigated whether Adolf, Gartrell and Johnson were linked to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District. Authorities were also studying whether a bullet recovered from a Hertz rental car shot on August 15 could have matched the guns seized from the men.|$|E

He hoped to be appointed to the <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the main}} port {{on the river}} was at Bridgwater, where a span crossed the river from 1200 AD onwards. Quays were built at Bridgwater in 1424, with another quay, the Langport slip, being built in 1488 {{upstream}} of the Town Bridge. A <b>custom</b> <b>house</b> was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. Bridgwater built some 167 ships, the last one being the Irene launched in 1907.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two {{congressional and}} one Treasury Department {{investigations}} {{took place over}} corruption at the New York <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy. Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees. Grant's friend, George K. Leet, was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits. Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage.|$|E
5|$|Some {{location}} shooting {{took place}} in New York City. The Alexander Hamilton U.S. <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, {{was used as the}} exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family. A row of houses on Fuller Place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Windsor Terrace stood in for the Forest Hills, Queens neighborhood of Ben and May Parker. A web-swinging stunt sequence takes place along the Riverside Drive Viaduct in Harlem.|$|E
5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the <b>custom</b> <b>house,</b> but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
50|$|In November 1897, the Government Architect A B Brady {{submitted}} {{plans for}} approval to Treasury {{for a new}} <b>Customs</b> <b>House.</b> Estimated cost was to be £12,000. Completion was expected to take eighteen months. At this time other <b>Customs</b> <b>Houses</b> were being constructed by the colonial government in other ports along the Queensland coast, in locations such as Townsville and Maryborough. The construction of the Rockhampton <b>Customs</b> <b>House</b> {{was part of a}} major public works construction program leading to Federation of not only <b>customs</b> <b>houses</b> but also state government offices and post offices.|$|R

5|$|In 1887 a Congressional Act {{divided the}} Eastern District into the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Eastern District. The courts of the Eastern Division {{continued}} {{to be held at}} the U.S. <b>Custom</b> <b>House</b> and Post Office in St. Louis, while the courts of the Northern Division were moved to the U.S. Post Office at Hannibal, Missouri, where they met until 1960. These two courts, along with the four courts of the Western District, made six courts for the state, and at the time no other state had so many separate federal courts. The district has since been further divided into the Eastern, Northern, and Southeast divisions.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a <b>custom</b> <b>house.</b> Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also {{a considerable number of}} Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a <b>custom</b> <b>house</b> or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
5000|$|Knoxville's {{continued}} growth rendered the <b>Customs</b> <b>House</b> insufficient for the city's postal needs, {{and a new}} post office was built on Main Street in 1934. [...] Ownership of the <b>Customs</b> <b>House</b> {{was transferred to the}} newly created Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for use as office space. [...] Along with the <b>Customs</b> <b>House,</b> TVA maintained offices in the nearby Arnstein Building and in the Daylight Building on Union Avenue. Following the completion of the TVA Towers in 1976, ownership of the <b>Customs</b> <b>House</b> was transferred to Knox County for use by the Lawson McGhee Library's Calvin M. McClung Historical Collection, and the Knox County Archives.|$|R
