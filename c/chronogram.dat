25|$|The Javanese {{sources are}} very {{selective}} in putting dates to events. Events {{such as the}} rise and fall of kratons, the death of important princes, great wars, etc. are the only kind of events deemed important enough to be dated, by using a poetic formula <b>chronogram</b> called candrasengkala, which can be expressed verbally and pictorially, the rest being simply described in narrative succession without dates. Again these candrasengkalas do not always match the annals.|$|E
25|$|The story centres on {{the widely}} made claim that, when numerised (i.e., when those {{letters in the}} 'title' that have Roman numeral value are added {{together}} as in a <b>chronogram),</b> they produce the number 666, described in the Book of Revelation as the Number of the Beast (the Antichrist), who wears multiple crowns (identified by some as the triple tiara). This claim has been made by some Protestant sects {{who believe that the}} Pope, as head of the Roman Catholic Church, is the Beast or the False Prophet mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However, a detailed examination of the existing tiaras shows no such decoration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chronograms</b> {{from the}} Roman Empire are {{reported}} but not confirmed. The earliest confirmed <b>chronograms</b> using Roman numerals were devised {{in the mid}} 14th century but retrospective <b>chronograms</b> which express earlier dates are known. [...] <b>Chronograms</b> were particularly popular during the Renaissance, when <b>chronograms</b> were often used on tombstones and foundation stones to mark {{the date of the}} event being commemorated. They were popular during the Baroque as well. In 1711, Joseph Addison compared <b>chronograms</b> to [...] "anagrams and acrostics". [...] Examples include: ...|$|R

5000|$|It is evident, therefore, {{that for}} a period of five hundred years <b>chronograms</b> {{occurred}} in the epitaphs of European Jews. Thus the dates of the epitaphs of the family of Asher ben Jehiel {{in the first half of}} the fourteenth century are indicated by <b>chronograms</b> (Almanzi, [...] "Abne Zikkaron", pp. 4, 6, 9); and among sixty-eight Frankfort epitaphs of that century four <b>chronograms</b> have been preserved (Horowitz, [...] "Inschriften... zu Frankfurt-am-Main", Nos. 8, 29, 36, 68). The German Jews seem to have possessed little skill in the composition of <b>chronograms,</b> there being only about twenty-five (and these very simple) in a total of some 6,000 inscriptions. In Bohemia and Poland, <b>chronograms</b> in epitaphs occur more frequently, and are often very clever; for example, the epitaph of the physician Menahem b. Asher Mazzerato, who died at Prague in 1680, reads as follows: איש צדיק ישר חכם וענו האלוף מהר״ר מנחם רופא מומחה (Lieben, [...] "Gal Ed," [...] p. 36); and the numerical value of the marked initial letters therein amounts to 440; i.e., 5440, the Jewish year in which Menahem died. The year of death of the associate rabbi of Prague, Zalman, who perished in the great fire of 1689 (=5449 Jewish era), is indicated by the words באש יצא מאת ד (bolded letters equal 448) (ib. No. 59).|$|R
500|$|On {{the side}} facing the High Street, {{there is a}} statue of Rhodes over the main entrance, with Edward VII and George V beneath.

500|$|The {{building}} of Taman Sari ended upon {{the completion of}} the gates and the walls. A sengkalan memet (a Javanese <b>chronogram)</b> on the western gate (Gedhong Gapura Hageng) marks the year with the Javanese words Lajering Kembang Sinesep Peksi, denoting the Javanese year of 1691 or about 1765: lajering, [...] "core" [...] for 1; kembang, [...] "flower" [...] for 9; sinerep, [...] "suck" [...] or [...] "drink" [...] for 6; peksi, [...] "bird" [...] for 1; the sentence can be read as [...] "birds gathering nectar of the flower". The relief around this sengkalan memet shows birds siphoning honey from flowery trees.|$|E
2500|$|According to Wolf ("Bibl. Hebr." [...] ii. 1385), {{the history}} of Hebrew {{typography}} at Frankfurt-on-the-Main begins with 1625, in which year seliḥot were printed there. But Steinschneider and Cassel declare this statement doubtful. The <b>chronogram</b> of a certain prayer book seems {{to show that it}} was printed there in 1656, but this <b>chronogram</b> is known only from references to it in a second edition printed at Amsterdam in 1658 ("Cat. Bodl." [...] Nos. 2149, 2152). It may be said with certainty, however, that Hebrew printing began in Frankfurt not later than 1662, when the Pentateuch with a German glossary was printed. The books printed at Frankfurt up to 1676 do not bear any printer's name.|$|E
