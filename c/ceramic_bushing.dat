50|$|Other ceramic pieces would {{typically}} {{be used as}} a {{junction point}} between the wiring system proper, and the more flexible cloth-clad wiring found in light fixtures or other permanent, hard-wired devices. When a generic power outlet was desired, the wiring could run directly into the junction box through a tube of protective loom and a <b>ceramic</b> <b>bushing.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an ensemble-boosting algorithm (EBA) for classifying partial discharge (PD) {{patterns in the}} condition monitoring of insulation diagnosis applied for electrical assets. This approach {{presents an}} optimization technique for creating a sequence of artificial neural network (ANNs), where the training data for each constituent of the sequence is selected based {{on the performance of}} previous ANNs. Four different PD faults scenarios were manufactured in the high-voltage (HV) laboratory to simulate the PD faults of cylindrical voids in methacrylate, point-air-plane configuration, <b>ceramic</b> <b>bushing</b> with contaminated surface and a transformer affected by the internal PD. A PD dataset was collected, pre-processed and prepared for its use in the improved boosting algorithm using statistical techniques. In this paper, the EBA is extensively compared with the widely used single artificial neural network (SNN). Results show that the proposed approach can effectively improve the generalization capability of the PD patterns. The application of the proposed technique for both online and offline practical PD recognition is examined. Chilean Research Council (CONICYT), project Fondecyt 11160115...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the quality}} survey of the working {{procedure}} of interior hole grinding of the <b>ceramic</b> shaft <b>bush</b> parts, this paper analyzes and studies it by the quality control tools such as Pareto diagram and Cause and effect diagram, and finds out the main deficiency indicator. The main influencing factor is that the verticality of the interior hole is Ultra-poor in the Process quality deficiencies. A series of the testing data of this deficiency indicator has been analyzed {{in order to obtain}} the factors influencing the deficiency indicator. Finally, comparison is made between the quality status before and after implementing improvement measures and measures of adjusting processes are taken to greatly improve the effect and the product qualified rate, which can provide reference for enterprises to improve the quality in the production process...|$|R
50|$|Hampton Springs Cemetery is a {{cemetery}} in rural Dallas County, Arkansas, {{at the junction}} of county roads 425 and 427, {{near the city of}} Carthage. The cemetery is divided into two sections, one in which traditional European grave markers predominate, and another section in which graves are marked by a local adaptation of African burial customs. This African-American section of the cemetery {{is said to have been}} in use since the late 19th century, although its oldest identified grave is dated 1916. Most of its estimated 128 marked graves are denoted by informal means, including small <b>bushes,</b> <b>ceramic</b> objects, metal pipes, wooden stakes, offering vessels such as glass jars and bowls, and even a kerosene lamp. This section of the cemetery has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an important regional example of traditional African burial practices.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the water}} {{chemistry}} surveillance program for Multi Purpose Research Reactor (MPR) G. A. Siwabessy 30 MW, the effects of primary water on homogeny, galvanic and crevice corrosion have been studied using various coupons {{in order to better}} control the corrosion in the reactor system. [4, 5] The main objectives are to establish standard procedures for corrosion monitoring and surveillance, and provide technical guidelines for continued wet storage of spent fuels. After having defined the current water chemistry profile, experiments were conducted using the coupons made of the same grade materials as used for the construction of the fuel cladding (aluminium) and reactor tank (aluminium), and fuel storage racks (stainless steel). The test coupons were made of a series of discs (φ 95 mm with φ 15 mm centre hole; 1 mm thick for stainless steel and 5. 5 mm thick for aluminium) put together as an assembly using a stainless steel centre pin and insulated with a <b>ceramic</b> <b>bushing</b> and 5 mm thick spacers between the discs. The coupons are also assembled in two orientations to allow vertical and horizontal installations in the pool. The first batch of six coupon assemblies were strategically positioned in the service pool in January 2007 and are due to be withdrawn in stages for inspection after 1, 2, and 3 years of exposure. This paper describes the current water chemistry and surveillance program...|$|E
