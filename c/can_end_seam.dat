50|$|The {{requirements}} for double seam examinations are specified in 21 CFR Part 113.60(a)(1).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a refined analysis for evaluating low-cycle fatigue crack initiation life of welded beam-to-column connections of steel frame structures under strong earthquake excitation. To consider different length scales between typical beam and column components {{as well as}} a few crucial beam-to-column welded connections, a multiscale finite element (FE) model having three different length scales is formulated. The model can accurately analyze the inelastic seismic response of a steel frame and then obtain in detail elastoplastic stress and strain field near the welded zone of the connections. It is found that the welded zone is subjected to multiaxial nonproportional loading during strong ground motion and the elastoplastic stress-strain field of the welded zone is three-dimensional. Then, using the correlation of the Fatemi-Socie (FS) parameter versus fatigue life obtained by the experimental crack initiation fatigue data of the structural steel weldment subjected to multiaxial loading, the refined evaluation approach of fatigue crack initiation life is developed based on the equivalent plastic strain at fatigue critical position of beam <b>end</b> <b>seams</b> of crucial welded connections when the steel frame is subjected to the strong earthquake excitation...|$|R
