500|$|The {{black stork}} (Ciconia nigra) {{is a large}} bird in the stork family <b>Ciconiidae.</b> It was first {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae. Measuring on average [...] from beak tip to end of tail with a [...] wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black plumage, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread, but uncommon, species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Spain, and central and eastern parts), and Asia to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance migrant, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. An isolated, non-migratory, population occurs in Southern Africa.|$|E
500|$|The greater {{adjutant}} (Leptoptilos dubius) is {{a member}} of the stork family, <b>Ciconiidae.</b> Its genus includes the lesser adjutant of Asia and the marabou stork of Africa. Once found widely across southern Asia, mainly in India but extending east to Borneo, the greater adjutant is now restricted to a much smaller range with only two small breeding populations; one in India with the largest colony in Assam and the other in Cambodia. Populations disperse after the breeding season. This large stork has a massive wedge-shaped bill, a bare head and a distinctive neck pouch. During the day, they soar in thermals along with vultures with whom they share the habit of scavenging. They feed mainly on carrion and offal; however, they are opportunistic and will sometimes prey on vertebrates. The English name is derived from their stiff [...] "military" [...] gait when walking on the ground. Large numbers once lived in Asia, but have declined greatly, possibly due to improved sanitation, to the point of being endangered. The total population in 2008 was estimated at around a thousand individuals. In the 19th century, they were especially common in the city of Calcutta, where they were referred to as the [...] "Calcutta adjutant". Known locally as hargila (derived from the Bengali words for [...] "bone-swallower") and considered to be unclean birds, they were largely left undisturbed but sometimes hunted for the use of their meat in folk medicine.

It is typically larger than the white stork, at 100 - 129 cm long, 110 - 150 cm tall, a weight of 2.8 - 5.9 kg and a wingspan of 2.22 m. Unlike its more widespread cousin, the Oriental stork has red skin around its eye, with a whitish iris and black bill. Both sexes are similar. The female is slightly smaller than male.

5000|$|The {{white stork}} (Ciconia ciconia) {{is a large}} bird in the stork family <b>Ciconiidae.</b> Its plumage is mainly white, with black on its wings.

The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to {{as far south as}} South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends do not form over water.|$|E

50|$|Accipitrimorphae is a clade {{of birds}} of prey that include the orders Cathartiformes (New World vultures) and Accipitriformes (diurnal {{birds of prey}} such as eagles, hawks, osprey and secretarybird). However this group might be a junior synonym (or at least a {{subjective}} one) of Accipitriformes. The DNA-based proposal and the NACC and IOC classifications include the New World vultures in the Accipitriformes, but the SACC classifies the New World vultures as a separate order, the Cathartiformes which has been adopted here. The placement of the New World vultures has been unclear since the early 1990s. The {{reason for this is}} the controversial systematic history of the New World vultures as they were assumed to be more related to (or a subfamily of) <b>Ciconiidae</b> (the storks) after Sibley and Ahlquist work on their DNA-DNA hybridization studies conducted in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Only {{a single}} species of stork, the Black-necked Stork Ephippiorhynchus (= Xenorhynchus) asiaticus, occurs in Australia today, and is known from several fossil localities from the Early Pliocene. Two species of smaller fossil storks are also known, one {{previously}} named and one described here. The former, found in the Darling Downs, southeastern Queensland, was named Xenorhynchus nanus De Vis, 1888. Some later authors suggested that this species should {{be transferred to the}} living genus Ciconia; this decision is confirmed here, the name for this species becoming Ciconia nana. The second species of small stork comes from several Late Oligocene and Early Miocene sites at Riversleigh, northwestern Queensland. This taxon is referred to the genus Ciconia and distinguished as a new species, C. louisebolesae. It constitutes the earliest record of the <b>Ciconiidae</b> from Australia. BOLES, WALTER E., 2005.

Location data were then utilized {{in a variety of}} applications, from determining migration routes, stopover patterns and wintering sites, through more advanced analyses including using various data overlays to examine habitat use, occupation of nature reserves, differential migration patterns between adults and juvenile birds, climatological effects on migration and the connectivity and network structure of migration pathways. Through this work, we have identified numerous important sites for migratory birds, especially cranes and storks. These include Bohai Bay and the Yellow River delta (China), the Korean Demilitarized Zone, Lake Khanka (Russia/China), and Poyang Lake, the Qiqihar Baicheng area, the Three Rivers Plain and Yangcheng Nature Reserve (all in China). We have also developed recommendations for spatial improvements to nature reserves, discovered different migration strategies in juvenile and adult birds, and a possible migration trigger involving temperature.

Compari− sons with all the hitherto known species of large <b>Ciconiidae,</b> and with an enlarged sample representing extant species, lead to a re−evaluation of some extinct taxa. Several synonymies are proposed, reflecting better the past diversity for this group. L. pliocenicus (Pliocene, Ukraine) is equivalent to L. cf. falconeri. Cryptociconia indica (late Pliocene, Siwalik Hills) belongs to Leptoptilos, and is probably either extant L. dubius or female L. falconeri. L. siwalicensis, from the same locality and also tentatively reported from the late Miocene of Northern Pakistan, is better referred to as Leptoptilini gen. et sp. indet. We consider the two following species as valid. L. titan (Pleistocene, Java) may be a late offshot of the lineage of L. falconeri. L. richae (late Miocene, Tunisia) {{is the size of}} L. crumeniferus, and is distinct from L. falconeri. Thus, L. falconeri remains the only ascertained extinct Pliocene species in the tribe Leptoptilini. It was a widespread “giant” mara− bou stork, in the Pliocene of southern Asia, as well as northern and eastern Africa where it coexisted with different Plio− cene hominids, and probably eastern Europe. It weighed up to about 20 kg, reached 2 m in height, and had probably slightly reduced forelimbs. It became extinct {{by the end of the}} Pliocene. L. falconeri is an example of a biogeographical link at the species level between the African and Eurasian faunas in the Pliocene.

The new species can be distinguished from all known species of Syncuaria by having irregular dotted ornamentations on the caudal alae of males, a complex distal end of the left spicule comprising three protuberances, and a spicule ratio of 1 : 9. 3. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of 11 Syncuaria spp. based on 9 morphological characters produced two equally parsimonious cladograms with a consistency index of 85 %, differing only in the placement of S. hargilae. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the new species is the sister species of S. leptoptili, whose male members have a single protuberance on the left spicule. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the plesiomorphic host group for the genus is Ciconiiformes, specifically <b>Ciconiidae</b> (host for 5 species), with two species occurring in Threskiornithidae (also Ciconiiformes), possibly as a result of cospeciation, and two species each occurring in Pelecaniformes and Podicipediformes, resulting from four episodes of speciation by host switching...|$|E
