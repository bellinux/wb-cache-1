5000|$|Canon 19 is a {{long one}} dealing with catechumens, {{preparation}} for baptism, administration of that sacrament, and of the Eucharist for the newly baptized. The candidate is twice anointed: first, with the oil of exorcism, after he has said, with his face westward, [...] "I renounce you, O devil, and all your following"; and, again, immediately after the baptism. As {{he stands in the}} water, he declares his faith in response to an interrogatory creed; and after each of the three clauses he is immersed. After the second anointing the bishop gives thanks [...] "for that You hast made them worthy that they should be born again, and hast poured out your Holy Spirit upon them, so that they may belong, each one of them, to the body of the Church": he signs them with the cross on their foreheads, and kisses them. The Eucharist then proceeds: [...] "the bishop gives them of the Body of Christ and says, This is the body of Christ, and they answer Amen"; and similarly for the <b>cup.</b> <b>Milk</b> and honey are then given to them as being [...] " [...] born a second time as little children." [...] A warning is added against eating anything before communicating.|$|E
