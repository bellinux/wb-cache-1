5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, the <b>cost</b> of welding plays {{a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total <b>cost,</b> including equipment <b>cost,</b> labor <b>cost,</b> material <b>cost,</b> and energy <b>cost.</b> Depending on the process, equipment <b>cost</b> can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high <b>cost,</b> they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor <b>cost</b> depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The <b>cost</b> of materials includes the <b>cost</b> of the base and filler material, and the <b>cost</b> of shielding gases. Finally, energy <b>cost</b> depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

50|$|Process <b>costing</b> is an {{accounting}} methodology that traces and accumulates direct <b>costs,</b> and allocates indirect <b>costs</b> of a manufacturing process. <b>Costs</b> {{are assigned to}} products, usually in a large batch, which might include an entire month's production.
