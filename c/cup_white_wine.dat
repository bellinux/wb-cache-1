5000|$|Bouillabaisse is {{the classic}} seafood dish of Marseille.

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{a model to}} describe the effect of exposing <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> to oxygen. The model that {{is used in the}} project describes the diffusion of oxygen through a bottle of <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> and the reaction between oxygen and ethanol in <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> The system of this phenomenon and our mathematical model is as follows: d[O 2]/dt = DO 2 *d 2 [O 2]/dx 2 − k[O 2][EtOH] d[EtOH]/dt = DEtOH *d 2 [EtOH]/dx 2 − k[O 2][EtOH] The process of limiting the real world mechanism in <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> to the oxygenethanol reaction-diffusion is outlined and discussed in the project. The model used in this project uses data from a literature study of the reaction-diffusion process for oxygen and ethanol, and is based on numerical solutions to a system of reaction-diffusion equations solved using the finite difference method. The model is analyzed in different variations. Simulation 1 describes a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> left open. Simulation 2 describes a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> that has been stirred and left open. Simulation 3 describes a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> with an alternating opening and closing mechanism reducing the oxygen access to the <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> Simulation 4 describes only the oxygen-ethanol reaction in <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> and simulation 5 describes only the diffusion of oxygen through <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> The project illustrates, that the reaction between oxygen and ethanol primarily happens {{in the top of the}} wine, thus stopping the diffusion of oxygen down through the <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> For this reason it can be concluded, that the reaction between oxygen and ethanol in <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> has almost no influence on the <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> quality and taste after openin...|$|R
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>wine</b> can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. Fermentation of the non-colored {{grape pulp}} {{produces}} <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> The grapes from which <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, {{such as the}} Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Other <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes {{may be used to}} produce <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.|$|R

40|$|The in-mouth {{perception}} of textures of <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> {{arising from the}} interactions among <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> phenolics, pH, and alcohol level was evaluated. Phenolics were extracted from <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> and added back to <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> that were adjusted to different pH and ethanol concentrations within wine realistic ranges. Adding phenolics to a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> at pH 3. 3 significantly increased its astringency, but the same addition did {{not contribute to the}} higher astringency elicited by the same wine when adjusted to pH 3. 0. Higher phenolics generally increased bitterness and viscosity, but the effect depended on the source of the phenolics. Wines with added phenolics were generally perceived to be hotter, and significantly so when the wine was low in alcohol. The combined effect of phenolic content and alcohol concentration on astringency and bitterness was additive, suggesting that alcohol directly contributes to these attributes in <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Overall, the tastes and textures produced by <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> phenolics were more pronounced in wines with lower alcohol levels. 5 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Because of its shorter maceration, <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> {{contains}} {{very little}} tannin and therefore little antioxidants that make red wine so interesting medically speaking.
