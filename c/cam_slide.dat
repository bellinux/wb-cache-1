40|$|The helmet-mounted eye {{movement}} measuring system, weighs 1, 530 grams; {{the weight of}} the present aviators' helmet in standard form with the visor is 1, 545 grams. The optical head is standard NAC Eye-Mark. This optical head was mounted on a magnesium yoke which in turn was attached to a <b>slide</b> <b>cam</b> mounted on the flight helmet. The <b>slide</b> <b>cam</b> allows one to adjust the eye-to-optics system distance quite easily and to secure it so that the system will remain in calibration. The design of the yoke and <b>slide</b> <b>cam</b> is such that the subject can, in an emergency, move the optical head forward and upward to the stowed and locked position atop the helmet. This feature was necessary for flight safety. The television camera that is used in the system is a solid state General Electric TN- 2000 with a charged induced device imager used as the vidicon...|$|R
50|$|The valves are {{typically}} {{operated by a}} camshaft rotating at half {{the speed of the}} crankshaft. It has a series of cams along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A tappet between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the <b>cam</b> <b>slides</b> to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts “above” a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the crankcase, in which case each cam usually contacts a push rod, which contacts a rocker arm that opens a valve, or in case of a flathead engine a push rod is not necessary. The overhead cam design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.|$|R
50|$|The 9422 action {{design was}} {{original}} and extremely reliable. The feed system handled the cartridge from the magazine to the breech face by its rim, and the <b>slide</b> <b>cammed</b> {{the rear of}} the breechblock up into the locking recess. A concealed polymer buffer above the breech gave a firm-feeling lockup and a very positive unlocking motion.|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{mechanism}} of the APS is of a simple construction and features a double/single-action fire mode. It comprises a trigger and trigger bar, disconnector, sear and hammer. The rebounding hammer, when in resting state, has an intermediate safety intercept notch that does not allow forward travel of the hammer unless the sear is raised. Disconnection is achieved through a <b>cam</b> in the <b>slide.</b>|$|R
40|$|The PA 46 {{polyamide}} {{material has}} a wide application in engineering due to its good mechanical behaviour in transmissions with variable temperature – gears, <b>slides,</b> <b>cams,</b> bearings, guides for chains.

"Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided <b>sliding</b> <b>cam.</b> [...] (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) [...] Each arm has a cam follower. [...] As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart.

50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Michel engine were cam engines. These do not use a crankshaft in the conventional sense, but instead have a shaped cam. The pistons or their connecting rods have <b>cam</b> followers that <b>slide</b> {{over the surface of}} this cam. Although most cams use rotary motion to generate a linear motion, this 'crankshaft' use is also possible, where the linear motion of the pistons is used to drive the rotary motion of the cam and the engine's output shaft.|$|R
50|$|A cam/rocker {{assembly}} uses {{a normal}} cam, but the roller-tip-rocker has a wheel {{on the end}} of it like that of a measuring wheel, which rolls by the use of needle bearings. Others will add roller bearings for the main pivot also. Although roller rockers are used in both pushrod and overhead cam engines, roller rockers for pushrod and overhead cam engines are considerably different in design. For pushrod engines, roller rockers employ a roller where the rocker contacts the valve stem. On the other hand, roller rockers for overhead cam engines employ a roller where the rocker contacts the cam. This greatly reduces frictional losses and wear compared to slipper followers (where the <b>cam</b> simply <b>slides</b> on a surface on the rocker arm). The difference between a roller rocker and a standard rocker with slipper followers on an overhead cam engine is analogous to the difference between roller lifters and flat tappet lifters on a pushrod engine.|$|R
5000|$|There are two rare {{variants}} {{that use}} the roller cam principle. For locations where centre-pull is inappropriate, the side-pull [...] "toggle cam brake" [...] was developed. [...] Also a first-class cantilever, it uses a single-sided <b>sliding</b> <b>cam</b> (the toggle) against one arm that is attached by {{a link to the}} other arm. As the cam presses against the follower, the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link. And specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame, the side-pull [...] "sabre cam brake" [...] was developed. In the sabre cam design, the cable end is fixed and the housing moves the single-sided cam.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is <b>cammed</b> into the <b>slide</b> away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} engine valve control {{system has been}} presented, in which both valve lift and phase are {{controlled}} directly by electric motors. A mechanism of the phase control system is made of planetary gears. The outer gear is the timing pulley which has timing belt driven by the crank of an engine. Two planetary gears are inside of the pulley. The gears engage in inner gear of the pulley. The center of the disc which has centers of the planetary gear {{is connected to the}} camshaft. Then, the crank rotation is transmitted to the cam shaft, and rotation of sun gear is added to the rotation of cam shaft. This means that when rotation angle of the sun gear is controlled, phase of the cam can be controlled. The lift control system is made of linear slider and ball screw. The cam shape of this system is three-dimensional. The height of the cam varies along the axis of the shaft. Hence, when the ball screw rotates, the <b>cam</b> shaft <b>slides</b> in the axial direction, so that the lift of the cam varies. Experimental tests have been carried out for the system. lt is ascertained that both cam lift and phase can be controlled continuously...|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the L98A1, the SA80 system is a selective fire gas-operated design that uses ignited powder gases bled through a port in the barrel to provide the weapon's automation. The rifle uses a short-stroke gas piston system located above the barrel, which is fed gas through a three-position adjustable gas regulator. The first gas setting is used for normal operation, the second is for use in difficult environmental conditions, while the third setting prevents any gas from reaching the piston and is used to launch rifle grenades. The weapon uses a rotating cylindrical bolt that contains seven radially mounted locking splines, an extractor and casing ejector. The bolt's rotation is controlled by a <b>cam</b> stud that <b>slides</b> inside a helical camming guide machined into the bolt carrier.|$|R

"Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided <b>sliding</b> <b>cam.</b> (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart.

Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{innovations}} in refrigeration compressors and their mechanisms which were conceptualised (and {{some of these}} were commercialised) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore {{over the past twenty}} years are discussed and presented. These {{innovations in}}clude piezo compressor [1 - 3], <b>sliding</b> <b>cam</b> compressor [4], rotaprocating compressor [5], revolving vane compressor and its variants [6 - 14], revolving vane expander [15] and cross-vane mechanism for expander-compressor unit [16]. The revolving vane compressor had won the World Best Technology Showcase, in Arlington, Texas, USA in 2009 and it has licensed to a Japanese compressor company for air-conditioning applications in automobile and private boats sectors, while the patent of the piezo compressor has sold to another Japanese compressor company. In this paper the working principles of each of these innovations, their uniqueness, advantages and challenges in applications will be shown, analysed and discussed. *References* 1. Ooi, K.

50|$|The {{layout of}} the Remington 51 {{is similar to the}} Walther PPK pistol in the use of a {{stationary}} barrel and recoil spring surrounding the barrel. However, the unique feature is the use of a locking breech block within the slide. When the pistol is in battery, the breech block is held forward of the locking shoulder in the frame by the force of the recoil spring which holds the bolt face solidly against the end of the chamber. When the cartridge is fired, the bolt and slide move together a short distance rearward powered by the energy of the cartridge as in a standard blowback system. When the breech block contacts the locking shoulder, it hesitates, locking the breech. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase forcing the hammer down and compressing the recoil spring around the barrel. This allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels while the breech is locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. After the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure drops to a safe level, the rearward motion of the slide causes an inclined <b>cam</b> within the <b>slide</b> to lift the rear of the breech block free from its locking recess, continuing the operating cycle. One can insert a dowel into the barrel and push on the breech block. It will only move a fraction of an inch and stop against the recessed buttress. Only manually retracting the slide or firing a cartridge opens the gun. The Remington Model 51 was the only production pistol to utilize Pedersen's type of operating system.|$|R
