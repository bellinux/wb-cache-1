40|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>overruns</b> are {{a global}} phenomenon. By {{assuming}} that companies are profit maximizing, we imply that inaccurate estimates of project costs are unwanted {{as the basis}} for investment analysis is weakened. The aim of this thesis is therefore to identify which factors affect the ability to set accurate budgets and meet the estimated costs. I highlight this topic by analyzing the differences in <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> between projects from the Norwegian oil industry and the public sector, by introducing macroeconomic variables for analysis and by looking into whether the <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> from one sector affects the other. Firstly, descriptive statistics and univariate regressions were run in order to obtain a better overview of the topic. Both public and oil projects are statistically more prone to <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> than underruns, however, oil projects experience overruns of larger magnitude. Public projects show a trend where increasing project size reduces <b>cost</b> <b>overruns,</b> while <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> in oil projects tend to increase with the duration of the project. To further analyze the dynamics of <b>cost</b> <b>overruns,</b> multivariate regressions were performed. This includes using forward selection by iterative processes in order to arrive at the final models. For oil projects, I find the variables Duration, Pension fund surprise, GDP growth and NCS investment surprise to significantly affect the magnitude of <b>cost</b> <b>overruns,</b> explaining about 25 % of the variability in <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> for oil projects. As for public projects, the corresponding model includes the variables Duration, Employment level, GDP from marine activities and Export, explaining about 13 % of the variability. The models above indicate that <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> in both sectors depend on the macroeconomic environment at the time of project execution. The explanatory power for the oil model is rather acceptable, however, I fail to find a good general model for <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> in public projects. When comparing the two sectors by running the models on the opposite dataset, no causal relationship in <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> between the two was found, and I therefore fail to confirm whether the different sectors affect the <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> of each other...|$|R

The successful execution of construction projects and keeping them within prescribed schedule and cost is very important for effective time performance and cost performance. This research work is carried out on studying significant factors causing Time <b>overruns</b> and <b>Cost</b> <b>overruns</b> in Indian construction projects. A valid questionnaire for the survey was developed based on factors for time overruns and factors for <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> identified from literature review. These factors are grouped into 12 categories for time overruns and 8 categories for <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> and distributed to Contractors, Consultants, and Owners of Indian construction Industry. The data from the questionnaire was analyzed statistically. Relative important index method was used to found out the most significant factors affecting Time and <b>Cost</b> <b>overruns.</b> The result accomplished from the survey revealed that the major cause for time overruns are material market rate, contract modification, and high level of quality requirement and the major cause for <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> are high transportation cost, change in material specification, and escalation of materials price.

With those numbers to encourage them, the stockholders formally organized the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in June 1828. In the end, the final construction cost to Cumberland in 1850 was $11,071,075.21.

The study makes use of a kiviat diagram/radar chart in order to visualize multivariate data. Findings Aggregated rankings of important causes of <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> and time delays are reported. These show a strong emphasis on the management aspect as a primary cause of <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> and delays. Additionally, there seems to be a trend toward deemphasizing the role of financial considerations in explaining <b>cost</b> <b>overruns</b> and delays.

Research limitations/implications Only public construction projects have been considered. The results will not be directly applicable to privately funded construction projects and/or projects of a smaller size.
