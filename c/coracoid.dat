5|$|Prehistoric {{representatives of}} the extant Picidae genera are treated in the genus articles. An enigmatic form based on a <b>coracoid</b> found in Pliocene {{deposits}} of New Providence in the Bahamas, {{has been described as}} Bathoceleus hyphalus and probably also is a woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each <b>coracoid.</b> As in other flightless birds, the angle between the <b>coracoid</b> and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids are {{diagnosed}} {{by the following}} features; short T-shaped frontals that form the rostral boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging shelf of the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the caudal vertebrae elongate and spanning several vertebrae; {{the presence of a}} subglenoid fossa on the <b>coracoid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and <b>coracoids</b> are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and <b>coracoids</b> articulate, the <b>coracoids</b> are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The <b>coracoids</b> resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|R

5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The <b>coracoid</b> is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The <b>coracoid</b> as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated <b>coracoid,</b> indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and <b>coracoid</b> elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E

50|$|Fendusaurus {{is known}} from five {{specimens}} of skeletal elements. The specimens include a holotype, FGM998GF13-II, {{that includes a}} skull, and cannot be assigned to cf. Ammosaurus. Other specimens are also assigned to Fendusaurus, FGM998GF13-I, FGM998GF13-III, FGM998GF69, FGM998GF9, and FGM998GF18, all found by a crew from the Princeton University. All the specimens include femora and <b>coracoids,</b> and although they each share slightly different features, the differences are credited to intra-specific variation. The femora and <b>coracoids</b> also help identify different individuals, and Timothy J. Fedak, the described of the specimens, found that each block represented about one individual.|$|R
5|$|The Munich Specimen (BSP 1999 I 50, {{formerly}} known as the Solenhofer-Aktien-Verein Specimen) was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the Paläontologisches Museum München in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million Deutschmark. What was initially believed to be a bony sternum turned out {{to be part of the}} <b>coracoid,</b> but a cartilaginous sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It has been used as the basis for a distinct species, A. bavarica, but more recent studies suggest it belongs to A. siemensii.|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} arch may insert {{into the}} tendon of the pectoralis major muscle, the fascia of the coracobrachialis muscle, or the fascia covering the biceps brachii muscle. Insertion into the pectoralis major muscle proper, the long {{head of the}} biceps brachii muscle, the <b>coracoid</b> process, the pectoralis minor muscle, the axillary fascia and to the bone at {{the crest of the}} greater tubercle of the humerus inserting distal to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle have all been reported.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a <b>coracoid.</b> Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
50|$|Eoalulavis hoyasi {{presents}} numerous synapomorphies that {{justifies the}} inclusion of the taxon within Enantiornithes and the less inclusive clade Euenantiornithes. These traits include a groove in the inter-osseous surface of radius or a conspicuous foramen in the dorsal surface of the strut-like <b>coracoids.</b>|$|R
50|$|The single fossil is an {{incomplete}} semi-articulated skeleton {{the size of}} a sparrow. It includes both feet, the right leg, the sternum, part of the right arm, and fragmentary <b>coracoids</b> and pubes. Its accession number is IVPP11303. It is {{in the collection of the}} Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing. It has advanced flight, perching, and respiratory adaptations like a long, deeply keeled sternum, a pair of anterolateral processes on the sternum near the articulations with the <b>coracoids,</b> fused, short, metatarsals, and highly curved pedal claws indicating good perching ability. Hou et al. (1996) described the metatarsals as fused only distally, but Zhou and Hou (2002) revised this analysis, finding that the metatarsus was fused distally and proximally, but not along most of the length.|$|R
50|$|The genus Callichthys can {{be readily}} {{distinguished}} from other callichthyids by having the <b>coracoids</b> covered by skin and not exposed ventrally, the infraorbital bones also covered by skin, and the head highly depressed with less than 75% of the cleithral width (except sometimes in mature males).|$|R
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to <b>coracoid</b> attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, <b>coracoid,</b> and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{is reasonably}} complete {{and includes a}} partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull {{is only the second}} skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum. Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula (shoulder blade) and <b>coracoid</b> (which sits on {{the lower end of the}} scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires.|$|E
50|$|The scapula {{contains}} a prominent glenoid labrum and tapers backward, ending as thin rods. The <b>coracoids</b> are slightly concave anteriorly and are {{separate from the}} scapulae dorsally. They also stick out from the neck on either side. Gobipteryx's clavicles curve {{in a way that}} is consistent with that of other birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{specimens}} of Fendusaurus include mostly crushed vertebrae, along with appendicular elements. They are distinguishable from Ammosaurus by the morphology {{of both the}} ilium and sacral vertebrae. However, in some specimens, the morphology of the femora and <b>coracoids</b> are quite different, which led Fedak to speculate {{that more than one}} species may have been present.|$|R

5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The <b>coracoid</b> was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The <b>coracoid</b> was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
25|$|FMNHP25107, the holotype of {{both the}} genus Brachiosaurus and the species B. altithorax, {{consists}} of the right humerus (upper arm bone), the right femur (thigh bone), the right ilium (a hip bone), the right <b>coracoid</b> (a shoulder bone), the sacrum (fused vertebrae of the hip), the last seven thoracic (trunk) and two caudal (tail) vertebrae, {{and a number of}} ribs. Riggs described the <b>coracoid</b> as from {{the left side of the}} body, but restudy has shown it to be a right <b>coracoid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its {{relationships}} are unresolved, mainly {{due to the}} paucity of material. While the material {{is not enough to}} be assessed by wide-scale cladistic analysis, it has been quantitatively compared to other avian <b>coracoids.</b> The bone looks decidedly neornithine, and most similar to Charadriiformes especially. It is not certain that this clade was already distinct by the Maastrichtian.|$|R
50|$|The {{incomplete}} skeleton, {{which was}} found in 1975 by the palaeontologist Storrs L. Olson, consists of both <b>coracoids</b> and the left femur. It is presumed to have become extinct soon after Saint Helena was discovered and colonized in 1502, due {{to a combination of}} habitat destruction and the introduction of predators such as black rats and domestic cats.|$|R
5000|$|Paleontologists believe Yuzhoupliosaurus to {{have been}} approximatively 4 meters long. The lower jaw {{contains}} five pairs of large teeth and 23 or 24 smaller teeth. The cervical vertebra are considered [...] "high and short". The anterior cervical ribs are double-headed while the posterior cervical ribs are single-headed. The <b>coracoids</b> are elongated and the clavicles are well developed.|$|R
25|$|At birth, a {{large part}} of the scapula is osseous, but the glenoid cavity, the <b>coracoid</b> process, the acromion, the {{vertebral}} border and the inferior angle are cartilaginous. From the 15th to the 18th month after birth, ossification takes place in the middle of the <b>coracoid</b> process, which as a rule becomes joined with the rest of the bone about the 15th year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fossil}} therapsids, a third bone, the true <b>coracoid,</b> formed {{just behind the}} procoracoid. The {{resulting}} three-boned structure is still seen in modern monotremes, but in all other living mammals, the procoracoid has disappeared, and the <b>coracoid</b> bone has fused with the scapula, to become the <b>coracoid</b> process. These changes {{are associated with the}} upright gait of mammals, compared with the more sprawling limb arrangement of reptiles and amphibians; the muscles formerly attached to the procoracoid are no longer required. The altered musculature is also responsible for the alteration {{in the shape of the}} rest of the scapula; the forward margin of the original bone became the spine and acromion, from which the main shelf of the shoulder blade arises as a new structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle of ichthyosaurs {{is not much}} modified from its original condition. Some basal forms show a hatchet- or crescent-shaped shoulder blade or scapula; derived forms have an elongated blade positioned on a broader base. The scapula is not fused with the <b>coracoid</b> into a scapulocoracoid, indicating that the forces exerted on the {{shoulder girdle}} were moderate. The shoulder joint is positioned {{on the border between}} the scapula and the <b>coracoid.</b> Both coracoids are fused on their common midline. The <b>coracoid</b> shape is very variable, but usually it is rather low. The upper part of the shoulder girdle is formed by two long and slender clavicles, crowned by a central interclavicular bone that is large and triangular with basal forms, small and T-shaped in Jurassic species. Breast bones or sterna are absent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle is only partly known but {{appears to be}} typical for plesiosaurs. It includes fused clavicles at the anterior end, scapulae (shoulder blades), and large <b>coracoids.</b> The scapulae and <b>coracoids</b> both contribute to the glenoids (arm sockets). A pair of oval holes called pectoral fenestrae are found midway along the scapular/coracoid contacts. The forelimbs are elongate and relatively narrow compared to those of most plesiosaurs. The humerus (upper arm bone) has distinctive curvature, {{which appears to be}} a retained primitive feature among sauropterygians. Mature Plesiosaurus also have a distinctive groove along the ventral surface of the humerus. The forearm includes a flat, broad, crescent-shaped ulna and a [...] "robust and pillar-like" [...] radius. The wrist includes six bones. The hand paddle has five digits; the phalangeal formula is uncertain, but the count for one large individual, from [...] "thumb" [...] to fifth [...] "finger", is 4-8-9-8-6.|$|R
50|$|Paracrax {{is known}} {{from a variety}} of materials, such as pelvises, keels, forelimb {{elements}} and <b>coracoids.</b> The humerus material is distinct from the closely related Bathornis by an internal condyle that is less distinctively raised in relation to the external condyle. Overall, it can be assumed that it had similar proportions to phorusrhacids, with proportionally short wings and a large, deep bill.|$|R
