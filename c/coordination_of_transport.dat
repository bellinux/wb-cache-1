This is done by creating optimization models for both separate and coordinated transports, based on previously completed order tables, and comparing the results. The final results show at best a 13 % improvement in driving distance and a 7 % improvement in driver work time, which transfers into 172 000 SEK savings yearly and significant reductions in CO 2 -emissions while easing workload during high intensity days. Changes in the transport fleet might increase this to up to 272 000 SEK while possibly further reducing emissions but without creating significant increase in workload for drivers...|$|R

40|$|While, undoubtedly, {{there are}} some {{development}} challenges {{that need to be}} tackled globally, it must be recognized that many Financing for Development issues are more effectively dealt with at the regional level. An example of this is the provision of public goods and services needed for development that are not provided by the market or by national governments in the absence of external assistance—regional health programs to contain endemic diseases, <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure among neighboring countries, regional energy cooperation, and financial regulation to limit cross-border contagion, to name but some of the challenges in point. The Regional Development Banks (RDBs) have a central role to play in the provision of these “regional public goods ” (RPGs).

40|$|This paper briefly {{discusses}} inter-modal <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> {{services from}} a perspective {{of what could}} be called "diversity-based mobility policy". It examines the framework conditions for inter-modal competition and coordination under an approach to transport policy making that reflects the broad variety of mobility needs and aspirations in market economies and reflects the social opportunity costs of alternative ways of addressing the demand for mobility. The paper discusses integrated land-use planning and transport policy making, the importance of institutional frameworks for integrated transport planning and the fiscal framework for inter-modal competition, including in relation to external costs. Competition for resources between freight and passenger services is considered as well as truly inter-modal issues.

Here, we show that Pik 1 p binds to the redundant 14 - 3 - 3 proteins Bmh 1 p and Bmh 2 p. We provide evidence that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Pik 1 p involves phosphorylation and that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins bind Pik 1 p in the cytoplasm. Nutrient deprivation results in relocation of Pik 1 p from the Golgi to the nucleus and increases the amount of Pik 1 p– 14 - 3 - 3 complex, a process reversed upon restored nutrient supply.
