40|$|This paper {{presents}} the alternatives available to support threadprivate data in OpenMP and evaluates them. We show how current compilation systems rely on <b>custom</b> <b>techniques</b> for implementing thread-local data. But {{in fact the}} ELF binary specification currently supports data sections that become threadprivate by default. ELF naming for such areas is Thread-Local Storage (TLS). Our experiments demonstrate that implementing threadprivate based on the TLS support is very easy, and more efficient. This proposal goes in the same line as the future implementation of OpenMP on the GNU compiler collection. In addition, our experience {{with the use of}} threadprivate in OpenMP applications shows that usually it is better to avoid it. This is because threadprivate variables reside in common blocks and they impede the compiler to fully optimize the code. So it is better to keep threadprivate as a temporary technique only to ease porting MPI codes to OpenMP. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Most {{biomedical}} research databases contain considerable amounts of time-oriented data. However, temporal {{knowledge about the}} contextual meaning of such data is not usually represented in a principled fashion. As a result, investigators must often develop <b>custom</b> <b>techniques</b> for temporal data analysis {{that are difficult to}} reuse. We addressed this problem by developing a set of knowledgedriven methods and tools for temporally representing and querying biomedical data, and have integrated them using a mediator approach. A central issue driving our work is a need to integrate temporal representations of data in relational databases with the domain-specific semantics of temporal patterns used in querying. This paper presents a formal temporal knowledge model using the Semantic Web ontology and rule languages, OWL and SWRL, respectively. The model informs the mediator of the temporal semantics used for data analysis. We show that our approach provides the computational foundation for much-needed software to make sense of complex temporal patterns in two {{biomedical research}} domains...|$|R

Many existing algorithms have been highly optimized [...] one example being Felsenstein's PHYLIP code, written in C, for UPGMA and Neighbor Joining algorithms. However, the ability to process {{more than a few}} tens of taxa in a reasonable amount of time using conventional computers has not yielded a satisfactory speedup in data processing, making it difficult for Phylogenetics practitioners to quickly explore data sets [...] such as might be done from a laptop computer. In this paper, we discuss the application of <b>Custom</b> Computing <b>techniques</b> to Phylogenetics. In particular, we apply this technology to speed up UPGMA algorithm execution by a factor of a hundred, against that of PHYLIP code running on the same PC.

In 32. 8 % of all tests, the average accuracy of the least complex method is better than that of the most advanced method at less than 0. 3 % the hardware overhead.

Whether streaming media files, constructing an overlay or picking a candidate server to download from, applications need to provide a good user experience. What constitutes a good user experience differs for each application but what is common is the need to discover and adapt to the current conditions of the network path. This is especially important since, due to the design of the Internet, network routers do not provide any feedback about these network properties. Measurement is typically performed in one of three ways: (1) actively, by injecting specially crafted probe packets into the network, (2) passively, by observing existing data traffic, and (3) customized, where applications use use their own traffic to perform customized measurements. All current approaches suffer from drawbacks. Passive techniques are efficient but are constrained by the shape of the existing traffic, limiting the speed and accuracy of their measurements. Active techniques are faster, more accurate and more flexible but impose a significantly higher overhead by competing with applica-tions for bandwidth.

30|$|Cooperative sensor {{actuation}} and event disambiguation: The CPS event processing {{engine is}} required to react to events quickly, e.g., notification about an unauthorized individual’s entry in a surveillance scenario is much more valuable seconds after entry as opposed to minutes after he has already left the premises. This requires applying complex processing operators on high volume data; information extraction tasks such as person identification from multimedia surveillance data is difficult in resource-constrained environments where I/O storage limitations, transmission delay, bandwidth restrictions, and packet losses may prevent the capture of high quality data. The ability to exploit semantics (of content, deployment, application, users) can help in enhancing information quality {{in the presence of}} such resource limitations. Recent work on camera networks suggests that a probabilistic model based on extracted semantics can predict where events of interest will occur and dedicate scarce resources accordingly [38]; this will help meet compute limitations without sacrificing event detection accuracy. However, the ability to increase dependability of one event may come at the cost of increased uncertainty about other activities that the sensor could have captured. For example, activating zoom capabilities to collect high-resolution facial images will imply temporary loss of “pan” capability which can capture potential events (albeit at lower resolutions) elsewhere in the coverage area of the camera sensor. While <b>custom</b> <b>techniques</b> can be designed, addressing information uncertainty with large numbers of devices is challenging.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: In {{a larger}} effort, we are {{studying}} methods {{to improve the}} specificity of the diagnosis of breast cancer by combining complementary information from multiple imaging modalities (PET, pre- and post-contrast MRI, Ultrasound, and Digital Mammography). Merging information is important {{for a number of}} reasons. For example, the determination of functional and corresponding anatomical locations in images from various modalities is necessary {{to determine the extent of}} disease. Furthermore, the time course of contrast uptake values are an indication of malignancy so the reduction of the influence of motion artifacts is important as well. To facilitate this fusion of multimodal information, image registration (alignment) becomes necessary. In this work, we describe our efforts to register 3 D breast images from PET and MRI. Methods: PET images are acquired with the patient in the supine position by a GSO-based Philips Allegro system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA) and are reconstructed using 3 D RAMLA with voxel sizes of 4 x 4 x 4 mm. Images sizes are typically 144 x 144 x(45 to 170) slices (for breast or whole body scans, respectively). A 10 µCi/gram dose of FDG adjusted for patient weight is injected. Both transmission and emission images are acquired. Prone breast MRI images are acquired by a GE Signa 1. 5 T scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI).
