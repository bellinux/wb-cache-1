Because of this, the Amazons agreed to give Hippolyta her royal title back, and followed her instructions to invade Washington, D.C. which brought about the events of Amazons Attack. Artemis and Philippus were assigned to oversee the battle, but soon lost faith in Hippolyta when they discovered some of her actions against Man's World proved to be less honorable. Due to their failure to follow-through in stopping Hippolyta during the war, a disguised Granny Goodness cursed all of the Amazons by erasing their memories and scattering them across the globe with false personas.

However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E
5000|$|While {{many groups}} protested against Stead's imprisonment, {{it seemed that}} he was treated well in prison. [...] "Never had I a pleasanter holiday, a more charming season of repose", he {{afterwards}} would say. In Holloway as a [...] "first class misdemeanant" [...] {{he had his own}} room with an open fire and a fellow prisoner as a servant to tend to him. His wife and children were allowed in for Christmas. Madame Mourez died in jail. Jarrett survived six months with hard labour. While in prison, he continued to edit the Pall Mall Gazette, and his Christmas card played up his martyrdom. Ever the self-publicist, Stead wrote a threepenny pamphlet of his prison experience soon after his release. He asked the prison governor whether he could keep his prison uniform (although he spent much of his sentence in ordinary <b>civilian</b> street <b>clothes).</b> The governor agreed, and thereafter, every 10 November, the anniversary of his conviction, Stead would dress up in his prison garb to remind people of his [...] "triumph".|$|R
500|$|At 20:00, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in {{a meeting}} {{organized}} by the Americans, and insisted Khánh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-coup forces swept into the city. Whether the rebels were defeated or a deal was struck with Kỳ to end the revolt in exchange for Khánh's removal is disputed. According to the latter version, Thảo and Phát agreed [...] to free {{the members of the}} Armed Forces Council whom they had arrested and to withdraw in exchange for Khánh's complete removal from power. Thảo and Phát were given an appointment with the figurehead chief of state, Sửu, who was under the close control of the junta, to [...] "order" [...] him to sign a decree stripping Khánh of the leadership of the military. Before fleeing, Phát changed into <b>civilian</b> [...] <b>clothes</b> and made a broadcast stating [...] "We have capitulated", before leaving with Colonel Tôn, who had also participated in his September 1964 coup attempt.

Danny is immediately enamored of Frederica Burkhardt (Cornell Borchers), an attractive German war widow chosen to thank him {{on behalf of the}} women of Berlin. When a news correspondent covering the ceremony recruits Danny for a public relations stunt, Danny jumps at the opportunity as a means of getting a pass in Berlin and seeing Frederica again. During a tour of the city, Danny's uniform is accidentally covered with poster paste, forcing him to wear <b>civilian</b> working <b>clothes</b> until it is cleaned. They meet Hank and his [...] "Schatzi", the friendly and intelligent Gerda, at a night club, where Hank is rude to Frederica and treats Gerda as an inferior. Hank chances to see the former prison guard who tortured him as a POW, and beats him nearly to death. Danny is able to stop Hank only by knocking him down. Mistaken for a German attacking Hank, he is chased into the Soviet occupation zone by military police.|$|R
5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included a shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop training, a shortage of weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping Allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory.|$|E

Dressed in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> he was initially treated with suspicion but soon convinced the Americans of his identity. He borrowed an American uniform and went forward to the frontline with the 44th Infantry Division and assisted in the capture of three villages and rounding up of German POWs.

50|$|They pick up Erika {{from work}} to change Holtz's {{appearance}} {{to make him look}} younger. As they arrive at the derelict courthouse, they change Holtz from Maar's borrowed <b>civilian</b> street <b>clothes</b> into a replica of his old Nazi party uniform. Holtz is escorted into a courtroom furnished to look like a Third Reich office. Once inside the sedative wears off, he awakens to find himself in a staged meeting, with Schmidt disguised as Adolf Hitler, Sly disguised as an SS officer, and Ernst disguised as a Field Marshal. Schmidt states that Holtz stole the gold from the Reich and betrayed him. Holtz is confused about what Schmidt is referring to and asks what gold was stolen. Schmidt tells Holtz that the gold disappeared only seven days ago, and confirms that Holtz signed the order to have it deposited into the Reich Bank. Ernst escorts Holtz into another room to refresh his memory. Sly and Schmidt congratulate each other on their performances, while Ernst tells Holtz that Germany is winning the war and Holtz has been hospitalised. Holtz remembers that the gold was hidden to prevent Hermann Göring from stealing it. He will only tell Hitler the exact location, though. Holtz whispers to Schmidt (still disguised as Hitler) that the gold is hidden in his bunker, which is on the property of his summer home in Vanglitz. Holtz is given another sedative, while Schmidt admires a portrait of Hitler, comparing his likeness to it. Sly congratulates Schmidt, and Harry sarcastically says that they should do a double act with himself as Benito Mussolini. Schmidt gets carried away with his acting, while Ernst is worried Holtz may recognize the scam, and that their cover can still be blown by him reporting the incident to the prison guards. Sly proposes to return Holtz {{first thing in the morning}} before going after the gold, but Harry refuses to wait, worried that it could be found by anyone at any time.|$|R
25|$|The {{culmination}} of the FYOP is the obstacle course. The obstacle course lasts over 2 hours and consists of twelve obstacles built by each squadron located around the college grounds. Obstacles such as a 12-foot wall and rope bridge are designed to test teamwork and physical fitness of First Years. The First Year flights are judged on {{the time it takes}} to complete each obstacle. The completion of the obstacle course signals the end of FYOP. Afterwards, First Years are given a parade where they are officially welcomed into RMC and join the Cadet Wing. Cadets are then allowed to see their friends and relatives, and are allowed the freedom to leave college grounds. In previous years cadets were required to wear their College uniform when leaving the college grounds, but as of 2017 this rule has been modified; cadets can now wear <b>civilian</b> business casual <b>clothes.</b> When attending formal events, the college uniform worn is the number 4s. This form of dress consists of dark blue pants with a red stripe down the side and a dark blue tunic. Badges can be put on both arms once earned. The year is also represented on the lower arms by red ribbon; however, second year is the first to have any red ribbon.|$|R
5|$|In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> {{where they}} met with Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy.

Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer.

This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
5000|$|At the British {{ministry}} of defence, {{there is a}} realisation that the plane has picked up [...] "the wrong two monks". René and Edith are brought in and a man is being sent for to interpret {{between them and the}} ministry personnel. However, before he arrives, the two officers with them try to talk to them, but one of them cannot speak French and the other one speaks the same mangled kind of French that Crabtree does. Thus, René and Edith do not understand much of what they are saying and therefore do not answer them. This means that the communication between them does not work at all, until the interpreter arrives. When he does, it becomes somewhat of a surprise, both to him and to René and Edith. He turns out to be none other than Colonel von Strohm's former assistant, Captain Hans Geering, whom they have not seen since their escape from the prison camp (in the episode Prisoners of War) and heard since his message on the radio (in the episode Camp Dance). When they are alone, Hans tells René and Edith, that he has now become a [...] "neutralised Englishman" [...] after three months of brainwash and is now a British citizen. He also says he knows that René is [...] "Nighthawk", the hero of the resistance. He also has to interrogate them a little, just for show. When the two officers rejoin them, Hans tells them that there was a [...] "cockup" [...] in France and that the British airmen were not there, when they were to be picked up. René and Edith tried to tell them this, but were dragged into the plane and flown off to England. However, the officers are vary pleased to hear that René is [...] "Nighthawk". As they hear that Winston Churchill wants to see them right away, they are dressed in <b>civilian</b> gentleman's <b>clothes,</b> which were standing by for Fairfax and Carstairs. When Hans tells the two of them that Churchill wants to see them and probably wants to give them a medal, they are not very happy about it, since medals are the last thing they need.|$|R
5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The Guides were disbanded in January 1862 {{after the}} Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky fled Bowling Green, as Hines {{did not want}} to fight anywhere except in Kentucky.

John Hunt Morgan, and he re-enlisted in the army as a private in the 9th Kentucky Cavalry in May 1862. Morgan recognized Hines' talents and commissioned him as a captain on June 10, 1862. Afterward, Hines {{spent most of his time}} engaged in secret missions in his beloved Kentucky. Dressed in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> he usually operated alone to avoid drawing attention to himself, not wanting to be executed as a spy.|$|E
5|$|The three Scottish soldiers' killings was an {{incident}} {{that took place in}} Northern Ireland during the Troubles. It happened on 10 March 1971, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were killed off-duty and in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> having been lured from a city-centre bar in Belfast, driven to a remote location and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside.

These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman– who was in <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> and unrecognised by the troops holding them– was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E
5|$|The Huks {{began their}} anti-Japanese {{campaign}} as five 100-man units. They obtained needed {{arms and ammunition}} from Philippine army stragglers, which were escapees from the Battle of Bataan and deserters from the Philippine Constabulary, in exchange of <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> The Huk recruitment campaign progressed more slowly than Taruc had expected, due to competition with U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE) guerrilla units in enlisting new soldiers. The U.S. units already had recognition among the islands, had trained military leaders, and an organized command and logistical system. Despite being restrained by the American sponsored guerrilla units, the Huks nevertheless took to the battlefield with only 500 men and much fewer weapons. Several setbacks {{at the hands of}} the Japanese and with less than enthusiastic support from USAFFE units did not hinder the Huks growth in size and efficiency throughout the war, developing into a well trained, highly organized force with some 15,000 armed fighters by war's end. The Huks attacked both the Japanese and other non-Huk guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Allied airmen {{who were}} {{captured}} after being {{shot down over}} Japan were mistreated. On 8September 1944, the Cabinet of Japan directed that indiscriminate bombing constituted a war crime despite the fact there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft at the time. As a result, captured Allied airmen were subject to trial and possible execution although the rules of war stipulates that only soldiers who engaged in combat or carry out acts of sabotage or espionage wearing enemy uniforms or <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> behind enemy lines can be punished. The frequency of such executions differed between military districts, however. While no airmen were executed in the Tōbu district (eastern Musashi), which included Tokyo, those captured in the Tōkai, Chūbu and Seibu (western Musashi) districts were sometimes killed after a brief trial or summarily executed by the Kempeitai ("Military Police Corps"). For instance, 33 American airmen were killed by IJA personnel at Fukuoka, including 15 who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on 15 August. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the men into custody. In addition to these killings, most captured B-29 crewmen were brutally interrogated by the Kempeitai.|$|E
