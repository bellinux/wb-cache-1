40|$|AbstractTransient {{entrainment}} {{was used}} to test the hypotheses that 1) procainamide prolongs the cycle length of ventricular tachycardia in patients with coronary artery disease because it has a preferential effect on the reentrant tachycardia circuit, and 2) regions of slow conduction in the reentrant circuit are more susceptible to the effect of procainamide than are other areas of the ventricles. In five patients with prior myocardial infarction, sustained ventricular tachycardia with identical QRS configuration was inducible before and after intravenous infusion of procainamide. Transient entrainment of ventricular tachycardia was demonstrated at two or more cycle lengths by rapid pacing in the baseline state and after procainamide. Rapid pacing was performed from the same site during sinus rhythm at the cycle lengths that demonstrated transient entrainment of ventricular tachycardia. The <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> to the transiently entrained site during ventricular tachycardia (orthodromic interval) was compared with the <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> to the same site during pacing in sinus rhythm (antidromic interval). The mean tachycardia cycle length increased by 27 % after procainamide administration (p = 0. 002). The antidromic conduction intervals were prolonged by 9 % (p = 0. 06) compared with a 28 % increase in the mean orthodromic <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> (p = 0. 002). The difference between the orthodromic and antidromic conduction intervals increased by 40 % (p = 0. 003). Prolongation of the tachycardia cycle length after procainamide administration correlated positively with increases in the orthodromic conduction intervals (r = 0. 94, p = 0. 02) but not with changes in the antidromic intervals (r = − 0. 08, p = NS). The effect of procainamide on the difference between orthodromic and antidromic conduction intervals correlated strongly with changes in the cycle length of venetricular tachycardia (r = 0. 97 p = 0. 006). Thus, procainamide has a preferential effect on the reentrant circuit of ventricular tachycardia compared with other areas of ventricular myocardium. In addition, these results are compatible with the hypothesis that the effect of procainamide is more marked in regions of conduction delay in the reentrant circuit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract Mutations of {{the cardiac}} {{transcription}} factor NKX 2 - 5 cause hypoplastic {{development of the}} AV node and conduction block. How the anatomy of the mutant AV node relates to its function is unknown. We thus studied conduction through the AV nodal region in ex vivo preparations of wild-type and Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) mouse hearts in which the central conduction system was highlighted by a transgenic Cx 40 -eGFP reporter. Fluorescence imaging guided electrode placement and pacing of the inferior and superior approaches to the AV node. Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) hearts had a prolonged atrio-His interval compared to the wild type, consistent with previous in vivo observations. The conduction time to the His bundle from the Cx 40 (-) AV nodal region that is superior to and immediately adjacent to the Cx 40 (+) lower node is slightly, but not significantly greater in Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) than wild-type hearts. A novel phenotype was also observed. Pacing the Cx 40 (-) inferior approach to the AV node with increasing stimulus strength led to progressive shortening of the stimulus-to-His <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> in wild-type but not Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) hearts. The strength of pacing at the Cx 40 (-) superior approach {{had no effect on}} the <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> in either group. The prolonged AV delay in the Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) heart appears to arise before the Cx 40 (+) lower node. Whether the pacing phenotype explains the mutant's conduction defect is uncertain, but the observation adds to a number of unique properties of the inferior approach to the AV node...|$|E

A more streamlined modeling procedure is proposed {{which serves as a}} general framework for comparing different models. A duty ratio constraint that defines the diode <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> is identified to be the key to accurate prediction of high-frequency behavior. A new duty-ratio constraint is proposed that leads to full-order averaged models of DCM converters. Numerical analyses and experimental measurements confirm that the new models correctly predict the small-signal responses up to one third of the switching frequency and are more accurate than all previous models. Moreover, new analytical results are included to show the origin of the high-frequency pole in DCM operation and to explain why the full-order model is capable of accurately predicting it. Averaged circuit counterparts of the new models are developed in the form of averaged switch models to facilitate circuit simulation.

40|$|Using His bundle {{recording}} techniques, {{we examined}} direct and autonomically mediated conduction system effects of quinidine in five cardiac transplant recipients who have anatomically denervated hearts. We made control <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> and refractory period measurements, and then infused 10 mg/kg quinidine gluconate over a 20 -min period. At 30 min, we determined the electrophysiologic changes induced by quinidine. Quinidine significantly increased the atrial-His (AH) interval (from 97 +/- 9 [SEM] to 108 +/- 7 ms, P less than 0. 001), the His-ventricular (HV) inteval (from 43. 9 +/- 1 to 52. 8 +/- 3 ms, P less than 0. 01), the donor heart sinus cycle length (from 599 +/- 38 to 630 +/- 56 ms, P less than 0. 08), and the atrial {{effective refractory period}} (from 214 +/- 14 to 241 +/- 11 ms, P less than 0. 01). Quinidine significantly decreased the innervated, remnant atrial sinus cycle length (from 847 +/- 104 to 660 +/- 96 ms, P less than 0. 01) and the blood pressure. The mean plasma concentration of quinidine {{at the time that}} electrophysiologic measurements were repeated was 4. 37 +/- 0. 449 micrograms/ml.

40|$|The role of {{autonomic}} tone on antegrade atrioventricular nodal (AVN) conduction {{was assessed}} in 8 pts (7 f, 1 m, 52 ± 11 yrs) with common type AVN reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) {{before and after}} radiofrequency current (RFC) ablation of the slow pathway (SP). AVN conduction curves and refractoriness (ref) were analyzed during baseline and following i. v. administration of propranolol (0. 2 mg/kg) and atropine (0. 04 mg/kg) before (day 1) and after RFC ablation (day 2). During pre-ablation baseline state, curves consistent with two antegrade AVN conduction pathways were observed in 4 pts and with three pathways in 3 pts. Autonomic blockade (AB) produced new dual patterns in 1 pt and annulled them in 2 / 7 pts, preventing from inducibility of AVNRT observed during baseline in 1; AVN ref was either unaffected (5 pts), markedly prolonged (2 pts) or shortened (1 pt), with nonpredictable changes of atrium-to-hissian (A-H) <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> curves. After RFC ablation, AVNRT inducibility was abolished in all pts and dual AVN physiology in all but 1 pt during baseline; ref of the fast pathway (FP) was reduced in 4 n pts. AB after RFC exposed dual AVN physiology in another pt in whom also changes in AVN ref and AH interval curves were produced. ConclusionsData from {{this study suggest that}} the electrophysiologic substrate of AVNRT is more complex than the one defined by a dual pathway.

40|$|An {{association}} among premature ventricular complexes on routine electrocardiogram, elevated right ventricular {{systolic pressure}} and sudden death after repair of tetralogy of Fallot was previously reported. To examine this relation further, noninvasive, hemodynamic and in-vasive electrophysiologic data were studied in 27 {{patients who had}} undergone repair of tetralogy of Fallot 7 months to 21 years (mean 1. 75 years) previously. Syncope, which had occurred in four patients, was not significantly related to ventricular arrhythmia on rest electrocardiogram, 24 hour electrocardiogram or treadmill test. AH four patients with syncope had either nonsustained (two patients) or sustained (two patients) ventricular tachycardia induced at electrophysiologic study. His bundle to ventricle <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> was prolonged in two patients and Q to right ventricular apex interval was prolonged {{in three of the}} four patients. AH four had abnormal anatomic or hemodynamic findings: two had a right ventricular systolic pressure of 70 mm Hg or more, one had right ventricular dysfunction with tricuspid insufficiency and one a septal aneurysm. The 9 patients with induced nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia were then compared with the 15 patients without induced ventricular arrhythmias. Those with ventricular tachycardia had a greater prevalence of: more complex ventricular arrhythmia on 24 hour electrocardiogram (63 versus 0 %, p < 0. 001), long His bundle to ventricle interval (44 versus 0 %, p < 0. 001), right ventricular systolic pressure of 70 mm Hg or more (56 versus 0 %, p < 0. 01) and reduced right ventricular ejection fraction (33 versus 7 %, p < 0. 025). It is concluded that: 1) induction of nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia was associated with a history of syncope; 2) all patients at risk for syncope could not be identified by routine electrocardiogram 24 hour electrocardiogram or treadmill test; 3) hemodynamic alterations may interact with intraventricular conduction abnormalities and predispose to ventricular tachycardia...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{in a series of}} 105 cases of pneumonia, 95 of which we have {{selected}} as available for statistical study, that digitalis given by mouth has an action on the heart. We have judged this action to be present because changes occurred in the auriculoventricular conduction time and {{in the form of the}} T wave of the electrocardiogram, just as they do in the non-febrile heart. This conclusion is strengthened by finding that the pulse rate in fibrillating and fluttering cases fell in the presence of fever, exactly as it does in non-febrile cases. The dose and the time required to produce these effects are given and are the same as in the non-febrile cases. When there was a difference in the amount necessary to produce one or the other of the changes, it was found that the T wave is more often and more readily affected than the <b>conduction</b> <b>interval.</b> We have shown that the intoxication due to pneumonia is probably not responsible for the changes found, both from a study of the statistics and because in the control cases reverse tendencies were often found (that is, decrease in conduction time and increase in the size of the T wave). We have shown that the method of selection in consequence of which we treated a large number of severe cases did not prejudice our results, because it could be demonstrated that the proximity of death, whether in control or treated cases, was not necessarily associated with the changes we are describing. We have also, by referring to the literature of the subject, brought evidence to show that heart muscle does not undergo those changes in pneumonia, as it does in other infectious diseases, which would lead one to expect changes in conduction found in other diseases. The changes in conduction which have been reported by others were almost entirely associated with the giving of digitalis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives—To {{examine the}} effect of {{isoprenaline}} on slow and fast pathway properties and tachycardia initiation.  Design—Consecutive patients, prospective study.  Setting—Referral centre for cardiology, academic hospital.  Patients— 24 patients suffering from common type atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT).  Interventions—Programmed electrical stimulation and radiofrequency catheter ablation of the slow pathway.  Measurements and main results—AVNRT was induced before and after the administration of isoprenaline in nine patients (group 1), before isoprenaline only in five (group 2), and after isoprenaline only in 10  (group 3). The anterograde effective refractory period of the fast pathway was prolonged significantly during isoprenaline administration in group 1  (405  (31) v 335  (34)  ms, p <  0. 001) and shortened in group 2  (308  (57) v 324  (52)  ms, p =  0. 005). There was also significant shortening in group 3  (346  (85) v 395  (76)  ms, p <  0. 001). Isoprenaline administration did not result in a significant change of the anterograde effective refractory period of the slow pathway in groups 1  and 3, but eliminated slow pathway conduction in group 2.  Isoprenaline significantly shortened the minimal and maximal atrial to His bundle <b>conduction</b> <b>interval</b> recording in response to each extrastimulus of the slow pathway (210  (24) v 267  (25)  ms, p <  0. 001 and 275 (25) v 328  (25)  ms, p <  0. 001, respectively) in group 1  and significantly prolonged these intervals (331  (34) v 274  (34)  ms and 407  (33) v 351  (33)  ms, respectively) in group 3.  In all groups only minimal changes in the refractory period of the atrium occurred after isoprenaline administration. The effect of isoprenaline was also measured on the ventricular effective refractory period and on the minimal and maximal length of the ventriculoatrial (V 2 -A 2) interval during ventricular pacing. Isoprenaline did not result in a significant change of the ventricular effective refractory period in groups 1  and 2  nor of the shortest and longest V 2 -A 2 interval. In group 3, however, the ventricular effective refractory period and the shortest and longest V 2 -A 2 interval shortened significantly after isoprenaline administration.  Conclusions—In group 1  isoprenaline did not affect inducibility of AVNRT because it prolonged the fast pathway refractory period without affecting slow pathway conduction. In group 2  isoprenaline shortened the fast pathway refractory period and appeared to abolish slow pathway conduction. Consequencely, isoprenaline prevented induction of AVNRT. In group 3  isoprenaline facilitated induction of AVNRT. This effect seemed primarily {{to be the result of}} shortening of retrograde refractoriness of the fast pathway with prolongation of slow pathway anterograde conduction and refractory period.    Keywords: atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia;  isoprenalin...|$|E

This article reviews {{the role of}} nutrients {{in the treatment of}} arrhythmias. Omega- 3 fish oils and arrhythmia It has been well documented that populations that have a high fish intake have a low incidence of coronary heart disease and death. 1 Omega- 3 oils have been demonstrated to reduce sudden death from ventricular fibrillation, presumably by stabilising the electrical activity at the cell membrane. Experimental in vitro and animal studies suggest that fish oil has direct cardiac electrophysiological effects. 2 In animal experiments infused fish oils slow heart rate (HR) and alter the QT interval, both HR and abnormal QT interval predict arrhythmic events in humans. 3 Mozaffarian et al 4 have previously shown that fish oil lowers HR. More recently the associations between usual consumption of fish and marine omega- 3 fish oil and electrocardiograph (ECG) measures among 5096 women and men aged 65 years and over enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) have been investigated. 5 The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if fish consumption could reduce the incidence of sudden death and atrial fibrillation possible related to antiarrhythmic effects.

Tuna/other fish intake was not associated with ventricular conduction (p = 0. 60). Findings were similar for estimated intake of marine n- 3 fatty acids: a 1 g/day higher intake was associated with 2. 3 beats/min lower heart rate (95 % CI = 0. 9 to 3. 7), 7. 6 ms longer PR interval (95 % CI = 3. 3 to 11. 9), and 46 % lower likelihood of prolonged QT (relative risk = 0. 54, 95 % CI = 0. 33 to 0. 88).

We have previously reported data, suggesting that atypical fast–slow and typical slow–fast AVNRT do not seem to use the same limb for fast conduc-tion. 12 This evidence, however, was derived by observations on typical and atypical tachycardias recorded in different patients. We are not aware of data on patients who have exhib-ited both typical and atypical tachycardia at the same study. We hypothesized that by comparing <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> dur-ing typical and atypical forms that occur in the same patient at the same study, we could gain insight into the properties of the fast and slow pathways, and the mechanisms responsible for atypical AVNRT...|$|R

40|$|Electrograms {{observed}} {{prior to}} successful and unsuccessful ablation trials in 33 patients (362 attempts) with manifest pathways and 18 patients (194 attempts) with concealed pathways {{were compared to}} identify the electrogram patterns {{that are associated with}} successful radiofrequency ablation of accessory atrioventricular connections in young patients (mean age 12. 7 years; range 4 – 22 years). Success was defined as permanent or transient interruption of conduction in the accessory connection. Predictors of success in patients with manifest pathways were local ventricular preexcitation (p = 0. 0001), left-sidedness (43 or 174) of the accessory connection compared (p = 0. 04) to right-sidedness (27 of 172), a probable Kent bundle potential (29 of 84 versus 39 of 256; p = 0. 0001), and short antegrade atrioventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> (53. 1 ± 31. 9 ms versus 64. 6 ± 32. 0 ms; p = 0. 02). Predictors of success in patients with concealed pathways were short ventriculoatrial conduction times (103. 3 ± 35. 8 ms versus 117. 9 ± 34. 8 ms; p = 0. 01), and left-sided (42 of 125) pathways (p = 0. 03; versus right-sided, 11 of 60). The presence of a Kent bundle potential was not significant. We conclude that specific electrogram patterns can predict successful ablation of either manifest or concealed accessory pathways.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{and analysis of}} several cationic ion channels and their associated genes have greatly improved {{our understanding of the}} molecular and cellular mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia. Our objective in {{this study was to examine}} the involvement of anionic ion channels in cardiac arrhythmia. We used a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. We used RNase protection and in situ hybridization assays to determine the level of CFTR expression, and radiotelemetry and in vivo electrophysiological study in combination with pharmacological intervention to analyse the cardiac function. Cardiac CFTR overexpression leads to stress-related sudden death in this model. In vivo intracardiac electrophysiological studies performed in anaesthetized mice showed no significant differences in baseline conduction parameters including atrial-His bundle (AH) or His bundle-ventricular (HV) <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals,</b> atrioventricular (AV) Wenckebach or 2 : 1 AV block cycle length and AV nodal functional refractory period. However, following isoproterenol administration, there was marked slowing of conduction parameters, including high-grade AV block in transgenic mice, with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia easily inducible using programmed stimulation or burst pacing. Our sudden death mouse model can be a valuable tool for investigation of the role of chloride channels in arrhythmogenesis and, potentially, for future evaluation of novel anti-arrhythmic therapeutic strategies and pharmacological agents. © 2011 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesIn {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node electrophysiology of endurance athletes and untrained individuals {{before and after}} autonomic pharmacologic blockade. BackgroundEndurance athletes present a higher prevalence of sinus bradycardia and AV conduction abnormalities, as compared with untrained individuals. Previous data from our laboratory suggest that nonautonomic factors {{may be responsible for}} the longer AV node refractory period found in well-trained athletes. MethodsSix aerobically trained male athletes and six healthy male individuals with similar ages and normal rest electrocardiograms were studied. Maximal oxygen uptake (o 2 max) was measured by cardiopulmonary testing. The sinus cycle length (SCL), AV <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals,</b> sinus node recovery time (SNRT), Wenckebach cycle (WC) and anterograde effective refractory period (ERP) of the AV node were evaluated by invasive electrophysiologic studies at baseline, after intravenous atropine (0. 04 mg/kg) and after addition of intravenous propranolol (0. 2 mg/kg). ResultsAthletes had a significantly higher o 2 max as compared with untrained individuals. The SCL was longer in athletes at baseline, after atropine and after the addition of propranolol for double-autonomic blockade. The mean maximal SNRT/SCL was longer in athletes after atropine and after propranolol. The WC and anterograde ERP of the AV node were longer in athletes at baseline, after atropine and after propranolol. ConclusionsUnder double-pharmacologic blockade, we demonstrated that sinus automaticity and AV node conduction changes of endurance athletes are related to intrinsic physiology and not to autonomic influences...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Loss-of-function sodium channelopathies {{manifest}} as {{a spectrum}} of diseases including Brugada syndrome (BrS) and cardiac conduction disease. OBJECTIVE To analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of these disorders in children. METHODS Patients aged 98 th percentile for age). RESULTS: Among the cohort (n = 33, age 6 +/- 5 years, 58 % male subjects, 30 % probands), 14 (42 %) patients were symptomatic, presenting with syncope (n = 5), palpitations (n = 1), supraventricular arrhythmias (n = 3), aborted cardiac arrest (n = 3), and sudden cardiac death (n = 2). Heart rate was 91 +/- 26 beats/min, PR interval 168 +/- 35 ms, QRS duration 112 +/- 20 ms, and heart-rate corrected QT interval 409 +/- 26 ms. <b>Conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> were prolonged in 28 (85 %) patients; 6 of these patients also had spontaneous type 1 BrS ECG. Eight fever-associated events occurred in 6 patients; 2 of these were vaccination-related fever episodes. Treatment included aggressive antipyretics during fever in all patients; antiarrhythmic treatment included implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (n = 4), pacemaker (n = 2), and beta-blockers, either alone (n = 3) or in combination with device (n = 2). During follow-up (4 +/- 4 years), 2 previously symptomatic patients had monomorphic ventricular tachycardia; there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of loss-of-function sodium channelopathies in children relies on cardiac symptoms, family history, and ECG. Fever and vaccination are potential arrhythmia triggers; conduction delay is the commonest finding on ECG. Beta-blockers {{have a role in}} preventing tachycardia-induced arrhythmias; implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should probably be reserved for severe case...|$|R
40|$|Filtered bipolar {{catheter}} electodes, I mm apart, {{were used}} to pace and record from the high right atrium, right ventricular apex, right ventricular outflow tract, right ventricular inflow tract, middle cardiac vein, great cardiac vein, and endocardium of the left ventricular septal surface. Right ventricular apex to middle cardiac vein and the middle cardiac vein to right ventricular apex <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> gave a rough estimate of anteroposterior and posteroanterior "transseptal plus free left ventricular wall" conduction times, respectively. On the other hand, the right ventricular apex to left ventricular septal surface and left ventricular septal surface to right ventricular apex intervals represented pure "transseptal" conduction times, since both sets of electrodes were {{in contact with the}} respective septal surface. During stimulation of the intermediately located right ventricular inflow tract propagation to the right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tract was longer than between these two sites. Moreover, conduction was almost as delayed to the right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tract as it was to the left ventricular septal surface. These findings were attributed to the peculiar electrophysiological behaviour of the right ventricular inflow tract muscle. Pacing from different segments of the great cardiac vein produced QRS morphologies and arrival of excitation patterns consistent with the relation between the anatomical location of this structure and the recording electrodes. However, from this study no inferences could be drawn regarding the conduction velocity or specific conduction pathways used by the stimulus in its journey from stimulating to recording areas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ectopic beats are {{frequently}} associated with morphologic repolarization alterations of ensuing sinus beats. Less {{is known about}} repolarization duration alterations of post-ectopic sinus beats. In one patient who developed long QT and torsades de pointes upon exposure to a class III antiarrhythmic drug, and was later genotyped as being a carrier for long QT syndrome (LQTS) type 1, review of a pre-drug Holter monitor study revealed marked QT prolongation of post-ectopic sinus beats. In wondering whether {{this might be a}} common clue to Ã¢Â€ÂœconcealedÃ¢Â€Â unexpressed LQTS, we realized that we must first characterize the range of post-ectopic QT prolongation present in normals. Prolongation beyond the upper limit of this range might then raise suspicion of possible LQTS and alter the antiarrhythmic drug selection process for the suppression of atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias. Methods: Accordingly, we assessed the presence/degree of repolarization prolongation following premature ectopic impulses in 166 subjects with normal <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> and normal repolarization on their resting 12 -lead ECG, 75 of whom had no known associated cardiovascular disorder of any kind. That is, in our subjects, the maximal prolongation of the QT interval of the sinus beat following isolated ventricular and atrial premature complexes was characterized. Results: QT prolongation is common in post ectopic sinus beats. However, in our subjects the uncorrected QT interval of post-ectopic sinus beats never exceeded 480 ms in duration [which was much shorter than that seen (510 - 590 ms) in our gene carrier]. Conclusions: The QT interval in normal subjects may prolong following premature complexes but not to a value in excess of 480 ms...|$|R
40|$|Objectives We {{have tested}} whether a genotype-phenotype {{relationship}} exists in Brugada syndrome (BS) {{by trying to}} distinguish BS patients with (carriers) and those without (non-carriers) a mutation in the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel (SCN 5 A) using clinical parameters. Background Brugada syndrome is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by a varying degree of ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and (non) specific conduction disorders. In a minority of patients, SCN 5 A mutations can be found. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated, but other causally related genes await identification. If a genotype-phenotype relationship exists, this might facilitate screening. Methods In a multi-center Study, we have collected data on demographics, clinical history, family history, c 1 cctrocardiograrn (ECG) parameters, His to ventricle interval (HV), and ECG parameters after pharmacologic challenge with I-NA blocking drugs for BS patients with (n= 23), or those without (n= 54), an identified SCN 5 A mutation. Results No {{differences were found in}} demographics, clinical history, or family history. Carriers had a significantly longer PQ interval on the baseline ECG and a significantly longer HV time. A PQ interval of {{greater than or equal to}} 210 ms and an HV interval greater than or equal to 60 ms seem to be predictive for the presence of an SCN 5 A initiation. After I-Na blocking drugs, carriers had significantly longer PQ and QRS intervals and more increase in QRS duration. Conclusions We observed significantly longer <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> on baseline ECG in patients with established SCN 5 A mutations (PQ and HV interval and, upon class I drugs, more QRS increase).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sudden {{cardiac death}} caused by ischemic {{ventricular}} fibrillation (VF) associated with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) {{is one of}} the most frequent causes of death. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics differ between STEMI patients with and without ischemic VF. METHODS: Fifty-five first STEMI patients with at least one 12 -lead ECG recorded before ischemic VF were compared with 110 first STEMI patients without ischemic VF. Patients with bundle branch blocks or high-degree atrioventricular blocks with escape rhythms were not included. ECG measurements were performed manually after scanning the ECG with the most prominent ST deviation into a software environment and magnifying it 4 times. RESULTS: Mean age was 57 +/- 12 years, and 126 patients were male. No differences were present between the VF and control group regarding baseline, enzymatic, and angiographic data. In left circumflex artery and right coronary artery myocardial infarction, a longer QRS interval (109 +/- 23 ms vs. 91 +/- 16 ms, P =. 02 and 107 +/- 24 ms vs. 93 +/- 19, P =. 02) was present. In the latter the PR interval (211 +/- 64 ms vs. 160 +/- 36 ms, P <. 001) and ST deviation score (3. 6 +/- 1. 0 mV vs. 1. 7 +/- 1. 5 mV, P <. 001) were also increased. In the left anterior descending artery group no differences in <b>conduction</b> <b>intervals</b> and ST deviation score were present. CONCLUSION: Longer PR and QRS intervals in right coronary artery and left circumflex artery MI fit with the perfusion and activation pattern of the atrioventricular node and the ventricular myocardium. Myocardium perfused by the left anterior descending artery is activated earliest, hiding any intraventricular conduction delay within the QRS complex. Intramural slowed conduction could be a substrate for ischemic V...|$|R
