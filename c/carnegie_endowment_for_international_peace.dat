40|$|Includes bibliographyPrólogo de José Antonio OcampoForeword At {{the start}} of the new decade, the debate on {{economic}} policy centres on the consequence of the reforms implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean in the last two decades. Trade and financial liberalization and the privatization of production activities have radically altered {{the rules of the game}} governing labour and business. The macroeconomic policy changes that accompanied or preceded the reforms sometimes strengthened the latter's specific objectives, especially the growth of exports, but on other occasions they had the opposite effect. That combination of factors prompted the emergence of new market structures and transformations in microeconomic behaviour. Assessing the effects of the reforms on economic growth, employment and income distribution is of more than academic interest. Governments, political parties and social actors require a thorough evaluation of the results, so as to devise or propose policies that complement the reforms or counter their unwanted consequences. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) actively participates in this process. This book is part of a project carried out by ECLAC, in conjunction with researchers from nine countries, to study the impact of the reforms. Directed by Dr. Barbara Stallings, the project has produced 14 books and 70 working papers. The summary appears in the first volume, entitled Growth, Employment and Equity: The Impact of the Economic Reforms in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is complemented by four issue-specific volumes analysing investment, technological change, employment and equity. Additionally, another nine country volumes examine the particular characteristics of the reforms in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Mexico and Peru. The working papers are available at ECLAC's web site (www. cepal. cl). One feature of the project that distinguishes it from other comparative studies of economic reform is that it specifically addresses the interaction between macroeconomic and microeconomic processes. To understand the impact of the reforms more fully, it is necessary to disaggregate the regional level and to study the differences between countries and in the microeconomic behaviour of firms according to sector, size and ownership. The globalization of the economy and government policies such as structural reform affect different countries and groups of firms in different ways. Some have been able to exploit the new opportunities, while the situation of others has deteriorated. The outcome of such developments gives rise to aggregate trends that others have observed and measured, but to design economic policy measures and improve future performance, it is essential to know what underlies those aggregates. The differing effects of the reforms are also evident in labour markets. Jürgen Weller, an ECLAC economist, thus takes account of their profound heterogeneity in the analysis of the region's labour markets presented in this book. That diversity partly derives from the special way in which labour markets work, as reflected in the presence of different segments driven by labour demand and by supply. This analysis thus differs from approaches which start from the premise of homogeneous labour markets, or which argue that the segmentation stems from politically induced distortions. Such approaches fail to capture the inherent dynamics of the region's labour markets. The author argues that economic reforms and effective labour institutions do not necessarily lead to equilibrium in the labour market, which underscores the importance of empirical research. Since it might be expected that the reforms would mainly affect the segment driven by labour demand, the book focuses on wage employment, although it also addresses the evolution of supply and of other employment categories. Additionally, the author maintains that an understanding of labour market dynamics demands an examination not only of trends at the aggregate level, but also of changes at the sectoral level. This approach provides a dynamic vision of the use of production factors, specifically the labour force, which explains why the economic reforms did not fulfil the expectations about job creation. In that context, the book shows that it is mistaken to speak (as some do) of jobless growth, but that some sectors did indeed suffer a significant decline in labour intensity. The productive restructuring triggered by the reforms not only affected job creation, but also had a marked impact on the composition of employment. Changes within and between sectors created a labour demand bias in favour of more educated workers, which tends to aggravate labour market segmentation. The author's analysis clearly reveals the size of the challenge facing the region in terms of creating more and better quality jobs.

Some have been able to exploit the new opportunities, while the situation of others has deteriorated. The outcome of such developments gives rise to aggregate trends that others have observed and measured, but to design economic policy measures and improve future performance, it is essential to know what underlies those aggregates. In this book,ECLAC economists Graciela Moguillansky and Ricardo Bielschowsky analyze the investment process, using the methodology just mentioned. Unlike traditional analyses of the determinants of investment, which have tended to rely largely on macroeconomic variables, Moguillansky and Bielschowsky's study attempts to link macroeconomic aspects to sectoral, microeconomic and institutional factors. Thus, they examine the impact of structural reform, institutional change, market structures and the role of agents (both domestic and foreign private agents and the State) in conjunction with the increasingly important legal and regulatory aspects. This approach represents a major step forward in the development of a new methodology for analysing the complex determinants of investment. A second noteworthy feature of the book is its contribution to the understanding of the investment process in the context of the transition set in train by economic reform, by identifying the phases of the investment cycle and the way firms adapt to institutional change. The study looks at both permanent and transitory factors, the latter stemming from the effects of reform policies, which have a different impact at each phase of the investment cycle. An analysis of sectoral investment trends serves to discern patterns in the allocation of capital resources after reform and the strengths and vulnerabilities thus generated,which help to explain the existence of obstacles to the attainment of a high sustained growth rate in the region. As well as making a methodological and substantive contribution, the book adds new material to the existing stock of empirical information by supplying quantitative data on the distribution of investment by sector for each of the countries examined and a comparison of changes in legislation and sectoral regulations in different countries of the region. This material was not previously available and will without doubt be useful for those who profess an interest in this subject area.

Some have been able to exploit the new opportunities,while the situation of others has deteriorated. The outcome of such developments gives rise to aggregate trends that others have observed and measured,but to design economic policy measures and improve future performance,it is essential to know what underlies those aggregates. This book by Samuel Morley,currently a visiting researcher at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI);and formerly a consultant of ECLAC,deals with a topic of growing concern in Latin American and Caribbean countries:the distribution of income. Distribution in the region is the most unequal in the entire world,a situation that has been true for as long as the statistics have been kept. Since 1980,inequality has increased. No doubt some of that is due to the recessions of the 1980 s,but recent studies indicate that the region 's economies saw very little improvement in the 1990 s as they recovered from their earlier recessions. The consensus is that distribution has stayed about the same or even worsened slightly since 1990. Morley identifies three contributing factors that help explain Latin America 's high level of inequality. First,Latin America has a highly unequal distribution of education and the highest skill differentials for university graduates in the world. Second,the combination of a highly skewed distribution of land and an increase in the growth rate of the labour force in recent decades has driven down the relative wage of the unskilled. Third,the rich in Latin America are much richer relative to the remainder of the population than they are elsewhere. Unfortunately it does not appear that growth will improve the distribution very much,if at all. One reason is that growth is more skill intensive now than it used to be. This may be simply a Latin American phenomenon,but more likely it reflects changes in technology that are being felt all over the world. Skill-intensive growth has favoured university graduates. So far,this group contributes less to overall inequality than the rich do because many in the group are not rich. Unlike the rich,however, Morley shows that this group 's contribution to inequality rose sharply in the post-reform period. In the nine-countries examined in the book,inequality would have fallen in every case had it not been for the rising relative incomes and size of the university group. The evidence is mixed on the impact of the structural reforms on income distribution,because it is difficult to separate the effect of the reforms from all the other changes that were happening at the same time. In the aggregate,the reforms appear to have had a regressive effect on distribution,but the effect is small and only marginally significant. The reason is that reforms in different areas have offsetting effects on equity. Tax and trade reforms are unambiguously regressive though not highly significant,but opening the capital account is unambiguously progressive. Results for other reforms were not consistent enough to give a clear answer. ECLAC could not have carried out a project of this scale without the cooperation of many individuals and institutions.
