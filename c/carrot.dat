5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic <b>carrot</b> has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild <b>carrot</b> Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild <b>carrot</b> was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E

5|$|Carrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% {{dietary fiber}}, 1% ash and 0.2% fat. <b>Carrot</b> dietary fiber {{comprises}} mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch. Free sugars in <b>carrot</b> include sucrose, glucose and fructose.|$|E

40|$|Nutrition {{recommendations}} worldwide emphasize {{ingestion of}} plant-based diets rather than diets that rely primarily on animal products. However, this plant-based diet could limit the intake of essential nutrients such as calcium. Osteoporosis {{is one of}} the world's most prevalent nutritional disorders, and inadequate dietary calcium is a known contributor to the pathophysiology of this condition. Previously, we have modified <b>carrots</b> to express increased levels of a plant calcium transporter (sCAX 1), and these plants contain ≈ 2 -fold-higher calcium content in the edible portions of the <b>carrots.</b> However, it was unproven whether this change would increase the total amount of bioavailable calcium. In randomized trials, we labeled these modified <b>carrots</b> with isotopic calcium and fed them to mice and humans to assess calcium bioavailability. In mice feeding regimes (n = 120), we measured 45 Ca incorporation into bones and determined that mice required twice the serving size of control <b>carrots</b> to obtain the calcium found in sCAX 1 <b>carrots.</b> We used a dual-stable isotope method with 42 Ca-labeled <b>carrots</b> and i. v. 46 Ca to determine the absorption of calcium from these <b>carrots</b> in humans. In a cross-over study of 15 male and 15 female adults, we found that when people were fed sCAX 1 and control <b>carrots,</b> total calcium absorption per 100 g of <b>carrots</b> was 41 % ± 2 % higher in sCAX 1 <b>carrots.</b> Both the mice and human feeding studies demonstrate increased calcium absorption from sCAX 1 -expressing <b>carrots</b> compared with controls.

5|$|The <b>carrot</b> (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild <b>carrot,</b> Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic <b>carrot</b> has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. <b>Carrot</b> seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the <b>carrot</b> are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the <b>carrot</b> or the closely related parsnip.|$|E

No culture-related differences in firmness and in the behaviour of the <b>carrots</b> during lactic fermentation could be detected. Fresh (organic) <b>carrots</b> were found to be more rapidly colonized by Botrytis if they had been cultivated with additional organic nitrogen, and use of “bio-dynamic preparations” strengthened the colonization resistance of these <b>carrots.</b> The SSCP-method revealed different fingerprints of PCR-amplified bacterial DNA isolated from the surface of different batches of <b>carrots.</b> When <b>carrots</b> were stored for 6 month prior to inoculation, resistance against colonization by Fusarium sp. decreased, in particular if they had received additional nitrogen but no “biodynamic preparations”.

5|$|<b>Carrot</b> soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. <b>Carrot</b> juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed <b>carrot.</b> After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed <b>carrot</b> may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the <b>carrot</b> root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the <b>carrot,</b> like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
