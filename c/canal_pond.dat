5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most {{idiosyncratic}} 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute {{the plans for the}} park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye {{in the form of a}} swan. The lake originally had a snow (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a <b>canal</b> <b>pond.</b>|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{water is}} found in bodies of water, such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, <b>canal,</b> <b>pond,</b> or puddle. The {{majority}} of water on Earth is sea water. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in aquifers.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, the Penrhos College {{site was}} taken over by the {{government}} for Ministry of Food use. The Duke of Devonshire, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, offered Chatsworth House {{for the use of the}} school. The contents of the house were packed away in eleven days and 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the <b>Canal</b> <b>Pond.</b> The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} monumental earthworks, causeways, ramps, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> and drained fields {{that have been}} buried by {{extensive}} sedimentation (Roosevelt 1991: 33, 331-333, 422) ...|$|R
50|$|So called koek en zopie outlets, small {{food and}} drinks stalls which spring up only during winters along frozen <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> and lakes in the Netherlands and cater to ice skaters, usually serve snert as a savoury snack.|$|R
50|$|The water {{structures}} such as <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> {{and artificial}} islands also confirm human habitation for long periods. The people that once inhabited the area probably built these canals for water drainage to prevent flooding as well as water transportation to connect the Musi River with inland areas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Canal</b> <b>Pond,</b> dug in 1702, is a 314 yd-long {{rectangular}} lake to {{the south}} of the house.|$|E
50|$|The Seahorse Fountain is a sculptural {{fountain}} {{in a circular}} pond on the lawn {{between the house and}} the <b>Canal</b> <b>Pond.</b> Originally, it was the centrepiece of the main parterre.|$|E
50|$|The {{fountain}} {{is situated}} {{at the north end}} of the <b>Canal</b> <b>Pond,</b> which was dug in 1703. The metal jet is surrounded by irregularly placed boulders. To the north are two sandstone sculptures of reclining figures.|$|E
5000|$|It {{natively}} inhabits rivers, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> ditches, and inundated fields, over a silt and mud substrate. They live in {{a tropical}} climate in water with a 7.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 15 - 30 dGH, and a temperature range of 64 - 82 °F (18 - 28 °C).|$|R
50|$|Anematichthys repasson is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the family Cyprinidae. It lives in Southeast Asia. Specifically, it occurs in the Mekong and Chao Phraya basins, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. It grows to 28 cm SL. It is a minor commercial fishery species that lives in rivers, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> and reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|The species inhabits <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> streams, and flooded rice paddies, in both {{fresh and}} {{brackish}} water, and {{is found in}} particular abundance during the rainy season. The species feeds on mosquito larvae and worms and also eats the scales of other fishes (lepidophagy), the species may have potential use in controlling malaria and parasites.|$|R
50|$|At an {{exhibition}} held by Sotheby's at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, in September-October 2012, fifteen of Flanagan's works were {{shown in a}} parkland setting. They included Large Nijinski on Anvil Point and Nijinski Hare, placed {{at opposite ends of}} the <b>Canal</b> <b>Pond.</b>|$|E

The baroque garden has been laid out, but only the first, smaller version of the Cascade has been built, and the <b>Canal</b> <b>Pond</b> has not been dug. The 1st Duke's stables are {{to the left of}} the house ...|$|E
5000|$|On the {{southern}} tip of the island is a forest park. The island is also known for its Folk and Culture Village. It has market gardens, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> and redwood avenues. Due to its scenic areas, it is designated a National Grade AA scenic area and one of the city's four [...] "green lungs".|$|R
50|$|Bumble Hole Local Nature Reserve is {{situated}} in the Netherton area of Dudley Metropolitan Borough in the county of West Midlands, England. This former industrial area now features <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> grassland and wooded areas. The reserve lies adjacent to the Warren's Hall Local Nature Reserve (which is in Sandwell Metropolitan Borough). It was declared a local nature reserve in 1996.|$|R
500|$|In 1690, Sir John Brownlow {{was granted}} {{permission}} to enclose {{an area of}} 1,000acres (4km²) to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens. Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including <b>canal</b> <b>ponds</b> bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the [...] "rond-points" [...] (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener André Le Nôtre. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, these formal parterres had been removed and the <b>canal</b> <b>ponds</b> filled in.|$|R
50|$|Quebec is a 4 acre part of {{the garden}} {{to the south and}} west of the <b>canal</b> <b>pond</b> that was, until 2006, a {{neglected}} and dank area covered with Rhododendron ponticum. This is now an extension to the Arboretum walk with a path that runs {{along the top of the}} steep bank. The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood. An 18th-century cascade was uncovered during the clearance.|$|E
5000|$|Hyslop's {{work was}} not all restoration. Immediately {{adjacent}} to the east facade, in a court created by newly planted yew hedging linking the mansion and East Pavilion, Hyslop created a swimming pool garden. The placing of pools was a problem to the owners of country houses in the 20th century; the pools would be treated with some [...] "circumspection" [...] and disguised as something else. Thus, at Buscot, the pool appears as a formal <b>canal</b> <b>pond</b> set in a renaissance garden.|$|E

50|$|The finescale razorbelly minnow (Salmophasia phulo) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the genus Salmophasia. It is {{a species of}} {{freshwater}} fish native to Bangladesh and India. It lives in the lower reaches of various bodies of water including rivers, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> and ditches. With a maximum length of only 12 cm, the fish is of little commercial or dietary value to humans.|$|R
50|$|Trithemis aurora, {{the crimson}} marsh glider, is {{a species of}} {{dragonfly}} in the family Libellulidae. It is a medium-sized dragonfly that is commonly found in weedy tanks and ponds, marshes, channels, and slow flowing streams and rivers in the lowlands and mid-hills. It breeds in streams, rivers, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> and tanks. It is found commonly and widely distributed in the Oriental region throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The little egret's habitat varies widely, and {{includes}} {{the shores of}} lakes, rivers, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> lagoons, marshes and flooded land, the bird preferring open locations to dense cover. On the coast it inhabits mangrove areas, swamps, mudflats, sandy beaches and reefs. Rice fields are an important habitat in Italy, and coastal and mangrove areas are important in Africa. The bird often moves about among cattle or other hoofed mammals.|$|R

50|$|Most of the UK's country {{houses were}} put to {{institutional}} use during World War II. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the 10th Duke, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by Penrhos College, a girls' public school in Colwyn Bay, Wales. The contents of the house were packed away in 11 days and, in September 1939, 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay.

30|$|Therefore, speculating high {{profit from}} high land value {{encouraged}} developers {{as well as}} individual buyers to grab high productivity farm land, flood zones, lakes and canals. This results in withering away of rivers, lakes, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> and ditches from megacity Dhaka which ultimately intensifies the level of inundation the inner city during the wet season. Moreover, excessive land filling and land developments have many other adverse ecological, social and economic impacts as well.|$|R
50|$|Once {{again the}} snow brought travel chaos {{to much of}} the country, {{particularly}} to the railways, with British Rail making its now infamous excuse that severe delays to services were being caused by the wrong type of snow. Heathrow Airport was forced to cancel flights, while Birmingham and Gatwick were closed. Cars were abandoned as roads and motorways became impassable, and <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> and even part of the Bristol Channel froze over.|$|R
5000|$|Earthen mounds, unlike lithic artifacts, are abundant. They {{were used}} for {{cemetery}} purposes {{as well as for}} habitation, as the low-lying areas are prone to flooding in the rainy season. Mounds may have served a defensive purpose too. Pre-historic peoples of Marajo Island may have also constructed ramps, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> and drained fields found near earthworks mounds, but most of the evidence has likely been buried by sediment in seasonal floods (Roosevelt 1991: 33).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most {{underwater}} networks rely on expensive specialized hardware for {{acoustic communication}} and modulation. This has impeded wide scale deployments of underwater sensor networks and has forced researchers to use simulations to investigate these systems. To address these issues, this paper examines {{a system that}} integrates off-the-shelf acoustic hardware built-in to sensor modules with software modems for establishing underwater acoustic links. Because the hardware in our system is readily available, we have conducted several rounds of field experiments to evaluate it. Building on our recent field experiments in a river, <b>canal,</b> <b>pond,</b> and swimming pool, this paper outlines the technical and logistical challenges for deploy-ing software-driven underwater sensor networks. The design choices include methods for signal modulation at the sender, and symbol synchronization, signal filtering, and signal demodulation at the receiver. We also discuss higher layer communication protocol issues, {{with a focus on}} cross-layer optimization, as well as practical solutions to logistical deployment challenges, such as waterproofing and casing, calibration, and fouling. The design guidelines in this paper lay the groundwork for further development of software-driven of underwater sensor networks...|$|E
50|$|It breeds in weedy ponds, lakes, {{and slowly}} moving streams; {{especially}} in sluggish waters. It {{is very common}} along sewage <b>canals,</b> tanks, <b>ponds</b> and ditches.|$|R
50|$|The paradise garden {{takes some}} of its {{character}} from its original arid or semi-arid homeland. The most basic feature is the enclosure of the cultivated area. This excludes the wildness of nature, and includes the tended, watered greenery of the garden. The commonest and easiest layout for the perimeter walls {{is that of a}} rectangle, and this forms one of the prime features of this kind of garden. Another common theme is the elaborate use of water, often in <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> or rills, sometimes in fountains, less often in waterfalls of various kinds.|$|R
50|$|Oryzias mekongensis is {{a species}} of fish in the Adrianichthyidae family. It is endemic to the Mekong River Basin in {{southeast}} Asia, where found in ditches, <b>canals</b> and <b>ponds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Woodhouse's toad {{is found}} in North America at altitudes of up to 2500 m. Its range extends from Mexico {{in the south to}} Washington in the north. In the United States it {{is found in}} Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. In the western part of its range it is {{typically}} found in lowland riparian corridors, wooded land besides streams and rivers. At higher altitudes it inhabits wet meadows, ponds, reservoirs and lakes. It is also found in urban environments, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds</b> and irrigated agricultural land.|$|R
5000|$|The MGNREGA was {{initiated}} {{with the objective}} of [...] "enhancing livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year, to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work". Another aim of MGNREGA is to create durable assets (such as roads, <b>canals,</b> <b>ponds,</b> wells). Employment is to be provided within 5 km of an applicant's residence, and minimum wages are to be paid. If work is not provided within 15 days of applying, applicants are entitled to an unemployment allowance. Thus, employment under MGNREGA is a legal entitlement.|$|R
