5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or general ledger), nonprofits <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than one general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity {{must be able to}} produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E

25|$|Both {{approaches}} use {{the observation}} that in claw-free graphs, no vertex <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than two neighbors in an independent set, and so the symmetric difference of two independent sets must induce a subgraph of degree at most two; that is, it is a union of paths and cycles. In particular, if I is a non-maximum independent set, it differs from any maximum independent set by even cycles and so called augmenting paths: induced paths which alternate between vertices not in I and vertices in I, and for which both endpoints have only one neighbor in I. As the symmetric difference of I with any augmenting path gives a larger independent set, the task thus reduces to searching for augmenting paths until no more can be found, analogously as in algorithms for finding maximum matchings.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, {{an ambiguous}} grammar is a context-free grammar {{for which there}} exists a string that <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than one leftmost derivation or parse tree, while an unambiguous grammar is a context-free grammar for which every valid string has a unique leftmost derivation or parse tree. Many languages admit both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, while some languages admit only ambiguous grammars. Any non-empty language admits an ambiguous grammar by taking an unambiguous grammar and introducing a duplicate rule or synonym (the only language without ambiguous grammars is the empty language). A language that only admits ambiguous grammars is called an inherently ambiguous language, and there are inherently ambiguous context-free languages. Deterministic context-free grammars are always unambiguous, and are an important subclass of unambiguous grammars; there are non-deterministic unambiguous grammars, however.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{take the}} given rng R, {{and make a}} {{category}} E whose objects are rng homomorphisms R → S, with S a ring having a multiplicative identity. The morphisms in E between R → S1 and R → S2 are commutative triangles of the form (R → S1,R → S2, S1 → S2) where S1 → S2 is a ring map (which preserves the identity). Note that {{this is precisely the}} definition of the comma category of R over the inclusion of unitary rings into rng. The existence of a morphism between R → S1 and R → S2 implies that S1 is at least as efficient a solution as S2 to our problem: S2 <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> adjoined elements and/or more relations not imposed by axioms than S1.|$|E
