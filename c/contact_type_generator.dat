40|$|This paper proposes an {{absorption}} {{refrigeration cycle}} device using a plate <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> {{in order to}} improve the start-up process to reduce the time to reach the steady state condition. A conventional absorption refrigeration cycle device using a shell&tube generator places a rectifier above the generator to remove absorbent from generated refrigerant vapor and to raise concentration of refrigerant vapor. However the replacement of a shell&tube <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> by a plate <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> makes it difficult to include the rectifier within an absorption refrigeration system. Therefore, the cycle proposed in the present study introduced a partial condenser instead of a rectifier. Refrigerant vapor in the partial condenser is cooled by coolant so that only absorbent within the generated vapor condenses by utilizing the difference of boiling temperature. Then, the analytical model was formulated in order to investigate the effectiveness of the plate <b>type</b> <b>generator.</b> The analytical results show that the start-up time is reduced with the plate <b>type</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R

This is because both <b>types</b> of <b>contact</b> offer very similar potential barrier in off-state. However, the on-state current in doped contact devices is much higher due to better modulation of on-state potential profile, and its variation with strain is sensitive to the device <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b> The on/off current ratio and the inverse subthreshold slope are better with doped source-drain contact, and their variations with strain are relatively less sensitive to the device <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b> The channel transconductance and device switching performance are much better with doped source-drain contact, and their variations with strain are sensitive to device <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R

Reverse engineering is used when the original product design document has been lost or never existed, unable to create the complex shapes accurately.
