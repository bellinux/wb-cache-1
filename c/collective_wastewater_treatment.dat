40|$|The study {{provides}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} quality of sewage discharged from selected sewerage systems. The analyzed data were collected from 10 agglomeration sewerage systems discharging sewage into <b>collective</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants (WTP). The investigated pollution indicators included BOD 5, CODCr, total suspended solids and biogenic indicators such as total nitrogen and total phosphorus. These results were compared with the outcomes reported in commonly available research papers on sewage disposal. Considering the concentration of individual pollution indicators, more detailed categories of sewage pollution were adopted in this work. The sewage was divided into five basic groups: I – highly concentrated, II – concentrated, III – moderately concentrated, IV – diluted, and V – highly diluted. The sewage categories accounted for the following pollution indicators: BOD 5, CODCr, total suspended solids, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. Mean BOD 5, CODCr and total suspended solids in raw sewage were higher than average values reported in the referenced literature. Contrary to that, concentration of total phosphorus in raw sewage was significantly lower than reported by other authors. The outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} the predictions concerning pollution degree of raw sewage made at WTP design stage should not be based exclusively on general values provided in literature reports...|$|E

Industry has been utilizing solid waste into by-products, fertilizers and animal feeds, but the wastewater which consist a lot of organic substances still discharged directly into the water that potentially cause water pollution. This study aims to determine the wastewater treatment system that can be applied in tapioca starch industry based on five scenarios proposed by using fuzzy goal programming approach. The first objective is the achievement of stream standard (DO-dissolved oxygen and BOD-biochemical oxygen demand) and wastewater quality standards. The second objective is to minimize the cost of wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment system that proposed, consists of a primary, secondary and collective treatment that shared by some of the industries in one segment with 20 % efficiency of BOD removal for primary, 60 % for secondary and 85 % for collective treatment.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Thesis was to {{calculate}} and visualize performance indicators for the secondary treatment step in municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants. Performance indicators are a valuable tool to communicate process conditions and energy efficiency to both management teams and operators of the plant. Performance indicators should be as few as possible, clearly defined, easily measurable, verifiable and easy to understand. Performance indicators have been calculated {{based on data from}} existing <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants and qualified estimates when insufficient data was available. These performance indicators were then evaluated and narrowed down to a few key indicators, related to process performance and energy usage. Performance indicators for the secondary treatment step were calculated for four municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants operating three different process configurations of the activated-sludge technology; Sternö <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (Sweden) using a conventional activated-sludge technology, Ronneby <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (Sweden) using a ring-shaped activated-sludge technology called oxidation ditch, Headingley <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (Canada) and Kimmswick <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (USA), both of which use sequencing batch reactor (SBR) activated-sludge technology. Literature reviews, interviews and process data formed the basis of the Master Thesis. The secondary treatment was studied in all the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants. Performance indicators were calculated, to the extent it was possible, for this step in the treatment process. The results showed that all the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatments</b> plants, studied in this master thesis, were well below regulatory requirements of effluent concentrations of organic matter and nutrients. This gap between legislated requirements and performance provides an opportunity for improving energy efficiency and maintaining discharge requirements. The removal of organic matter was consistently high at all <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants studied but the removal of nitrogen was slightly lower during the colder months. The results further showed that the discharge of nitrogen from <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants is the largest stress on the recipient. Data regarding the energy usage was almost nonexistent and energy for aeration was therefore calculated when possible since it is aeration that accounts for the largest fraction of energy usage in a <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant.
