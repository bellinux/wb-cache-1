50|$|Similar to the {{occasional}} observation of violet-green swallows building interspecific cooperative relationships, {{they have also}} been involved in interspecific competition for nesting sites.

After multiple aerial battles, the chickadees regained control of their nest and successfully defended against future violet-green swallow attacks. The same field observer noted a similar altercation between violet-green swallows and hairy woodpeckers, which resulted in the same outcome. These species are permanent residents, allowing them first choice of nesting sites, while the violet-green swallows are summer residents with late breeding habits.

50|$|Dominance may {{initially}} {{be established}} by fighting, or simply by threatening displays or interchanges. Once established, however, dominance is usually maintained by agonistic (<b>competitive)</b> <b>behaviours</b> with aggression considerably reduced or sometimes absent. In {{the maintenance of}} dominance relationships, the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal is critical. If a dominant animal perceives its status is being threatened, it will likely threaten the sub-dominant individual. The sub-dominant must then either escalate {{the intensity of the}} interaction to challenge the dominant, or defer. In this way, it is often the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal that maintains the dominance relationship, rather than the dominant.|$|R
50|$|Even {{without any}} {{intergroup}} interaction (as in the minimal group paradigm), individuals begin to show favouritism towards their own group, and negative reactions towards the outgroup.

In contrast, intergroup competition can sometimes be relatively harmless, particularly in situations where there is little history of conflict (for example, between students of different universities) leading to relatively harmless generalizations and mild <b>competitive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Intergroup conflict is commonly recognized amidst racial, ethnic, religious, and political groups.|$|R

This allows the location of important points in time where behaviour changes occur. Furthermore, the hierarchical nature of the system allows individual player classification results to be used towards the modelling and classification of higher-level tactical behaviours of groups of players, as defined within an application envelope.

50|$|There are two {{theories}} {{on the role}} of testosterone in aggression and competition among males. The first one is the Challenge hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty thus facilitating reproductive and <b>competitive</b> <b>behaviour</b> which would include aggression as a result of evolution. Thus it is the challenge of competition in relation to testosterone among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone levels. The same research also found dads (those outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males. The second theory is also similar and is known as the evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory of male aggression. Testosterone and other androgens have evolved to masculinize a brain in order to be competitive even as far as being a risk to harming others. By doing so, individuals with masculinized brains as a result of pre-natal and adult life testosterone and androgens enhance their resource acquiring abilities in order to survive, attract and copulate with mates as much as possible. Thus, crime can been seen as an extreme form of adaptation to gain status and acquire more resources. Many other researchers have agreed with this and have stated that criminal behavior is an expression of inter-male competition in mating efforts and resource seeking since there is a huge correlation between criminals and fathering children at younger ages.|$|E

50|$|Optimal {{stocking}} density is often {{defined by the}} carrying capacity of the stocked environment {{and the amount of}} individual space needed by the fish, which is very species specific. Although behavioural interactions such as shoaling may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species, in many cultured species high stocking densities may be of concern. Crowding can constrain normal swimming behaviour, as well as increase aggressive and <b>competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as cannibalism, feed competition, territoriality and dominance/subordination hierarchies. This potentially increases the risk of tissue damage due to abrasion from fish-to-fish contact or fish-to-cage contact. Fish can suffer reductions in food intake and food conversion efficiency. In addition, high stocking densities can result in water flow being insufficient, creating inadequate oxygen supply and waste product removal. Dissolved oxygen is essential for fish respiration and concentrations below critical levels can induce stress and even lead to asphyxiation. Ammonia, a nitrogen excretion product, is highly toxic to fish at accumulated levels, particularly when oxygen concentrations are low.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} experimental {{study on the}} application of continuous stripping mode foam fractionation to separate a model surfactant–protein mixture was performed with emphasis on the <b>competitive</b> adsorption <b>behaviour</b> and transport processes of surfactant–protein mixtures in the rising foam column. Bubble size measurements of the foamate showed that at steady state conditions the bubbles rising from the liquid pool were stabilised by BSA. However {{at the top of}} the column the recovery of Triton X− 100 in the foamate (75 – 100 %) was always greater than the recovery of BSA (13 – 76 %) for all foam fractionation experiments. The enrichment of BSA remained at almost unity for experiments with high feed concentrations of both components and low air flow rates, and only increased when the recovery of Triton X− 100 reached 100 %. Thus it was concluded that Triton X– 100 displaced the adsorbed BSA from the surface. The surface activity and diffusivity of the two components was determined from surface tension and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. These results illustrated that <b>competitive</b> adsorption <b>behaviour</b> was due to the greater maximum surface pressure (2. 05 times) and diffusivity (19. 6 times) of Triton X− 100 than BSA. In addition to investigating the effect of foam fractionation process parameters on the separation of mixed systems, the results from the characterisation studies of surface adsorption and foam properties provided insight and deeper understanding of the <b>competitive</b> adsorption <b>behaviour</b> of surfactants and proteins in a foam fractionation process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} develop an {{understanding}} of the social and environmental influences on athlete motivation, and the way these change across the athlete career span. Study 1 set out to explore the social and environmental influences of coaches, parents and peers on the motivation of young athletes (under 12 years old), at the initiation/sampling stage of their careers. Forty participants (7 - 11 years of age) from a variety of sports were interviewed in focus groups, using a semi-structured format to investigate the roles played by coaches, parents, and peers in influencing athlete motivation. An inductive content analysis was conducted to determine which behaviours among these social agents influenced key motivational outcomes. The young athletes described motivational influences which showed consistencies with existing models of motivation, but which also expanded upon these models in terms of both the specificity of behaviours identified, and also the comprehensive nature of the findings. The influences of coaches related most strongly to {{the manner in which they}} perform their roles of instruction and assessment, whereas parents influences were most salient in terms of the way they support the child s participation and learning. Both parents and coaches exerted influences through their leadership styles, affective responses and pre-performance behaviours. Peers influenced participants motivation through <b>competitive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> collaborative behaviours, evaluative communications and through their social relationships. This study provides an insight into the socioenvironmental influences on motivation experienced by young athletes, as well as helping to delineate the different roles of social agents in influencing their motivation at this early stage of development. Study 2 qualitatively examined the motivationally relevant behaviours of key social agents in athletes at the specialising career stage. Seventy-nine participants (9 - 18 years old) from 26 sports participated in semi-structured focus-groups investigating how coaches, parents, and peers may influence motivation. Using a critical-realist perspective, an inductive content-analysis indicated that specialising athletes perceived a multitude of motivationally-relevant social cues. Coaches and parents influences were related to their specific roles: instruction/assessment for coaches, support-and-facilitation for parents. Peers influenced motivation through <b>competitive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> collaborative behaviours, evaluative communications and through their social relationships. The results were consistent with Study 1 in terms of returning an analysis based around the different roles performed by social agents in relation to the ways that athlete motivation can be influenced. Study 3 examined the socio-environmental influences of coaches, parents and peers on the motivation of elite athletes. Twenty-nine elite sport participants (15 - 29 years old) took part in semi-structured focus groups or interviews investigating how coaches, parents, and peers influenced their motivation. An inductive content analysis was performed using a critical realist approach. Coaches and peers were reported to be focal influences, whilst the role of parents appeared to be decreased relative to other career-stages; being limited to emotional and moral support. Themes of feedback/evaluation, and pre-performance motivating behaviours were common to all social agents, whilst the coach-athlete and peer-athlete relationships appeared to be important in mediating and directly influencing motivation. The influences of social agents related to their specific roles: instruction/leadership for coaches; whilst peer-influences revolved around collaborative and <b>competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and emotional support. The discussion chapter took the form of a meta-interpretive synthesis of research findings concerning social and environmental influences on athlete motivation across the career-span. From a total of 124 papers that qualified for initial consideration 45 contributed to the final analysis. This chapter presents models of motivational processes that are intended to contribute new ideas and stimulate thinking in the area. The final analysis proposes a horizontal structure relating to athletic career developments, and a vertical structure detailing general dimensions of the overall motivationally relevant social environment. From this, the relative influences of coaches, parents and peers were ideographically assessed, suggesting that the influence of peers grows over the athletic career, whilst the relative influence of parents decreases. Finally, a meteorological model is presented, with a view to facilitating the joint consideration of numerous motivationally relevant variables, reflecting the proposed complex interactivity and interdependence identified throughout this thesis. In this chapter, the term motivational atmosphere is proposed in order to represent the extremely broad, complex and interactive nature of the socio-environmental influences on athlete motivation. The thesis concludes with the consideration of the theoretical and applied implications of the studies conducted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
