40|$|Abstractâ€”In {{this paper}} two typical {{arrangements}} of underground single-core high voltage three-phase power cables (flat and trefoil protected by PVC pipes) inside a closed shield {{of three different}} materials (low-carbon steel, non-oriented grain steel and aluminium) are analysed. The shield has two components: a U-shaped base and a flat plate (cover) located {{on top of the}} base. Whereas most of previous papers on this subject only dealt with the degree of mitigation obtained with each material, this paper, in addition to also addressing this issue, mainly focusses on the effect that electromagnetic losses induced in the shield have on the ampacity of the cable and the cost involved (material and losses). To obtain the numerical results, a high number of simulations by a well-known commercial finite element method software (COMSOL Multiphysics) have been performed. The results obtained in the numerous cases analysed are widely commented and the solutions that enable an important mitigation with no <b>current</b> <b>derating</b> and at a comparatively low cost are highlighted. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{nonlinear}} load such as UPS, fan controller, mobile charger is {{distorting the}} supply current waveform. This <b>current</b> harmonics <b>derates</b> the power system equipment. To avoid this current harmonics, filters namely passive filter / active filter /hybrid filters are {{introduced in the}} supply line. In this paper the overall view {{of the performance of}} the various filters are studied and the performance of the transformerless single phase hybrid filter using artificial neural network(ANN) is analysed using Matlab simulink and the results are presented.

50|$|Circuit {{integrity}} {{for conventional}} plastic-insulated cables requires additional measures {{to obtain a}} fire-resistance rating or to lower the flammability and smoke contributions to a minimum degree acceptable for certain types of construction. Sprayed-on coatings or flexible wraps cover the plastic insulation {{to protect it from}} flame and reduce its flame spreading ability. However, since these coatings reduce the heat dissipation of the cables, often they must be rated for less current after application of fire-resistant coatings. This is called <b>current</b> capacity <b>derating.</b> It can be tested through the use of IEEE 848 Standard Procedure for the Determination of the Ampacity Derating of Fire-Protected Cables.|$|R
40|$|The {{supply current}} is {{distorted}} by the nonlinear load such UPS, DC drives, AC drives and arc furnace. This <b>current</b> harmonics <b>derates</b> the electrical equipments. Thus the current harmonics are reduced from the supply line using Shunt Hybrid filter. The Hysteresis controller controls the active filter thus the supply current tracks the reference fundamental current extracted by the synchronous reference frame unit. So supply current is free from harmonics and also it provides harmonic compensation. The passive filter is tuned for the dominant harmonic frequency so it reduces the rating of the active filter. The total harmonic distortion and power factor of the supply current of three phase controlled rectifier load with filter and without filter is analyzed using MATLAB simulink {{and the results are}} presented...|$|R
