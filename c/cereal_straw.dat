40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of 17 straws was {{determined}} {{on the basis}} of their chemical composition, in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility and rumen fermentation kinetics (from gas production curves measured in vitro). Five roughages were from the cereal species Avena sativa (oat), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Secale cereale (rye), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Zea mays (maize stover). The other 12 samples were legume straws, two samples from each of the species Cicer arietinum (chickpea), Lens culinaris (lentil) and Phaseolus vulgaris (bean) and one sample from each of the species Lathyrus sativus (chickling vetch), Lupinus albus (white lupin), Pisum sativum (field pea), Vicia articulata (one-flowered vetch), Vicia ervilia (bitter vetch) and Vicia sativa (common vetch). All samples were collected after harvesting from different farms located in León (northwestern Spain). Based on their chemical composition, digestibility and gas production characteristics, species could be clustered into two groups with a significant linkage distance, one for <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> that merged at a level of similarity of 80 % and the other for legume straws with a degree of similarity of 50 %. Species varied widely and significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed between the two groups of straws. Legume straws showed higher crude protein (74 ± 6. 1 vs 29 ± 2. 2 g kg- 1 DM) and lower fibre (584 ± 18. 1 vs 793 ± 27. 5 g neutral detergent fibre kg- 1 DM) contents than <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> and, consequently, DM digestibility coefficients (0. 670 vs 0. 609; standard error of difference 0. 0054) and metabolisable energy values (7. 4 ± 0. 15 vs 5. 7 ± 0. 24 MJ kg- 1 DM) were significantly greater in legume than in <b>cereal</b> <b>straws.</b> Although there were noticeable differences among species within each botanical family, legume straws showed better nutritional quality than <b>cereal</b> <b>straws,</b> indicating that they could be considered promising and interesting sources of roughage for incorporation into ruminant diet...|$|R

The matrix (the soil from a suspected archaeological feature) is slowly added to agitated water. The soil, sand, and other heavy material, known as heavy fraction, will sink to the bottom. The less dense organic material such as charred seeds, grains and charcoal will tend to float to the surface. The material that floats to the top, called light fraction, is poured into a sieve (usually 250-500 µm). The light fraction is then dried and later examined under a low power microscope. Samples of the heavy fraction are also gathered for later analysis. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets, [...] or by machine-assisted flotation where water is circulated through a series of tanks by a pump.Waterlogged plant remains are separated from the matrix by a combination of wet-sieving and/or small-scale flotation in a laboratory.

Second generation biofuel can be subdivided into those from dedicated bioenergy crops (DESGB), e. g. miscanthus, or those from co-products (CPSGB) such as <b>cereal</b> <b>straw.</b> Potential supply of <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> as a feedstock for CPSGB's is uncertain in England due to the difficulty in obtaining data and the uncertainty in current estimates. An on-farm survey of 249 farms (Cereal, General Cropping and Mixed) in England was performed and linked with Farm Business Survey data to estimate current straw use and potential straw availability. No significant correlations between harvested grain and straw yields were found for wheat and oilseed rape and only a weak correlation was observed for barley.

40|$|Abstract Background Deficiency of macro and micro-minerals in the ration {{of dairy}} cows {{adversely}} affects growth, milk production and reproduction efficiency. It {{is essential to}} examine mineral concentrations in feeds offered to dairy cows in practical farms. Methods Two villages from each taluka were selected at random for taking representative samples of feeds, forages and hair. Within the village, help was sought from village milk producers and district animal husbandry officer for identification of 4 to 5 farmers and collection of representative samples. All the samples were processed and analyzed for chemical composition as well as major macro and micro-minerals, using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer. Results Ca content in wheat straw (0. 29 %), crushed maize (0. 02 %) and wheat bran (0. 12 %) {{was found to be}} below the critical level (0. 30 %). The P content in concentrate ingredients was high (0. 26 – 0. 96 %), but low in dry roughages (0. 06 – 0. 12 %). <b>Cereal</b> <b>straws</b> (0. 14 %) and grains (0. 12 %) were deficient in Mg. Feeds and forages were found to be adequate in K (1. 50 %). <b>Cereals</b> <b>straws</b> were found to be deficient in S (0. 11 %). Greens were good source of Cu (12. 02  ppm). Wheat straw was found to be low in Zn (18  ppm), but high in Mn (225  ppm) and Fe (509  ppm). Local grasses and azolla green were found to be rich source of Co (> 1. 00  ppm). Se (0. 63  ppm) was present in appreciable quantities in most of the feedstuffs. Conclusions From the present study, it was apparent that the feeds and forages available in the state of Jharkhand may not meet the requirements for Ca, P, Mg, Cu, Zn and Co in order to sustain a milk production of ~ 10  kg/day.

50|$|A {{major concern}} for the {{viability}} of current alternative fuels is the cropland needed to produce the required materials. For example, the production of corn for corn ethanol fuel competes with cropland {{that may be used}} for food growth and other feedstocks. The difference between this and cellulosic ethanol production is that cellulosic material is widely available and is derived from a large resource of things. Some crops used for cellulosic ethanol production include switchgrass, corn stover, and hybrid poplar. These crops are fast-growing and can be grown on many types of land which makes them more versatile. Cellulosic ethanol can also be made from wood residues (chips and sawdust), municipal solid waste such as trash or garbage, paper and sewage sludge, <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> and grasses. It is particularly the non-edible portions of plant material which are used to make cellulosic ethanol, which also minimizes the potential cost of using food products in production.|$|R

Second generation biofuels offer potential to contribute towards this target with <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> representing a potentially large feedstock source. From an on-farm survey of 240 arable farmers, timeliness of crop establishment and benefits of nutrient retention from straw incorporation were cited as reasons for straw incorporation. However, two-thirds (one-third) of farmers would supply wheat (barley) straw for bioenergy. The most popular contract length and continuous length of straw supply was either 1 or 3 years.

One or several by-products are specifie of each region of the country, but most of them are localised in the northern region. Some of the agricultural wastes are available in important quantifies but are of nutritionally poor or moderate qualifies (straw, olive wastes, poultry litter, etc), while others are produced in limited amounts but are of very interesting feeding values (sugar beet pulp, brewers grain, date residue, etc). The main applied strategies to valorise Tunisian agricultural by-products consist in ammoniation of <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> along with supplementation with multinutriment blocks and formulation of balanced diets based totally or partially on them. These alternatives are crucial in the improvement of feeding values of studied diets and animal performances essentially by improving microbial activity in the rumen. In Tunisia such solution could be applied both in extensive and moderate animal production systems...|$|R

The high concentration of ash and acid insoluble ash would {{have a negative effect on}} the voluntary feed intake. According to Kakkar et al. (1990), that used mushroom harvested spent straw as feed for buffaloes, the voluntary intake decreased due to the relatively high content of ash in the diet. In addition to the high concentration of ash, presence of inhibitor substances such as phenolic compounds in MSWS, produced as a result of degradation of lignocelluloses by fungi, could negatively affect intake (Langar et al. 1980; Bonnen et al. 1994). According to previous studies mushroom spent straw obtained from Coprinus fimetarius or Pleurotus fungi did not have such limitation effect on intake (Walli et al. 1991; Fazaeli et al. 2002). These types of fungi are cultured on <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> where no soils are added to the substrate and the remaining compost contained much lower ash than that of the spent straw from button mushrooms (Zadrazil 1997; Fazaeli et al. 2007).|$|R
