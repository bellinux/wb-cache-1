2500|$|The Los Angeles Kings {{debuted in}} the NHL wearing purple – officially, [...] "Forum blue" [...] – and gold uniforms. The {{original}} design was simple and straightforward, featuring monochrome striping {{on the shoulders}} and tail, as well as purple pants with white and gold trim. Later on, white trim was added on the numbers, and names were also added, while tail stripes were adjusted. At one point, gold pants were used to pair with the gold uniforms during the 1970s. A variation of the original crown logo, with a contrasting <b>color</b> <b>background,</b> was used with this uniform.|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the three}} two-record sets carried the same cover art, a Theodore de Bry etching of an {{instrument}} Smith {{referred to as the}} [...] "Celestial Monochord," [...] taken from a mystical treatise by scientist/alchemist Robert Fludd. [...] This etching was printed over against a different <b>color</b> <b>background</b> for each volume of the set: blue, red and green. Smith had incorporated both the music and the art into his own unusual cosmology, and each of these colors was considered by Smith to correspond to an alchemical classical element: Water, Fire, and Air, respectively. The fourth 'Labour' volume (released later by Revenant) is colored yellow to represent the element earth.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} phase shifts between Long-wavelength cone (L-cone) and Middle-wavelength cone (M-cone) signals {{as well as}} sensitivity in the luminance pathway either {{following a}} cone-silent substitution of <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> or on a steady <b>colored</b> <b>background.</b> In background substitution, the phase shifts between L- and M-cone signals varied only slightly depending on the substituted color, whereas marked elevation of the threshold following the substitution of <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> was found. In contrast, the phase shifts, as well as threshold, varied largely, depending on the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> in the steady background. These facts suggest that suppression by the cone-opponent process for <b>background</b> <b>color</b> substitution {{is different from the}} one for a steady <b>colored</b> <b>background.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Primatte {{is usually}} {{activated}} on a foreground image {{with a person}} or other foreground object filmed or digitized against a solid <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> or backing screen; usually a bluescreen or a greenscreen. The solid <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> area is removed and replaced with transparency. This allows the user to replace the solid <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> with a background image of his choice.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{presentation}} of the empty shape on a <b>colored</b> <b>background,</b> the <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> induces an illusory complementary color ("induced color") inside the empty shape (i.e. bird). After the disappearance of the <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> an afterimage of the [...] "induced color" [...] might appear inside the [...] "empty shape". Thus, the expected color of the shape will be complementary to the [...] "induced color", and therefore similar to the color of the original background.|$|R
6000|$|... § 19. Before {{the idea}} of {{landscape}} had been thus far developed, the representations of it had been purely typical; the objects {{which had to be}} shown in order to explain the scene of the event, being firmly outlined, usually on a pure golden or chequered <b>color</b> <b>background,</b> not on sky. The change from the golden background, (characteristic of the finest thirteenth century work) and the colored chequer (which in like manner belongs to the finest fourteenth) to the blue sky, gradated to the horizon, takes place early in the fifteenth century, and is the crisis of change in the spirit of mediæval art. Strictly speaking, we might divide the art of Christian times into two great masses--Symbolic and Imitative;--the symbolic, reaching from the earliest periods down to the close of the fourteenth century, and the imitative from that close to the present time; and, then, the most important circumstance indicative of the culminating point, or turn of tide, would be this of the change from chequered background to sky background. The uppermost figure in Plate 7. opposite, representing the tree of knowledge, taken from a somewhat late thirteenth century Hebrew manuscript (Additional 11,639) in the British Museum, will at once illustrate Mr. Macaulay's [...] "serpent turned round the tree," [...] and the mode of introducing the chequer background, will enable the reader better to understand the peculiar feeling of the period, which no more intended the formal walls or streams for an imitative representation of the Garden of Eden, than these chequers for an imitation of sky.|$|E

50|$|The L-plate is {{very similar}} to those used in the United Kingdom and Singapore, with the {{exception}} being that two background colors are issued which are blue <b>color</b> <b>background</b> (for all vehicles except motorcycles) and white <b>color</b> <b>background</b> (for motorcycles only).

50|$|Limitations of the {{watercolor}} illusion were studied. The color-spreading effect occurs on <b>colored</b> <b>backgrounds</b> {{in addition to}} the white or gray. In the case of a <b>colored</b> <b>background,</b> {{the watercolor}} illusion color spread does not mix with the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> but does get superimposed onto the <b>colored</b> <b>background.</b> For lighting conditions, the color spreading effect declines as the illumination in the room increases. It is the strongest at medium illumination. Lastly, the watercolor illusion persists even when dotted lines are used for the purple contour and orange fringe instead of continuous lines.|$|R
