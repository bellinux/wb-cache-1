40|$|This {{study was}} {{addressed}} {{to the relationship between}} norovirus and acute diarrhea in hospitalized children, including hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and community-acquired infection (CAI) in a children's hospital in Beijing. RT-PCR was used to detect norovirus in stool specimen, followed by sequence analysis for PCR products. From 2010 to 2013, a total of 1248 specimens, including 661 from the HAI group and 587 from the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> were tested for norovirus. Norovirus were detected in 380 of 1248 (30. 4 %) diarrheal specimens. The positive rate for norovirus detection was higher in children within HAI group than <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> (35. 3 %, 232 / 661 vs. 25. 6 %, 148 / 587), and the difference was significant (X 2 = 14. 35, P< 0. 05). For age distribution, the highest positivity rates of norovirus were in age of 0 - 5 months for HAI group and 12 - 23 months for <b>CAI</b> <b>group.</b> In the study, 262 amplicons of the VP 1 region from norovirus-positive specimens were sequenced, which showed GII. 3 and GII. 4 norovirus were the most common genotypes detected in 50. 0 % (n = 131) and 48. 9 % (n = 128) of the positive specimens, respectively. Regarding the wards distribution, GII. 3 norovirus was mainly detected in ward for neonatal diseases (36 / 85 in HAI group; 19 / 46 in <b>CAI</b> <b>group),</b> GII. 4 norovirus was mainly detected in ward for respiratory and digestive diseases (21 / 85 in HAI group; 15 / 33 in <b>CAI</b> <b>group).</b> The data elaborated the importance of norovirus in hospital associated infectious diarrhea.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the ankle position, the changes and persistence of ankle kinematics after neuromuscular training in athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI). A total of 21 national women’s field hockey players participated (CAI = 12, control = 9). Ankle position at heel strike (HS), midstance (MS), and toe touch (TT) in the frontal plane during walking, running and landing were measured using 3 D motion analysis. A 6 -week neuromuscular training program was undertaken by the <b>CAI</b> <b>group.</b> Measurements of kinematic data for both groups were measured at baseline and the changes in kinematic data for <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> were measured at 6 and 24 weeks. The kinematic data at HS during walking and running demonstrated that the magnitude of the eversion in the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> (− 5. 00 ° and − 4. 21 °) was less than in the control group (− 13. 45 °and − 9. 62 °). The kinematic data at MS also exhibited less ankle eversion in the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> (− 9. 36 ° and − 8. 18 °) than in the control group (− 18. 52 ° and − 15. 88 °). Ankle positions at TT during landing were comparable between groups. Following the 6 -week training, the CAI participants demonstrated a less everted ankle at HS during walking and running (− 1. 77 ° and − 1. 76 °) compared to the previous positions. They also showed less ankle eversion at MS (− 5. 14 ° and − 4. 19 °). Ankle orientation at TT changed significantly to an inverted ankle position (from − 0. 26 ° to 4. 11 °). The ankle kinematics were restored back to the previous positions at 24 weeks except for landing. It appeared that athletes with unstable ankle had a relatively inverted ankle position, and that 6 -week neuromuscular training had an immediate effect on changing ankle orientation toward a less everted direction.

It is unclear if {{there are differences in}} the spatial distribution of COP and TTBminima data points under the foot. Our purpose was to determine if there are differences in the location of the distribution of the COP and the TTB minima data points between groups with and without CAI. Fifty healthy and 61 CAI subjects participated in this case–control study.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the alterations in eccentric evertor/concentric invertor strength ratio and their importance in the chronically unstable ankle. Eight patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and nine healthy individuals participated in this study. Isokinetic concentric and eccentric invertor and evertor muscle strength measurement was carried out at an angular velocity of 120 ° · sec- 1 by measuring maximal force moments (torque) during isokinetic ankle inversion and eversion movements. Functionally, evertor/invertor muscle strength ratios (E/I strength ratio) were calculated separately based on peak moment and angle-specific moments obtained at 0 °, 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° ankle joint angles. Peak and angle-specific eccentric evertor strength values at 0 °, 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° were significantly lower in the chronic ankle instability (<b>CAI)</b> <b>group.</b> In spite of this, no differences were obtained for peak and angle-specific concentric invertor torque values.

40|$|Purpose: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is {{a leading}} cause of {{blindness}} in working-age adults. Slow-release, nonbioerodible fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) implants have shown efficacy in the treatment of DMO; however, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that FAc should be used in patients with chronic DMO considered insufficiently responsive to other available therapies only if the eye to be treated is pseudophakic. The goal of this analysis was to examine treatment outcomes in phakic patients who received 0. 2 ??g/day FAc implant. Methods: This analysis of the phase 3 FAME (Fluocinolone Acetonide in Diabetic Macular Edema) data examines the safety and efficacy of FAc implants in patients who underwent cataract extraction before (cataract before implant (CBI) group) or after (cataract after implant (<b>CAI)</b> <b>group)</b> receiving the implant. The data were further examined by DMO duration. Results: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after 36 months was comparable in the CAI and CBI groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Better patient {{education}} {{prior to}} colonoscopy improves adherence to instructions for bowel preparation {{and leads to}} cleaner colons. We reasoned that computer assisted instruction (CAI) using video and 3 D animations followed by nurse contact maximizes the effectiveness of nurse counselling, increases proportion of clean colons and improves patient experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults referred for colonoscopy in a high-volume endoscopy unit in the Netherlands were included. Exclusion criteria were illiteracy in Dutch and audiovisual handicaps. Patients were prospectively divided into 2 groups, 1 group received nurse counselling and 1 group received CAI and a nurse contact before colonoscopy. The main outcome, cleanliness of the colon during examination, was measured with Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) and Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). We assessed patient comfort and anxiety at 3 different time points. RESULTS: We included 385 patients: 197 received traditional nurse counselling and 188 received CAI. Overall patient response rates were 99 %, 76. 4 % and 69. 9 % respectively. Endoscopists scored cleanliness in 60. 8 %. Comparative analysis of the 39. 2 % of patients with missing scores showed no significant difference on age, gender or educational level. Baseline characteristics were evenly distributed over the groups. Bowel cleanliness was satisfactory and did not differ amongst groups: nurse vs. <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> scores in BBPS: (6. 54 +/- 1. 69 vs. 6. 42 +/- 1. 62); OBPS: (6. 07 +/- 2. 53 vs. 5. 80 +/- 2. 90).

40|$|Abstract Background Postural control deficits {{have been}} {{purported to be}} a {{potential}} contributing factor in chronic ankle instability (CAI). Summary forceplate measures such as center of pressure velocity and area have not consistently detected postural control deficits associated with CAI. A novel measurement technique derived from the dynamical systems theory of motor control known as Time-to-boundary (TTB) has shown promise in detecting deficits in postural control related to chronic ankle instability (CAI). In a previous study, TTB deficits were detected {{in a sample of}} females with CAI. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine postural control in sample of males and females with and without CAI using TTB measures. Methods This case-control study was performed in a research laboratory. Thirty-two subjects (18 males, 14 females) with self-reported CAI were recruited and matched to healthy controls. All subjects performed three, ten-second trials of single-limb stance on a forceplate with eyes open and eyes closed. Main outcome measures included the TTB absolute minimum (s), mean of TTB minima (s), and standard deviation of TTB minima (s) in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. A series of group by gender analyses of variance were conducted to evaluate the differences in postural control for all TTB variables separately with eyes open and eyes closed. Results There were no significant group by gender interactions or gender main effects for any of the measures. There, however, significant group main effects for 4 of the 6 measures with eyes closed as the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> demonstrated significant deficits in comparison to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the TTB measures with eyes open. Conclusion TTB deficits were present in the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> compared to the control group. These deficits were detected with concurrent removal of visual input. CAI may place significantly greater constraints on the sensorimotor system during single limb stance, resulting in a reorganization of postural control strategies. These deficits may be indicative of a diminished ability to respond effectively to changes in postural control demands in those with CAI. </p...|$|E

A test of between-subjects effects showed that there was a significant main group effect on the exercise knowledge change (F = 29. 22, p,. 002), but not on the exercise self-efficacy change CF = 1. 68, p,. 05). In spite of this, the results showed that the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> had significantly better exercise knowledge than the tutorial group in both the post-training and follow-up phases.

This study investigated the effects of computer-assisted and teacher instruction on reading achievement scores of urban, low-achieving African-American learners. The design of the study assumed that creating computer labs or having computers throughout a school will not necessarily increase reading achievement. Teacher management strategies (TMS) were developed inductively with experienced teachers who had at least three years of experience with computer-assisted instruction (CAI). The initial sample consisted of 494 African-American students. Data from 375 were used in the analysis. Subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups: non-computerized classroom techniques (NCCT), computer-assisted only (CAI Only), and computer-assisted instruction plus teacher management strategies (CAI+TMS). Materials were checked for content validity across groups. Pretests and posttests were given before and after two months of the three treatments. A factorial repeated measures MANOVA revealed that both the CAI Only and the CAI+TMS groups produced significant (p $<$. 05) achievement score gains. The NCCT group gained in some cases but not in others. In one case, the CAI+TMS group had significantly higher (p $<$. 05) gains than the <b>CAI</b> Only <b>group.</b> In another, the CAI+TMS group significantly (p $<$. 05) outgained the NCCT group...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine whether the use of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) would enhance the teaching of handwriting skills. There is only one commercially available courseware for handwriting instruction and very little research in this area has been conducted. In view of the paucity of research, this investigator explored the effects of the use of CAI on the handwriting skills of Spanish-speaking {{children between the ages of}} 4 and 7 years. Subjects were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1 received traditional handwriting instruction, Group 2 participated in <b>CAI,</b> and <b>Group</b> 3 participated in CAI but also was given reinforcement. Pretests were administered to establish an initial baseline for each subject. Progress was measured weekly in order to determine the impact of the interventions. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare mean number of letters correctly written by each group each week. A significant difference in mean number of letters correctly written existed among the three groups of subjects at Week 5 (p =. 04) and Week 6 (p =. 019). Scheffe procedures revealed CAI with reinforcement resulted in significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) greater improvement in handwriting skills than did traditional instruction. It may be concluded from these results that CAI with reinforcement can greatly enhance the learning of handwriting skills. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that phonological sensitivity is an important causal skill for decoding. This study evaluated the use of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) to provide training in phonological sensitivity skills to preschoolers at-risk for reading problems. Forty-five children ranging in age from 44 to 64 months (M = 55. 1, SD = 6. 07) were randomly assigned to a <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> or a control group. Children exposed to CAI made significantly greater gains on rhyming and elision skills compared to the control group. Expressive vocabulary scores were predictive of pre- to posttest growth. Children in the CAI condition positively rated participation in the training program. Results provide preliminary support for CAI to improve the phonological sensitivity skills of preschoolers who are at-risk. Reading skills provide a crucial piece of the foundation of children’s academic success. Children who read early and well experience more exposure to print and consequent growth in numerous knowledge domains (Cunning...|$|E
40|$|Many primary {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to reveal the effects of computer assisted instruction (CAI) on students ’ attitudes towards science courses. In determining {{the effectiveness of these}} studies, gathering and evaluating of the studies at some characteristics play an important role. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine meta-analytically the overall effectiveness of CAI on students’ attitudes towards science courses from the years 2000 to 2007 in Turkey. This paper reported the results of 23 effect sizes included in 17 studies, since some studies performed multiple comparisons within the same study. The overall number of subject was 1583. Grand mean for 23 ESs was calculated as 0, 68. When this mean ES was converted to percentiles, the percentiles on students ’ attitudes towards science course were 75 for the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> and 50 for TI group. In other words, an average student’s attitude towards science course moved from the 50 th percentile to the 75 th percentile when computer assisted instruction was used...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A pretest-posttest {{design was}} used to compare the {{effectiveness}} of computer-assisted-instruction (CAI) drill and practice with the effectiveness of same-age peer-tutor drill and practice on promoting mastery of multiplication facts. The subjects were students from three, fourth grade classes in the Reedville School District of Aloha, Oregon. Two fourth grade classes were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: CAI and same-age peer-tutoring. A third class was designated as a control group. Students in the <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> drilled on multiplication facts independently at a computer for 10 minutes per day for 25 days. Students in the same-age peer-tutor group tutored classmates using multiplication flashcards for 5 minutes and were tutored for an additional 5 minutes for a total of 10 minutes per day for 25 days. The control group received traditional math instruction consisting of daily, one-minute, mastery tests. Drill and practice was independent and self-paced. Treatment consisted of drill and practice on multiplication facts with multipliers 0 - 9 and multiplicands 6 - 9. The pretest and posttest were computer-constructed criterion tests consisting of randomly selected multiplication facts from the treatment set. Fifty-two students began the treatment. Forty-five students completed treatment and the posttest. Analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test showed {{a significant difference between the}} <b>CAI</b> <b>group</b> (x̄ = 48. 00) and control group (x̄̄ = 67. 60) on the pretest. However, on the posttest, analysis of covariance revealed no significant difference among the groups (p =. 05). Therefore, the null hypotheses for the study were accepted. The hypotheses predicted there would be no significant difference between the groups' mean math scores on the posttest. Although the study did not identify either CAI or same-age peer-tutoring drill and practice as more effective than the other, it did show both strategies to be equally effective in promoting mastery of basic math facts. The adjusted group means were CAI: 93. 97 and same-age peer-tutoring: 93. 43. In finding the two strategies to be equally effective, the study identified same-age peer-tutoring as a cost-effective alternative to CAI drill and practice. The findings have implications for staff development, curriculum planning, and for teachers' selection of drill and practice strategies...|$|E
40|$|Problems of cost stall {{substantial}} {{implementation of}} computer-assisted instruction, (CAI) particularly for dispersed populations. This paper examines the {{problems inherent in}} providing <b>CAI</b> to scattered <b>groups</b> so that accurate estimates {{of the costs of}} different technologies (including satellites) which could deliver CAI to dispersed populations can be made and so that, {{on the basis of these}} costs, educators can make decisions about the allocation of their,resources. The paper first outlines a CAI system capable of reaching dispersed populations without excessive costs (i. e., the system requires only 110 bits per second communications capability for each student terminal). This makes the service economically feasible [...] Next, models of several communications alternatives for the system are provided. The results of this modeling constitute approximate minimum cost communication designs for many configurations of population dispersal [...] Finally, some basic economic trade-offs and implementation alternatives are described which are relevant to educators who'must decide whether or not to use CAI for certain student populations.

40|$|Twenty-five {{experimental}} fifth-grade {{students were}} given an instructional/ experiential program in Logo for fourteen weeks. A control class of eighteen students had no Logo experiences during this time but did have occasional access to a computer for <b>CAI</b> purposes. Both <b>groups</b> were administered three cognitive style tests prior to and immediately following the instructional period. The experimental group {{scored significantly higher on}} the posttest in divergent thinking and field dependenelindependence. The control class also showed gains but they were not statistically significant. When the classes were compared, group effects were evident on two of the divergent thinking subtests but not on the total score. On both subtests, differences were due to better posttest performances by the experimental group than the controI group. Educators seem to be increasingly convinced {{of the value of the}} microcomputer to facilitate both learning and instruction. We are still unsure, however, about the effect of computer experiences on children’s thinking. On one hand educa...|$|R
