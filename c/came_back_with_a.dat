5|$|This {{would be}} a turning point of the game, as the Giants, who had trouble {{mounting}} many drives to that point, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 95–yard drive. The key play of the drive was Conerly's pass to Kyle Rote, who after a 62–yard gain, fumbled at the Colts' 25–yard line, where Alex Webster picked up the ball and ran it to the 1–yard line. New York then scored a touchdown, to make the score 14–10. The Giants drove again, with quarterback Charley Conerly throwing a 15–yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17–14.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event and final {{scheduled}} match on the card, Bret Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Yokozuna. Hart tried to use his technical wrestling abilities against Yokozuna, while Yokozuna relied on his size advantage in the match. Hart gained control at the beginning, but Yokozuna <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clothesline, leg drop, and nerve hold. Hart regained the advantage when Yokozuna missed a running splash. Yokozuna applied another nerve hold but missed a running splash again. He recovered and carried Hart {{to the middle of}} the ring, but Hart removed the protective padding on the turnbuckle in the corner of the ring. He threw Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle and applied the Sharpshooter, his signature submission hold that stretches the opponent's legs and back. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw salt in Hart's eyes, which enabled Yokozuna to pin Hart and win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

Triple H took control as he took out Orton's knee with a chop block and applied a figure four leglock. After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but Triple H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair, but Triple H managed to avoid being hit. Triple H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H's back and performed a DDT.

But the Vikings responded with Cunningham's 53-yard completion to Reed setting up a 3-yard touchdown reception by Carter, narrowing the gap to 24-14. Replays showed the officials blew the call on Reed's reception because his second toe came down on the end line, but it didn't make much difference because the 49ers <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 75-yard touchdown drive with Kirby rushing for gains of 22 and 14 yards {{on the first two}} plays.

Ishii, who was a large favorite in the fight, was dominated in the first round by the more-experienced Yoshida, taking many strikes including a right overhand that staggered the newcomer, along with a series of knees and uppercuts from the clinch. Ishii, however, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more competitive second round, but took a point deduction after illegally kneeing Yoshida in the groin. Ishii continued to find his range in the third round with punches, but ultimately lost via unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} {{wiped out by}} a lockout, and the Bruins {{had a lot of}} space within the new salary cap {{implemented}} for 2005–06. Bruins management eschewed younger free agents in favor of older veterans such as Alexei Zhamnov and Brian Leetch. The newcomers were oft-injured, {{and by the end of}} November, the Bruins team traded their captain and franchise player, Joe Thornton (who went on to win the Art Ross and Hart Trophies). In exchange, the Bruins received Marco Sturm, Brad Stuart and Wayne Primeau from the San Jose Sharks. After losing 10 of 11 games before the trade, the Bruins <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 victory over the league-leading Ottawa Senators, as rookie goaltender Hannu Toivonen earned his first career NHL shutout. When Toivonen went down with an injury in January, journeyman goalie Tim Thomas started 16-straight games and brought the Bruins back into the playoff run. Two points out of eighth place at the Winter Olympic break, the Bruins fired General Manager Mike O'Connell in March and the Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in five years.|$|E

The {{game was played}} on January 6, 2007 at Toronto, Ontario's Rogers Centre (formerly known as SkyDome) making it the first game played outside the United States since Notre Dame and Navy played their annual game in Dublin in 1996 and the first postseason game outside the U.S. since the Bacardi Bowl in Havana, Cuba back in 1937. The game's scoring came in three separate blocks, as Cincinnati jumped out to a 24–0 lead by the second quarter before WMU stormed back with 24 straight points of their own to tie the game. Immediately following WMU's tying touchdown in the 4th quarter, Cincinnati <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 12-play, 81-yard drive ending with a 33-yard field goal that provided the winning margin with 6:11 remaining in the game.

25|$|In August 1896, as coordinated attacks {{broke out}} and sparked the {{revolution}} beginning in Manila. Emilio Aguinaldo marched from Kawit with 600 men {{and launched a}} series of skirmishes at Imus which eventually ended in open hostilities against Spanish troops stationed there. On September 1, {{with the aid of}} Captain Jose Tagle of Imus, they laid siege against Imus Estate to draw the Spanish out. A Spanish relief column commanded by Brig. General Ernesto de Aguirre had been dispatched from Manila to aid the beleaguered Spanish defenders of Imus. Supported only by a hundred troops and by a cavalry, Aguirre gave the impression that he had been sent out to suppress a minor disturbance. Aguinaldo and his men counter-attacked but suffered heavy losses and almost cost his own life. Despite the success, Aguirre did not press the attack and felt the inadequacy of his troops and hastened back to Manila to get reinforcements. During the lull in the fighting, Aguinaldo's troops reorganized and prepared for another Spanish attack. On September 3, Aguirre <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> much larger force of 3,000 men. When Spanish troops arrived at the Isabel II bridge, they were fired upon by the concealed rebels. As surprise was {{on the side of the}} revolutionaries, almost all the Spaniards that were sent there were trapped and annihilated, among them was Gen. Aguirre.|$|E
