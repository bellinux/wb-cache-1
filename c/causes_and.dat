5000|$|The {{point of}} the koan {{is that for the}} {{ordinary}} person the two conflicting views of causality are between falling into <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect or not falling into <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect, because they dream of being free from <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect as being separate from <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect. But when a person awakens to their true nature he/she sees the oneness of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect and therefore that person does not [...] "darken", [...] "obscure", or [...] "ignore" [...] (昧, mei4) the functioning of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect by imagining <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect are two separate things, that <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect is separate from one's Buddha nature. Thus awakened persons neither [...] "fall into" [...] nor do they [...] "not fall into" [...] <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect, because they are one with <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect.

5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, <b>causes,</b> <b>and</b> {{control of}} {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they}} are enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

5000|$|Dōgen revisits the wild-fox kōan in “Jinshin inga,” a 1250s {{rewriting}} of {{the earlier}} “Daishugyō” fascicle, to ground his ideas in precedent and explain them in detail. He elaborates upon the significance of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect, {{setting the stage for}} criticism of other thinkers and schools of thought. By suggesting that there is a distinction between existing in causality and a state in which causality is no longer in force, Dōgen's newfound view runs, conventional interpretations thus fall victim to [...] "a dualistic contrast between the pure and impure, flux and serenity, and freedom from and subjection to causation." [...] He explains: Those who say [...] "one does not fall into <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect" [...] deny causation, thereby falling into the lower realms. Those who say [...] "one cannot ignore <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect" [...] clearly identify with <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect. When people hear about identifying with <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect, they are freed from the lower realms. Do not doubt this. Many of our contemporaries who consider themselves students of Zen deny causation. How do we know? They confuse [...] "not ignoring" [...] with [...] "not falling into." [...] Thus we know they deny <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect.|$|R

5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> monetary contributions from elites.|$|E
50|$|According to the Theory of the Pre-existent Effect, {{there is}} no {{annihilation}} of the existence, {{nor is there any}} creation of the non-existent, which means, there cannot be anything new or the destruction of what exists; and that {{there is no}} relation between <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect. With regard to the non-difference of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> the effect the general views are that, a) the difference (negation of non-difference) of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect is the essence (swarupa) of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> the effect, and the non-difference of them is their relation of identity; b) that difference of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect is their essential quality and that their non-difference is the negation of that difference, and c) that both difference and non-difference are essential qualities of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect and are equally positive in character and colour. These views lead to the reasoning that non-difference of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect cannot be taken as absolutely different from them, non-difference is not an attribute different from <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect and if difference is interpreted as constituting the essential nature of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect, with non-difference qualifying it as an attribute then a rational conception of the relation between <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect cannot be formed. It is held that the effect before its manifestation remains undifferentiated in the cause, because the causal substance is the substance of the effect as a substance therefore, the effect cannot be different from the cause, it evolves out of the cause, it exists inseparable from the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> at the time of destruction it merges {{in the nature of the}} cause. Also, specific features that constitute the effect are not different from the cause. Thus, the entire world which prior to its manifestation is existent in an unmanifest state in the nature of Prakrti, the Primal Energy, the modification of Prakrti resulting in the perceivable world does not make it lose its identity.Existence is a manifestation of the unmanifest Brahman, and the individual souls (atman) are the reflections of Brahman and non-different from Brahman, but even then non-difference cannot become the content of awareness without reference to difference. To the Advaitins, non-difference is real and it is not known through reasoning. Brahman is then held to be knowable because it is different from empirical things.|$|R
30|$|<b>Cause</b> <b>and</b> effect {{diagrams}} ually called Fishbone diagram is {{an analytical}} decision tool {{used in the}} quality management {{for the analysis of}} the root cause of the defect. <b>Cause</b> <b>and</b> effect analysis was devised by Professor Kaoru Ishikawa, a pioneer of quality management, in the 1960 s. The technique was then published in his 1990 book, “Introduction to Quality Control.” The diagrams that create with <b>Cause</b> <b>and</b> Effect Analysis are known as Ishikawa Diagrams or Fishbone Diagrams (because a completed diagram can look like the skeleton of a fish). <b>Cause</b> <b>and</b> effect analysis was originally developed as a quality control tool; this tool has a variety of uses in the service industry as well to find out the reasons for the lack of quality.|$|R
50|$|Humans {{understand}} <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect. Research {{suggests that}} other animals, such as rats and monkeys, {{may or may}} not understand <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect. Animals may use information about <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect to improve decision-making and make inferences about past and future events. A constant which guides human reasoning and learning about events is causality. Causal considerations are integral to how people reason about their environment. Humans use causal cues and their related effects to make decisions and predictions and to understand mechanisms leading to change.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of system dynamics approach, in understanding of cause-effect relationship. The experimental design with pre-post test with control group is applied in {{this research}}. In order to assess the sub problems of the study, a valid and reliable “Cause-Effect Relationship Scale” had been developed by the researcher. Collected data were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics, paired and independent t-tests. The scale for “understanding <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship” has two sections. In the first section (causality 1), the interest and attitude of the students towards <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationships are evaluated. In the second section (causality 2) the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship commenting skills of the students in some sample cases are evaluated. In the first section the initial mean values of experimental and control groups are different whereas, their mean scores are equal in the end of the empirical study. As per second section, in the end of the empirical study, it is obvious that <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship skills of the students have been increased after system dynamics application. Statistically there is not a significant difference in <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship oriented of interest and attitude (causality 1) {{of the students in the}} end of empirical study (t= 0. 00; p>. 05). In the classes where system dynamics approach is performed, it is obvious that ideas of the students about <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship did not change. The results gained from causality 2 scale shows that there is an increase in previous and post empirical study in both groups. <b>Cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship is understood better by the students in experimental group, according to mean scores. It can be said that the system dynamic provides benefit of understanding <b>and</b> commenting of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect relationship...|$|R
