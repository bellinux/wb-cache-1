40|$|Marine {{aquaculture}} generates considerable {{amounts of}} effluent {{in the form}} of solid (waste feed, faeces) and dissolved substances such as nutrients, pesticides and pharmaceuticals which are released directly into the water column. With the rapid development of floating net cage culture in the mid 1970 ’s, concerns grew with respect to its environmental impacts. Ongoing improvement of feed technology and higher ingestion rates leads to a reduced wastage {{in the form of}} particulate organic matter, making dissolved substances a more important factor. So far, no clear link was laid between the placement of multiple floating net <b>cage</b> fish <b>farms</b> and mitigation of dissolved floating net <b>cage</b> <b>farm</b> wastes. Since the degree of nutrient enhancement is related to the nutrient discharge of a given standing stock and the physical characteristics of a water body at both farm level and at greater distances away from the farm. Therefore, adequate farm placement and methods to optimize the distribution of cultured fish over multiple floating net <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> provides leverage to reduce potential impacts of the dissolved wastes which are directly released into the environment. This study targets to develop strategic measures to optimize the arrangement of multiple floating net <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> and the distribution of the standing stock to efficiently accommodate dissolved nitrogenous wastes into the direct environment and to minimize nutrient concentration enhancement and potential triggers of eutrophication effects...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} {{technical}} inefficiency model indicate that farmers {{experience and the}} number of production cycles were negatively related to technical inefficiency of finfish cage culture in the study areas. This imply that technical inefficiencies of <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> could be reduced significantly through increasing the number of production cycle. The slow growth of grouper in <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> has been identified as the main difficulty to increase production in Malaysia and other countries in South East Asia. The growth of grouper depends on the type of seed, feed and feeding practices in cage culture. Farmers mainly use trash fish due to low cost and locally available feed for grouper compared to pelleted feed. It is generally believed that feeding trash fish can improve the texture and appearance of the fish that can fetch high market value. The results reveal that farmers experience is lacking in cage culture activities. Improving skills in cage culture management will reduce the inefficiency of <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> in Malaysia. Study found that farmers have lack of knowledge and skills in the daily care and feeding activities required in cage culture in Indonesia (Ahmad and Sunyoto 1990).|$|R

5000|$|Fish cages {{are placed}} in lakes, bayous, ponds, rivers, or oceans to contain and protect fish until they can be harvested. The method is also called [...] "off-shore cultivation" [...] when the cages {{are placed in}} the sea. They can be {{constructed}} {{of a wide variety}} of components. Fish are stocked in cages, artificially fed, and harvested when they reach market size. A few advantages of fish farming with cages are that many types of waters can be used (rivers, lakes, filled quarries, etc.), many types of fish can be raised, and fish farming can co-exist with sport fishing and other water uses. <b>Cage</b> <b>farming</b> of fishes in open seas is also gaining popularity. Concerns of disease, poaching, poor water quality, etc., lead some to believe that in general, pond systems are easier to manage and simpler to start. Also, past occurrences of cage-failures leading to escapes, have raised concern regarding the culture of non-native fish species in dam or open-water cages. Though the cage-industry has made numerous technological advances in cage construction in recent years, storms always make the concern for escapes valid.|$|E
50|$|After {{the lobster}} seed is sold to farmers, they are {{normally}} placed into sea cages and grown to adult size for harvest at about 1 kg. This takes about 18- 24 months. Three methods of cage culture exist. The first farming method, is a floating cage, where a frame about 10 to 20 m2 in area {{is supported by}} buoys and holds the lobster cages, and is normally moored in waters 10-20m deep. Such cage method occurs most commonly on Nha Trang Bay. The second farming method is wooden fixed cages, made from 2.5m length by 10 cm width wood with salt resistance, placed about 2 m apart so to create a square shape and normally have an area of 20-40 m2 up to 100-200 m2 with varying cage size. They are usually on or off seabed in areas with little wave activity. Normally such cage methods are found in Van Phong Bay. The third <b>cage</b> <b>farming</b> method is the submerged cage method, made from iron mesh with meshing of 15-16 mm, with an overall size of the cage ranging from 1 - 16 m2 and with a height of 1 - 1.5 m.

50|$|Ashanti {{region has}} a {{significant}} aquaculture industry and fishing industry. Products for local consumption and export include Western Cuttlefish, tilapia, rock lobsters, prawns, crabs, smoked catfish (smoked fish) and tuna. Processing is conducted along the Crater Lake of Lake Bosumtwi and Ashanti region's eastern Lake Volta coast. The main fish species cultivated in Ashanti region are Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Tilapia species represent over 90 percent of farmed fish production. Pond aquaculture is the main production system in terms of number of farms, and is mainly small scale and semi-intensive. However, {{in the last five}} to seven years the dominant culture system for tilapia production has changed, {{and the vast majority of}} tilapia is now farmed intensively in cages in Lake Volta. Aquaculture production increased from 950 metric tons in 2004 to over 27,000 metric tons in 2012. This growth is due mainly to increased production from a small number of large-scale cage farms (battery cages). Overall, cage farms currently account for less than 2 percent of farms by number but much more by production. In 2012, for example, aquaculture production from cages was over 24,000 metric tons compared to less than 2,000 metric tons from ponds and tanks. The growth in aquaculture production is also attributed to increased availability of quality fingerlings and feed for fish production. The number of private hatcheries, which currently produce the majority of fingerlings in Ashanti region, has increased in recent years as a result of the rapid growth of <b>cage</b> <b>farming</b> (battery cage). The establishment of a feed mills in Ashanti region in 2011, has greatly improved the reliability and availability of feed supply to fish farmers in Ashanti region.|$|E

An increase of both peritoneal and perivisceral fat was observed in summer months. In general size had little effect on muscle composition. A significant size effect was observed in the fillet lipid content, which increased with it. Fillet lipid content was unexpected lower in the warm period (June-July).

30|$|Cage culture {{plays an}} {{important}} role in achieving higher output and generating more export earnings in Malaysia. However, the cost of fingerlings, feed and labour have increased substantially for cage culture in the coastal areas in Peninsular Malaysia. This paper uses farm level data gathered from Manjung, Perak and Kota Tinggi, Johor to investigate the technical efficiency of brackish water fish cage culture using the stochastic frontier approach. The technical efficiency was estimated and specifically the factors affecting technical inefficiencies of fish cage culture system in Malaysia was investigated. On average, 37 percent of the sampled fish <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> are technically efficient. The results suggest very high degrees of technical inefficiency exist among the cage culturists. This implies that great potential exists to increase fish production through improved efficiency in cage culture management in Peninsular Malaysia. The results indicate that farmers obtained grouper fingerlings from other neighboring countries due to scarcity of fingerlings from wild sources. The cost of feeding for grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) requires relatively higher costs compared to seabass (Lates calcarifer) production in <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> in the study areas. Initiatives to undertake extension programmes at the farm level are needed to help cage culturists in utilizing their resources more efficiently in order to substantially enhance their fish production.|$|R
