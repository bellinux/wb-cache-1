5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> made a push to get {{residents}} to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to repeated requests from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership. By September, it had granted charters to police unions in 37 cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Paul, though not without protests from some <b>city</b> <b>officials,</b> {{who opposed the}} unionization of police, firefighters, and teachers.|$|E

An attempt by <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> to acquire a trolley car in 1986 was dropped in the face of high insurance costs.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, rose {{hobbyist}} and Oregon Journal editor Jesse Currey convinced <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> {{to establish}} a rose test garden to protect hybrid roses grown in Europe during World War I. Portland's Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917, allowing rose enthusiasts in England to send roses to Portland for preservation. City landscape architect Florence Holmes Gerke began designing the International Rose Test Garden and accompanying amphitheatre in 1921. The garden was dedicated in June 1924 with Currey as the first curator. He served {{until his death in}} 1927. A stone bench in the garden honors Currey's work as founder.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> {{announced}} that the Peachtree Road Race, Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, and the Dogwood Festival would not {{be held in the}} park due to extreme drought. Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E

5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> simply wanted to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission.

The masters were allowed to display in their front windows.
