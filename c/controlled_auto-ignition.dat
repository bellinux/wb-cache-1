40|$|The {{work was}} {{concerned}} with improving understanding of the chemical and physical trade-offs when employing transient over-fuelling to <b>control</b> <b>auto-ignition</b> in gasoline spark ignition engines under knock intensities not usually tolerated in optical engines. The single cylinder engine used included full bore overhead optical access capable of withstanding unusually high in-cylinder pressures. Heavy knock was deliberately induced by adopting inlet air heating and a primary reference fuel blend of reduced octane rating. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging and simultaneous in-cylinder pressure data measurement were {{used to evaluate the}} combustion events. Under normal operation the engine was operated under port fuel injection with a stoichiometric air-fuel mixture. Multiple centred auto-ignition events were regularly observed, with knock intensities of up to ~ 30 bar. Additional excess fuel was then introduced directly into the end-gas in short transient bursts. As the mass of excess fuel was progressively increased a trade-off was apparent, with knock intensity first increasing by up to 65 % before lower unburned gas temperatures suppressed knock under extremely rich conditions. This trade-off is not usually observed during conventional low intensity knock suppression via over-fuelling and has been associated with the competing effects of reducing auto-ignition delay time and charge cooling/ratio of specific heats. Overall, the results demonstrate the risks in employing excess fuel to suppress knock deep within a heavy knocking combustion regime (potentially including a Super-Knock regime) ...|$|R

Ignition regimes were classified into three categories:. weak (where deflagration is the dominant mode of fuel consumption),. reaction-dominant strong, and. mixing-dominant strong (where volumetric ignition is the dominant mode of fuel consumption). Two-dimensional (2 D) direct numerical simulations (DNS) of auto-ignition in a lean syngas/air mixture with uniform mixture composition at high-pressure, low-temperature conditions were performed in a fixed volume. The initial conditions considered two-dimensional isotropic velocity spectrums, temperature fluctuations and localized thermal hot spots. A number of parametric test cases, by varying the characteristic turbulent Damköhler and Reynolds numbers, were investigated. The evolution of the auto-ignition phenomena, pressure rise, and heat release rate were analyzed. In addition, combustion mode analysis based on front propagation speed and computational singular perturbation (CSP) was applied to characterize the auto-ignition phenomena. All results supported that the observed ignition behaviors were consistent with the expected ignition regimes predicted by the theory of the regime diagram.

This novel combustion technique allows for significant reduction of fuel consumption and engine-out NOX emissions at low and medium engine load/speed conditions. High heat release rate enables realization of the Otto cycle close to ideal, increasing thermal efficiency. Among different approaches to invoke an auto-ignition of air-fuel mixture, exhaust gas trapping {{with the use of a}} negative valve overlap is under intensive investigations. The paper presents research results of <b>controlling</b> an <b>auto-ignition</b> and combustion phasing in a single cylinder gasoline engine with direct fuel injection operated in the negative valve overlap mode. The experiments were performed at variable valvetrain settings, providing a control of EGR rate and volumetric efficiency. Additionally, the combustion process was investigated at variable air-fuel ratio. It was found that volumetric efficiency and EGR rate are mainly dependent on exhaust valve timing, while a timing of intake valve determined combustion on-set and its duration. The effects of EGR rate and air-fuel ratio on combustion timing and exhaust gas emissions were isolated. The direct fuel injection showed its benefits versus mixture formation outside the cylinder. The application of variable injection timing provided additional possibility to control the combustion timing and exhaust emissions. However, it was found that the fuel injection strategy should be related to the engine load conditions...|$|R
40|$|A large eddy simuation (LES) {{model is}} {{presented}} for simulation of spark-assisted homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion. The model {{is based on}} tabulated chemical kinetic rate for ignition and flame surface density for flame propagation, taking into account interaction between flame propagation introduced by the spark and auto-ignition due to charge compression. The model is used to simulate the combustion process in an experimental HCCI engine, with operation conditions ranging from spark-ignition controlled flame propagation to <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>controlled</b> HCCI combustion. The model is shown {{to be able to}} predict the combustion behavior observed in previous engine experiments. With low initial temperature, the SI flame mode prevails; with high initial temperature, the HCCI mode prevails. With moderate initial temperature, the SI flame and HCCI ignition interact more closely, which results in higher sensitivity to the initial temperature and turbulence conditions. This may be the reason of the observed high cyclic variation in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition ({HCCI}) {{combustion}} principle lacks direct {{ignition timing}} <b>control,</b> instead the <b>auto-ignition</b> {{depends on the}} operating condition and fast combustion phasing control is necessary for reliable operation. A six-cylinder heavy-duty HCCI engine was controlled on a cycle-to-cycle basis in real time {{using a variety of}} sensors, actuators and control structures for control of the {HCCI} combustion in comparison. Combustion phasing control based on ion current was compared to feedback control based on cylinder pressure. Two actuators were compared, dual fuel and Variable Valve Actuation (VVA). Model-based control synthesis requiring dynamic models of low complexity and HCCI combustion models were estimated by system identification and by physical modeling. The models identified by system identification were used to design model-predictive control (MPC) with several desirable features and today applicable to relatively fast systems. Both control of the combustion phasing and control of load-torque with simultaneous minimization of the fuel consumption and emissions were included...|$|R
