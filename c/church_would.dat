5|$|In the 17th century, at {{the church}} of St Vigeans, near Arbroath, communion was not held for several years because the villagers {{believed}} there was a curse on the church. The curse said that if communion were held then the <b>church</b> <b>would</b> fall into a large subterranean lake.|$|E
5|$|Another officially {{published}} doctrinal {{change was}} {{that women in}} the <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to wear makeup. In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.|$|E
5|$|By 1917, the American diocese was {{the largest}} in the Russian Orthodox Church. It had grown from ten parishes in 1890 to more than 350. Most of the funding for the diocese was {{provided}} by Russian Church, via the Imperial Missionary Society. The connections between the American diocese and the Russian <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> be severely compromised by the events of that year.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, {{throughout}} the Lenten period, {{the interior of}} Maltese <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> be draped in purple, with statues and paintings covered in mourning crêpe.|$|R
5000|$|The Angel of Philadelphia {{would be}} the new holy pope, and the last three <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> {{constitute}} [...] "the new church of these new days".|$|R
50|$|Part of Drums ethos was investigative journalism. One of {{the aims}} {{was to show}} the realities and inequities of apartheid. Themba decided to see how white <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> react to his {{attending}} services.|$|R
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery <b>church</b> <b>would</b> have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, {{it is more likely that}} the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Senior Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a Yeltsin appointee, {{signed a}} {{decision}} {{for the removal of}} the institute. The decision, dated 7March 1995, ordered the institute's departure by 1996. Simultaneously, the institute wrote to Luzhkov describing the earlier events from their perspective, and requested compensation for loss of the building. In a meeting with the Polish Ambassador, Stanisław Ciosek, on 15March 1995, the acting mayor of Moscow, Alexander Musykantski, assured him that the return of the <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be complete {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done. The clas <b>church</b> <b>would</b> continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{closeness}} between Kelley Chapel and Kelley Presbyterian. The <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> often share {{literature and}} other materials. In Kelleytown, whenever someone had something that others didn't, {{it was shared}} without a second thought.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} it was Ennemond who first {{conceived}} the idea of calling the faithful to church by ringing church bells. Similarly, when his body was returned to Lyon, all <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> have started ringing their bells.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 it {{was decided}} that the two Church of Scotland congregations, Dennistoun Blackfriars and Dennistoun Central <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> unite to form Dennistoun New parish church. This {{followed}} long vacancies dating from 2000 (Dennistoun Blackfriars) and 2004 (Dennistoun Central).|$|R
5|$|In 1095, at the Council of Piacenza, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos {{requested}} {{military aid}} from Pope Urban II, {{probably in the}} form of a small body of mercenary reinforcements he could direct and control. Alexios had restored the Empire's finances and authority, but he still faced a number of foreign enemies, particularly the migrating Turks who had colonised the sparsely populated areas of Anatolia. At the Council of Clermont later that year, Urban raised the issue again and preached for a Crusade. Many historians consider that Urban also hoped that aiding the Eastern <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> lead to its reunion with the Western under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5000|$|During consecration the {{building}} would usually be named {{in honour of}} a [...] "holy martyr", but sometimes instead a [...] "confessor", [...] "matron", or [...] "virgin", but nonetheless many churches remained undedicated up until the thirteenth century. In 1229 the Bishop of Worcester William of Blois mandated that all churches in his diocese display the date of dedication and name of patron saint alongside the altar, and many medieval <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> also have a painted image of their patron nearby. <b>Churches</b> <b>would</b> also celebrate the feast day of their patron or patrons {{in what is now}} known as the 'patronal festival', with local parishioners taking a holiday or naming children after their patron.|$|R
50|$|In {{the above}} cases, the ultramontanist {{movement}} {{acted as a}} counterbalance to growing {{power of the state}} in Europe. Roman Catholic apologists argued that if the pope had ultimate authority in the Church, then national <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> be more immune to interference from their governments.|$|R
50|$|Protestant <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> {{generally}} view ecumenical councils as fallible human {{institutions that}} have {{no more than a}} derived authority {{to the extent that they}} correctly expound Scripture (as most would generally consider occurred with the first four councils in regard to their dogmatic decisions).|$|R
5|$|The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, {{confirmed}} that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non-fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) {{was still in the}} second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a graze wound to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right side of her head. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local <b>church</b> <b>would</b> open at 7:00 a.m. for students.|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} {{a church}} {{dedicated}} to the Holy Trinity stood at the summit until it was razed by the Ottomans; in another version, the church crumbled after {{a boy and a}} girl sinned within. Before 2005, there was a custom to pick up a stone at a certain distance from the peak and carry it to the supposed site of the church in the belief that when a sufficient quantity of stones were collected, the <b>church</b> <b>would</b> rebuild itself. A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, {{the shops}} had been rebuilt in 'barren' Broadmead (at {{the expense of}} {{demolishing}} an area of Victorian, Georgian and Tudor buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed), and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used for car parking. The picturesque area around Narrow Wine Street and Castle Mill Street had been demolished to create modern Newgate, and Old Market, severed from Bristol's shopping axis by the new Temple Way Underpass {{and the destruction of}} Castle Street, was in serious decline. The plan for Castle Park was crystallising, however. The ruined St Peter's <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park. The south-western corner nearest Bristol Bridge would contain a riverside hotel, and the north-western corner would be home to 'a block for cultural, professional and exhibition purposes'.|$|E
50|$|In {{its first}} issue for 1906, the Canadian Union Messenger {{reported}} that the leadership expected all the <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> place large orders for the religious liberty tracts addressing the pending Sunday legislation. The membership seemed stirred over the matter. They showed a lively interest in petitions addressing it.|$|R
50|$|On 11 September 2014 the Deputy Prime Minister Etienne Schneider {{announced}} plans to introduce a church tax, payable only by members of religious congregations; the <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> then have to pay their clergy's salaries themselves. This would have replaced {{the system of the}} clergy being paid by the state.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Home Office {{minister}} Mike Penning wrote {{a letter}} to representatives of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England to try to reassure them that incense would not fall {{under the jurisdiction of the}} bill and that <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> not face prosecution for use of incense during worship.|$|R
5|$|Manor Farm and Park Wood {{were nearly}} {{demolished}} {{in the early}} 1900s {{to make way for}} a new development planned in partnership with King's College and the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. A town planning competition was won by A & J Soutar from Wandsworth, who suggested a symmetrical design across the parish which would have seen a total of 7,642 new homes built. St. Martin's <b>church</b> <b>would</b> have been the only example of historical architecture left in Ruislip. An outline map of the new development proposal was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A Local Board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911 which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914. Three roads with residential housing, Manor Way, Windmill Way and Park Way were completed before the outbreak of the First World War when all construction work was halted. It was not resumed until 1919, though the plan was substantially scaled back as work slowed throughout the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The Nine Queries, as {{they came}} to be called, focused on the divine right (jure divino) of church government. While the presbyterian divines were capable of {{defending}} their vision for church government as established by divine right in the Bible, they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the Assembly and weaken their case in Parliament. In July 1647, the New Model Army invaded London and conservative members of Parliament were forced out. Parliament passed an ordinance establishing religious tolerance and ensuring that the Assembly's vision of a national, compulsory presbyterian <b>church</b> <b>would</b> never come to fruition. In London, where support for presbyterianism was greatest, presbyteries were established in only sixty-four of 108 city parishes, and regional presbyterian classes were only formed in fourteen of England's forty counties. A planned national general assembly never met. Many presbyterians did, however, establish voluntary presbyteries in what was a de facto free church situation until the Restoration in 1660, when a compulsory episcopal system was reinstated.|$|E
5|$|The fateful {{encounter}} between Margaðr and Guthormr is sometimes dated to 1052 on {{the presumption that}} Margaðr is identical to Echmarcach, and that the event must have taken place {{at the conclusion of}} Echmarcach's second reign in Dublin. In fact, the Old Norse personal name Margaðr is a form of the Gaelic personal name Murchad; and the aforesaid accounts of Margaðr likely refer to Echmarcach's nemesis Murchad, rather than Echmarcach himself. Although the saga claims that a thankful Guthormr donated a portion of his looted silver to the shrine of his saintly uncle at Niðaróss, it is unlikely that any <b>church</b> <b>would</b> have accepted property known to have been looted from Christians. Instead, it is possible that Guthormr's hoard of silver was actually the tax that Murchad which had collected from Mann in 1061 during the expulsion of Echmarcach. Such a date corresponds to the implied date of about 1061 given by Heimskringla.|$|E
5000|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{serve as}} an ecumenical [...] "bridge" [...] between Catholicism and the Orthodox Church. Tawil argued that Latinizing the Eastern Catholic <b>Churches</b> <b>would</b> {{ultimately}} block a much hoped-for reunion of Eastern and Western Christianity by demonstrating that a union with Rome would lead to [...] "ecclesiastical assimilation".|$|R
5000|$|Separating {{the city}} core from the low-density {{residential}} area {{would be an}} expanse of grass areas, known to the planners as the [...] "green belt". This is where the city services would be located. Establishments such as parks with playgrounds, community centers, schools, stadiums, and <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> be located here.|$|R
40|$|This document, which {{consists}} of 15 articles, is the plan formulated by the Mexican Congress in 1833 to secularize the California missions. It stipulates, among other things, that the mission <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> become parishes, and that the friars would be replaced by secular clergy who would receive a salary {{as determined by the}} government. Furthermore, the mission buildings would now be utilized as town hall, elementary schools, workshops and public offices.

5|$|Together with King's College, {{the urban}} {{district}} council worked to establish plots {{of land for}} development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish. Many {{of the woods and}} historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only St. Martin's <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> have been spared. An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections recorded.

5|$|With {{political}} and geographic division came religious division. One {{part of the}} Armenian Church claimed it wanted to be separate from the head, whose seat was in Echmiadzin, Armenian SSR. Some Armenians in the US thought Moscow tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists' ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the Armenian Apostolic <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> not admit members of the ARF. This {{was one of the}} reasons why the ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian Catholicate of Cilicia, from Lebanon to the US. In 1933, members of ARF were convicted in the assassination of Armenian archbishop Levon Tourian in New York City. Prior to his murder, the archbishop had been accused of being exclusively pro-Soviet by the ARF. The ARF was legally exonerated from any direct complicity in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan <b>church</b> <b>would</b> continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E

40|$|Two unnamed children, {{born from}} a Cuban and Chinese settler, were baptized {{in the city}} of Havana.

25|$|Some denominations, {{typically}} Roman Catholicism, {{recognize the}} doctrine of Purgatory, while many Protestant and Eastern Orthodox <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> not use the same terminology, the former {{on the basis of}} their own sola scriptura doctrine, combined with their exclusion of 2 Maccabees from the Protestant Canon of the Bible; the latter because the Orthodox Churches consider Purgatory a non-essential doctrine.|$|R
