40|$|The {{measurement}} of electrical conductivity using eddy current (electro magnetic induction) sensors {{is the most}} promising solution for validation of metal <b>coins</b> in <b>coin</b> <b>handling</b> <b>devices,</b> as the electrical conductivity is a very distinctive property of specific alloys. Low cost, simple and robust nature, and also possibility for high-speed precise measurements are the advantages of electromagnetic sensors. Multi-frequency scanning the coins under test at various field penetration depths is preferred due to the sophisticated "construction" of various alloys in nowadays coins. Air-core measurement coils have an additional advantage-a possibility to measure absolute values of conductivity without repetitive calibration of sensors and the measurement systems. Development of solutions for eddycurrent validation of metal coins has been investigated together with comparing the experimental results with the values derived from theoretical models. Frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 MHz have been considered (particularly up to 500 kHz for precision measurements) and conductivity values to be measured from 4 to 40 % of IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard) conductivity (about 60 MS/m). The results demonstrate that the precise, highspeed, low-cost and robust coin validation system can be developed {{on the basis of}} air-core coil arrays...|$|R

40|$|With {{an aging}} {{population}} {{there is a growing}} need to assist people with disabilities. Particularly crucial is assisting people who cannot stand between positions necessary for everyday living, such as from a wheelchair to the toilet. It is unsafe to transfer people with direct manual techniques, thus a patient <b>handling</b> <b>device</b> is required. To reduce the burden on the healthcare system it is beneficial for disabled people to be cared for in-home. Many in-home caregivers may be physically impaired, thus patient <b>handling</b> <b>devices</b> for this use must require as little effort as possible. This thesis found that existing manual patient <b>handling</b> <b>devices</b> contained significant weaknesses when used for in-home care and there is potential to improve upon them. Expert interviews, computer modelling and physical models were used to develop a novel patient <b>handling</b> <b>device</b> which addresses these identified weaknesses. A {{reduction in the number of}} operator tasks, operation time and operation force was achieved. A method of supporting the patient solely by their upper body is required by the novel patient <b>handling</b> <b>device,</b> though an acceptable way of incorporating this has yet to be achieved. Testing of an upper body enclosure support revealed that a person may be supported by their lower thorax without substantial clamping or physical effort from the patient. Such a support has potential to be developed into an acceptable solution. Further development and testing in variable conditions encountered during practical patient handling is required...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} trends of space research is a delivery of the soil samples of the investigated object to the Earth. In delivering the soil samples the most important stage is a stage to pick-and-place it in the transportation (returned) capsule. The aim of this work is to develop a reloading device of the suction head to provide picking up the soil of Mars’ satellite “Phobos”. This device is designed for use {{as a part of the}} spacecraft "Phobos-Grunt". The presented device belongs to a manipulating type of devices and consists of a manipulator and a <b>handling</b> <b>device.</b> The manipulator provides picking up the Phobos surface soil samples and their placing into a capsule, which is in the block of the <b>handling</b> <b>device.</b> Upon the capsule has been filled it is reloaded from the soil intake area to the area of capsule transfer, which is provided by means of a compactly piled gas-filled shell. In operation there is a number of restrictions. The tolerable capsule opening size to take-in the soil samples can be up to 10 mm with 1003 cm free soil capsule volume. When picking up the soil the magnitude of the axial force of the manipulator is restricted.
