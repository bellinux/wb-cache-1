40|$|The {{combination}} {{forms of}} the hydrate dissociation methods in different well systems are divided into 6 main patterns. Dissociation processes of methane hydrate in porous media using the inverted five-spot water flooding method (Pattern 4) are investigated by the experimental observation and numerical simulation. In situ methane hydrate is synthesized in the Cubic Hydrate Simulator (CHS), a 5. 832 -L <b>cubic</b> <b>reactor.</b> A center vertical well is used as the hot water injection well, while the four vertical wells at the corner are the gas and water production wells. The gas production begins simultaneously with the hot water injection, while after approximately 20 min of compression, the water begins to be produced. One of the common characteristics of the inverted five-spot water flooding method is that both the gas and water production rates decrease with {{the reduction of the}} hydrate dissociation rate. The evaluation of the energy efficiency ratio might indicate the inverted five-spot water flooding as a promising gas producing method from the hydrate reservoir. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In present study, {{the center}} {{composite}} design in response surface methodology (RSM) was firstly applied {{to optimize the}} synthesis of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) -TiO 2 composite photocatalyst. Twenty-eight composite photocatalysts were prepared by adjusting four operating parameters (amount of MWCNTs, amount of TiF 4, hydrothermal temperature and hydrothermal time) at five levels by the method of multiple variable analysis. The structural, optical and morphological properties of the prepared composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-visible absorption spectra and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Based on the experimental design, a semi-empirical expression was firstly established and subsequently applied to predict the photocatalytic degradation activity of the prepared composite photocatalysts to gaseous styrene in a <b>cubic</b> flow-through <b>reactor.</b> The {{results showed that the}} experimental photocatalytic degradation efficiencies using the differently prepared MWCNTs-TiO 2 composite photocatalysts matched with the theoretically predicted values very well with a high correlation (R 2 = 0. 9790). Based on the theoretical and experimental results, the optimum synthesis parameters for the composite photocatalyst within the experimental ranges were 0. 01 g MWCNTs, 0. 14 g TiF 4, and 120 ?C hydrothermally treated for 87. 2 h. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency of gaseous styrene using the MWCNTs-TiO 2 composite photocatalyst synthesized under the optimum parameters reached 74. 4 %. All these demonstrates that the experimental design and theoretical prediction methods used in this work would have great significance in designing and developing high performance photocatalysts for environmental remediation and solar energy conversion.

40|$|Laboratory and {{pilot-plant}} {{investigations have}} shown the technical feasibility of removing nitrates from neutralized acid wastes from uranium purification processes by biological denitrification, a dissimilatory {{process in which the}} nitrate ion is reduced to nitrogen gas by specific bacteria. The process requires anaerobic conditions and an organic carbon source, as well as other life-sustaining constituents. These denitrification studies produced process design information on a columnar denitrification plant and on continuous- flow, stirred-bed reactors. Denitrification, using packed columns, was found to be desirable for soluble salts, such as those of sodium and ammonium; denitrification, using stirred reactors, was found to be desirable for mixtures containing insoluble salts, such as those of calcium and aluminum. Packed columns were found to have denitrification rates ranging up to 122 grams of nitrate per day per cubic decimeter of column volume; stirred-bed reactors have been shown to have reaction rates near 10 grams of nitrate per day per <b>cubic</b> decimeter of <b>reactor</b> volume. The continuous-flow, stirred-bed reactors were selected for scaleup studies because of the solids-removal problems associated with packed columns when operating on feeds containing high concentrations of insoluble salts or ions which form insoluble salts with the products of the denitrification reaction.

40|$|Hydrogen gas has {{tremendous}} potential as an environmentally acceptable energy carrier for vehicles, but most hydrogen is generated from nonrenewable fossil fuels such as natural gas. Here, {{we show that}} efficient and sustainable hydrogen production is possible from any type of biodegradable organic matter by electrohydrogenesis. In this process, protons and electrons released by exoelectrogenic bacteria in specially designed reactors (based on modifying microbial fuel cells) are catalyzed to form hydrogen gas through {{the addition of a}} small voltage to the circuit. By improving the materials and reactor architecture, hydrogen gas was produced at yields of 2. 01 – 3. 95 mol/mol (50 – 99 % of the theoretical maximum) at applied voltages of 0. 2 to 0. 8 V using acetic acid, a typical dead-end product of glucose or cellulose fermentation. At an applied voltage of 0. 6 V, the overall energy efficiency of the process was 288 % based solely on electricity applied, and 82 % when the heat of combustion of acetic acid was included in the energy balance, at a gas production rate of 1. 1 m 3 of H 2 per <b>cubic</b> meter of <b>reactor</b> per day. Direct high-yield hydrogen gas production was further demonstrated by using glucose, several volatile acids (acetic, butyric, lactic, propionic, and valeric), and cellulose at maximum stoichiometric yields of 54 – 91 % and overall energy efficiencies of 64 – 82 %. This electrohydrogenic process thus provides a highly efficient route for producing hydrogen gas from renewable and carbon-neutral biomass resources...|$|R
