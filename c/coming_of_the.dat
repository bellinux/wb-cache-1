5|$|No rivers or streams {{ran into}} the sound but note that early maps {{conflict}} and show that the River Cadoxton, originating from feeder brooks meeting at Michaelston-le-pit between Ely, Leckwith and Wenvoe to the north-east, passed through Dinas Powys and Sully Moors and bypassed the Barry shoreline to meet the sea near Cold Knap Point before decades later, Cold Knap promenade and Watchtower Bay was developed. With the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> docks, the River Cadoxton was re-routed from Sully moors through what was later to become the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later still, the chemical complexes in the area, to discharge south-east of the dock's south-east breakwater at the Bendricks. For many years after the last war, with {{the dissolution of the}} SRD and <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical works, effluent discharge from some of them, was carried along the river to the sea and turned the water white in colour and it gave off a pungent effervescent odour until bylaws brought this pollution to an end and gradually the hitherto white shoreline at that area, returned to its normal sandstone colour.|$|E
5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.|$|E
5|$|After the Gadsden Purchase, {{southern}} Arizona's social elite, {{including the}} Estevan Ochoa, Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad in the 1880s. When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, {{it sought to}} employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a work ethic and leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians. This mixture failed to stabilize the remote area, which lacked formal social, political, and economic organization in the years from the Gadsden Purchase to the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like the Acts of Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mongols to the Western world, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers convinced themselves that they had found him in Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{built the}} Willow Run Expressway to carry workers from Detroit {{to the defense}} plants at Willow Run Airport. This {{expressway}} was numbered {{as a part of}} US112 initially. During the 1950s, additional highways were converted to freeways before the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interstate Highway System in 1957. The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was US24A in the southeastern corner of the state, which became part of Interstate 75 (I-75) in 1959.|$|E
5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E

Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E
5|$|Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. Prints {{of their}} {{photographs}} of the fairies, {{along with a few}} other items including a first edition of Doyle's book The <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fairies, were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the National Science and Media Museum), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Morales {{appeared}} in the miniseries Spider-Men, in which he encounters the Spider-Man of the mainstream Marvel universe. In June 2013, the character {{appeared in}} the climax of Age of Ultron #10, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or Earth-616 {{as it is known}} in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the space-time continuum {{as a result of the}} time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream Marvel Galactus, an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Francesca Tinti {{has arrived}} at a {{different}} conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, {{more so than the}} Liber Wigorniensis, came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the Prefatio is silent about monks, the Enucleatio is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (ad victum monachorum). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate {{in the second half of}} the 11th century. The <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of Westbury-on-Trym, would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.|$|E

He played {{in all of}} Ireland's pool games, <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bench against the United States and Australia, and starting against Russia. In the Russia game, he became Ireland's highest points scorer in World Cup matches. He {{was selected}} ahead of Jonathan Sexton for Ireland's crunch Pool C game against Italy, and scored 16 points as Ireland won 36–6. He retained the fly-half jersey for Ireland's quarter-final against Wales, scoring a penalty and a conversion as Ireland lost 22–10.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper.

5|$|Palestinian cuisine {{consists}} of foods from or commonly eaten by Palestinians—which includes {{those living in}} Palestine, Israel, Jordan, refugee camps in nearby countries {{as well as by}} the Palestinian diaspora. The cuisine is a diffusion of the cultures of civilizations that settled in the region of Palestine, particularly during and after the Islamic era beginning with the Arab Ummayad conquest, then the eventual Persian-influenced Abbasids and ending with the strong influences of Turkish cuisine, resulting from the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Turks. It is similar to other Levantine cuisines, including Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom. The canal had {{its origins}} in various plans, going back to 1796, to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal, {{bypassing}} Lands End. An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and coal to lime kilns along with {{the removal of the}} resulting quicklime, which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses. This intended canal-link was never completed as planned, as the <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways removed the need for its existence.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) {{canalisation}} of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice.|$|E
