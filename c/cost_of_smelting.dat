50|$|Copper was {{initially}} recovered from sulfide ores by directly smelting the ore in a furnace. The smelters were initially {{located near the}} mines to minimize the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> transport. This avoided the prohibitive <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> transporting the waste minerals and the sulfur and iron present in the copper-containing minerals. However, as the concentration of copper in the ore bodies decreased, the energy <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>smelting</b> the whole ore also became prohibitive, and it became necessary to concentrate the ores first.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the changes in}} the crude steel production volumes implies gradual increase of production since the mid 20 th century. This tendency has been slightly hampered by the economic depression. At the same time, the market requirements enforce improvement {{of the quality of the}} products manufactured on simultaneous minimisation <b>of</b> the production <b>costs.</b> One <b>of</b> the tools applied to solve these problems is mathematical optimisation. The author of this paper has presented an example of application of the multi-criteria optimisation method to improvement of efficiency <b>of</b> steel <b>smelting</b> in an electric arc furnace (EAF) through appropriate choice of the charge scrap. A measurable effect of applying such a methodology of choosing the metal charge is the ability to reduce the unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>smelting...</b>|$|R

The new cast steel was devised in HYDRO-VACUUM company in Grudziądz, where “duplex” cast steel for pump elements is smelted. The {{goal was to}} devise a new grade of “duplex” cast steel of better physicochemical properties and cheaper than now applied. It was demonstrated, that {{there is the possibility}} of devising the new grade of “duplex” cast steel. It is characterized by higher mechanical properties, similar wear resistance and greater corrosion resistance in 15 % water solution of H 2 SO 4 in comparison to now applied “duplex” cast steel. The chemical composition was selected to obtain in microstructure about of 50 % ferrite and 50 % austenite.

60|$|From similar considerations, {{it appears}} that many purely {{mechanical}} improvements, which have, apparently, at least, no peculiar connection with agriculture, nevertheless enable a given amount of food to be obtained with a smaller expenditure of labor. A great improvement in the process <b>of</b> <b>smelting</b> iron would tend to cheapen agricultural implements, diminish the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> railroads, of wagons and carts, ships, and perhaps buildings, and many other things to which iron is not at present applied, because it is too costly; and would thence diminish the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production of food. The same effect would follow from an improvement in those processes {{of what may be}} termed manufacture, to which the material of food is subjected after it is separated from the ground. The first application of wind or water power to grind corn tended to cheapen bread as much as a very important discovery in agriculture would have done; and any great improvement in the construction of corn-mills would have, in proportion, a similar influence.|$|R

25|$|The blowing house method <b>of</b> <b>smelting</b> tin was {{probably}} introduced {{early in the}} 14th century to replace the earliest method <b>of</b> <b>smelting</b> {{which had to be}} done in two stages – a first smelting probably took place near to the tinworks and the roughly smelted metal was taken to a stannary town to be smelted again to produce the final refined product.

It is likely that this tax change was due to the improved smelting process provided by the blowing houses.|$|R
