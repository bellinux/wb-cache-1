5|$|Blatty was a Roman Catholic. In 2012, {{he filed}} a canon law {{petition}} against {{his alma mater}} Georgetown University. According to Blatty, the school for decades has been at variance with Catholic <b>church</b> <b>teaching</b> by inviting speakers who support abortion rights, and disobeying Pope John Paul II's instructions issued to church-affiliated {{colleges and universities in}} 1990.|$|E
5|$|Official <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> {{allows for}} medical {{procedures}} and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus.

5|$|In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England {{disapproved of}} {{divorced}} people remarrying in church while a former spouse was still living. The monarch {{was required to}} be in communion with the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> and {{his role as the}} Church's ex officio head.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic <b>Church's</b> <b>teaching</b> {{in support}} of labor unions is not just {{something}} of the past. The <b>Church</b> <b>teaches</b> that in today's situation, unions are an indispensable part of a just social order.|$|R
50|$|The LDS <b>Church</b> <b>teaches</b> that abusive behavior, whether physical, sexual, verbal, or emotional, {{is a sin}} and is {{condemned}} unreservedly by the <b>church.</b> The <b>church</b> <b>teaches</b> that {{victims of}} abuse should report it to their bishop, and should be assured {{that they are not}} to blame for the abuse.|$|R

5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted <b>Church</b> <b>teaching.</b> Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
25|$|Practices and {{procedures}} of episcopal inquisitions could vary from one diocese to another, {{depending on the}} resources available to individual bishops and their relative interest or disinterest. Convinced that <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> contained revealed truth, the first recourse of bishops was that of persuasio. Through discourse, debates, and preaching, they sought to present a better explanation of <b>Church</b> <b>teaching.</b> This approach often proved very successful.|$|E

25|$|The Chinook writing, or Wawa shorthand, was {{developed}} by Father Jean-Marie-Raphaël Le Jeune in the early 1890s for writing in Chinook Jargon, Lillooet, Thompson, Okanagan, and English, with the intended purpose of bringing literacy and <b>church</b> <b>teaching</b> to the first nations in the Catholic Diocese of Kamloops. The result was three decades' publication of the Chinook Jargon language Kamloops Wawa.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) {{clarified}} {{the criteria}} for the funding of community development programs by the Catholic Campaign for Human Development. One criterion was exclusion of organizations advancing activities that run counter to Catholic teaching, examples of which included those that support or promote same-sex marriage or discrimination. In 2016, the President and the Chair of USCCB denounced US Vice President Joe Biden for officiating at the wedding of a same-sex couple, arguing that Catholic politicians should only do what is expressly in line with Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>teaching.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Protestant Reformation critics, the Council of Trent reaffirmed purgatory as already {{taught by the}} First Council of Lyon, confining itself to the concepts of purification after death and the efficacy of prayers for the dead. It simply affirmed the existence of purgatory and the great value of praying for the deceased, but sternly instructed preachers not to push beyond that and distract, confuse, and mislead the faithful with unnecessary speculations concerning the nature and duration of purgatorial punishments. It thus forbade presentation as <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> of the elaborate medieval speculation that had grown up around the concept of purgatory.|$|E
25|$|Such {{individuals}} and groups make the general argument that the Catholic Church's line on homosexuality emphasises the physical dimension of the act {{at the expense of}} higher moral, personal and spiritual goals. Gay and lesbian Catholics also feel that the practice of total, life-long sexual denial risks personal isolation. John J. McNeill writes that since gay people experience their sexual orientation as innately created, to believe that it is therefore a tendency towards evil would require believing in a sadistic God; and that it is preferable to believe that this element of <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> is mistaken in arguing that God would behave in such a way.|$|E

25|$|For example, <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> heavily {{influenced}} the legal concept of marriage. During the Gregorian Reform, the Church developed and codified {{a view of}} marriage as a sacrament. In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed and established a minimum age for marriage. The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union a binding contract, with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities. Although the Church abandoned tradition to allow women {{the same rights as}} men to dissolve a marriage, in practice, when an accusation of infidelity was made, men were granted dissolutions more frequently than women.|$|E
25|$|Within the Roman Catholic Church, {{there has}} existed a {{sometimes}} tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See due to questioning of official <b>church</b> <b>teaching</b> and papal directives, {{such as those}} on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. Usually, this theological free thinking is academically oriented, being prevalent at the university level. From this standpoint, the function of this debate is less to challenge the magisterium than to publicize the results of historical research or to illustrate the church's ability to compromise in a pluralist society based on shared values that do not always align with religious teachings. This has not prevented Popes from appointing Jesuits to powerful positions in the church. John Paul II and Benedict XVI together appointed ten Jesuit Cardinals to notable jobs. Under Benedict, Archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer was Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Federico Lombardi was Vatican Press Secretary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> is that Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter a {{new life}} of {{salvation}} through repentance whose purpose is {{to share in the}} life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the imitation of Christ and hesychasm, cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer. Each life occurs within the life of the Church {{as a member of the}} body of Christ. It is then through the fire of God's love in the action of the Holy Spirit that each member becomes more holy, more wholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the next. The Church teaches that everyone, being born in God's image, is called to theosis, fulfillment of the image in likeness to God. God the creator, having divinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by cooperatively accepting His gift of grace.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, 1896, John Augustine Zahm, {{a well-known}} American Holy Cross priest {{who had been}} a professor of physics and chemistry at the Catholic University of Notre Dame, Indiana, and was then Procurator General of his Order in Rome, published Evolution and Dogma, arguing that <b>Church</b> <b>teaching,</b> the Bible, and evolution did not conflict. The book was denounced to the Congregation of the Index, who decided to condemn the book but did not publish the corresponding decree, and consequently, the book was never included on the Index. Zahm, who had returned to the United States as Provincial superior of his Order, wrote to his French and Italian editors in 1899, asking them to withdraw the book from the market; however, he never recanted his views. In the meantime his book (in an Italian translation with the imprimatur of Siena) had had a great impact on Geremia Bonomelli, the Bishop of Cremona in Italy, who added an appendix to a book of his own, summarizing and recommending Zahm's views. Bonomelli too was pressured, and retracted his views in a public letter, also in 1898.|$|E
500|$|According to <b>Church</b> <b>teaching,</b> spousal love is {{intended}} to form an unbroken, two-fold end: the union of husband and wife and the transmission of life. The unitive aspect includes the transference of each partner's being [...] "so that {{they are no longer}} two but one flesh." [...] The sacrament of matrimony is viewed as God's sealing the consent which binds the partners together. <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> on the marital state requires spousal acceptance of each other's failures and faults, and the recognition that the [...] "call to holiness in marriage" [...] is one that requires a process of spiritual growth and conversion that can last throughout life.|$|E
500|$|Explaining <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> of this commandment, Kreeft cites Saint Thomas Aquinas, who wrote, [...] "An evil desire {{can only}} be {{overcome}} by a stronger good desire." [...] The US Bishops suggest {{that this can be}} achieved through cultivation of goodwill, humility and gratitude for one's own and others' blessings, while trusting in God's grace. Kreeft explains that Saint Paul the Apostle illustrated the concept in his letter to the Philippians when he listed his worldly credentials as a respected Jew and stated, [...] "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." [...] As Jesus stated, [...] "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own [...] <b>Church</b> <b>teaching</b> on the tenth commandment is directed toward this same attitude toward worldly goods, termed [...] "poverty of spirit".|$|E
