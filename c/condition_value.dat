40|$|Over years, cloud {{computing}} has been rapidly chang-ing {{the shape of}} modern computing environment. The {{problem of how to}} keep the confidentiality of user data against malicious entities including a cloud service provider has been recognized as a significant issue. This prob-lem becomes even more complicated if a data is shared among multiple users. Recently, the idea of proxy re-encryption has been introduced to support secure data sharing among group members in cloud environment. However, in this scheme, a malicious user can collude with the server to decrypt unauthorized messages. The conditional proxy re-encryption (CPRE) aims to fix this problem by introducing a <b>condition</b> <b>value</b> into message encryption process and re-encryption key generation. We observe that CPRE becomes significantly inefficient when the membership of the group changes very actively {{and the size of the}} group is large since a new <b>condition</b> <b>value</b> is selected and re-encryption keys have to be generated for each user whenever the group membership is changed. This paper introduces a new CPRE in which the con-dition value is not associated with re-encryption keys. Whenever a group membership is changed, only a new <b>condition</b> <b>value</b> is distributed to the users via cloud server. As a result, the overhead of each user becomes signifi-cantly reduced at each membership change...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Conditional PRE (CPRE) {{is a novel}} {{public key}} {{primitive}} which enables the group sharing of confidential data without revealing its plaintext or decryption key to outside the group member. Previously, several efforts are made to facilitate CPRE in group data sharing in cloud environment. The main drawback of the state-of-art CPRE schemes for this purpose is that whenever the group member changes, the originator of the data needs to download all of the existing data on the cloud, encrypt them again with a new <b>condition</b> <b>value,</b> and uploads them to the cloud. As a result, they are not suitable for secure big data sharing among group member in cloud environment. In this paper, we introduce a new CPRE called the outsourcing CPRE scheme (O-CPRE) which reduces the client overhead drastically. When {{the membership of the}} group changes, in O-CPRE, the originator only needs to select a new <b>condition</b> <b>value</b> and upload it to the cloud. In addition, O-CPRE will move a part of client overhead at the initial setup stage and at the decryption of each message from the client to the cloud. As a result, O-CPRE is much more suitable for secure big data sharing in cloud environment than the other existing schemes.

The sensor is formed by an amorphous carbon layer with piezoresistive characteristics. The sensor can measure force components in different directions (x,y) and can determine a torque. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - System to control and/or monitor and/or regulate a vehicle or aircraft has a sensor to receive an operating <b>condition</b> <b>value,</b> and a signal processing unit. The sensor is formed by an amorphous carbon layer with piezoresistive characteristics. The sensor can measure force components in different directions (x,y) and can determine a torque. Two sensors (1, 1, 2, 2) are used for each direction, so that a constant load in the x-direction generates an identical signal at both sensors, and the same applies for the sensors in the y-direction. A difference at the y-sensors shows a torque around the y-axis which can be determined from the force difference and the known gap. USE - For use on or in a rail vehicle and the permanent way rail, to register the load distribution over a load-carrying surface or an aircraft cargo hold surface, {{the center of gravity}} of a load, the force distribution at vehicle wheel mountings, the acceleration or wheel slip or imbalance of vehicle wheel or low tire pressures, the load or load distribution at a vehicle seat, the load or its distribution at an airbag control, the forces on a motor suspension etc. ADVANTAGE - The novel vehicle/aircraft sensor system gives increased security with improved comfort.
