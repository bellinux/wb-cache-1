5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.|$|E

25|$|Sick sinus syndrome* is most {{commonly}} seen in female Miniature Schnauzers. It {{is characterized by}} sinoatrial node dysfunction and may include atrioventricular node disease and bundle branch block. Electrocardiogram findings include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial heart block, and atrial tachycardia. The major <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> is fainting (syncope).|$|E
25|$|Once the {{intermediate}} host is eaten by the definitive host {{such as a}} dog or human, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction within the gut to create macrogamonts and microgamonts. Most definitive hosts do not show any <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> or symptoms. Fusion of a macrogamont and a microgamont creates a zygote which develops into an oocyst. The oocyst is passed through the faeces completing the life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Hypersecretion is {{more common}} than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most {{frequent}} abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors, termed prolactinomas. Prolactinomas may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as prolactin tends to suppress the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus and in turn decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, therefore disrupting the ovulatory cycle. Such hormonal changes may manifest as amenorrhea and infertility in females as well as impotence in males. Inappropriate lactation (galactorrhoea) is another important <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> of prolactinomas.|$|E
40|$|Pheochromocytomas are {{uncommon}} {{tumors of the}} {{adrenal medulla}} in canines that can be functional or non-functional. Functional tumors secrete catecholamines causing sporadic <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> due to sporadic hormone release. Non-functional tumors can cause <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> related to their space-occupying nature and invasion of regional vasculature and other structures. Pheochromocytomas are difficult to diagnose based on <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> and history alone. However, detection of an adrenal mass on abdominal ultrasound in correlation with <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> raises <b>clinical</b> suspicion in some cases.

25|$|Colic in horses {{is defined}} as {{abdominal}} pain, {{but it is a}} <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> rather than a diagnosis. The term colic can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract. The most common forms of colic are gastrointestinal in nature and are most often related to colonic disturbance. There are a variety of different causes of colic, some of which can prove fatal without surgical intervention. Colic surgery is usually an expensive procedure as it is major abdominal surgery, often with intensive aftercare. Among domesticated horses, colic {{is the leading cause of}} premature death. The incidence of colic in the general horse population has been estimated between 4 and 10 percent over the course of their lifetime. Clinical signs of colic generally require treatment by a veterinarian.|$|E

2500|$|Low-frequency {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} is present in many patients with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a [...] "third window." [...] Vibrations entering the ear canal and middle ear are then abnormally diverted through the superior semicircular canal and up into the intracranial space where they become absorbed instead of being registered as sound in the hearing center, the cochlea. Due to the difference in resistance between the normal round window and the pathological dehiscence window this hearing loss is more serious in the lower frequencies and may initially be mistaken for otosclerosis. [...] In some patients there is true enhancement of low frequency hearing via bone conducted sound. [...] A <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> of this phenomenon {{is the ability of}} the patient to hear (not feel) a tuning fork placed upon the ankle bone.|$|E
2500|$|The age {{at which}} CP is {{diagnosed}} is important, but there is disagreement over {{what is the best}} age to make the diagnosis. The earlier CP is diagnosed correctly, the better the opportunities are to provide the child with physical and education help, but there might be a greater chance that CP will be confused with another problem, especially if the child is 18 months of age or younger. Infants may have temporary problems with muscle tone or control that can be confused with CP, which is permanent. A metabolism disorder or tumors in the nervous system may appear to be CP; metabolic disorders, in particular, can produce brain problems that look like CP on an MRI. Disorders that deteriorate the white matter in the brain and problems that cause spasms and weakness in the legs, may be mistaken for CP when they first appear early in life. However, these disorders get worse over time, and CP does not (although it may change in character). In infancy it may not be possible {{to tell the difference between}} them. In the UK, not being able to sit independently by the age of 8 months is regarded as a <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> for further monitoring. [...] Fragile X syndrome (a cause of autism and intellectual disability) and general intellectual disability must also be ruled out. Cerebral palsy specialist John McLaughlin recommends waiting until the child is 36 months of age before making a diagnosis, because by that age, motor capacity is easier to assess.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> {{have implications for}} diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the inter-observer agreement of <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> in pre-school children presenting to primary care. Methods A nested study comparing two clinical assessments within a prospective cohort of 256 pre-school children with acute cough recruited from eight general practices in Leicestershire, UK. We examined agreement (using kappa statistics) between unstandardised and standardised clinical assessments of tachypnoea, chest signs and fever. Results Kappa values were poor or fair for all <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> (range 0. 12 to 0. 39) with chest signs the most reliable. Conclusions Primary care clinicians should be aware that <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> may be unreliable when making diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decisions in pre-school children with cough. Future research should aim to further our understanding of how best to identify abnormal <b>clinical</b> <b>signs.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The lack of core outcome {{sets for}} atopic eczema (AE) {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} for advancing evidence-based treatment. The global Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative has already defined <b>clinical</b> <b>signs,</b> symptoms, quality of life, and long-term control of flares as core outcome domains for AE trials. This article deals with the standardization of measurement instruments to assess <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> of AE. To resolve the current lack of standardization of the assessment of <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> of AE, we followed a structured process of systematic reviews and international consensus sessions to identify 1 core outcome measurement instrument for assessment of <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> in all future AE trials. Systematic reviews indicated that from 16 different instruments identified to assess <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> of AE, only the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and the objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index were identified as extensively validated. The EASI has adequate validity, responsiveness, internal consistency, and intraobserver reliability.
