50|$|Polled {{livestock}} are {{preferred by}} many farmers {{for a variety}} of reasons, the foremost being that horns can pose a physical danger to humans, other livestock and equipment. Horns may also interfere with equipment used with livestock (such as a <b>cattle</b> <b>crush),</b> or they may become damaged during handling.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{livestock}} hurdles, {{known as}} panels or [...] "pipe panels" [...] in the USA, {{are used for}} sorting, handling or loading animals where permanent fencing is impractical or uneconomic. They are made of steel or aluminium, and vary in size. For sheep, they are usually 6 ft long and 3 ft high, while for cattle they are commonly 9 ft or more long and 5 ft high. They are usually joined by pins or hooks, both {{to each other and}} to handling facilities such as a <b>cattle</b> <b>crush.</b> While individual hurdles are easily knocked over by animals, when joined in a ring or to solid objects they make a secure fence. Single hurdles are often used as a temporary gate or to block a gap in a hedge. Hurdles are often supplied in a set together with a mobile <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> and a trailer for easy transport.|$|E
5000|$|The {{animal to}} be dehorned is usually restrained, either using a {{dehorning}} table or with chemical restraint —sedation. This {{ensures that the}} dehorning procedure can be done safely and properly. Young calves are run through a head gate (similar to a <b>cattle</b> <b>crush)</b> or haltered. Calves {{more than a few}} months old are held in a head gate and their head restrained with a dehorning table or chin bar. Smaller animals like sheep and goats may be restrained by hand or with use of halters.|$|E

5000|$|Stockmen {{who work}} with cattle in the Top End are known as ringers and are often only {{employed}} for the dry season which lasts from April to October. A station hand is an employee, who is involved in routine duties on a rural property or station and this may also involve caring for livestock, too. With pastoral properties facing dire recruitment problems as young men are lured into the booming mining industry, young women from the cities are becoming a common sight on outback stations, often attracted by {{the chance to work}} with horses. Some stations are now making changes for the employment of women by building female living quarters and installing hydraulic <b>cattle</b> <b>crushes</b> etc. An associated occupation is that of the drover, who, like the shearer may be an itinerant worker, and is employed in tending to livestock while they are travelling on a stock route.|$|R
50|$|The river {{has long}} {{been used as a}} source of power for mills, and many are {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book. At one point there were 22 mills on the river, and more on its tributaries. At various times they have been used for grinding grain, fulling wool, rolling oats, <b>crushing</b> <b>cattle</b> cake, leather dressing, paper production and gunpowder manufacture. Willey Mill was still in use in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} the race is usually {{determined}} {{by the size of}} the herd [...] - [...] a longer one requires less penning-up of a larger herd. Longer races may be curved, to improve the movement of the animals. However races longer than 24 ft tend to cause trouble with the flow of the animals into the loading chute or <b>cattle</b> <b>crush.</b> A walkway may be provided on the outside of the race, on one or both sides, to allow handlers easier handling, examination or treatment of animals from above.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} cowboy or stockman {{captured and}} secured an animal for branding by roping it, laying it {{over on the}} ground, tying its legs together, and applying a branding iron that had been heated in a fire. Modern ranch practice has moved toward use of chutes where animals can be run into a confined area and safely secured while the brand is applied. Two types of restraint are the <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> or squeeze chute (for larger cattle), which may close {{on either side of}} a standing animal, or a branding cradle, where calves are caught in a cradle which is rotated so that the animal is lying on its side.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> (in UK, New Zealand, Ireland and Australia), squeeze chute (North America), [...] {{standing}} stock, {{or simply}} stock (North America, Ireland) is a strongly built stall or cage for holding cattle, horses, or other livestock safely {{while they are}} examined, marked, or given veterinary treatment. Cows may be made to suckle calves in a crush. For {{the safety of the}} animal and the people attending it, a close-fitting crush may be used to ensure the animal stands [...] "stock still". The overall purpose of a crush is to hold an animal still to minimise the risk of injury to both the animal and the operator while work on the animal is performed.|$|E
50|$|The {{central core}} of the <b>cattle</b> yards {{comprises}} <b>crushes</b> for de-horning, cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and holding yards. The de-horning and cutting <b>crush,</b> <b>cattle</b> dip and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the cattle dip, which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the dip are of concrete with concrete rendered steps and pit. Bush timber uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular holding yard over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|R
60|$|Venters {{raised the}} bridle of {{his horse and}} {{followed}} the broad <b>cattle</b> trail. The <b>crushed</b> sage resembled {{the path of a}} monster snake. In a few miles of travel he passed several cows and calves that had escaped the drive. Then he stood on the last high bench of the slope with the floor of the valley beneath. The opening of the canyon showed in a break of the sage, and the cattle trail paralleled it {{as far as he could}} see. That trail led to an undiscovered point where Oldring drove cattle into the pass, and many a rider who had followed it had never returned. Venters satisfied himself that the rustlers had not deviated from their usual course, and then he turned at right angles off the cattle trail and made for the head of the pass.|$|R

We followed both the annual variability of the freezing point of mixed milk produced on one farm and the annual variability of mixed milk from farms supplying milk to one dairy. The {{other part of the}} experimental study was devoted to following the influence of dairy cattle nutrition on the freezing point of milk and the milk composition. In the experiment "Zichlinek" the freezing point of milk values were determined at dairy <b>cattle</b> fed with <b>crushed</b> soybean and at dairy cattle fed with adapted rapeseed cakes. In the experiment "Albrechtice" followed the freezing point of milk and milk composition at a check group fed with soybean and at an experimental group, which was given high portions of adapted rapeseed cakes.

50|$|Cattle crushes may {{be fully}} fixed or mobile; however, most crushes are best {{classified}} as semipermanent, being potentially movable but designed to primarily {{stay in one}} place. A <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> is typically linked to a cattle race (also known as an alley). The front end has a head bail (or neck yoke or head gate) to catch the animal and may have a baulk gate that swings aside to assist in catching the beast. The bail is often adjustable to accommodate animals of different sizes. This bail may incorporate a chin or neck bar to hold the animal's head still. A side lever operates the head bail to capture the animals, with the better types having a rear drop-away safety lever for easier movement of the cattle into the bail. Usually, smaller animals can walk through the head bails incorporated in crushes.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} shows {{that it is possible}} for cattle feeders to obtain additional profits if a consistent technical strategy for trading is applied to the <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> spread. However, when trading costs are introduced, the likelihood of obtaining profit from trading the crush reduces considerably. It also shows that the level of gains from the <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> is related to the month the cattle are marketed. When the crush is used as a hedging strategy it decreases the profit from the feeding operation and reduces the volatility of those returns, helping producers to transfer part of the price risk associated with their production. To provide evidence of these findings, this study utilizes daily prices for 1995 to 2006 of the futures contracts of corn, feeder and live cattle to construct the daily <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> spread for two different combination of futures contracts. These contract combinations suppose that cattle are fed in feedlots for 170 days before being marketed in April and in October.

En este estudio se muestra que es posible para un productor de ganado de carne en EE. UU obtener utilidades adicionales cuando estrategias de operación en el mercado financiero de futuros de Chicago son utilizadas (i. e. la estrategia “cattle crush”). No obstante, los costos de transacción presentes reduce la probabilidad de obtener utilidades mediante la estrategia de análisis técnico. También se muestra que el nivel de ganancia derivado del uso del “cattle crush” está relacionado con el ciclo ganadero en el cual se realice la operación. Cuando el “cattle crush” se utiliza como alternativa para cubrir riesgo, se reduce considerablemente la volatilidad de los retornos de la operación. Este trabajo utiliza precios diarios desde 1995 a 2006 de los contratos a futuro de maíz, ganado flaco y ganado gordo con el fin de tener una muestra suficientemente robusta que permita elaborar conclusiones significativas. El “cattle crush” se construyó utilizado dos diferentes combinaciones de ciclo productivo de ganado (ambos de 170 días), pero que comienzan en fechas distintas: abril y octubre. Adicionalmente, dos escenarios fueron analizados usando el “cattle crush” diferencial: uno en el cual esta estrategia fue usada como estrategia de cobertura antes del inicio de las operaciones (estrategia especulativa) y, el otro, en el cual la estrategia de cobertura se llevó a cabo una vez se inició la actividad productiva</p...|$|E
40|$|Cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) are {{organised}} on {{the basis}} of leadership and dominance in such a manner that a disturbance by an external stressor causes negative effects on their health, productivity, well-being, and behaviour. One of these effects is the excessive release of glucocorticoids, which results in increased alertness. We evaluated the action of exogenous oxytocin (OT) on serum cortisol levels in crossbred Red Angus heifers. Twelve Red Angus crossbred heifers were moved daily from the pasture to the corral in weeks 1 and 2 for adaptation to human contact and handling in the <b>cattle</b> <b>crush.</b> In weeks 3 and 4, they were divided into two groups of six (T 1 and T 2). The T 1 group was administered 20 IU (2 mL) of OT via intramuscular injection and the T 2 group was administered 2 mL of saline solution 0. 85 % (SS). In weeks 5 and 6, they were only contained in the <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> for evaluation. On days 01, 07, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42, blood samples were collected by jugular venepuncture in vacuum tubes without anticoagulants. Then, serum cortisol levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. In the period of adaptation, during weeks 1 and 2, serum cortisol levels decreased in both the groups, with higher levels in the SS group; the same result was obtained in weeks 5 and 6. During treatment, however, {{there was a significant difference}} between the two groups in week 4, with a reduction in cortisol levels in the OT group. This result suggests a modulator effect of OT on neuroendocrine response to stress...|$|E
30|$|In April 2014, an {{outbreak}} of FMD occurred in Kareng communal lands, {{an area that has}} been free from the disease for a long time. It is rare to experience an FMD disease outbreak in the sandveld. According to a veterinary officer, the 2014 outbreak started in Tubu, an area within the swamp, ‘…that <b>cattle</b> <b>crush</b> and the surrounding cattle posts were surrounded with water following the floods and were inaccessible…so they missed the routine vaccination…’ (Expert interview data, veterinary officer, Maun, 2015). However, pastoralists blamed the outbreak on elephants which destroy veterinary fences allowing cattle to cross to the buffalo area or vice versa. Following the outbreak, the Department of Veterinary Services imposed stringent livestock movement protocols on herders. Livestock herding was not allowed except with a permit from the veterinary extension officer, even within the same vaccination area. Pastoralists reported that this resulted in an increase in stray animals, poor herding practices and increased livestock predation as they were not able to conduct routine herding and night kraaling of their animals.|$|E
