5000|$|The four-cylinder {{compound}} cylinders {{were arranged}} horizontally {{on the outside}} and each drove its <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The Kitson-Still {{locomotive}} used different ends of {{the same}} cylinders for steam or diesel propulsion. The crank was above the frame and a gear train of fixed reduction linked it to the <b>centre</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Renault PR180.2 was {{designed}} around {{an interesting and}} unusual concept. Most articulated buses only have one driving axle - either the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> or the rear axle, however, the PR180.2 features two driving axles - centre and rear.|$|E
5000|$|Increase in the <b>centre</b> coupled <b>axle's</b> {{axle load}} from 15.4 Mp to 16.4 Mp ...|$|R
50|$|The four {{coupled axles}} {{were very close}} together, so that tight curves could be negotiated. The <b>centre</b> <b>axles</b> were {{installed}} with side play, which meant the connecting rod had to drive the fourth axle. The wheelbase was only 2.6 metres and, with the overall length of the locomotive being almost 8.5 metres, it had very long overhangs. The result was a relatively rough ride.|$|R
500|$|Three [...] {{diameter}} cylinders {{drove the}} <b>centre</b> coupled <b>axle.</b> The inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1:7.5 but the outside cylinders were horizontal.|$|R
5000|$|The inner {{frame of}} the {{locomotive}} was also used as a water tank. She {{was designed as a}} wet steam locomotive. The boiler had two shell rings and 90 heating tubes. The drive was achieved via a Walschaerts valve gear driving the third axle. The wheels on the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> were made without flanges to improve curve running.|$|E
50|$|The ten-coupled Italian E550 of 1908 had paired motors, {{each with}} a jackshaft. A {{triangular}} rod was carried between these, rotating in synchrony and so always horizontal. This carried a sliding crankpin journal for the <b>centre</b> <b>axle,</b> and bearings for the long coupling rods to the unevenly-spaced pairs of drivers ahead and behind. A similar arrangement {{was used for the}} Swiss Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway Be 5/7 1-E-1 of 1912.|$|E
50|$|The Cleminson {{system is}} not a true bogie, but serves a similar purpose. It {{was based on a}} patent of 1883 by James Cleminson, and was once popular on narrow-gauge rolling stock, e.g. on the Isle of Man and Manx Northern Railways. The vehicle would have three axles and the outer two could pivot to adapt to {{curvature}} of the track. The pivoting was controlled by levers attached to the third (<b>centre)</b> <b>axle,</b> which could slide sideways.|$|E
5000|$|The 44 {{engines of}} this class {{built by the}} Maschinenfabrik Esslingen between 1917 and 1924 were {{intended}} for work on the Geislingen ramp (Geislinger Steige) and the Baden Black Forest line. As a result of good experiences in Austria {{and the fact that}} there was a maximum axle load of only 16 tonnes on those routes, it was decided to produce a twelve-coupled locomotive. The first and last coupled axles were given side-play (Gölsdorf system), the wheel flanges of the two <b>centre</b> <b>axles</b> were reduced by about 15 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Float: A light, two-wheeled {{domestic}} {{delivery vehicle}} with the <b>centre</b> of its <b>axle</b> cranked downward to allow low-loading and {{easy access to}} the goods. It was used particularly for milk delivery.|$|R
50|$|Also a {{cylindrical}} body can be clamped between two <b>axle</b> <b>centres.</b> Here also the dial gauge is mounted over the {{cylindrical body}} {{and thus the}} roundness is measured by similar procedure as above.|$|R
50|$|A classic {{feature of}} these engines was the driver’s cab in {{the centre of}} the vehicle which could be used in both {{directions}} and which jutted out above the engine rooms.In the basic design the V 80 had elements, that were also used on all succeeding diesel locomotive classes: a diesel engine that ran at medium-speed, hydraulic gears, power transmission via the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> by means of universal joints. Originally three different motors were fitted with 800 to 1000 PS; later 1,100 PS MTU motors were installed. All were supercharged V12 four-stroke diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{the same}} piston stroke as their English counterparts and were also equipped with a fork valve gear (Gabelsteuerung). The locomotive OFFENBURG had a Capry valve gear on delivery. The engines had improved running gear however due to their adjustable leaf springs and <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> box. The last engine of this class, EXPANSION No. 15, had a Meyer double rocker (Doppelschwing) valve gear, a larger cylinder bore of 381 mm, higher boiler pressure of 5.0 bar and 101 heating tubes. Its larger heating area generated an increase in power.|$|E
50|$|This {{increase}} {{still did}} not allow sufficient clearance between the boiler barrel and the 60 in diameter coupled wheels. Pockets in the boiler barrel, {{similar to those used}} on the earlier locomotives, were therefore still necessary. The boilers of the first two locomotives, numbers 905 and 906, were fitted with Coale patent safety valves, while numbers 907 and 908 had Ramsbottom safety valves. The eccentrics and motion were actuated from the driving (<b>centre)</b> <b>axle</b> instead of the trailing axle. The firebox had an inside width of 4 ft.|$|E
50|$|The T 3s had a {{wet steam}} engine with two {{cylinders}} {{that drove the}} <b>centre</b> coupled <b>axle.</b> The slide valves were worked by an outside Allan valve gear. The water supply was stored in a well tank between the frame under the boiler; the coal bunkers were {{on the left and}} right hand side of the firebox. In front of each one was a filler pipe for the water tank.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet Union used a {{different}} solution to hammer blow with their 2-10-4 locomotive design. The cylinders were placed above the <b>centre</b> driving <b>axle.</b> Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods {{on both ends}} which transferred power to the wheels. The idea was to balance the driving forces on the wheels, allowing the counterweights on the wheels to be smaller and reducing [...] "hammer blow" [...] on the track.|$|R
500|$|The MSC Railway's steam {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} to negotiate the tight-radius curves of the sidings and industrial tracks on which they ran. Originally only hence specifying 0-4-0 wheel arrangements, later 0-6-0 locomotives - purchased to cope with increasing traffic and loads - had flangeless <b>centre</b> <b>axles,</b> whilst the coupling rods had a hinged central section that permitted several inches of lateral play. A long term user of Hudswell Clarke, from their steam through to diesel locomotives, like many industrial railways later motive power was often provided by the purchase of refurbished former [...] "big-four" [...] operated types, with the advantage that crew were hence readily available to operate these types. Post-WWII purchases included several war surplus Hunslet 'Austerity' 0-6-0 saddle tanks; the last steam locomotive types purchased for the MSC Railway. A fleet of diesel locomotives was purchased between 1959 and 1966, including 18 0-4-0 diesels from the Rolls-Royce-owned Sentinel Waggon Works from 1964-66. These enabled the MSC Railways to complete its conversion from steam on 6 July 1966, {{more than three years}} before British Railways.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} rationalise wagon {{maintenance}} the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> {{was removed from}} 1920 {{on many of the}} six-wheeled compartment coaches, because it had been established that this had no negative impact on the riding qualities. In addition, in order to overcome the pressing shortage of coaches following the ceasefire reparations of 1918/19, another 500 four-wheeled compartment coaches of Prussian design were ordered (50 seconds and 450 Wagen third class coaches). In addition, due to the great shortage of wagons, many former Prussian coaches were reallocated to the south German railway divisions so that they could now be seen across the entire German Empire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{drive is}} {{achieved}} using a 12 cylinder Maybach GT06-diesel motor {{capable of producing}} [...] This engine is an evolutionary development of the type G05, which was installed from 1932 in various railcars including the Flying Hamburger. The locomotive is driven {{by means of a}} hydraulic transmission by Voith via a jackshaft and coupling rods to the three axles, a concept that had also been used on earlier shunting engines such as the Class V 36. The <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> has about 30 mm of lateral play. Between the second and third axle there is a jack shaft.The locomotives have shunting and running gears.|$|E
50|$|Running {{the bridge}} out is {{effected}} by pushing it along its rails until the outer two wheels {{are at the}} edge of the granite sill of the ditch. When the bridge is pushed beyond this point the two outer wheels do not descend the slopes of the granite slabs but instead the bridge remains in a horizontal position. This is due to the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> being offset from the centre of the girders causing the bridge to run on its inner two wheels. The middle two wheels follow along the trays. When the bridge is just less than halfway out, the ends of the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> then engage in the cups of the lifting arms. The middle two wheels partially descend the slopes of the granite sill. The bridge continues to move out, its outer end dipping below the horizontal, its inner wheels still running along the trays of the courtyard. The weight of the bridge, at the point where the centre of gravity of the lifting arms is beyond the pivot point of the arms and the stays, causes the bridge mechanism to descend, its wheels running up the vertical racers set into the wall of the pit. At a point where the inner wheels are at the top of the slope down the granite sill, the outer ends of the girders and the outer wheels hit curved sprung metal guides.These guide the outer end of the bridge upwards so that the ends of the girders come to rest on the lip of the granite slab, the inner wheels descending the slope of the inner granite slab. The inner end of each girder is angled to form a close fit with the granite slab.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame is}} of the girder type, cast of {{vanadium}} steel. The twin-axle leading bogie has side play of ±80 mm, the rear truck of Adams type ±60 mm. The <b>centre</b> coupled <b>axle,</b> which is the driving one, has its flange reduced by 10 mm to allow negotiate curves of 160 m radius. The springs of the coupled axles and trailing truck are mounted above the axle boxes and are mutually joined by means of rockers.|$|R
5000|$|The Class ED62 {{locomotives}} {{were created}} between 1974 and 1979 by modifying the 18 earlier JNR Class ED61 Bo-Bo electric locomotives {{with the addition}} of a <b>centre</b> non-driven <b>axle.</b> Rebuilding was carried out at JNR's Nagano Works. The primary aim of rebuilding was to reduce the axle load (from 15 t to 13 t) for use on the Iida Line, where the class displaced vintage [...] (English Electric) and JNR Class ED19 (Westinghouse) locomotives, and later JNR Class EF10 locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The Grasmücke had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} with a 1.40 m track. Its mainwheels {{were on a}} single axle, {{rubber-sprung}} to a frame of steel V-struts, one mounted transversely from the lower fuselage frame to the <b>axle</b> <b>centre</b> and one on each side, mounted longitudinally, to its ends. There was an internally rubber-sprung tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The piston {{carriages}} were six-wheeled vans, with a driver's platform at each end, as {{they were}} double ended. The driver's position was within the carriage, not in the open. The <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> was unsprung, and the piston assembly was directly connected to it. The driver had a vacuum gauge (a mercury manometer, connected by a metal tube {{to the head of}} the piston. Some vehicles were fitted with speedometers, an invention of Moses Ricardo. As well as a brake, the driver had a by-pass valve which admitted air to the partially exhausted traction tube ahead of the piston, reducing the tractive force exerted. This seems to have been used on the 1 in 50 descent from the flyover. The lever and valve arrangement are shown in a diagram in Samuda's Treatise.|$|E
5000|$|At the IAA in September 2010, Kögel {{presented}} their new vehicles for the forwarding and construction industries on the largest stand {{of all the}} trailer manufacturers. They exhibited the [...] "Container chassis Port 40 multiplex" [...] - a sliding chassis vehicle. They also showed the Euro Trailer Cool, which offers forwarding companies in the refrigerated transport sector {{the advantage of a}} refrigerated body extended by 1.3 m. Kögel offers the optimum trailer for every application with its 2nd generation of the Cargo platform trailer. In addition, they showed a trailer variant as a volume trailer, the [...] "Kögel Mega <b>Centre</b> <b>Axle</b> Trailer“, which is new at Kögel. From the refrigerated vehicle range they presented the revised and extended [...] "Kögel Cool Rail" [...] for rail transport. In the construction sector, where the brand was once present, Kögel now offers the flatbed trailer as a turntable trailer or semi variant. A total of 1,000 orders prove that the products from the traditional brand from southern Germany continue to be in demand.2 ...|$|E
40|$|A {{concept for}} a {{lightweight}} Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) named the Manta {{was designed for}} inspection of the net cages and collection of dead fish at aquaculture facilities. The current thesis presents the initial development and engineering design of the product, including requirements and need findings, material selection, technical solutions and design verification by the finite element method. The Manta has a streamlined body with an internal cavity. Three vertical thrusters are mounted into thin wings on {{the exterior of the}} hull, and two horizontal thrusters are located inside the hull cavity. The ROV will use the suction through the hull created by the main thrusters to collect the dead fish into a rear-mounted net. Harsh environment and rough handling will require a robust design- and material selection. The hull of the Manta has been designed and engineered based on the currently chosen components, which may be changed in the future. Based on the combination of easy manufacturing, good impact properties, low density and low cost, ABS plastic was selected as material for the hull. The hull design is based on 4 mm thick ABS plastic sheets manufactured by vacuum forming, with a total component weight equal to 6, 6 kg. The sections are joined together by adhesives and bolts. The estimated manufacturing cost of the hull is approximately 2000 NOK per unit including tool cost for 100 units. The vertical thrusters, which are located in the wings, must have a low profile. A mechanical design of a so-called rim-driven thruster (RDT) has been developed and the current design has a predicted weight of 1, 7 kg. This is a design where the propeller is fitted permanent magnets on an outer ring instead of being powered by a <b>centre</b> <b>axle.</b> The resulting geometry has a significantly lower profile than conventional ROV thrusters, and a higher torque per length ratio. A thruster prototype and a special designed test rig for the prototype has been developed and manufactured at the IPM workshop. This test rig has been submitted to Argus for completion of their electromagnetic design. Commercially available thrusters will be used for horizontal propulsion. These thrusters have to be streamlined since they are oriented parallel to the main direction of travel, as opposed to the vertical thrusters. The RMI 1000 thruster from RoboMarine Indonesia is the most relevant candidate, with a weight of 2 kg and a 200 N nominal thrust force. The ROV now has an estimated total weight of 29 kg, which is within the limits set by the requirements. The final weight may, however, differ slightly due to the uncertainties of the thrusters mass...|$|E
5000|$|The 'portal' {{type design}} of {{the front and rear}} axles means that the <b>centre</b> of the <b>axle</b> is above the centre of the wheel, thus {{increasing}} ground clearance under the axle without the need to increase the wheel diameter. Power is transmitted from the axle to the wheel via drop gears in each wheel hub.|$|R
50|$|The ratchet mechanism, {{known as}} the freehub body, is still {{replaceable}} on most hubs, but forms a structural part of the hub. Cassette systems have a major advantage in that the drive-side axle bearing can be out near the frame, rather than being back towards the <b>centre</b> of the <b>axle</b> behind the freewheel. This greatly reduces the stress on the rear axle, making bent or broken axles extremely rare.|$|R
50|$|A three axle {{shunting}} locomotive, type Vossloh G6 {{was introduced}} in 2008, in 2009 the company announced to the intention to offer diesel electric or diesel hydraulic variant of four <b>axle</b> <b>centre</b> cab locomotives in two power ranges: G 12 or DE 12 and G 18 or DE 18 (approximately corresponding to the power ranges of the G1206 and G1700 versions.)In 2016, Vossloh Locomotives won a major contract in France. Akiem S.A.S. ordered 44 locomotives of DE 18.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a series-hybrid {{articulated}} bus with a compact 450 kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8-litre, 160 kW, Euro 4 OM-924LA diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, and four 80 kW electric wheel hub motors {{located on the}} <b>centre</b> and rear <b>axles.</b> (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12-litre, 1,000 kg.) The battery pack is also charged by regenerative braking (recuperation). The manufacturer anticipates fuel consumption 20% lower than conventional diesel Citaros.|$|R
50|$|Watt's linkage {{is used in}} {{the rear}} axle of some car {{suspensions}} as an improvement over the Panhard rod, which was designed in the early twentieth century. Both methods intend to prevent relative sideways motion between the axle and body of the car. Watt’s linkage approximates a vertical straight line motion more closely, and does so while locating the <b>centre</b> of the <b>axle</b> rather than toward one side of the vehicle, as more commonly used when fitting a long Panhard rod.|$|R
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the <b>centre</b> driving <b>axle.</b> Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, {{a number of}} the features of the Thompson design were not considered as acceptable or reasoned principles, as they did not follow established locomotive consideration. Divided drive, although it did reduce the total stress/strain on the <b>centre</b> crank <b>axle,</b> did not lend itself to frame integrity, especially coupled with connecting rods of equal length, as the greatest point of rigidity in the frame structure itself, the cylinders, were no longer lined up. Locomotive frames are flexible to handle side-to-side twist, and even axial twist along their length, but fore-and-aft motion between the frames leads to bearing and joint failures. To maintain connecting rods of equal length required the inside cylinder to be placed as far forward as possible, and even so the outside cylinders were behind the rear axle of the front bogie, which was not LNER practice, and subsequently resulted in a very long wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|The main design {{differences}} with the N class included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the <b>centre</b> driving <b>axle.</b> Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility.

50|$|With this system, the {{outermost}} of several sets of successive driving wheel sets {{are not connected}} by coupling rods to crankshaft journals {{on the outside of}} the wheels, but by cogwheels located in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>axles.</b> The axles are housed in the locomotive frame such that they are able to move at right angles to the axis of the rails to a certain degree, likewise the cogwheels are able to slide relative to one another. In this way curves can be negotiated with less friction being generated.|$|R
