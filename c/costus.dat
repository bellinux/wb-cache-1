25|$|<b>Costus</b> curvibracteatus is a {{tropical}} rhizomatous perennial native to Costa Rica and Panama. A {{member of the}} spiral ginger family of plants, its common name is orange tulip ginger. It is also {{sometimes referred to as}} spiral ginger; however, this common name is better associated with <b>Costus</b> barbatus, a more widely cultivated and very similar species. Despite the name and its relation to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), the rhizomes of the orange tulip ginger are not edible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Costus</b> curvibracteatus {{produces}} abundant nectar in its tubular florets and is pollinated by hummingbirds. Its seeds, {{by which}} it reproduces, are contained within glabrous, ellipsoid capsules, 10 to 17mm long.|$|E
25|$|E. imperialis {{typically}} feed on nectar from flowering plants, {{particularly of}} the orchid species. Studies {{have shown that}} the nectar intake rate for E. imperialis is determined primarily by nectar viscosity rather than nectar sweetness, as measured by sucrose concentrations. E. imperialis also visits a wide variety of deep flowering plants, unreachable to most other bee species, such as Bignoniaceae, Costaceae, and Marantaceae, as well as understorey herbs such as <b>Costus</b> laevis and <b>Costus</b> allenii, which are entirely dependent on female E. imperialis for pollination and cross-fertilization. Male euglossines have also been observed to collect chemical fragrances from floral sources—such as Orchidaceae, Solanaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Euphorbiaceae—as well as non-floral sources, including decaying wood, rotting fruit, animal feces, and tree wounds.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{description}} of <b>Costus</b> curvibracteatus {{as a species}} was published by the Dutch botanist Paul Maas in 1976 in the Acta Botanica Neerlandica. The article, 'Notes on New World Zingiberaceae', described 12 new species in the genus <b>Costus.</b> The following year, Maas published a monograph on the Zingiberaceae, clearing up some taxonomic confusion and expanding descriptions, including that for C. curvibracteatus. In this and other early works, the genus <b>Costus</b> {{is placed in the}} family Zingiberaceae, subfamily Costoideae. [...] Following further classification contributions by botanist W. John Kress, the spiral gingers were recognised as a sister clade to the Zingiberaceae and moved to the family Costaceae, as originally suggested by the Japanese botanist Takenoshin Nakai in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Banksia L.f. {{has since}} been {{challenged}} a number of times. The later near-homonym Banksea Koenig was published in 1783, but subsequently determined to be a synonym of <b>Costus</b> L. In 1790 James Bruce published Bankesia Bruce, later corrected to Banksia Bruce, but the name was rejected in favour of Johann Friedrich Gmelin's name Hagenia. [...] In 1820 the name Banksia Dombey ex DC. was published, but this was later determined by be a nomen nudum that referred to the genus Cuphea, [...] In 1891, Otto Kuntze proposed to enforce the right of precedent of Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, renaming Pimelea to Banksia, and proposing the name Sirmuellera Kuntze in place of Banksia L.f. This challenge failed, as did James Britten's 1905 challenge. [...] In 1940, Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against Banksia J.R.Forst. & G.Forst by Thomas Sprague.|$|E

2500|$|Plants used {{to treat}} snakebites in Trinidad and Tobago are made into tinctures with alcohol or olive oil and kept in rum flasks called 'snake bottles'. Snake bottles contain several {{different}} plants and/or insects. The plants used include the vine called monkey ladder (Bauhinia cumanensis or Bauhinia excisa, Fabaceae) which is pounded {{and put on the}} bite. Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the vine and kept in a snake bottle. [...] Other plants used include: mat root (Aristolochia rugosa), cat's claw (Pithecellobim unguis-cati), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), snake bush (Barleria lupulina), obie seed (Cola nitida), and wild gri gri root (Acrocomia aculeata). Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars (Battus polydamas, Papilionidae) that eat tree leaves (Aristolochia trilobata). Emergency snake medicines are obtained by chewing a three-inch piece of the root of bois canôt (Cecropia peltata) and administering this chewed-root solution to the bitten subject (usually a hunting dog). This is a common native plant of Latin America and the Caribbean which makes it appropriate as an emergency remedy. Another native plant used is mardi gras (Renealmia alpinia)(berries), which are crushed together with the juice of wild cane (<b>Costus</b> scaber) and given to the bitten. Quick fixes have included applying chewed tobacco from cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Making cuts around the puncture or sucking out the venom had been thought helpful in the past, but this course of treatment is now strongly discouraged, due to the risk of self-envenomation through knife cuts or cuts in the mouth (suction cups from snake bite kits can be used, but suctioning seldom provides any measurable benefit).|$|E

50|$|In Siddha medicine, it {{is known}} as kostum. It is being {{cultivated}} in Kashmir and the Himalayan regions for its root. It {{is related to the}} gingers and was originally part of the Zingiberaceae family. But now the <b>Costus</b> species and their kin have been reclassified into their own family, Costaceae. The species reproduces vegetative by rhizome and birds disperse seeds when they feed on the fruits. <b>Costus</b> products are sometimes called <b>Costus</b> comosus and are edible in nature. The flower petals are quite sweet and nutritious. It's a lower grower and makes a great ground cover. The long red flower spikes of <b>Costus</b> pulverulentus are unique to the family and they are sure to create interest in the garden. The plant grows very quickly. And the propagation is by stem cutting. It needs sunshine but it also grows in slightly shady areas. It is cultivated in India for its use in traditional medicine and elsewhere as an ornamental.|$|E
