5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that <b>counteracts</b> DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding <b>counteracts</b> of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} metamorphosis, {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which <b>counteracts</b> thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E

25|$|Though smoking {{may help}} relieve {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia, smoking also <b>counteracts</b> {{the effects of}} antipsychotic medication.

25|$|Coenzyme Q10 has {{potential}} to inhibit {{the effects of}} warfarin (Coumadin), a potent anticoagulant, by reducing the INR, a measure of blood clotting.

25|$|Cortisol <b>counteracts</b> insulin, {{contributes}} to hyperglycemia-causing hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose (insulin resistance) by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) {{to the cell}} membrane.

25|$|Sleep timing depends greatly on {{hormonal}} {{signals from}} the circadian clock, or Process C, a complex neurochemical system which uses signals from an organism's environment to recreate an internal day–night rhythm. Process C <b>counteracts</b> the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a brain area directly above the optic chiasm, is presently considered the most important nexus for this process; however, secondary clock systems have been found throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Since salt {{restriction}} is {{the basic}} concept in treatment, and aldosterone {{is one of the}} hormones that acts to increase salt retention, a medication that <b>counteracts</b> aldosterone should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics such as triamterene or amiloride) is the drug of choice since they block the aldosterone receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be dosed once per day. Generally, the starting dose is oral spironolactone 100nbsp&mg/day (max 400nbsp&mg/day).|$|E
25|$|DNA {{damage has}} been one of the many causes in {{diseases}} related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that <b>counteracts</b> DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by Gioacchino Failla in 1958 is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist Leó Szilárd. This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.|$|E
