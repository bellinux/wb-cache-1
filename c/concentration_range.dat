25|$|Some dietary supplements, {{sold for}} the {{purposes}} of promoting weight-loss or providing energy, contain synephrine as one of several constituents. Usually, the synephrine is present as a natural component of Citrus aurantium ("bitter orange"), bound up in the plant matrix, but could also be of synthetic origin, or a purified phytochemical (i.e. extracted from a plant source and purified to chemical homogeneity). The <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> found by Santana and co-workers in five different supplements purchased in the US was about 5–14mg/g.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{conducted}} by Hibino and co-workers {{also showed that}} synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) produced a dose-dependent constriction of isolated rat aorta strips, in the <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> 10−5–3 × 10−6 M. This constriction {{was found to be}} competitively antagonized by prazosin (a standard α1 antagonist) and ketanserin, with prazosin being the more potent antagonist (pA2 = 9.38, vs pA2 = 8.23 for ketanserin). Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by BRL-15,572, but not by SB-216,641 (used here as a selective 5-HT1B antagonist), or by propranolol (a common β antagonist).|$|E
25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

25|$|PFOA is also {{formed as}} an {{unintended}} byproduct {{in the production}} of fluorotelomers and is present in finished goods treated with fluorotelomers, including those intended for food contact. Fluorotelomers are applied to food contact papers because they are lipophobic: they prevent oil from soaking into the paper from fatty foods. Also, fluorotelomers can be metabolized into PFOA. In a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) study, lipophobic fluorotelomer-based paper coatings (which can be applied to food contact paper in the <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> of 0.4%) were found to contain 88,000–160,000 parts per billion PFOA, while microwave popcorn bags contained 6–290 parts per billion PFOA. Toxicologists estimate that microwave popcorn could account for about 20% of the PFOA levels measured in an individual consuming 10 bags a year if 1% of the fluorotelomers are metabolized to PFOA.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} found to {{directly}} interact with the ER. Although a study found that spironolactone did not interact with the human ER at the <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> tested, a subsequent study found that the drug did interact with the human ER at higher concentrations, albeit with very low (micromolar) affinity (inhibition constant = 2 × 10−5). In the same study, spironolactone was administered to rats and found to produce mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic or selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-like effects that were described as very similar to those of tamoxifen. In {{spite of the fact that}} tamoxifen had three orders of magnitude higher affinity for the ER than did spironolactone, the two drugs showed similar potency in vivo. It has been said that the likelihood of spironolactone interacting with the ER itself is remote in consideration of its very low affinity for the receptor in vitro. However, metabolism of spironolactone may result in metabolites with greater ER affinity, which could thus account for the activity.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{excreted}} through urine, {{and concentration}} in urine of this drug shows a large inter-individual spread; that is, the same dose {{can give a}} vast difference in urine concentration for different individuals. Pseudoephedrine is approved to be taken up to 240mg per day. In seven healthy male subjects this dose yielded a urine <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> of 62.8 to 294.4 microgram per milliliter (µg/ml) with mean ± standard deviation 149 ± 72µg/ml. Thus, normal dosage of 240mg pseudoephedrine per day can result in urine concentration levels exceeding the limit of 150µg/ml set by WADA for {{about half of all}} users. Furthermore, hydration status does not affect urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine.|$|E

2500|$|At gas-phase {{concentrations}} {{greater than}} 30% volume in air at STP (more correctly: at partial pressures above 10 kPa), ClO2 may explosively decompose into chlorine and oxygen.

[...] Thus, chlorine dioxide gas is never handled in concentrated form, but {{is almost always}} handled as a dissolved gas in water in a <b>concentration</b> <b>range</b> of 0.5 to 10grams per liter. Its solubility increases at lower temperatures, thus {{it is common to}} use chilled water (5°C, or 41°F) when storing at concentrations above 3grams per liter. In many countries, such as the United States, chlorine dioxide gas may not be transported at any concentration and is almost always produced at the application site using a chlorine dioxide generator. In some countries, chlorine dioxide solutions below 3grams per liter in concentration may be transported by land, however, they are relatively unstable and deteriorate quickly.|$|E
