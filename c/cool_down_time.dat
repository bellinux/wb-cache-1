The matured palm kernel shell is carbonized in a glass furnace at elevation temperature after soaked with H acid and <b>cooled</b> <b>down</b> the carbonized activated carbon. Methyl orange are used as an indicator to test the carbonized raw material whether it is activated carbon or common charcoal. The real activated carbon would change the orange solution to a clear solution and the solution of different color is analyzed by using FTIR to check the functional group of methyl orange. The result showed that 1000 Co is the optimum temperature to carbonize the raw material and the use of 0. 35 M H 3 po acid with the <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> at 30 minutes would give the best adsorption of activated carbon after filtration.

50|$|Kingdom Rush is a tower defense game set in {{a medieval}} fantasy setting. There are empty lots set along the pre-determined path, called 'Strategy Points', where the player can build towers. There are four towers to choose from: Mages, Archers, Barracks, and Artillery, each of them costing {{a certain amount of}} money. At the {{beginning}} of each level, the player starts off {{with a certain amount of}} money in order to buy towers. As the enemies begin to emerge from one end of the path, the goal is to kill them using these towers before they reach the other end of the path (defence point). Killing enemies generates money, which can be used to upgrade towers as well. Certain towers are more effective in killing certain types of enemies. Another way to earn money is to call waves early, which also reduces <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> of spells. Money is also earned by selling built towers or having an enemy reach the defence point. There are 18 levels in total and 48 different types of enemies that one will encounter throughout the levels. After completing a level and earning 3 stars, Heroic Mode and Iron Challenge are unlocked. These are more challenging modes than the traditional campaign. In Heroic Mode and Iron Challenge, the player will only be given one life. In Campaign Mode, the player is given 20 lives, and if all waves are completed and all enemies are killed with eighteen or more lives remaining, the player is awarded 3 stars. Some enemies cost more lives, and lives are deducted when an enemy reaches the defence point before it is killed. Heroic Mode and Iron Challenge reward one star each. With these stars, the player can upgrade his or her equipment and strengthen their towers and spells (Reinforcements and Rain of Fire). Note as of this time the Supreme Defender award on version 1.1.3 is not working and a such all Iron and Heroic Challenges do not correctly register when completed.|$|E

40|$|For cooling {{the liquid}} hydrogen/deuterium target from room {{temperature}} {{to the operating}} temperature (15 K/ 19 K) until recently a long solid copper heat conductor and a short heat pipe was used between cooling machine and the target cell.

50|$|The printer {{contains}} melted wax when at operating temperature, and owners' manuals {{warn that}} it cannot be moved {{until it has}} completed a special cool-down cycle selected from the machine's control panel. It is recommended to provide a 30-minute <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> {{from the point of}} removing main power, however all modern solid-ink printers have a shutdown cycle which use fans to solidify the ink in less than ten minutes, with the added benefit of physically restraining the printhead to prevent damage during moving or shipping. The manuals warn that substantial damage is possible otherwise, requiring servicing by a trained technician if not properly cooled down before moving the printer. Moving the printer before cool down completes can damage the print head by spilling molten ink between reservoirs of different color as well as over other components inside the printer (motors, belts, etc.), and is not covered under maintenance or warranty. Because of the liquid-ink-spillage concern, solid-ink printers are not suitable for mobile usage, such as on movable carts for printing pricing tags in retail settings. Unlike some inkjet printers where the cartridge includes the print head, the printhead in these printers is fixed. Over time, parts of the printhead may become permanently clogged, resulting in unsightly streaks, but there are printhead and drum cleaning cycles and jet-substitution options which can resolve most printing issues. There is a filter for the ingested ink implemented at least on the recent ColorQube devices (8570/8870), according to a service manual for those models. Dust caused by the use of cheap paper may cause printhead clogging, which is why Xerox recommends the use of papers that are not prone to giving off dust and fibers during regular usage. Paper dust may also accumulate as debris inside the printer; this could cause abrasions on the drum and may mimic a weak or missing jet. For this reason, the basic built-in drum-cleaning procedure is therefore recommended to be invoked at least three times before initiating printhead-nozzle cleaning cycle. The printhead system also contains a wiper-assembly unit that is used to wipe the printhead from dust, debris and residual ink, {{in order to protect the}} nozzles from clogging. Overall, the design of this system is robust: printheads have been known to last one million prints or more. Ink blocks are not compatible between Phaser models, due to Xerox changing each CMYK molded shape with each new model release due to changes in the formulation (and especially melt point) of the ink. Special openings prevent the insertion of ink sticks from the wrong model, or the wrong slot. Lamination becomes difficult due to the nature of the ink technology. The ink melts and becomes smeared unless the laminator temperature is reduced to just enough to seal a pouch.|$|E

The main topics of this project are simulations of the <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> of thepulsed DC system done in the physics simulation software COMSOL.

40|$|The line N is {{a special}} superconducting line in the LHC, which is {{external}} to the cold mass. The line {{is connected to the}} cold mass every half cell, and due to this it will have the same operating pressure and temperature as the magnets. In the dispersion suppressor zones the cool down of the line N is slightly delayed with respect to the magnets, due to its geometrical design. As this delay may affect the readiness of the accelerator for operating, it is desired that it is reduced to less than two hours. In a test called String 2 a full scale model of the LHC cell was built to validate the LHC systems in working condition, and to investigate the collective behavior under various conditions. During this test, there was installed a copper plug in line N. The result showed that the <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> of the line was delayed by more than two hours. After this test there has been designed a new copper heat exchanger that is used in the line N to make additional lambda fronts, and by this lower the <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> of the line.

The failure modes of the power electronics are investigated, along with lifetime analysis with respect to different current levels and compared with the lifetime {{information provided by the}} manufacturer. In the power electronics module both the IGBTs and the diodes are tested. The report focuses on active power cycling. Passive cycling is when the test object is thermally cycled from the surrounding temperature and active power cycling is when the test object is heated up by a current, during <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> the current is stopped. The time for heating up is 2 s and the <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> is 2 s, generally for short time cycles the bond wire is the major cause of failure, for longer time periods solder delamination becomes a problem. The tests are done with an on time of 2 seconds, with this time cycle the bond wires are the part most likely to be the cause of failure. The lifetime of the modules varied between 56 000 and 380 000 cycles depending on the temperature swing, Î”T, and if it is a diode or an IGBT. For the highest temperature swing, of both the diode and the IGBT, the result is as expected when compared to the manufacturers lifetime curve. For the other temperature swings the lifetime is longer than expected. Since it seems that the failure were caused by the bond wires, longer time periods are needed if the test should be done to find when the modules fails because of solder delamination. Also passive cycling should be investigated together with other types of tests such as vibration and chemical tests to investigate if the modules are suitable for operation in a heavy hybrid vehicle...|$|R

In {{the field of}} cooled infrared imaging systems, the maximal detector area {{is determined by the}} dewar. It is generally a sealed and cooled environment dedicated to the infrared quantum detector. By integrating an optical function inside it, we improve the compactness of the camera as well as its performances. The originality of our approach is to use a thin integrated optics which is a high quality Fresnel lens on a thin germanium substrate. The aim is to reduce the additional mass of the optical part integrated inside the dewar to obtain almost the same <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> as a conventional dewar with no imaging function. A prototype has been made and its characterization has been carried out...|$|E
40|$|A {{very light}} liquid hydrogen/deuterium target has been {{constructed}} {{to be used}} in scattering experiments at intermediate energy with phase space cooled external proton beams at the COoler SYnchrotron COSY in Juelich. The target cell is 6 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length with very thin windows of 0. 9 #mu#m thickness Mylar foil. For cooling the target from room temperature to liquid hydrogen/deuterium temperatures until recently a short heat pipe and a long solid copper heat conductor was used between cooling machine and the target. The <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of copper, aluminum and silver conductors have been studied. As result, improvements have been achieved by using aluminum heat conductor. (orig.)

He sent his Shiva-dutas out with orders {{to bring back}} the head of the first {{creature}} that is lying dead with its head facing North. The Shiva-dutas soon returned with the head of a strong and powerful elephant Gajasura which Lord Brahma placed onto boy's body. Breathing new life into him, he was declared as Gajanana and gave him the status of being foremost among the gods, and leader of all the ganas (classes of beings), Ganapati.|$|R
40|$|Fast carrier cooling is {{important}} for high power graphene based devices. Strongly Coupled Optical Phonons (SCOPs) {{play a major role}} in the relaxation of photoexcited carriers in graphene. Heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have shown exceptional mobility and high saturation current, which makes them ideal for applications, but the effect of the hBN substrate on carrier cooling mechanisms is not understood. We track the cooling of hot photo-excited carriers in graphene-hBN heterostructures using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the carriers <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> four <b>times</b> faster in the case of graphene on hBN than on a silicon oxide substrate thus overcoming the hot phonon (HP) bottleneck that plagues cooling in graphene devices.
