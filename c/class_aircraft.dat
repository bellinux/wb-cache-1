5|$|When the {{requirement}} for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers and their successors, the Queen Elizabeth <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers, and possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS Bulwark and Albion. Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E

40|$|Development of an arrival air-traffic {{management}} {{system for a}} single runway. Traffic is segregated {{throughout most of the}} near terminal area according to performance characteristics.

25|$|The {{original}} design concept for the aircraft {{that would become}} the Guardian, the XTB2F of 1944, was for a twin-engined aircraft with a 3,600lb (1,633kg) warload {{and a range of}} 3,700mi (5,950km). This was considered to be too large for practical use from an Essex <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier, and was cancelled in 1945, replaced by a modified Grumman F7F Tigercat, the XTSF-1.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Ministry of Defence placed {{orders for}} two Queen Elizabeth <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{carriers}} {{to operate the}} F-35B variant. On 2 May 2008, however, the Washington Post reported that an Inspector General's report chided the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Security Service for failing to ensure that BAE Systems was exercising appropriate controls over access to sensitive technologies, while both BAE and Lockheed Martin denied that any technology had been compromised.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2010, The Sunday Times {{reported}} that the British government was considering canceling orders for the F-35B and buying the Super Hornet instead for its Queen Elizabeth <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers.

25|$|Under the Joint Force Harrier organisation, {{both the}} RAF and RN {{operated}} the Harrier II, including routine operational deployments {{on board the}} navy's Invincible <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers. The Harrier II participated in numerous conflicts, making significant contributions in combat theatres such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The type's main function was as a platform for air interdiction and close air support missions; the Harrier II was also used for presence projection and reconnaissance duties. The Harrier II served alongside the Sea Harrier in Joint Force Harrier.|$|E
25|$|During service {{evaluations}} of the Sea Hawk, both Australian and Canadian pilots from each of their respective naval services would fly examples of the aircraft, and there were official suggestions they would adopt the type as standard equipment. However, both nations were also interested in new American-built naval aircraft; {{only a handful of}} Sea Hawks would be transferred to either nation, notably some would operate from the flight deck of the Australian Majestic <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier HMS Sydney, though these did not enter full squadron service.|$|E
25|$|In June 1994, {{the newly}} {{introduced}} GR7 was deployed for trials {{on board the}} Navy's Invincible <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers. Operational naval deployments began in 1997.

In 2000, 'presence' and reconnaissance sorties over Sierra Leone were performed solely by carrier-based Harrier GR7s. The Invincible class carriers also received multiple adaptations for greater compatibility with the Harrier II, including changes to the communications, lighting and flight deck.|$|E

25|$|After the war Douglas {{continued}} {{to develop new}} aircraft, including the DC-6 in 1946 and the DC-7 in 1953. The company moved into jet propulsion, producing its first for the military – the conventional F3D Skyknight in 1948 and then the more 'jet age' F4D Skyray in 1951. In 1955, Douglas introduced the first attack jet of the United States Navy with the A4D Skyhawk. Designed to operate from the decks of the World War II Essex <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers, the Skyhawk was small, reliable, and tough. Variants of it continued in use in the Navy for almost 50 years, finally serving in large numbers in a two-seat version as a jet trainer.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor {{there was a need}} for large vessels that could be {{converted}} into training aircraft carriers for pilot training. The Greater Buffalos length, following conversion, would be roughly two thirds the length of an Independence <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier and it was felt by the navy that if pilots could master takeoffs and landings on the shorter deck they would have less problems transitioning to a standard length carrier. Other benefits by using her for training were that an active duty combat ship would not have to be used for training and with her location on the Great Lakes she would be {{out of the reach of}} enemy submarines and mines. The Greater Buffalo was acquired by the Navy on 7 August 1942 by the War Shipping Administration to be converted into a training aircraft carrier and renamed Sable on 19 September 1942.|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{mounted in}} 2009 that the UK {{government}} would switch from the F-35B to the F-35C model, with its greater range and payload. The UK would require fewer F-35Cs and save about $25 million for each aircraft ordered. In October 2010, press reports {{suggested that the}} Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government were considering reducing the order for the F-35 from 138 to a currently unspecified but lower number as of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. This was confirmed by a MoD spokeswoman in 2012. The proposed cuts would also close RAF Lossiemouth, chosen as the main operating base for the F-35. On 19 October 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review that the UK would procure an unspecified number of F-35Cs, to fly from a Queen Elizabeth <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier, instead of the F-35B. This change would require the aircraft carrier to be equipped with catapults and arresting gear.|$|E
500|$|Following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Pakistan {{invested}} heavily in modern submarines and long-range torpedoes. In response, India opted to procure six Westland Sea Kings from Britain in 1969, for ASW duties, designated as Mk42. The purchase also included the provision of air-droppable homing torpedoes for use against submarines. The delivery of the aircraft began {{a few months before}} the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Due to training shortfalls on the new helicopters, Sea King operations were considerably restricted during the 1971 war; by November 1971, increased aircrew experience had enabled offensive anti-submarine operations to be conducted. The Majestic <b>class</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier [...] was also refitted in 1972–1974 to enable extensive Sea King operations, becoming the carrier's primary anti-submarine aircraft.|$|E
