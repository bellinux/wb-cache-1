The complex geological environmental condition made dangerous rock a typical geological hazard to Chongqing. Through field investigation of dangerous rock zone and analysis of geological environment condition, we researched the formation mechanism and unstable mode of dangerous rock and done qualitative analysis and analytical analysis to the dangerous rock. Under the condition of dead weight and surface load, the stability coefficient is 1. 16 ~ 1. 29, which illustrates that dangerous rock is basically stable; under the condition of dead weight, surface load and hydrostatic pressure, stability coefficient is 0. 95 ~ 1. 04, which illustrates that dangerous rock is not stable. The emergency capacity is so slow that it’s urgent to take treatment measures to control dangerous rock.

50|$|Steel was {{introduced}} to the construction industry {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the Bessemer process was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be “fireproofed” in some manner, utilizing a cladding of terra-cotta, tile, plaster-poured <b>concrete,</b> <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete,</b> or <b>sprayed</b> insulation. Ferro <b>concrete,</b> also called reinforced concrete, was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} from {{experience}} that when <b>spraying</b> <b>concrete</b> it spreads on the wall, being the distribution of concrete around the axis depending -at the remaining factors constant- on nozzle designo The shape of these "spreadings" have been analysed by different authors [1][2], who shown that a relation between the cross section of single layer strips of <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> and the <b>spraying</b> process parameters exist. However, no analytical mode 1 s of this relationship {{have been found in}} the literature [1]. The way concrete spreads on the wall can be modelled using a statistical approach by introducing a spraying density function.

50|$|Structures, {{which are}} {{designed}} as integral arches, {{can be constructed}} as stiff individual objects or {{by means of a}} <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> procedure. Arches made of <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> provide for free and organic shapes, allowing rooms to become suffused with light. The <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> procedure was first used by natural scientist Carl Akeley in 1911. Akeley patented a device able to <b>spray</b> fine-grained <b>concrete.</b> While <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> is mainly applied in underground engineering and tunnel construction, Friedrich Kiesler was the first to use this technique for the construction of buildings. Swiss architect Peter Vetsch improved the technique over several years. To date, he has built over 40 earth houses using <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete,</b> and he can therefore be considered the leading authority in this area of expertise. The <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> is applied to a finely meshed metal stretch net which is welded onto the supporting armature. The curvatures are bent and formed according to the intended shape of the building. A 20 cm thick polyurethane solid-foam-insulation is sprayed onto the outside of the arches, protecting the house from low or high temperatures. A fleece filter mat is then laid on top of this and the building is covered with a thick layer of soil some 80 cm to 3 metres thick. The foundation of the buildings designed by Peter Vetsch are built conventionally. The interior walls of an earth house are furnished using loam rendering which provides superior humidity compensation. The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white cement paint.|$|R

40|$|The <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{complies}} {{a construction}} technique that combines the placement and the compacting of concrete {{in only one}} process. This sort of concrete, which is widely used in underground constructions, requires a quick setting obtained by using set accelerating admixtures. Due to the function performed by these admixtures during the hydration process of the concrete, an analysis of its mechanical properties at early ages is essential. The European Standard ‘EN 14488 - 2 : 2007 - Testing <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete.</b> Part 2 : Compressive strength of young sprayed concrete' describes the indirect methods {{used to determine the}} compressive strength of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> at early ages. These are the penetration needle test and the stud driving method. The first one estimates the compressive strength until 1. 30 MPa evaluating a force gradually applied so that a needle penetrates a certain distance. The second one estimates the compressive strength evaluating the penetration of studs shoot with a certain power and the force to extract them. This second method cannot be performed until the compressive strength of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> is around 2. 50 - 3. 00 MPa. Therefore a range of strength cannot be estimated. This range entails certain time in which the estimation of the compressive strength of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> is not possible. This communication aims to present the problem related with the estimation of the compressive strength of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> at early ages. Furthermore, it objects to give a solution for this problem adapting the maturity method for the <b>spraying</b> <b>concrete.</b> In other words, it tries to solve the problem using the relationship between the compressive strength and the evolution of temperature during the hydration of cement. Therefore, a wide experimental program was performed testing specimens produced with different types of cement and types of accelerators.

Furthermore, the analysis of the experimental results allows adapting the maturity method for <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete.</b> Therefore, the relationship between the compressive strength and the evolution of temperature, which depends on the type of cement and accelerator, can be used to estimate the compressive strength of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> at early ages.
