25|$|The Long Count {{calendar}} identifies a date {{by counting}} {{the number of}} days from the Mayan <b>creation</b> <b>date</b> 4 Ahaw, 8 Kumk'u (August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6 in the Julian calendar -3113 astronomical dating). But instead of using a base-10 (decimal) scheme like Western numbering, the Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. Thus 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25 and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. As the winal unit resets after only counting to 18, the Long Count consistently uses base-20 only if the tun is considered the primary unit of measurement, not the k'in; with the k'in and winal units being the number of days in the tun. The Long Count 0.0.1.0.0 represents 360 days, rather than the 400 in a purely base-20 (vigesimal) count.|$|E

2500|$|The Mesoamerican Long Count {{calendar}} is a non-repeating, vigesimal (base-20) and base-18 calendar used {{by several}} pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, {{most notably the}} Maya.

2500|$|While {{differences}} in biblical interpretation or in calculation methodology can produce some {{differences in}} the <b>creation</b> <b>date,</b> most results fall relatively close {{to one of these}} two dominant models. The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying Biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3750 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text). Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the Book of Genesis. Patriarchs from Adam to Terah, the father of Abraham, are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint {{than they were in the}} Latin Vulgate ( [...] ; [...] ) or the Hebrew Tanakh ( [...] ; [...] ).
