50|$|A {{spring-loaded}} {{safety relief}} valve is usually installed on all oil and gas separators. These valves normally are set at the design pressure of the vessel. Safety relief valves serve primarily as a warning, and in most instances {{are too small to}} handle the full rated fluid <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separator.</b> Full-capacity {{safety relief valve}}s can be used and are particularly recommended when no safety head (rupture disk) is used on the separator.|$|R
50|$|Separators {{should be}} {{operated}} above hydrate-formation temperature. Otherwise hydrates may {{form in the}} vessel and partially or completely plug it thereby reducing the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separator.</b> In some instances when the liquid or gas outlet is plugged or restricted, this causes the safety valve to open or the safety head to rupture. Steam coils can be installed in the liquid section {{of oil and gas}} separators to melt hydrates that may form there. This is especially appropriate on low-temperature separators.|$|R
30|$|The {{possible}} {{influence of}} large sample volume injections {{on the performance}} <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> system has been tested with previously unused Dionex IonPac AG/AS 20 columns. The perchlorate retention times of a 7.5  µg/L standard solution were recorded over 34  days, yielding more than 1000 injections. During this time, the perchlorate retention time decreased by 2.5  min indicating a loss <b>of</b> anion exchange <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> column. As large sample volumes (up to 1000  µL) of real-world samples—including waste and surface waters, {{some of which were}} untreated—had to be injected in order to achieve the desired LOD and LOQ, it is to be expected that larger amounts of other matrix components, like non-polar organics, humic acids, or transition metals, were co-injected, leading to the decrease in retention time. It is therefore advisable to check the performance of the guard column regularly and replacing it at an early stage, if necessary [36] to extend the separator column’s lifetime.|$|R
40|$|The reflux {{classifier}} {{is a new}} gravity separation {{technology for}} processing fine coal and other dense minerals, developed through collaboration between the University of Newcastle and Ludowici Australia. This chapter provides an account of that development, covering {{a number of the}} key findings that have led to the final design, and indeed the separation performance achieved. The chapter also outlines the theoretical basis used to quantify the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separator.</b> The technology embodies the benefits of a high shear rate similar to that observed for spirals, the benefits of an autogenous dense medium similar to that observed in a teetered-bed separator, and an increased throughput advantage similar to that produced by a lamellae thickener, with a strong synergy achieved among all three. Moreover, the laminar shear mechanism that arises within closely spaced inclined channels permits a powerful separation on the basis of density, delivering a significant performance advantage at the low cut points required for the recovery of metallurgical coal...|$|R

Cells with the inorganic separation all fell below 70 % <b>of</b> their theoretical <b>capacity</b> within 30 cycles, but the cells constructed with organic separation required 80 cycles. Failure of the cells using the ceramic separator was irreversible capacity degradation due to zinc loss through cracks developed in the inorganic separator.

40|$|In an Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) lifted oil field, the ESP of each {{oil well}} should be {{operated}} inside its operating window. The total power {{consumed by the}} ESPs in the oil field should be minimized. The speed of the ESPs and the production choke valve opening should be optimally chosen for maximizing the total oil produced from the oil field. At the same time, the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> should not be exceeded. In this paper, nonlinear steady state optimization based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is developed. Two optimal control structures are proposed in this paper. In the first case, the optimal pump speed is controlled by a PI controller by varying the electrical excitation signal to the motors. The optimal fluid flow rate through each oil well is controlled by another PI controller by varying the production choke valve opening. The paper shows that the production choke valve for each oil well has to be always 100 % open to maintain the optimal fluid flow rate. In the second case, the production choke valves {{are considered to be}} always 100 % open as hard constraints. The optimal fluid flow rate through each oil well is controlled by a PI controller by varying the pump speed. It is shown that when the optimal fluid flow rate is tracked by the controller, the speed of each of the pumps is equal to the optimal pump speed calculated by the optimizer. This basically means that we can achieve the optimization objective with the same optimal results as in the first case by using only a single PI controller. The limitations of these two optimal control structures for very low values and for very high values <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> <b>capacity</b> are discussed. For the feasible range <b>of</b> <b>separator</b> <b>capacities,</b> the optimal locus of the fluid flow rate and the pump speed are shown in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Lithium powder {{coatings}} on anodes {{have been reported}} to reduce the irreversible first-cycle capacity loss in silicon monoxide (SiOx) anodes. Instead of electrodes, we coated a separator with Li powder to reduce the irreversible capacity. We assembled a SiOx anode and Li cobalt oxide (LCO) cathode coin cell (CR 2032) with an Li-coated separator in an argon-filled glove box. The charge <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the obtained <b>separator</b> in a cell at 0. 1 C was 1502. 0 mAh g− 1 in the first cycle, while that <b>of</b> an uncoated <b>separator</b> was 1534. 3 mAh g− 1. The former also had a higher discharge capacity than the latter, 1334. 2 compared to 1019. 3 mAh g− 1. Using electrochemical analysis it was estimated that the first cycle irreversible capacity loss ratio was 11. 2 % with the Li coating compared to the 33. 6 % capacity drop in pure SiOx cells. Morphology changes in the Li-coated separator are also observed using a scanning electron microscope. The results indicate that a uniform Li coating on a separator acts as an effective reserve layer, reducing the irreversible first-cycle capacity loss...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{vertices}} in a graph is a dominating set {{if every}} vertex outside the set has a neighbor in the set. A dominating set is connected if the subgraph induced by its vertices is connected. The connected domatic partition problem {{asks for a}} partition of the nodes into connected dominating sets. The connected domatic number of a graph {{is the size of}} a largest connected domatic partition and it is a well-studied graph parameter with applications in the design of wireless networks. In this note, we consider the fractional counterpart of the connected domatic partition problem in node-capacitated graphs. Let n be the number of nodes in the graph and let k be the minimum <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> a node <b>separator</b> in G. Fractionally we can pack at most k connected dominating sets subject to the capacities on the nodes, and our algorithms construct packings whose sizes are proportional to k.

40|$|The pore {{structure}} <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> {{is crucial to}} the performance of a lithium-battery as it affects the cell resistance. Herein, a straightforward approach to vary the {{pore structure}} of Cladophora cellulose (CC) separators is presented. It is demonstrated that the pore size and porosity <b>of</b> the CC <b>separator</b> can be increased merely by decreasing the thickness <b>of</b> the CC <b>separator</b> by using less CC in the manufacturing <b>of</b> the <b>separator.</b> As the pore size and porosity <b>of</b> the CC <b>separator</b> are increased, the mass transport through the separator is increased which decreases the electrolyte resistance in the pores <b>of</b> the <b>separator.</b> This enhances the battery performance, particularly at higher cycling rates, as is demonstrated for LiFePO 4 /Li half-cells. A specific <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> around 100 mAh g- 1 was hence obtained at a cycling rate of 2 C with a 10 μm thick CC <b>separator</b> while specific <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> 40 and close to 0 mAh g- 1 were obtained for <b>separators</b> with thicknesses <b>of</b> 20 and 40 μm, respectively. As the results also showed that a higher ionic conductivity was obtained for the 10 μm thick CC separator than for the 20 and 40 μm thick CC separators, {{it is clear that the}} different pore structure <b>of</b> the <b>separators</b> was an important factor affecting the battery performance in addition to the separator thickness. The present straightforward, yet efficient, strategy for altering the pore structure hence holds significant promise for the manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>separators</b> with improved performance, as well as for fundamental studies of the influence of the properties <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> on the performance of lithium-ion cells...|$|R

Materials and methods : A total of 60 subjects (30 males, 30 females) in the age range of 18 to 25 years were divided into three groups with 20 subjects each (10 males and 10 females). Group 1, 2 and 3 were evaluated after 1, 2 and 3 days <b>of</b> <b>separator</b> placement respectively for the degree of separation and pain perception. Two types <b>of</b> <b>separators</b> namely elastomeric and spring separators were placed, at the mesial and distal contacts of the first permanent molars in the maxillary and mandibular arches.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{existing}} offshore processing facilities {{for oil and}} gas often need to be reconsidered after some years of production due to changes in operating conditions. One example is the Ekofisk 2 / 4 J facilities. Here, the water production is increasing and increased amount of lift gas is required to maintain and increase the current oil and gas production. The recycle of lift gas requires capacity in the gas treatment and compression train, limiting total available capacity for export gas. The objective of this work has been to develop a HYSYS model of the processing facility at Ekofisk 2 / 4 J and analyze and review capacity upgrade options. Several cases were established in order to identify the relevant bottlenecks in the processing facility by increasing the production of low-pressure and high-pressure gas. The findings in this thesis indicates that there are three major bottlenecks in the gas processing system at Ekofisk 2 / 4 J. Those are:&# 149; The <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the LP <b>separator.</b> &# 149; The <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the Lift Gas compressor. &# 149; The <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the dehydration tower. Several debottlenecking options are discussed and analyzed, in order to estimate the potential increase in lift gas production and to determine whether the bottlenecks are easy or difficult to overcome. On the basis of the results and discussion in this report, the recommended changes to the processing facility at Ekofisk 2 / 4 J are as follows:&# 149; Increase the volumetric utilization <b>of</b> the LP <b>separator,</b> if possible. &# 149; Replace the current lift gas compressor and driver with new high-capacity equipment. &# 149; Make internal changes to the dehydration tower in order to increase the flow capacity. </p...|$|R

Lithium-ion battery cells consist <b>of</b> cathode, anode, <b>separator</b> and shell casing or aluminum plastic cover. Among them, the shell casing provides substantial strength and fracture resistance under mechanical loading, and the failure <b>of</b> the <b>separator</b> determines onset <b>of</b> internal short circuit of the cell.

The shell casing model is calibrated and validated at both specimen and component levels. This shell casing model, together with homogenized jellyroll model could predict mechanical behavior of single cylindrical 18650 cell well and could serve for battery pack crash simulation purposes. Another part of this thesis is mechanical test, characterization and modeling <b>of</b> battery <b>separators</b> since the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>separators</b> are crucial to internal shorts of lithium-ion batteries.
