5|$|Sometime in April or May, De Soto's crew began <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> {{yellow fever}} and the steamer was sent north in early June, {{arriving}} at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 16 June. As per normal practice, the warship was decommissioned {{that same day}} and the crew quarantined until the fever burned out. On 12 January 1865, De Soto was sent to Baltimore, Maryland for the installation of new boilers. She was still there {{when the war ended}} on 9 April 1865.|$|E
5|$|Three former Sounds {{players have}} also managed the Sounds. Seven games into the 1985 season, Leon Roberts, {{who started the}} season as a Nashville outfielder, became the acting manager for seven games due to manager Lee Walls <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> an illness. Roberts was {{replaced}} by Gordon Mackenzie and returned to playing for the Sounds. After later retiring from playing, Roberts was hired to manage the 1986 team. Wayne Garland, who pitched for the Sounds in 1982, managed the team briefly during the 1988 managerial shuffle. Marty Brown managed the Sounds from 2001 to 2002 after having played for Nashville in 1988 and 1989.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E

25|$|Phelps served {{aboard the}} Bonita and Jamestown during the Mexican–American War, giving naval support to Winfield Scott's Army during the Siege of Veracruz. Much {{of his time}} was also spent patrolling the Mexican coast on {{blockade}} duty. In little time Phelps had already developed strong opinions about how the war should be conducted, and was displeased that the Navy was lending much of their service protecting merchant ships while sailors were <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> scurvy for want of provisions.|$|E
25|$|The year 1869 {{began with}} Livingstone finding himself {{extremely}} ill {{while in the}} jungle. He was saved by Arab traders who gave him medicines and carried him to an Arab outpost. In March 1869, Livingstone suffered from pneumonia and arrived in Ujiji to find his supplies stolen. He was <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> cholera and had tropical ulcers on his feet, so he was again forced to rely on slave traders to get him as far as Bambara—where he was caught by the wet season. With no supplies, Livingstone had to eat his meals in a roped-off enclosure for the entertainment of the locals in return for food.|$|E

25|$|Book Two {{features}} a traditional funeral for the Armenian dead, including the ceremonies of the wailing women, who {{assist in the}} birth of Aram Tomasian's son, a difficult delivery that is seen as ominous while conditions in the camp start to deteriorate, for the Armenian victories can only buy time. Jemal Pasha is introduced in Book Two and is portrayed as a resentful member of the triumvirate, pathologically jealous of Enver. The relationship between Bagradian and Iskuhi also comes into focus, as it is conducted openly but only consummated on a spiritual plane. Their love is interrupted by a reinforced Ottoman attack, which is repelled. Bagradian orders a massive forest fire, to surround the Armenian encampment with a no-man’s land of fire, smoke, and open terrain. Book Two ends with Sato exposing Juliette and Gonzague making love, Juliette <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> typhus and Gonzague’s escape. Stephan leaves the camp with Haik, {{on a mission to}} contact the American envoy in Antioch.|$|E
500|$|Rathbun's brownie {{customers}} were mostly gay men. [...] When they first began <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> AIDS {{in the early}} 1980s, she noticed that cannabis helped them with the wasting syndrome; she also found this to be true of cancer patients. [...] People donated cannabis to Rathbun and she began baking brownies in the hundreds and distributing them to sick people free of charge. [...] Rathbun's monthly $650 Social Security check helped her to purchase baking supplies.|$|E
500|$|... "Serious" [...] takes {{influence}} from the [...] "'80s style" [...] and dance music genres, {{which in turn}} drew frequent comparisons to the works of Madonna and Club Nouveau. It contains a string melody alongside a synthpop rhythm. Opening with [...] "an orchestral [...] before diving into a Prince-ready bumping drum beat and ambient synth", Stefani sings: [...] "I think I'm <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> something / I think I'm gonna need your medicine" [...] in a provocative tone. The use of [...] is also present. Hazel Cills from Vice found the aforementioned lyric reminiscent of Carol Douglas' 1974 cover of [...] "Doctor's Orders". In between different exclamations [...] "centered around Stefani's manic love", she also announces [...] "breathy, vaudeville 'Oohs' and 'Yeahs'". Theon Weber of Spin described the composition: [...] "'Serious' carved out a bittersweet niche that applied loping ska upstrokes to new-wave synth washes and blurred warm feelings about lovers into warm feelings about the synth-pop era." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} mother's hand, and began {{scrambling}} up the rocks.

2500|$|The extra {{period was}} {{described}} as [...] "a cautious game of cat-and-mouse" [...] by Mal Florence of the Los Angeles Times. The opening tip of overtime was won by Rouse and controlled by Hunter. Harkness received a pass from Hunter and scored on a layup, giving the Ramblers the lead. Wilson responded with a basket for the Bearcats, before a long-distance shot by Miller restored a two-point lead for the Ramblers. Loyola later {{had an opportunity to}} extend their advantage, but missed a field goal attempt; after <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the rebound, Thacker made a long pass to Shingleton, and a resulting layup evened the score at 58–58. The game remained tied with under two minutes on the clock, as the Ramblers called a timeout with possession of the ball and subsequently went into a slow-paced offense themselves. Play was stopped with 1:21 remaining, as a jump ball was required to determine possession; Egan and Shingleton jumped against each other. Egan earned possession for Loyola, and the Ramblers held the ball to attempt the last shot of the overtime period. Harkness drove to the basket with about seven seconds on the clock, but elected to pass to Hunter, who attempted a shot. Hunter's effort bounced off the rim, but Rouse rebounded the ball and scored. One second was left on the clock. It expired before Cincinnati could inbound the ball, as the Ramblers won their first national championship in men's basketball, 60–58.|$|E

2500|$|The family {{took two}} weeks in 1816 to move to Spencer County in {{southern}} Indiana, settling at the Little Pigeon Creek Community. Lincoln was a talented carpenter who owned better carpentry tools than the average settler. He could build cabins {{in as little as}} four days, and was able to have their new home built before the winter began. The next year he built up the homestead, cleared land of trees and rocks before plowing, and planted crops. In early September 1818, some residents started <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> milk sickness. It was caused by the settlers' consuming dairy products or meat of cows that ate the white snakeroot plant, which had the toxin temetrol. Cows often roamed in woods and underbrush, where the white snakeroot grew. Most of those in Little Pigeon Creek with milk sickness became deathly ill, including Abraham's mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln. She succumbed and died on October 5, 1818. She was buried in a gravesite behind the family cabin next to the Lincolns' closest neighbor, Nancy Rusher Brooner. Brooner had also been ill with milk sickness, was nursed by Nancy Lincoln, and died two weeks before on September 18. [...] Nancy's maternal aunt and uncle, Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow, with whom she had grown up, also died of the illness and were buried nearby, at what became known as Pioneer Cemetery. [...] A minister could not reach the frontier settlement until the following spring, when he conducted a funeral service for all of the dead.|$|E
