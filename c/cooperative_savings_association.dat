40|$|Within {{two years}} of its {{transformation}} from a pilot project to an on-going savings programme for smallholders, the <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Savings</b> Scheme's balances increased from Sh 2 million to almost Sh 37 million, {{and the number of}} depositors exceeded 110, 000. By the close of 1974 these balances will no doubt exceed Sh 60 million, belonging to 150, 000 co-operators. <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Savings</b> Scheme balances have a considerable impact on cooperative finance and at the close of 1973 exceeded by Sh 22 million the amount of loans outstanding on the books of participating societies under the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme, a companion programme. The <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Savings</b> Scheme operates in rural areas only and most depositors are members of primary coffee marketing societies. The <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Savings</b> Scheme exhibits several operational and management problems and cannot yet be considered mature. However, its performance during a period of generally favourable conditions in the smallholder coffee sector suggests that considerable rural savings capacity exists among small cash crop farmers and that this capacity is not tapped by financial institutions other than <b>cooperatives.</b> <b>Savings</b> is defined simply as deferred consumption, and the financier's view of savings as a funds flow phenomenon is more relevant to rural development than are considerations of savings as an institutional phenomenon motivated by long run considerations...|$|R

40|$|This paper traces some micro {{enterprises}} with a sociological lens {{to view the}} situation on the ground for almost three decades (29 years). It highlights the as a case study the experiences of the Mucunabitu Iron Works (MIW) Cooperative Limited at Nasinu, Fiji. It includes thrift and credit or micro finance within the case study and beyond. It mentions some prominent Coops like Lutu in the Province of Naitasiri, Makadru in Matuku, Lau Province, Cane-growers <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Savings</b> and Loans <b>Association</b> (CCSLA) in Lautoka, Fiji Teachers Union Credit & Thrift Cooperative (FTU-CTC) in Suva, and Savu Coop in Naitasiri. The role played by the author, research conducted through the Sociology & Social Work Division of the School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts and Law, University of the South Pacific (USP). The study highlights developing cooperatives and micro finance as social enterprises establishing the basis of developing capacities to contribute to development after four coups. National policy mooted by the late former Reserve Bank Governor and Vice Chancellor, Mr. Savenaca Siwatibau supports the work pursued here from interactions with him and of course his paper (Narsey 2009). The need for social as well as {{micro enterprises}} in Fiji and globally can no longer be ignored. Much has been written in Bolivia micro finance and Bangladesh‟s Grameen Bank (Todaro & Smith 2006 : 341 - 7). It is our challenge to support micro enterprises in Fiji and the South Pacific now for it should robustly develop our countries for our livelihood as well as contributing largely to sustaining our economic and social progress...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} whether {{elimination of the}} <b>savings</b> <b>association</b> charter might reduce lending to "nontraditional" (e. g., low-income) mortgage borrowers. We present a theoretical model of lender portfolio choice, in which nontraditional lenders have some market power and traditional lenders are price-takers in the mortgage market. The comparative statics indicate differences between nontraditional and traditional lenders {{in terms of their}} asset allocation responses to changes in borrower income and house prices. Empirical tests indicate the absence of such differences between <b>savings</b> <b>associations</b> and commercial banks, suggesting that elimination of the <b>savings</b> <b>association</b> charter would not impair lending to nontraditional mortgage borrowers.
