25|$|The {{families}} of Cypriniformes are traditionally {{divided into two}} superfamilies. Superfamily Cyprinioidea contains the carps and minnows (Cyprinidae) and, according to some, also the mountain carps as the family Psilorhynchidae. In 2012 Maurice Kottelat reviewed the superfamily Cobitioidea and under his revision it now consists of the following families: hillstream loaches (Balitoridae), Barbuccidae, Botiidae, suckers (Catostomidae), true loaches (<b>Cobitidae),</b> Ellopostomatidae, Gastromyzontidae, sucking loaches (Gyrinocheilidae), stone loaches (Nemacheilidae), Serpenticobitidae and long-finned loaches (Vaillantellidae).|$|E
25|$|The {{well-known}} red-tailed black shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor) {{from the}} Mae Klong river of The Bridge on the River Kwai fame possibly only survives in captivity. Ironically, while pollution {{and other forms}} of overuse by humans have driven it from its native home, it is bred for the aquarium fish trade by the thousands. The Yarqon bleak (Acanthobrama telavivensis) from the Yarqon River had to be rescued into captivity from imminent extinction; new populations have apparently been established again successfully from captive stock. Balitoridae and <b>Cobitidae,</b> meanwhile, contain {{a very large number of}} species about which essentially nothing is known except how they look and where they were first found.|$|E
2500|$|Balitoridae and Gyrinocheilidae are {{families}} of mountain stream fishes feeding on algae and small invertebrates. They are {{found only in}} tropical and subtropical Asia. While the former are a speciose group, the latter contain {{only a handful of}} species. The suckers (Catostomidae) are found in temperate North America and eastern Asia. These large fishes are similar to carps in appearance and ecology. Members of <b>Cobitidae</b> common across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. A mid-sized group like the suckers, they are rather similar to catfish in appearance and behaviour, feeding primarily off the substrate and equipped with barbels to help them locate food at night or in murky conditions. Fishes in the families <b>Cobitidae,</b> Balitoridae, Botiidae, and Gyrinocheilidae are called loaches, although it seems that the last do not belong to the lineage of [...] "true" [...] loaches but are related to the suckers.|$|E
2500|$|Obligate {{cavefish}} {{are known}} {{from a wide}} range of families: Characidae (characids), Balitoridae (hillstream loaches), <b>Cobitidae</b> (true loaches), Cyprinidae (carps and allies), Nemacheilidae (stone loaches), Amblycipitidae (torrent catfishes), Astroblepidae (naked sucker-mouth catfishes), Callichthyidae (armored catfishes), Clariidae (airbreathing catfishes), Heptapteridae (heptapterid catfishes), Ictaluridae (ictalurid catfishes), Kryptoglanidae (kryptoglanid catfish), Loricariidae (loricariid catfishes), Phreatobiidae (phreatobiid catfishes), Trichomycteridae (pencil catfishes), Sternopygidae (glass knifefishes), Amblyopsidae (U.S. cavefishes), Bythitidae (brotulas), Poeciliidae (live-bearers), Synbranchidae (swamp eels), Cottidae (true sculpins), Eleotridae (sleeper gobies) and Gobiidae (gobies). Many of these families are only very distantly related and do not form a monophyletic group, showing that adaptations to a life in caves has happened numerous times among fish. As such, the descriptive term [...] "cavefish" [...] is an example of folk taxonomy rather than scientific taxonomy. Strictly speaking some Cyprinodontidae (pupfish) are also known from sinkhole caves, famously including the Devils Hole pupfish, but these lack the adaptations (e.g., reduced eyes and pigmentation) typically associated with cavefish. Additionally, species from a few families such as Chaudhuriidae (earthworm eels), Glanapteryginae and Sarcoglanidinae live buried in the bottom of aboveground waters, and can show adaptions similar to traditional underground-living (troglobitic) fish. It has been argued that such species should be recognized as a part of the group of troglobitic fish.|$|E

5000|$|The Botiids {{are more}} robust {{than most of}} their {{relatives}} in <b>Cobitidae</b> and {{tend to have a}} more or less arched back, yielding an altogether more [...] shape. Botiids typically have a pointed snout of intermediate length, while many cobitids are remarkably stub-nosed.|$|E
50|$|Botiidae is {{a family}} of cypriniform ray-finned fishes from South, Southeast, and East Asia.

5000|$|<b>Cobitidae,</b> {{also known}} as the True loaches, is a family of Old World {{freshwater}} fish. They occur throughout Eurasia and in Morocco, and inhabit riverine ecosystems.

50|$|Cobitis is a palearctic genus of ray-finned fish in {{the family}} <b>Cobitidae.</b> It {{contains}} the typical spiny loaches, including the well-known spined loach of temperate western Eurasia. As of early 2012, the genus contained 69 named species. Similar spiny loaches, occurring generally south {{of the range of}} Cobitis, are nowadays separated in Sabanejewia.|$|E
50|$|The pond loach, dojo loach (dojō), or oriental/Japanese weather loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), is a {{freshwater}} {{fish in the}} loach family <b>Cobitidae.</b> They are native to East Asia but are also popular as an aquarium fish and introduced elsewhere in Asia and to Europe, North America and Australia. The alternate name weather loach is shared with several other <b>Cobitidae,</b> including {{the other members of}} the genus Misgurnus and the spotted weather loach (Cobitis taenia, commonly known as spined loach). This term comes from their ability to detect changes in barometric pressure and react with frantic swimming or standing on end. This is because before a storm the barometric pressure changes, and this is known to make these fish more active. The pond loach also comes in a variety of colors, such as pink, orange, albino and gray.|$|E
