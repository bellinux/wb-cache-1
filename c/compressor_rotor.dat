A very important catch {{not only in}} the engineering, but also in other developed production industries in general pay large attention on lifetime of the instruments, machines, tables of work, and also their complete parts, including rotors of screw type compressors. Hasty growth of screw compressor field and variety of their constructions enables this wide use. A screw type compressor is one of the simplest mechanisms, which uses for production of the compressed air. Screw compressor is rotary positive displacement machine, which is compact and have few moving parts, and which operate at high efficiency over a wide range of speeds and pressure differences. Already long time scientists of engineering solve problems, which relates to the changes of mechanical properties of rotors of screw type compressors and possibilities to increase lifetime of rotors without diminishing his efficiency in action. The rotors of screw type compressors are the most important details, which makes influence on running efficiency. Threadbare of rotors and change of material properties diminishes efficiency of action of compressor, and their lifetime. The task of this work is analysis and solutions for these problems. There are changes in contact surfaces of rotors of screw type compressors, which act in process of manufacturing and exploitation. This includes analysis of surface roughness and changes of mechanical properties of rotors during exploitation, as well as changes of material structure of rotors in process of manufacturing. The changes on contact surface roughness of rotors of screw type compressor are analyzed {{at the beginning of the}} article. The change of surface roughness is one of the most important pointers of oil-flooded compressors, which makes influence on hermetic of axis in the pair apartment of screw, together with it also pointer of productivity and action.

5000|$|In {{overall design}} terms, the PS.13 {{was similar to}} the RB.106, using a [...] "two-spool" [...] layout with {{low-pressure}} and high-pressure sections of the compressor for added efficiency. It differed slightly in being somewhat more powerful, especially in afterburner. However, the design also incorporated a number of new design features intended to improve simplicity and lightness. With this in mind, Orenda pioneered work in the use of titanium in engines, with 20% by weight of the Iroquois (mainly the <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> blades) consisting of this metal. Titanium has light weight, high strength and good temperature and corrosion resistance. It was estimated that the engine would be 850 lb lighter than if steel had been used. During the early 1950s, this material was in short supply, and the lack of knowledge of its physical properties and fabrication techniques created problems which had to be overcome. It was also very expensive relative to the more common materials such as steel and aluminum.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of an assumed steady inlet {{circumferential}} total pressure distortion, three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations are conducted on an axial flow subsonic <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor.</b> The performances and flow fields of a <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor,</b> either casing treated or untreated, are investigated in detail either with or without inlet pressure distortion. Results show that the circumferential groove casing treatment can expand the operating range of the <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> either with or without inlet pressure distortion {{at the expense of}} a drop in peak isentropic efficiency. The casing treatment is capable of weakening or even removing the tip leakage vortex effectively either with or without inlet distortion. In clean inlet circumstances, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex cause the untreated <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> to stall. By contrast, with circumferential groove casing, the serious flow separation on the suction surface leads to aerodynamic stalling eventually. In the presence of inlet pressure distortion, the blade loading changes from passage to passage as the distorted inflow sector is traversed. Similar to the clean inlet circumstances, with a smooth wall casing, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex are still the main factors which lead to the <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> stalling eventually. When the rotor works under near stall conditions, the blockage resulting from the tip leakage vortex in all the passages is very serious. Especially in several passages, flow-spillage is observed. Compared to the clean inlet circumstances, circumferential groove casing treatment can also eliminate the low energy zone in the outer end wall region effectively...|$|E

40|$|Calculation of the {{clearances}} {{between the}} blades and casing of the high-pressurecompressor rotors in aeroengines involves calculating the radial {{growth of the}} corotating compressor disks. This requires the calculation of the thermal growth of the disks, which in turn requires knowledge of their temperatures and of the Nusselt numbers and the flow structure in the cavity between the disks. The authors have recently published a theoretical model of the buoyancy-induced flow in rotating cavities, and approximate solutions were obtained for laminar Ekman-layer flow on the disks; the equation for the Nusselt numbers, which includes two empirical constants, depends strongly on the Grashof number and on the radial distribution of disk temperature. In this paper, Nusselt numbers and disk temperatures predicted by the buoyancy model are compared with values obtained from published experimental data. For most of the 19 test cases, with Grashof numbers up to nearly 1012, mainly good agreement was achieved between the theoretical and experimental distributions of Nusselt numbers and disk temperatures. This suggests that, owing to Coriolis effects, the laminar model of buoyancy-induced rotating flow could be valid even at the high Grashof numbers found in the <b>compressor</b> <b>rotors</b> of aeroengines. As predicted by the model, for a constant Grashof number increasing the rotational Reynolds number can cause {{a decrease in the}} Nusselt number. This is the first time a theoretical model (rather than computational fluid dynamics (CFD)) has been used to predict the temperatures of a compressor disk, and the model takes only seconds to predict disk temperatures that would take days or even weeks to predict using CFD.
