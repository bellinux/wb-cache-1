50|$|In {{electrical}} and electronic engineering, a current clamp or <b>current</b> <b>probe</b> is an electrical device with jaws which open to allow clamping around an electrical conductor. This allows {{measurement of the}} current in a conductor without {{the need to make}} physical contact with it, or to disconnect it for insertion through the probe. Current clamps are typically used to read the magnitude of alternating current (AC) and, with additional instrumentation, the phase and waveform can also be measured. Some clamps meters can measure currents of 1000 A and more. Hall effect and vane type clamps can also measure direct current (DC).|$|E
5000|$|The classic <b>current</b> <b>probe</b> {{is a low}} valued {{resistor}} (a [...] "sampling resistor" [...] or [...] "current shunt") {{inserted in}} the current's path. The current is determined by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor and using Ohm's law. [...] The sampling resistance needs to be small enough not to affect circuit operation significantly, but large enough to provide a good reading. The method is valid for both AC and DC measurements. A disadvantage of this method {{is the need to}} break the circuit to introduce the shunt. Another problem is measuring the voltage across the shunt when common-mode voltages are present; a differential voltage measurement is needed.|$|E
50|$|Early surveys (beginning {{in the mid}} 20th century) {{often used}} the Wenner array, which was a linear array of four probes. These were {{arranged}} current-voltage-voltage-current, at equal distances across the array. Probes were mounted on a rigid frame, or placed individually. While quite sensitive, this array has a very wide span for its depth of investigation, leading to problems with horizontal resolution. A number of experimental arrays attempted to overcome the shortcomings of the Wenner array, The most successful of these being the twin-probe array, which has become the standard for archaeological use. The twin-probe array - despite its name - has four probes: one current and one voltage probe mounted on a mobile frame to collect survey readings, and the other <b>current</b> <b>probe</b> placed remotely along with a voltage reference probe. These fixed remote probes {{are connected to the}} mobile survey probes by a trailing cable. This configuration is very compact for its depth of investigation, resulting in superior horizontal resolution. The logistical advantage of the more compact array is somewhat offset by the trailing cable.|$|E

40|$|An eddy <b>current</b> <b>probe</b> which {{provides}} a null-signal {{in the presence of}} unflawed material without the need for any balancing circuitry has been developed at NASA Langley Research Center [1]. Such a unique capability of the probe reduces set-up time, eliminates tester configuration errors, and decreases instrumentation requirements. The probe is highly sensitive to surface breaking fatigue cracks, and shows excellent resolution for the measurement of material thickness, including material loss due to corrosion damage. The presence of flaws in the material under test causes an increase in the extremely stable and reproducible output voltage of the probe. The design of the probe and some examples illustrating its flaw detection capabilities are presented. Probe Design The self-nulling eddy <b>current</b> <b>probe</b> is a driver-pickup type eddy <b>current</b> <b>probe</b> which has a ferromagnetic shield inserted between the drive and sensor coils. The ferromagnetic material focuses the flux of the probe into a tight cylinder about the outer diameter of the pickup coil.
