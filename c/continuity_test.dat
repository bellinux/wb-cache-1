5000|$|In electronics, a <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> is the {{checking}} of {{an electric}} circuit to see if current flows (that {{it is in fact}} a complete circuit).A <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> is performed by placing a small voltage (wired in series with an LED or noise-producing component such as a piezoelectric speaker) across the chosen path. If electron flow is inhibited by broken conductors, damaged components, or excessive resistance, the circuit is [...] "open".|$|E
50|$|When a {{locomotive}} is first coupled to a train, or if a vehicle is detached or added, a brake <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> is carried out, {{to ensure that}} the brake pipes are connected throughout {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|E

A rolled newspaper was discovered in the train pipe, effectively isolating the rear part of the train from the driver's control. The blockage should have been detected if a proper brake <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> had been carried out before the train started its journey.|$|E

50|$|Electrical safety {{testing is}} {{essential}} to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity. Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide. In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on. To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or high potential test), Insulation Resistance Test, Ground (Earth) Bond & Ground <b>Continuity</b> <b>Test</b> & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current Test, Enclosure Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test). These tests are described in IEC 60335, IEC 61010 and many other national and international standards.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} steered data-analysis {{approach}} to measure coherence for fault detection. In contrast with conventional coherence, which detects discontinuities without distinction, our approach aims to identify faults only. Assuming the local linearity of fault geometry, the method performs a <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> using a steered data-analysis window over {{a set of}} dip/azimuth directions. A robust, selective directional <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> is achieved by combining measures of coherence computed from a few aligned, steered windows. Finally, fault detection consists of finding the maximum directional response and accumulating it into an attribute volume. A comparison between results obtained on both synthetic and real seismic images indicates the new method is superior to the conventional coherence measure in isolating faults from stratigraphic signature and noise. Undesired scale, staircase, and mislocation effects are reduced noticeably...|$|E

More localized impact scenarios – for example loss of a specific floor in a building – may also be documented. The BC plans should reflect the requirements to recover the business in the widest possible damage. The risk assessment should cater to developing impact scenarios that are applicable to the business or the premises it operates. For example, it might not be logical to consider tsunami in the region of Mideast since the likelihood of such a threat is negligible.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Continuity</b> <b>Test</b> is the {{principle}} that a proposed distribution of resources is wrong if it treats someone as disadvantaged when they don’t {{see it that way}} themselves, for example by offering compensation for features that they do not themselves regard as handicaps. This principle – which is most prominently developed in Ronald Dworkin’s defence of his theory of distributive justice – is an attractive one for a liberal to endorse as part of her theory of distributive justice and disadvantage. In this paper, I play out some of its implications, and show that in its basic form the <b>Continuity</b> <b>Test</b> is inconsistent. It relies on a tacit commitment to the protection of autonomy, understood to consist in an agent deciding for herself what is valuable and living her life in accordance with that decision. A contradiction arises when we consider factors which are putatively disadvantaging by dint of threatening individual autonomy construed in this way. I argue that the problem can be resolved by embracing a more explicit commitment to the protection (and perhaps promotion) of individual autonomy. This implies a constrained version of the <b>Continuity</b> <b>Test,</b> thereby salvaging most of the intuitions which lead people to endorse the Test. It also gives us the wherewithal to sketch an interesting and novel theory of distributive justice, with individual autonomy at its core...|$|E

3000|$|<b>Continuity</b> <b>testing</b> Testing {{helps to}} examine the {{comprehensiveness}} and applicability of the BC plan {{and its ability to}} cope with various disaster and crisis scenarios. It ensures that the BC plan can be executed and that all the required resources are deployed as part of the overall BCM strategy. Full plan testing in a real atmosphere (also known as exercising the plan) enables continuity teams to find possible weaknesses in their plans and to strengthen them. Testing also builds confidence amongst people and reduces panic at the time of emergency (Green 2014). Most importantly, it is significant to note that testing should not be limited to internal employees. Engaging customers, business partners, and other agencies that support business operations is also significant.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a flexible arrangement of robots used for two point continuity tests. Robots are used increasingly {{in the manufacturing}} industry because of their flexibility. In the electronics packaging industry, there are many instances where one wants to do a two point <b>continuity</b> <b>test.</b> These two points can be anywhere on a given card.

40|$|Recent work by Nichols et al [8] and Pecora et al[22] {{have shown}} that {{steady-state}} dynamic analysis of structural health exhibits large advantages over transient vibrational analysis. A geometric representation of system dynamics {{can be used to}} extract information about a structure's response to sustained excitation. Analysis of various features of the geometric representation can be used to describe {{the degree to which the}} dynamics have been altered by damage. Here, the feature we employ is the "continuity test, " a statistical test rst described by Pecora, Carroll and Heagy [14]. This test measures the probability that a continuous function exists from one geometric object to another. In this implementation, we formulate a new null hypothesis which serves to make the test less sensitive to noise in the data than the original test. Using experimental data from an excited three-story aluminum frame structure with multiple sensors at the joints, we show that the <b>continuity</b> <b>test</b> can be used not only to detect, but also in some cases to localize damage to particular joints in the frame structure...|$|E
