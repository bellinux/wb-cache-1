50|$|A <b>combination</b> <b>machine</b> is a {{woodworking}} machine that combines {{the functions of}} two or more separate machines into a single unit. For example, a <b>combination</b> <b>machine</b> might consist of a tablesaw with a side mounted jointer. Another common example of this type of machine is the jointer-thicknesser (also known as an over-under) which combines the function of a jointer with that of a planer.|$|E
5000|$|The European <b>combination</b> <b>machine</b> allows {{efficient}} {{processing of}} both rough-cut timber and sheet stock (i.e. plywood). The sliding table {{can work in}} conjunction with either the table saw or the shaper. Outfitted with an 8-foot sliding table and outrigger, a single person can cut 4'x8' plywood very accurately and efficiently. Changing between most functions takes only a few seconds.|$|E
50|$|One {{rationale}} {{for the production of}} these machines is space saving. A <b>combination</b> <b>machine</b> takes up much less space than the equivalent separate machines. Most European machines have a sliding table that tends to make them safer than typical North American table saws. Even though top end combination machines can be quite expensive, there usually is a cost saving over separate machines of similar quality.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{companies}} in Austria, Italy, France and Belgium manufacture what is commonly known in North America as a Euro(pean) <b>combination</b> <b>machine,</b> which typically contains a sliding-table saw with a scoring blade, a shaper, a thicknesser, a jointer, and a mortiser. These machines generally have 3 motors, {{one for the}} table saw, one for the shaper, and one shared by the thickness planer/jointer and mortiser.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 an {{employee}} demonstrated the K R Wilson <b>Combination</b> <b>Machine.</b> Within three hours he relined the crankshaft bearings, bored them to accurate size and re-bored four cylinders {{to a standard}} Ford size. The work would previously have taken 18 to 20 hours. A special assembly bench by Manley Motor Support assisted with quick and accurate re-assembly. The machinery was claimed to bring factory exactness to the local garage and ensure a full 12,000 miles of running without further attention. Other machinery for the same purpose included the Wright Multi-valve Grinder which grinds 4 valves at once, the Ames Cylinder Gauge, the Wilson Crankcase Aligning Jig and Weaver Axle Stand.|$|E
50|$|Cliff and Peat became {{partners}} {{with a common}} goal. They had several meetings with local Congressman M Clyde Kelly to convince Kelly of the benefits in bringing aviation to the Pittsburgh area. Cliff and Peat would continue to lobby for aviation with local business men while Kelly took it to congress. In 1924 Cliff and Peat began {{to raise money to}} expand the airfield. Cliff mortgaged everything he owned and they borrowed the rest. They used the money to buy the property from Neal for $35,000 in August 1925. Cliff was President and Peat was Vice-President of the new Pittsburgh-McKeesport air field PMA. PMA started out on 25 acres. They used the leftover money from the purchase of the property along with additional funding, from Sam Brendel, Neel and Cliff's brother Albert Ball, and they erected a building that was used as a <b>combination</b> <b>machine</b> shop, concession stand and living quarters for pilots. Peat cut down trees and ran a tractor filling in ditches adding an additional 18 acres of useful space to the airfield. Cliff would stage aerial stunts and plane rides as well as running the concession stand. In 1925 Cliff hired a secretary, Helen Marie Stinner, who also acted as gatekeeper and ticket taker.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>combination</b> <b>machines</b> run all {{of their}} {{functions}} from a single motor; others may use more than one. Cutter heads are often shared: for example a jointer-thicknesser may use the same cutter head for both functions. The machines rely upon well thought-out designs which allow the user to switch from one function to another easily.|$|R
5000|$|Ghiorso invented {{numerous}} {{techniques and}} machines for isolating and identifying heavy elements atom-by-atom. He is generally credited with implementing the multichannel analyzer and {{the technique of}} recoil to isolate reaction products, although both of these were significant extensions of previously understood concepts. His concept for {{a new type of}} accelerator, the Omnitron, is acknowledged to have been a brilliant advance that probably would have enabled the Berkeley lab to discover numerous additional new elements, but the machine was never built, a victim of the evolving political landscape of the 1970s in the U.S. that de-emphasized basic nuclear research and greatly expanded research on environmental, health, and safety issues. Partially {{as a result of the}} failure to build the Omnitron, Ghiorso (together with colleagues Bob Main and others) conceived the joining of the HILAC and the Bevatron, which he called the Bevalac. This <b>combination</b> <b>machine,</b> an ungainly articulation across the steep slope at the Rad Lab, provided heavy ions at GeV energies, thereby enabling development of two new fields of research: [...] "high-energy nuclear physics," [...] meaning that the compound nucleus is sufficiently hot to exhibit collective dynamical effects, and heavy ion therapy, in which high-energy ions are used to irradiate tumors in cancer patients. Both of these fields have expanded into activities in many laboratories and clinics worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Protein-protein {{interface}} {{prediction is}} a booming field, with a substantial {{growth in the}} number of new methods being published the last two years. The increasing number of available three-dimensional structures of protein-protein complexes has enabled large-scale statistical analyses of protein interfaces, considering evolutionary, physicochemical and structural properties. Successful combinations of these properties have led to more accurate interface predictors in recent years. In addition to parametric <b>combination,</b> <b>machine</b> learning algorithms have become popular. In the meantime, assessing the absolute and relative performance of interface predictors remains very difficult: This is due to differences in both the output of the various interface predictors, and in the evaluation criteria used by their respective authors. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in the field, and discusses the performance of existing interface predictors. The focus is mainly on protein-protein interface prediction, although most issues are also valid for other kinds of interface prediction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between farm size and energy productivity of wheat production in west Azerbaijan province, Iran. Farmers with different farm sizes (less than two hectares, between two and five hectares and more than five hectares) were randomly selected. Questionnaires were filled by 61 farmers. Then total used energy, produced energy, energy productivity and energy ratio were calculated for each farm. Also the relationship between energy indexes and three methods of tillage and planting (<b>combination</b> <b>machine,</b> seed drill and seed spreader) and three harvesting methods (combine harvester, mower and hand tools) were calculated. The data were analyzed by SPSS software. The results showed that fertilizers (43 %) and machinery (40 %) was the maximum portion of total used energy on farm. There was no significant linear relationship between the farm size and energy indexes. There was no significant relationship between energy indexes and harvesting methods. But there was a significant relationship between tillage and planting methods and energy indexes. Results showed that tillage and planting methods such as combination tillage and planter machine application increases the effect of farm size on energy indexes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural products withhigh consumption different forms of usage asfood and fodder. Corn yield and its cultivation needs improvement especially in developing countries. In conventional fertilizing methods with centrifuge machines or hand fertilization, parts of the fertilizer lost through volatilization, leaching and weeds absorption. Leaf burning is also reported in this method. Fertilizer placement in bands is a method that does not show these disadvantages and improves fertilizer use efficiency for the crop. Therefore using new machines and new methods for fertilizing the crop,the cultivation area and mean of yield productioncan improved, for example the yield of corn in this research. Material and Methods: This research was conducted in Lak Lak research farm in Asadabad district. Moldboard plowing plus disking was used for bed preparing the seeds anda 4 rows crop planter was used for planting the seeds. For treatments conducting <b>Combination</b> <b>machine</b> that had designed in thisresearch station workshop was used. This machine was able to place Urea fertilizer with different methods (fertilizer drilling in the rills, fertilizer placement in one side and two sides of plants). The variety of corn that used for this experiment was SC 704 with 65000 plants in one hectareas plant density. After soil sampling nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium fertilizers and other fertilizers demands by means of soil testwere determined. Half of the nitrogen was used at planting time from source of urea and the other half was used as top dressing duringgrowth season due to treatments as follow: 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants The treatments were conducted through 7 - 9 leaf bearing stage of corn growth. After harvesting, the mean yield of each plot and other data of plant attributes were collected through growth season and leaf samples were collected for nitrogen analysis. All data were analyzed usingmeans of Duncan's test.

Experiments on high speed rough machining and finishing machining of the commonly used 6061 aluminum alloy are conducted to find its performance and best <b>combination</b> of <b>machining</b> parameters. The rough machining experiment is to find the best machining parameters to achieve maximum material removal rate (MRR).
