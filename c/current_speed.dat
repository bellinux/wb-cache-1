5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via <b>current</b> <b>speed.</b> While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino is {{designed}} as a premium facility train. The seats are fitted with audio sockets for radio and music channels; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage. All seats have electricity sockets for laptops and mobile phones. All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi-Fi Internet access since 2010. The passenger information monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train's <b>current</b> <b>speed</b> in addition to VR's marketing material and station information. They are also used to convey passenger information for the deaf. The train is accessible for wheelchairs, contains pet spaces and seats for allergic passengers.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{approach}} to the estimate of long-term sediment discharge through an entrance to a tidal basin is described. Using the method, cross-sectional mean <b>current</b> <b>speeds</b> are derived, {{on the basis of}} the definition of an ‘apparent tidal basin area’, from records of water level data from a single tide gauge. The obtained time-series of <b>current</b> <b>speeds</b> are then used to define ‘local’ <b>current</b> <b>speeds,</b> through the use of a sectional distribution function for the currents. Sediment transport formulae are then applied, using the obtained speed data and other relevant parameters contained within the formulae and frequency distribution functions with regard to wave and tidal current characteristics, to estimate sediment discharge through the entrance. Analytical procedures of the method are described in detail, in an example from Christchurch Harbour (southern England) ...|$|R
25|$|It {{is defined}} as the work needed to {{accelerate}} a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity.

25|$|Each seat {{featured}} a standard 3.5mm audio jack with controls for switching between eight channels: three radio programs from public broadcasters, three programs played from Compact Disc and two audio channels for video programs. In both classes, some seats featured video monitors in the backrests of the seats. Luggage could be stored both {{above and below}} the seats. The main part of the car was divided by a coat rack. Every seat had its own reading lamp and information monitors in the entrance areas switched between displaying the train's route and the <b>current</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth audio frequency induction loops between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its <b>current</b> <b>speed</b> it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Once {{established}} {{in a particular}} waterbody Tarebia granifera is likely to disperse actively, both up and downstream {{in the case of}} flowing systems, as far as environmental factors like <b>current</b> <b>speed</b> and food availability will allow. The snail’s tolerance of turbulent, flowing water was demonstrated by Prentice (1983) who reported it migrating upstream on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia at a rate of 100 m month−1 in streams discharging up to 50 l.s−1. In KwaZulu-Natal it has been collected in water flowing at up to 1.2 m.s−1 which is likely to exceed the current speeds of at least the lower and middle reaches of many rivers and streams in South Africa making these watercourses open to colonization.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{the main}} cities of Poland are linked by railway {{transport}} reaching 160km/h. On 14 December 2014, Polish State Railways started passenger service trains PKP Pendolino ED250 operating 200km/h speed on 80km line Olszamowice-Zawiercie (part of railway line called Central Trunk Line (CMK) from Warsaw to Katowice). Currently {{it is the}} line with highest railway speed in Poland. Several other sections of the Central Trunk Line will soon allow speeds of 200km/h (with a <b>current</b> <b>speed</b> record set up by Pendolino Train on 21 November 2013 in Poland of 293km/h).

500|$|British code-breakers {{were able}} to decrypt some of the German signals, {{including}} an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for Bismarck making for Brest, decrypted by Jane Fawcett on 25 May 1941. The French Resistance provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which Bismarck would have to pass. A squadron of Coastal Command PBY Catalinas based in Northern Ireland joined the search, covering areas where Bismarck might head {{in the attempt to}} reach occupied France.

500|$|However, {{there is}} no precise point at which an object {{can be said to}} have reached {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, [...] "how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice." [...] Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from gravitational collapse, impacts, tidal forces, or radioactive decay, also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal, but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its <b>current</b> <b>speed</b> of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is.|$|E

When <b>current</b> <b>speeds</b> are low, the damselfish forages higher in a water column where the flux of plankton is greater {{and they have a}} larger food source. As <b>current</b> <b>speeds</b> increase, it forages closer {{to the bottom of the}} column. Feeding rates tend to be higher when currents are faster. Smaller fishes forage closer to their substrates than do larger ones, possibly in response to predation pressures.|$|R

500|$|Double Dash is a kart racing {{video game}} in which the player races in a kart against other teams in {{different}} courses. The game screen indicates the current standings in a race, the <b>current</b> <b>speed</b> of the player's kart and incoming weapons. Like in the previous installments, players can pick up item boxes to receive a randomly selected item {{and use it to}} impede the opposition and gain the advantage. Some items, such as shells and bananas, allow the player to hit others to slow them down, while other items, such as the star power-up, render them temporarily invincible to attacks. This is the only game in the series in which instead of one character per kart, there are two: one to drive, and one to use items; and is also the first in the series where players drop their items when hit by a weapon. The powerslide technique, an action that allows the player to drift around turns, has been improved; players can tilt the control stick while drifting to make sparks appear around their kart. If tilted enough, the sparks turn blue, and the player gains a speed boost known as a [...] "mini-turbo". The rocket start, an action that allows the player to gain a speed boost when a race begins is also improved as the Double Dash, which can only be done as a team.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMuddy sediments {{with their}} {{potential}} for containing contaminants are commonly deposited and remobilized by tidal currents in estuarine environments. We examined the mobilization and subsequent redeposition of mud in a coastal plain estuary located in the southeastern United States.

We found that fast-settling mud particles are found during the highest tidal <b>current</b> <b>speeds.</b> Particle quality analyses suggest that all the material is of similar origin, and that phaeopigment {{can be used as}} a tracer of particles in this system. These particles settle onto the bed when <b>current</b> <b>speeds</b> approach slack conditions. We speculate that the quantity of mud mobilized during neap tide is less than during spring tide resulting in an opportunity for the mud to partially consolidate on the bottom and be removed from resuspension. We further speculate that the muddy sediments are mainly derived from fringing marshes in this estuary...|$|R
40|$|The global {{increase}} in tidal stream turbine installations creates {{a need to}} identify and mitigate any impacts on seabird populations. Within Scotland, UK, the vulnerability of black guillemots Cepphus grylle and European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis is dependent on their tendency to exploit microhabitats characterised by fast mean horizontal <b>current</b> <b>speeds</b> (≥ 2 ms– 1), and tidal states with maximum <b>current</b> <b>speeds,</b> within tidal stream environments. Identifying consistencies in their relative use of different microhabitats (fast versus slow mean horizontal <b>current</b> <b>speeds)</b> and tidal states (increasing/decreasing versus maximum currents) across these habitats could assist risk assessment and mitigation measures at both a regional and development site level. Datasets from shore-based surveys collated across 6 tidal stream environments showed that the probability of detecting foraging black guillemots and European shags tended to be higher in fast and slow microhabitats, respectively. However, differences between microhabitats were reversed and/or marginal in 3 out of the 5 sites used for each species. Differences between tidal states were almost always marginal. These variabilities show that a species' vulnerability could differ greatly among development sites, and environmental impact assessments (EIA) must quantify habitat-use using dedicated and site-specific surveys to reduce uncertainty. However, {{a greater understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying variation in the use of tidal stream environments is needed when selecting a suite of potential development sites that reduce the possibility of population-level impacts. The current collection of physical and biological data across tidal stream environments could therefore prove invaluable for the protection of seabird populations...|$|R
