5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} sleight of hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several sleight of hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the <b>Card</b> <b>Table</b> from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), {{emphasized the importance of}} incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a <b>card</b> <b>table</b> on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E

25|$|During the John F. Kennedy administration, the Entrance Hall (like {{most of the}} White House) {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} historic redecoration. The redecoration of the State Floor rooms, including the Entrance Hall, was overseen by American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont and French interior designer Stéphane Boudin. Du Pont wanted a more historic approach to the White House, while Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic. Du Pont originally redecorated the Entrance Hall with two French pier tables, a settee, a <b>card</b> <b>table,</b> and two tables by Charles-Honoré Lannuier. Boudin had all but the pier tables removed, and his style is the one which remained {{over the next several}} decades.|$|E

She tells them that her motive is Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement. Wearing gloves supplied by Clarissa, they manage to move the body back into the recess, with the intention of moving him later, but are interrupted when the police unexpectedly arrive.

500|$|In Arhanghelii, the {{implicit}} Christian lesson {{is about the}} love of money and its devastation of an Apuseni get-rich mining community. At {{the heart of the}} novel is a former notary, Rodean, whose gold claim appears to be endlessly productive and corrupting. As Șăineanu writes: [...] "with emotion and mounting interest, we witness here the ephemeral joys and disasters that this modern-day Moloch pours over this once-peaceful village." [...] The novel, Lovinescu argues, is overall [...] "awkward", but still interesting as a social fresco, called a [...] "frightening human torment" [...] by Iorga. Șăineanu deplores its [...] "prolixity" [...] and arcane mining terminology. As argued by Dragomirescu, the climax, where Rodean runs from the <b>card</b> <b>table</b> to see his mine collapsing, [...] "has remarkable qualities of literary vividness and vigor." [...] Nicolae Manolescu offers praise to the work, a [...] "solidly realistic novel" [...] that, although widely seen as a pastiche from Slavici, should still be taken into account for its [...] "originality and newness". He sees Agârbiceanu as an [...] "unlucky" [...] novelist, whose work was eclipsed by that of Rebreanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Gala Galaction, which it only resembles coincidentally.|$|E
500|$|In early April 1945, Anna {{arranged}} for Rutherfurd {{to come over}} from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his [...] "Little White House" [...] in Warm Springs, Georgia, the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s. Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at a <b>card</b> <b>table</b> by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician.|$|E
500|$|Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd (1862–1944), {{a widower}} then in his fifties, but despite her {{marriage}} and Franklin's promise, the two remained in surreptitious, albeit infrequent contact {{in the three}} decades that followed. Especially during the War years, Franklin's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, more frequently after Rutherfurd's death in 1944. [...] Mercer was in Warm Springs, Georgia, at the [...] "Little White House" [...] the President's long-time cottage and retreat, {{at the time of}} Roosevelt's death in April 1945. He was having his portrait painted, at Mercer's request, by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending. While sitting at a <b>card</b> <b>table</b> by the fireplace, reading an upcoming speech, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of my}} head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious. [...] Madame Shoumatoff, who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. [...] Mercer's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies.|$|E

His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine. As this type of equipment was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates tired {{of this type of}} work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses at the <b>card</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Con men and grifters too may use {{techniques}} of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games {{is an obvious}} example, and not a surprising one: {{one of the most}} respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert at the <b>Card</b> <b>Table</b> by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as [...] "Find the Lady" [...] or [...] "Three-card Monte" [...] is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.|$|E
