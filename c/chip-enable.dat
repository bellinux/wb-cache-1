40|$|Abstract — 1 This paper studies a dual {{interrogation}} mode (hybrid chip-enabled/chipless) {{technique to}} detect an embroidered RFID-enabled sensor. We {{have created a}} hybrid RFID strain sensor utilizing both chipped and chipless approaches. A comparison between the read range extraction technique which relies upon the detection of the threshold power that is required to activate an RFID IC, and a radar RCS-based technique that does not require any protocol is presented. An embroidered RFID sensor with an electrical length that is directly linked to the applied strain is realized and interrogated using both techniques. The sensitivities for the chipless radar technique and for the <b>chip-enabled</b> read range extraction technique are 0. 66 % and 0. 43 % frequency shift, respectively, for 1 % strain variation. Simulations and measurements validate the dual interrogation mode and provide the proof of concept that a <b>chip-enabled</b> RFID sensor tag can be detected accurately utilizing backscattering RCS measurements.

As of June 2014, Sam's Club discontinued offering the Sam's Discover card and now offers a Sam's Club MasterCard Card {{that can be used}} at Sam's Club and anywhere Mastercards are accepted. Sam's Club MasterCard offers a cash back program of 5% (Up to $6,000 a year then 1% thereafter) on gasoline, 3% on dining and travel and 1% on all other purchases. Sam's Club is also the first merchant in the United States to offer EMV (Europay/MasterCard/Visa) <b>chip-enabled</b> cards.|$|R
50|$|Each Estonian citizen {{possesses}} {{an electronic}} <b>chip-enabled</b> ID card, which allows him/her to vote over the internet. The ID card is inserted into a card reader, which {{is connected to}} a computer. Once his/her identity is verified (using the electronic ID card {{as a sort of}} digital signature), he/she can then cast his/her vote via the internet. Votes are not considered final until the end of election day, so Estonian citizens can go back and re-cast their votes until election day is officially over. Popularity of online voting in Estonia has increased widely throughout the nation, as in the elections of 2014 and 2015, nearly one third of Estonian votes were cast online.|$|R
50|$|All {{debit cards}} {{now have a}} {{magnetic}} stripe on which is encoded the card's service codes, consisting of three-digit values. These codes are used to convey instructions to merchant terminals on how a card should be processed. The first digit indicates if a card can be used internationally or is valid for domestic use only. It {{is also used to}} signal if the card is <b>chip-enabled.</b> The second digit indicates if the transaction must be sent online for authorization always or if transactions that are below floor limit can take place without authorization. The third digit is used to indicate the preferred card verification method (e.g. PIN) and the environment where the card can be used (e.g. at point of sale only). Merchant terminals are required to recognize and act on service codes or send all transactions for online authorization.|$|R
50|$|Tablet POS systems {{popular for}} retail {{solutions}} {{are now available}} for the restaurant industry. Initially these systems were not sophisticated {{and many of the}} early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen. Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection. Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible. Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include payments, loyalty, online ordering, table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers. Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, EMV <b>chip-enabled</b> cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards. Mobile POS (AKA mPOS) is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{advanced}} {{capabilities of the}} <b>chip-enabled,</b> debit and credit cards, fraud in payment transactions has not diminished- it has shifted. The reason lies in {{the lack of a}} trusted communication path between the smartcard and the cardholder. More explicitly, because users have no means of verifying the authenticity of the Point-of-Sales (POS) terminal, they do not know how much they are about to pay nor to whom. We propose to use the camera-enabled mobile phone and a previously shared secret to create a two-way, secure communication channel. Messages from the card are displayed by the POS terminal as visual codes, then captured and decoded by the phone. Messages from the cardholder are computed by the phone and manually typed in as one-time PINs. We extend the EMV payment protocol to provide explicit verification and confirmation of the transaction amount. In the process we also improve cardholder authentication, protect against stolen PIN and cards, and eliminate the POS terminal from the trust chain altogether. The implementation requires minimal software updates and no hardware modifications. ...|$|R
