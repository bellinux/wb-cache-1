50|$|Natural fabrics, such as <b>cotton,</b> <b>linen</b> {{and wool}} have higher burn temperatures, and they char instead of melting {{when exposed to}} flame. When a fabric melts onto skin it is {{difficult}} to remove, unlike a material that chars. Nomex is used for fire-resistant clothing. Wool is a good all-around fabric. <b>Cotton</b> and <b>linen</b> are best for hot weather and worst for cold, wet weather. Synthetics can be about the same as wool in the winter; many of them are fire hazards. Fabrics can be treated to help reduce their disadvantages.|$|R

50|$|Basic outdoor {{clothing}} {{materials are}} goose down, wool, polyester, and polyolefin, which provide similar degrees of insulation when dry. Wool and polyesters perform reasonably well for most weather conditions and provide some insulation while wet.

50|$|Dermestid beetles are {{destructive}} {{to a number}} of common items. Natural fibers such as wool, silk, <b>cotton,</b> <b>linen,</b> fur, or feathers are more prone to attack than synthetic fibers. Dermestids are also known to attack chocolate, copra, and cocoa beans. Most damage is done by the larval stage of the beetle, while adults feed on flowers and shrubs.|$|R
30|$|Davidson and Mainfort’s (2008) {{findings}} illustrate {{what remains}} of the nineteenth century clothing and accessories after 100 -plus years of burial. It can be extrapolated that small metal components can be expected to remain long after the common types of fibers available (e.g., <b>cotton,</b> <b>linen,</b> wool, silk) in the nineteenth century have decayed. This finding leads to preliminary recommendations for green burial practices via the use of clothing and textiles made from natural fibers (e.g., <b>cotton,</b> <b>linen,</b> wool, silk) with a minimum of non-textile fastenings and other components. As Bellacouche suggests, a natural burial that uses wool felt made from the wool of local sheep reduces the carbon footprint of shrouds and eco-coffins (Bellacouche, n.d.). Therefore, locally sourced materials should be used whenever possible. Further, soil composition and local microflora in natural burial grounds should be examined so that textiles can be chosen to be compatible with desired rates of decay.|$|R
