50|$|In November 2009, defense <b>counsel</b> <b>psychology</b> experts {{tried to}} {{establish}} that Gowadia suffers from narcissistic personality disorder but U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin S.C. Chang said in a ruling issued late Friday, November 20, that {{the testimony of the}} two defense witnesses — Richard Rogers, a forensic psychology professor at the University of North Texas, and Pablo Stewart, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Francisco — was not credible. The defendant's unwillingness to thoroughly consult with his lawyers does not equate with an inability to do so, Chang said. That challenging relationship between the defendant and his lawyers cannot and does not provide the basis to find the defendant incompetent, Chang added. Chief U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway chose to accept Chang's recommendation.|$|R

The objective of this research was to explore sexual-minority clients' subjective experience of finding a therapist and beginning therapy with them, capturing the complexity of this real life experience {{from the point of view}} of the sexual-minority client. Seven pal 1 ieipants who identified themselves as belonging to a sexual-minority were interviewed about their experience of finding a therapist and starting therapy. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, this study aimed to explore the subjective meaning that participants used to understand their experience. Five superordinate themes were identified within the data and these themes are discussed with reference to the existing literature. In particular, it is suggested that the participants' experience indicates the importance of working with an affirmative therapist, within an affirmative relationship. Implications and recommendations for therapy are considered and links with how <b>counselling</b> <b>psychology's</b> therapeutic and theoretical aims and practice can fit with the main findings are drawn.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} meaning of Punjabi Sikhs’ lived {{experiences}} of caring for a relative with dementia. The Department of Health (DoH) recognises that people caring for a person with dementia (PWD) are the most vulnerable of all carers to experiencing psychological problems. Six Punjabi Sikh respondents were recruited and semi-structured interviews conducted. Their accounts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Three themes emerged from this analysis 1) Surface and Depth of Dementia: Confused and Transparent Awareness 2) I’m Stuck and Winded up in Dis-ease and 3) Still I Kept Going: Perseverance as Transcending Limits. These findings indicate that emotional, relational, social, spiritual and physical perceptions of dementia aetiology do not necessarily exclude understanding of dementia as an illness or prevent professional help-seeking or diagnosis. Participant accounts also indicated that personal meaning of caring for a PWD as dis-ease (or as involving limited support) can be transcended through engaging with Sikh specific spiritual concepts such as Seva and Simran. Caring in this context {{has been found to}} extend beyond the interpersonal to hold transpersonal meaning. Punjabi Sikh experiential understandings of such phenomena are demonstrated as being synergistic with <b>Counselling</b> <b>Psychology’s</b> therapeutic relationship model. This connection provides scope for professionals to employ a broad conceptualisation of culturally sensitive phenomenological and transpersonal psychological support in this context. The thesis provides tentative guidelines for practice whilst indicating methodological limits to inform provisional suggestions for future research in this area...|$|R
