40|$|Cyanobacteria have {{recently}} gained {{a great deal}} of attention as hosts for metabolic engineering, due to their innate ability to convert CO 2 and sunlight into a variety of chemical products. Cyanobacteria are of special interest as hosts for production of biofuels, which are important for combating global climate change. Compared to eukaryotic algae and plants, many cyanobacteria are easier to genetically engineer, and can grow faster. Furthermore, they are capable of growing under a wide variety of temperatures, light condition and salinities, and cultivation of the bacteria does not compete with the food industry for arable land. Cyanobacterial model strains have already been engineered to produce a wide variety of products. However, the production rate is slow, and the price of commodity goods generated by cyanobacteria is too high to make the production economically competitive. More research and synthetic biology tools are needed to overcome these limitations (Liu et al., 2011, Berla et al., 2013, Taton et al., 2014). This thesis represents a small contribution to the goal of giving Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 and other cyanobacteria a toolbox of genetic parts, that can be utilized to establish cyanobacteria as successful biotechnological platforms for the production of renewable chemicals and biofuels. The aim of the study was to construct a genetic system that facilitates the genetic modification of wild-type Synechococcus by <b>counterselection.</b> The sacB gene from Bacillus subtilis was chosen as the counterselectable marker utilized for this purpose. The gene confers conditional lethality to Gram-negative bacteria harboring the gene, where growth in the presence of 5 % sucrose leads to death of the host cells (Gay et al., 1985, Pelicic et al., 1996, Viola et al., 2014). Various <b>counterselection</b> plasmids were constructed and cloned into Escherichia coli DH 5 α, each containing a <b>counterselection</b> cassette comprised of sacB and one or two antibiotic resistance genes, i. e. kanamycin resistance (kanr) and chloramphenicol resistance (Tn 9 cat). The cassettes were surrounded by synthesized sequences identical to the A 0160, A 0935 or A 2843 neutral integration sites within the genome of wild-type Synechococcus. The flanking sequences were utilized to facilitate homologous recombination, and thereby incorporation of the cassettes within the neutral sites of the Synechococcus genome. One of the constructed plasmids, pA 0160 -KanR-sacB, was investigated by sequencing. The results verified the presence of sacB and the kanr gene, and confirmed that the genes were incorporated in the expected place and in the right orientation within the constructed plasmids. Several successful transformations were performed utilizing this system. However, verification of cassette functionality proved to be problematic, as sacB-mediated <b>counterselection</b> was observed to be NaCl-sensitive. In E. coli host cells this problem could be circumvented by excluding NaCl from the growth plates. However, for Synechococcus host cells, the problem was more difficult to circumvent. NaCl was removed from the growth media, but sodium and chloride were still present as part of other media constituents. At this point, sacB-mediated <b>counterselection</b> could not be achieved within Synechococcus host cells. While the system shows great promise, appropriate selection conditions have to be established before it can be fully implemented in Synechococcus...|$|E

We find that during {{disruption of the}} HIS 1 locus all genes telomeric to HIS 1 were deleted and telomeric repeats were added to a 9 nt sequence within the transforming DNA.

Here we describe a versatile select agent compliant allele replacement system for B. pseudomallei based on a mobilizable vector, pEXKm 5, which contains (i) a multiple cloning site within a lacZ gene for facile cloning of recombinant DNA fragments, (ii) a constitutively expressed gusA indicator gene for visual detection of merodiploid formation and resolution, and (iii) elements required for resolution of merodiploids using either I-SceI homing endonuclease-stimulated recombination or sacB-based <b>counterselection.</b> The homing endonuclease-based allele replacement system is completed by pBADSce, which contains an araC-PBAD-I-sceI expression cassette for arabinose-inducible I-SceI expression and a temperature-sensitive pRO 1600 replicon for facile plasmid curing.

Overexpression of the C-terminal FADD deletion mutant FADD-DN blocks death receptor-induced apoptosis, but despite this antiapoptotic activity, lck FADD-DN transgenic mice do not develop lymphomas. To analyze whether functional inactivation of FADD cooperates with Myc overexpression in tumorigenesis, lck FADD-DN transgenic mice were crossed with Emicro L-myc transoncogenic animals. While no tumors were detected in single transgenic FADD-DN or L-myc mice within 15 months, 5 of 17 (29 %) FADD-DN/L-myc double transgenic animals developed lymphomas with an average latency period of 47 weeks. Protein analysis of FADD-DN/L-myc tumors showed, however, undetectable levels of FADD-DN protein. FADD-DN protein expression was again lost in 16 of 17 FADD-DN/p 53 k. o. T-cell lymphomas, though no significant acceleration of tumorigenesis in P 53 -deficient lck FADD-DN mice compared to p 53 k. o. animals was observed.

Cell {{movement is}} thought to involve motor complexes comprised of Gld proteins that propel the cell surface adhesin SprB. The four distal genes of the sprB operon (sprC, sprD, sprB, and sprF) are required for normal motility and for formation of spreading colonies, but {{the roles of the}} remaining three genes (remF, remG, and fjoh_ 0982) are unclear. A gene deletion strategy was developed to determine whether these genes are involved in gliding. A spontaneous streptomycin-resistant rpsL mutant of F. johnsoniae was isolated. Introduction of wild-type rpsL on a plasmid restored streptomycin sensitivity, demonstrating that wild-type rpsL is dominant to the mutant allele. The gene deletion strategy employed a suicide vector carrying wild-type rpsL and used streptomycin for <b>counterselection.</b> This approach was used to delete the region spanning remF, remG, and fjoh_ 0982. The mutant cells formed spreading colonies, demonstrating that these genes are not required for normal motility. Analysis of the genome revealed a paralog of remF (remH) and a paralog of remG (remI). Deletion of remH and remI had no effect on motility of wild-type cells, but cells lacking remF and remH, or cells lacking remG and remI, formed nonspreading colonies.

As {{part of our}} own efforts to further improve upon the S. mutans genetic toolbox, we previously reported {{the development of the}} first cloning-independent markerless mutagenesis (CIMM) system for S. mutans and illustrated how this approach could be adapted for use in many other organisms. The CIMM approach only requires overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) protocols to assemble counterselectable allelic replacement mutagenesis constructs, and thus greatly increased the speed and efficiency with which markerless mutations could be introduced into S. mutans. Despite its utility, the system is still subject to a couple limitations. Firstly, CIMM requires negative selection with the conditionally toxic phenylalanine analog p-chlorophenylalanine (4 -CP), which is efficient, but never perfect. Typically, 4 -CP negative selection results in a small percentage of naturally resistant background colonies. Secondly, CIMM requires two transformation steps to create markerless mutants. This can be inherently problematic if the transformability of the strain is negatively impacted after the first transformation step, which is used to insert the <b>counterselection</b> cassette at the mutation site on the chromosome. In the current study, we develop a next-generation <b>counterselection</b> cassette that eliminates 4 -CP background resistance and combine this with a new direct repeat-mediated cloning-independent markerless mutagenesis (DR-CIMM) system to specifically address the limitations of the prior approach. DR-CIMM is even faster and more efficient than CIMM for the creation of all types of deletions, insertions, and point mutations and is similarly adaptable for use {{in a wide range of}} genetically tractable bacteria...|$|E

In addition to its role in the selectivity of interactions, this generic recipe can underlie other important biological phenomena such as the regular synthesis at low level of supramolecular complexes, monostable kinetic bimodality, substrate concentration thresholds or the preparation of rapidly depolymerizable structures with stored energy, like microtubule...|$|E
