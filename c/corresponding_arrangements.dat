40|$|AbstractGene {{expression}} in eukaryotic cells is regulated by a complex network of interactions, in which transcription factors and their binding {{sites on the}} genomic DNA play a determining role. As transcription factors rarely, if ever, act in isolation, binding sites of interacting factors are typically arranged in close proximity forming so-called cis-regulatory modules. Even when the individual binding sites are known, module discovery remains a hard combinatorial problem, which we formalize here as the Best Barbecue Problem. It asks for simultaneously stabbing a maximum number of differently colored intervals from K arrangements of colored intervals. This geometric problem {{turns out to be}} an elementary, yet previously unstudied combinatorial optimization problem of detecting common edges in a family of hypergraphs, a decision version of which we show here to be NP-complete. Due to its relevance in biological applications, we propose algorithmic variations that are suitable for the analysis of real data sets comprising either many sequences or many binding sites. Being based on set systems induced by interval arrangements, our problem setting generalizes to discovering patterns of co-localized itemsets in non-sequential objects that consist of <b>corresponding</b> <b>arrangements</b> or induce set systems of co-localized items. In fact, our optimization problem is a generalization of the popular concept of frequent itemset mining...|$|E

The role of stated aims, especially the behavioral ones, has been exaggerated and selection of teaching methods have not been considered by either policy-makers or investigators. The fact that stated aims have no significant impact on the teacher's planning activity has, when operating with lists of stated aims, been given almost no consideration. The differences in the teachers ' general basic views and pedagogical outlooks have been-iven minor consideration.

The structure and thermotropic phase behaviour of the fractions have been examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction methods. The raft fractions are found to consist of vesicles and multilamellar structures indicating considerable rearrangement of the original ghost membrane. Few membrane-associated particles typical of freeze-fracture replicas of intact erythrocyte membranes are observed in the fracture planes. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies during heating and cooling scans showed that multilamellar structures formed by stacks of raft membranes from all three species have d-spacings of about 6. 5 nm. These structures can be distinguished from peaks corresponding to d-spacings of about 5. 5 nm, which were assigned to scattering from single bilayer vesicles {{on the basis of}} the temperature dependence of their d-spacings compared with the multilamellar arrangements.

40|$|Abstract: Marker-based optical {{tracking}} systems {{are often used}} to track objects that are equipped with {{a certain number of}} passive or active point markers. Fixed configurations of these markers, so-called rigid bodies, can be detected by, for example, infrared stereo-based camera systems, and their position and orientation can be reconstructed by corresponding tracking algorithms. The main issue in designing the geometrical constellation of these markers and their 3 D positions is to allow robust identification and tracking of multiple objects, and this design process is considered to be an essential and challenging task. At present, the design process is based on trial-and-error: the designer constructs a marker configuration, evaluates it in a given setup, and rearranges the marker positions within the configuration if necessary. Even though single ready-made rigid bodies permit sufficiently good tracking, it is not ensured that the <b>corresponding</b> <b>arrangements</b> of markers meet any quality criteria in terms of reliability and robustness. Furthermore, it is unclear whether it is possible to add further rigid bodies to the setup which are sufficiently distinguishable from the given ones. In this paper, we present an approach to semi-automatically generate marker-based rigid bodies which are optimal with respect to the properties of the tracking system for which they are used, e. g., granularity, accuracy, or jitter. Our procedure which is aimed at supporting the design process as well as improving tracking generates configurations for several devices associated with an arbitrary set of point-based markers. We discuss both the technical background of our approach and the results of an evaluation comparing the tracking quality of commercially available devices to the rigid bodies generated by our approach. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{group of}} the complement of a hyperplane arrangement {{plays an important role}} in studying the <b>corresponding</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In particular, for large families of hyperplane arrangements, this fundamental group, being isomorphic to the fundamental group of a complement of a line arrangement, has some remarkable properties: either it is a direct sum of free groups and a free abelian group, or it has a conjugation-free geometric presentation. In this paper, we first give a complete proof to the following key lemma: if we draw a new line through only one intersection point of a given real line arrangement whose fundamental group is conjugation-free, then the fundamental {{group of the}} new arrangement is also conjugation-free. Second, we generalize this lemma to the case of conic-line arrangements. Moreover, we prove that once the graph associated to conic-line arrangements (defined slightly different than the corresponding graph for line arrangements) has no cycles, then the fundamental group of its complement has a conjugation-free geometric presentation and in addition can be written as a direct sum of free groups and a free abelian group. Also, we show that if the graph consists of one cycle, and the conic does not pass through all the multiple points corresponding to the vertices of the cycle, then the fundamental group has a conjugation-free geometric presentation as well. For conclusion, we extend the family of real line arrangements having a conjugation-free geometric presentation (for their fundamental group) by defining the notion of a conjugation-free graph. We also extend this notion to certain families of conic-line arrangements. Comment: 42 pages, 26 figures; Totally revised version.
