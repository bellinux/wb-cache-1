40|$|Juvenile hormone {{esterase}} (JHE) is a carboxylesterase {{that has}} attracted great interest {{because of its}} critical role in regulating larval to adult transition in insects and other arthropods. Previously, we characterized an ecdysteroid sensitive and juvenile hormone non-susceptible juvenile hormone esterase related gene (SnJHER) in the <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Sesamia nonagrioides. SnJHER was rhythmically up-regulated close to each molt during the corn stalk borer’s larval development. In this paper we attempted to functionally characterize SnJHER using several reverse genetics techniques. To functionally characterize SnJHER, we experimented with different dsRNA administration methods, including hemolymph, bacterial or baculovirus-mediated RNA interference, (RNAi).

The latter is potentially problematic because this group includes several important pest species that are usually baregly distinguishable from non-pest species. In this study {{we focus on the}} Mediterranean <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre), an important pest of maize with a wide area of distribution that covers most of Africa and extends to the south of Europe and western Asia. According to a recent study, this pest consists of three allopatric populations that were formerly considered as distinct species or subspecies. Here we rely on recent collections of 5470 specimens (sampled in 17 countries and 175 localities) that putatively belong to S. nonagrioides. Integrative taxonomy studies allowed us to unravel the existence of six new species that are closely related to S. nonagrioides and described in this paper. In contrast to S. nonagrioides these new species have more specific ecological preferences, as they are associated with a limited number of plant species and habitats. Dating and population genetic analyses carried out on 100 S. nonagrioides specimens also indicate a more complex population structure than previously thought for S. nonagrioides, which can probably be accounted for by late Cenozoic environmental changes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCorn {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely grown crops {{throughout}} the world. However, many corn fields develop pest problems such as corn borers every year that seriously affect its yield and quality. Corn′s response to initial insect damage involves a variety of changes to the levels of defensive enzymes, toxins, and communicative volatiles. Such a dramatic change secondary metabolism necessitates the regulation of gene expression at the transcript level. In this paper, we summarized the datasets of the transcriptome of corn plants in response to <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> (Ostrinia furnacalis) and/or methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Altogether, 39, 636 genes were found to be differentially expressed. The sequencing data are available in the NCBI SRA database under accession number SRS 965087.

40|$|The {{sugarcane}} borer or <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Diatraea Guilding is polyphagous {{insect pest}} of many important {{crops such as}} corn, sorghum and sugarcane. Losses arising from the attack of Diatraea species have been a serious problem, which may cause loss in sugarcane production around 0. 25 % in sugar, 0. 20 % in alcohol and 0. 77 % of body weight for every 1 % infestation and up to 21 % in corn production fields. In Brazil, the most commonly reported species are Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius, 1794) and Diatraea impersonatella (Walker, 1863) (= D. flavipennella). However, multiple other species of Diatraea {{have been identified in}} Brazil according to the literature. Currently, little information exists on the presence of the other species causing injury to sugarcane and corn. The objectives of this study were to improve the accuracy of species assignment, evaluate the population genetic structure, and address many of the outstanding questions of systematics and evolution of Brazilian populations of D. saccharalis. To address these main questions, classical taxonomic methods were used, focused on morphological characterization of the reproductive organs, especially the male genitalia. In addition, genetic studies were performed using simple sequence repeats (SSR) and a fragment of cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene.

Under a long-day photoperiod, larvae completed their development and pupated after 6 molts, whereas under a diapause-inducing short-day photoperiod, several additional molts and considerable delay of pupation were recorded. Duration of 1 st to 5 th instars {{was about the same}} in diapause and nondiapause destined insects, but the duration of the 6 th instar was significantly longer in diapause larvae. Similarly, head capsule widths of the larvae were about the same under both photoperiods until the 5 th instar. The head capsule width of all instars, under both photoperiods, is described by the logistic model. Dyar's rule, implying a geometric model, was not found appropriate for our data. Larval weights were greater under long-day photoperiod up to 5 th instar, but the reverse was true for 6 th instar. Only 36 % of the initial number of larvae reached pupation under short-day photoperiod, whereas 74 % reached pupation under long-day photoperiod. Larval mortality gradually increased, for ≈ about 150 d under short-day photoperiod, whereas under long-day photoperiod, larval mortality occurred mainly during the first few days.

40|$|The stalk corn borer, Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), {{is one of}} {{the main}} pests of corn and sorghum in Portugal and other nearby Mediterranean countries. Several aspects of the {{developmental}} biology and the ecology of several populations of S. nonagroides from the region of Moral (Southern Portugal) were studied, to be used in future integrated pest management programs. This region is located in one of the most important and productive agricultural regions in Portugal, the Sorraia river valley. Temperature and larval feeding, under laboratory conditions, proved to influence the rate of development. Between 16 and 31 deg C, the rate of development is temperature dependant. A larval feeding diet based on corn stalks allows a rate of larval development significantly greater than that of a diet based on sorghum stalks or an artificial diet. Low temperature thresholds are between 15. 2 dec C (2 nd stage larva) and 8 deg C (pupa) in non-diapause larval stages. The means of cumulative temperatures of the larvae development and the total life cycle were 369. 1 degrees-day (D D) and 661. 9 D D, respectively. When rearing on corn and sorghum, the larval development is 30 D D less and 38 D D more than that of the artificial diet, respectively. The rate of post-dia pause larvae development is only temperature-dependant. The lower temperature threshold is 8. 4 deg C. Differences in reproductive parameters (fecundity, fertility, ovo position and longevity periods) among adults generated from non-dia pause or dia pause cycles were not significantly different. Fecundity and fertility are influenced by temperature and larval feeding, in both cycles. The most favorable temperature interval is from 22 deg C to 28 deg C. Female fecundity is greater under these temperatures, when generated from larvae reared on corn instead of sorghum or an artificial diet. The growth rate of laboratory-reared larvae is also influenced by temperature, feeding diet and life cycle.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in an outdoor insectary to examine behavioral interactions between fifth instar <b>stalk</b> <b>borers,</b> Papaiperna nebris, and potential host plant species. Plants tested included 6 - and 8 -leaf stage corn, Zea mays, and ten weed species (six broadleaf and four grass) commonly associated with corn production in southern Wisconsin. Broadleaf plants found to be acceptable hosts included Ambrosia trifida, Arnaranthus retroflexus, Rumex crispus, and Chenopodium album; Asclepias syriaca and Abutilon theophrasti were not acceptable as host plants.

40|$|Several {{studies showed}} that egg parasitoids are able to detect host sex pheromones {{produced}} by adult hosts as a host cue. In this way female wasps are directed toward an area where host mating is in progress and where an oviposition has probably taken place or is soon to occur. Telenomus busseolae Gahan (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is a solitary egg parasitoid of various noctuids (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) belonging to the genera Sesamia. In field observations, it has been demonstrated that T. busseolae reacts to the pheromone emitted by females of the <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) and the pink stem borer, Sesamia calamistis (Hampson). It is known that the sex pheromone produced by calling lepidopteran females are usually a mixture of compounds. In laboratory experiments, it was shown that three components of the synthetic sex pheromone of the Mediterranean stem borer, e. g. (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ac (the main component), (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ald and 12 :Ac, attract wasp females, while a fourth compound, (Z) - 11 – 16 :OH, did not. Interestingly, these active compounds are also present in the sex pheromone blends of other host Sesamia species, and in the sex pheromone blends of other non-host noctuid species. To evaluate {{the role played by}} some components of noctuid sex pheromone in the host specificity of T. busseolae, we carried a series of laboratory experiments with a Y-tube olfactometer coupled a video tracking and motion analysis system. In particular we analyzed the behavioural response of T. busseolae females to the main compounds of the synthetic sex pheromones of the corn earworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). Bioassays were carried out with the whole corn earworm sex pheromone blend [(Z) - 9 – 16 :Ald : (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ald at ratio of 3 : 97], and the following single compounds: (Z) - 9 – 16 :Ald present only in the corn earworm sex pheromone, (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ac the main component of the Mediterranean stem borer sex pheromone, and (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ald common to both noctuids. All the treatments were bioassayed at two different doses (0. 1 mg and 1. 0 mg). The results showed that T. busseolae females were 1) attracted by (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ac at 0. 1 mg and by (Z) - 11 – 16 :Ald at 1. 0 mg; 2) not attracted by the whole sex pheromone of the corn earn borer at both concentrations; and 3) slightly deterred by (Z) - 9 – 16 :Ald at both concentrations.

The average injury rating for a plot declined 0. 332 ± 0. 033 points per leaf stage. In years of adequate rainfall, yields declined linearly as plants were attacked later in development. Injury profiles were developed to describe feeding injury. Plot yield losses seem to be moderated by the ability of uninfested or slightly injured plants to compensate for severe <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> injury.

Thus, damage is often limited to border rows that are adjacent to grassy, weedy areas. 2 ̆ 2 Moving day 2 ̆ 2 for the <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> starts when approximately 1, 300 base- 41 degree days have accumulated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{combustion}} experiments of {{oil shale}} semi-coke and <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> mixtures were conducted using thermogravimetric analyzer. The {{results show that}} the advance ignition and burnout can be achieved when semi-coke is mixed with <b>corn</b> <b>stalk.</b> The influence of different blend ratios has been studied, and the combustion characteristics were obtained. Comprehensive combustion characteristics get improved with the increase of <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> proportion in the mixture. The interaction of mixture in the combustion process occurs mainly in 400 - 600 o C. It can be explained that the combustion of fixed carbon in <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> is delayed. What is more, TG curves were simulated by Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. The result shows the feasibility of using Weibull distribution to simulate the TG curves of co-combustion...|$|R

High energy supplemental nutrition around breeding tends to improve first service conception. <b>Corn</b> <b>stalk</b> development does not appear to negatively impact reproduction, although it resulted in lighter calf birth weight compared to winter range...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the management of <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> waste as reinforcement for polypropylene (PP) injection moulded composites as an alternative to wood flour and fibers. In the first step, <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> waste was subjected to various treatments, and four different <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> derivatives (flour and fibers) able to be used as reinforcement of composite materials were prepared and characterized. These derivatives are <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> flour, thermo-mechanical, semi-chemical, and chemical fibers. They were characterized in terms of their yield, lignin content, Kappa number, fiber length/diameter ratio, fines, coarseness, viscosity, and the length at the break of a standard sheet of paper. Results showed that the <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> derivatives have different physico-chemical properties. In the second step, the prepared flour and fibers were explored as a reinforcing element for PP composites. Coupled and non-coupled PP composites were prepared and tested for tensile properties. For overall trend, {{with the addition of a}} coupling agent, tensile properties of composites significantly improved, as compared with non-coupled samples. In addition, a morphological study revealed the positive effect of the coupling agent on the interfacial bonding. The composites prepared with semichemical fiber gave better results in comparison with the rest of the <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> derivatives due to its chemical characteristic...|$|R
