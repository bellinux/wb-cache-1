2500|$|The {{preferred}} {{amount of}} canopy cover at the roost is unclear. Many {{studies have reported}} the need for low cover, while others have documented use of trees with moderate to high canopy cover, occasionally up to complete <b>canopy</b> <b>closure.</b> Canopy cover ranges from 0% at the forest edge to 100% {{in the interior of}} the stand. A general trend is that primary roosts are found in low cover, while alternate roosts tend to be more shaded. Few data directly compare the differences between roost types. In Alabama, canopy cover at the roost tended to be low at an average of 35.5%, but at the stand level, canopy cover was higher with a mean of 65.8%. In a habitat suitability model, Romme and others [...] recommended the ideal canopy cover for roosting Indiana bats as 60% to 80%. Actual roost sites in eastern Tennessee were very high in the tree, and Indiana bats were able to exit the roost above the surrounding canopy. Thus, canopy cover measurements taken from the bases of roost trees may overestimate the actual amount of cover required by roosting Indiana bats.|$|E

We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i. e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents).

50|$|The {{harvest of}} timber {{from the great}} grey owl's habitat is, perhaps, the {{greatest}} threat to this species. Intensified timber management typically reduces live and dead large-diameter trees used for nesting, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly, and dense <b>canopy</b> <b>closures</b> in stands used by juveniles for cover and protection. If perches are not left in clearcuts, great grey owls cannot readily hunt in them. Although human-made structures (made specifically for use by this species) have been utilized by these owls, the species is far more common in areas protected from logging. Livestock grazing in meadows also adversely affects great grey owls, by reducing habitat for preferred prey species. Other dangers to great grey owls include rodenticides, collisions with vehicles, and West Nile Virus. West Nile Virus is likely to become more prevalent with climate change. In Ontario and northeastern Oregon there are confirmed great grey owl deaths from West Nile Virus. Testing of owls in the Yosemite area since 2005 has found evidence of West Nile Virus in that population.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} and evaluate a new analysis technique, spatial wavelet analysis (SWA), to automatically estimate the location, height, and crown diameter of individual trees within mixed conifer open canopy stands from {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) data. Two-dimensional Mexican hat wavelets, over {{a range of}} likely tree crown diameters, were convolved with lidar canopy height models. Identification of local maxima within the resultant wavelet transformation image then allowed determination of the location, height, and crown diameters of individual trees. In this analysis, which focused solely on individual trees within open canopy forests, 30 trees incorporating seven dominant North American tree species were assessed. Two-dimensional (2 D) wavelet-derived estimates were well correlated with field measures of tree height (r = 0. 97) and crown diameter (r = 0. 86). The 2 D wavelet-derived estimates compared favorably with estimates derived using an established method that uses variable window filters (VWF) to estimate the same variables but relies on a priori knowledge of the tree height – crown diameter relationship. The 2 D spatial wavelet analysis presented herein could potentially allow automated, large-scale, remote estimation of timber board feet, foliar biomass, canopy volume, and aboveground carbon, although further research testing the limitations of the method in a variety of forest types with increasing <b>canopy</b> <b>closures</b> is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} complex growth compensation patterns, {{white pine}} (Pinus strobus L.) seedlings were clipped to simulate different herbivory levels. Seedlings were growing with different understory competition lev-els (created through monthly weeding vs no brush con-trol) under {{a range of}} overstory <b>canopy</b> <b>closures.</b> Com-pensation patterns varied for the different growth and size measures. After one growing season, seedlings did not fully compensate for lost biomass regardless of the competitive environments of the seedlings. Although rel-ative height growth was stimulated by light intensity clipping (20 – 40 % of last-year shoots removed), relative diameter growth, total biomass, and biomass growth of seedlings declined sharply with increasing clipping in-tensity. Likewise, all growth parameters declined with increasing interspecific competition. Results showed that seedlings in highly competitive environments showed smaller growth loss due to clipping than those in compe-tition-free environments, presumably because seedlings experiencing high interspecific competition devoted more energy to maintaining apical dominance and a balanced shoot-root ratio. While competition from canopy trees al-tered compensatory patterns, competition from understo-ry vegetation only altered the magnitude, but not the pat-terns, of compensatory growth. We suggest that compen-satory growth follows a complex pattern that will vary with the parameters measured, competitive conditions, and clipping intensities. Our results support the assertion that overcompensation may be an adaptation to competi-tive ability, rather than a response to herbivory itself...|$|R

A dynamic - closed chamber technique was used to: evaluate the relative contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration and photosynthesis and assess the relative roles of substrate, plant communities, hydrology, and microclimates on CO 2 exchange. Large differences were observed among the forest floors of landscape units with different canopy covers with respect to midday total respiration (Rtot= vegetation respiration (Rveg) + soil respiration (Rsoil)) and gross ecosystem production (GEP), and the seasonal pattern of GEP and Rtot. Highest rates of Rtot followed the general progression of riparian 3 ̆e upland 3 ̆e open peatland 3 ̆e covered peatland, with high Rsoil contributions. Strong correlations were observed between C:N, soil temperature, moisture and Rtot. Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) controlled GEP, which was highest in the open and covered peatland. GEP and Rtot were highest {{in the middle of}} the growing season when soil and air temperatures were warmest, in addition Rveg contributed more to Rtot during this time, however Rsoil dominated the flux. Small differences were observed between lawn and depression sites in terms of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE). The general trend was for warmer, drier lawn sites to have higher GEP and Rtot than the topographically lower, cooler and wetter depressions. The moisture and temperature differences between microtopography drove differences in the productivity of species but did not drive differences in vegetation distribution. This study demonstrated that degrees of spatial and seasonal temporal variability as well as controlling environmental factors on CO 2 exchange cannot necessarily be extrapolated to a sub - humid region, such as Canada’s Western Boreal Plain. In addition, forest floors of different land cover units, and microtopography should be taken into account when discussing understory contributions to CO 2 exchange...|$|R

Once a common and economically important furbearer, the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) is now listed as endangered, threatened, or a species of conservation concern throughout much of its historical range. Virtually nothing is known about the fundamental ecology of the species or the potential effects of forest management strategies on habitat use. To elucidate home range dynamics and habitat selection, we conducted telemetry-based field work in the Ouachita National Forest of western Arkansas. During two years of field work we collected locations at 28 -hour intervals for 33 eastern spotted skunks. Using kernel-based utilization distributions and the volume of intersection index analysis, we found significant seasonal and intersexual differences in the home range dynamics. Adult males maintained spring ranges of 866 ([plus or minus] 235 SE) ha, which were much larger than the 76 to 175 ([plus or minus] 22 - 62 SE) ha ranges during the nonbreeding season and the 54 to 135 ([plus or minus] 7 - 30 SE) ha ranges of females. We observed little home range overlap between adults, especially between adult females. Using weighted compositional analysis we determined that during each season young shortleaf pine and hardwood stands were selected over other available habitat types. A comparison of used and available resting and denning sites using discrete choice analysis revealed similar patterns; selection for sites with young pine and old hardwood stands, higher <b>canopy</b> <b>closures,</b> rock and vine densities, steeper slopes, and smaller site entrances. These findings suggest that eastern spotted skunks are solitary carnivores that select structurally complex habitat that enhances protection from predators. The species may be vulnerable to forest ecosystem changes that result in a more open canopy and herbaceous understory, a management strategy used extensively in parts of the Ouachita National Forest...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Forest {{spatial pattern}} {{is a primary}} {{interest}} of landscape ecology due to the relationships between spatial configuration of biotic components and ecological processes. The spatial pattern must be measured in meaningful ways so that relationships between forests and their environment can be analyzed. Aerial and satellite imageries provide ecologists a variety of scale choices at which the spatial information of forests can be presented in levels ranging form individual trees to landscapes. The high lava plain of central Oregon is characterized by young lava flows of moderate relief interrupted by scattered cinder cones and lava buttes. The regosolic soils developed on pumice support open coniferous forests of nationwide significance. The relationship between forests and the harsh rocky land has not been analyzed, yet large portions of the forest have been logged at various intensities over the last 40 - 50 years. A {{better understanding of the}} relationship between forests and environment is needed for management of healthy forest ecosystems. It is the intent of this study to use remotely sensed data to measure the spatial variability of forest patterns across the lava landscape in Mount Bachelor volcanic chain, and to analyze relationships between forest structural attributes and environmental variables. First, I used aerial photographs to characterize tree point pattern and measure <b>canopy</b> crown <b>closure</b> and density. A step-wise digital approach based on spatial, spectral, and topographic characteristics of the photographic data was developed to measure forest spatial patterns. The method provides a fast and accurate, yet low cost way to characterize tree point pattern and measure <b>canopy</b> crown <b>closure</b> and density. Second, I used Landsat TM imagery to estimate leaf area index (LAI). A new approach using multiple regression analysis was developed to overcome the saturation problems of commonly used vegetation indices at high LAT ranges and improve the performance of Landsat TM data in estimating LAI.

We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i. e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents). The simulation of each scenario was performed for 10 different <b>canopy</b> <b>closures</b> (CC = 50 - 95 %, in steps of 5 %), 25 leaf area index (LAI = 3. 0 - 15. 0 m 2 m- 2, in steps of 0. 5 m 2 m- 2), and in four spectral bands (centred at 559, 671, 727, and 783 nm, with a FWHM of 10 nm). The influence of woody elements was evaluated separately for both, sunlit and shaded parts of the simulated forest canopy, respectively. The DART results were verified by quantifying the simulated nadir BRF of each scenario with measured Airborne Imaging Spectroradiometer (AISA) Eagle data (pixel size of 0. 4 m). These imaging spectrometer data were acquired over the same Norway spruce stand that was used to parameterise the DART model. The Norway spruce canopy modelled using the DART model consisted of foliage as well as foliage including robust woody constituents (i. e. trunks and branches). All results showed similar nadir BRF for the simulated wavelengths. The incorporation of small woody parts in DART caused the canopy reflectance to decrease about 4 % in the near-infrared (NIR), 2 % in the red edge (RE) and less than 1 % in the green band. The canopy BRF of the red band increased by about 2 %. Subsequently, the sensitivity on accounting for woody elements for two spectral vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the angular vegetation index (AVI), was evaluated. Finally, we conclude on the importance of including woody elements in radiative transfer based approaches and discuss the applicability of the vegetation indices as well as the physically based inversion approaches to retrieve the forest canopy LAI at very high spatial resolution...|$|R

5000|$|The Newfoundland marten {{range is}} now {{condensed}} into approximately 13,000 square kilometers {{in the western}} part of the island, with a large portion of key habitat in the Little Grand Lake area. Due to the unregulated pulpwood harvest during the last century, the forest age-class distribution is skewed to the younger regeneration stage of forest succession, which led to the majority of the island being contiguous blocks of second-growth forest. The behavioral patterns of habitat use by Newfoundland martens are altered by the ecological conditions of low prey biomass and high natural forest fragmentation that occur in Newfoundland. A wide spectrum of habitat types are used throughout the geographic range, however, it has been found the Newfoundland Marten has a strong association with old successional forest. Old-growth forest is defined as unharvested stands that are older than 80 years of age. [...] The stand-scale habitat use includes mature coniferous forest being the dominant cover types used proportionately more than the availability, along with coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands used in proportion to the availability, whereas open areas and fire disturbed area are avoided. However, the fire disturbance is minimized because of the lack of prolonged dry periods on the island. Due to infrequent fires, the episodic defoliation by the spruce budworm and hemlock looper are the primary form of natural stand-replacing disturbance. Newfoundland martens have a preference to mature (61-80 years old) and over mature (>80 years old) coniferous stands since it is critical for foraging habitat. More recent studies have found that martens will use forests with a variety of height and <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> conditions creating a wider variety of habitat types than previously thought; this variety includes areas that are disturbed by insects, mid-successional forests, precommercially thinned forests, along with the areas of mature and overmature forests.|$|E

Winter ticks occur throughout moose range south of 60 º N, but {{little is known}} about how habitat influences tick density in Minnesota. Adult female winter ticks drop off moose in the spring to lay eggs and larvae attach to moose in the fall. The habitat that a tick drops off into could increase or decrease either survival or reproduction. Moose select different cover types for foraging and for bedding. We used locations of moose wearing GPS collars to identify tick sampling locations. Moose GPS locations could be identified as either movement or bedding. Targeted sampling at moose GPS locations allowed us to evaluate flag and walking surveys for winter tick collection. Bed sites and movement paths were identified from the 2013 and 2014 spring tracks to assess the effect of moose behavior and habitat characteristics on tick density. Moose GPS locations had more ticks than random sites (p = 0. 001). Tick densities at moose sites were higher in 2013 (10. 8 ± 2. 9 ticks/m 2) than in 2014 (2. 8 ± 1. 2 ticks/m 2; p= 0. 0003). Ticks were found at 52 % of 2013 sites and at 27 % of 2014 sites. More movement paths than bed sites had ticks in 2013 (p = 0. 01), but tick densities were similar in bed sites (11. 2 ± 6. 3 ticks/m 2) and movement paths (10. 7 ± 7. 5 ticks/m 2). In both years, tick density was higher in areas with litter depths < 3 cm (p < 0. 06) and with <b>canopy</b> <b>closures</b> < 50 % (p < 0. 008). A high percentage of sites in lowland conifer, mixedwood, and regenerating forests had ticks present, but no upland conifer sites had ticks present (p = 0. 0001). Spring locations from GPS collared moose were converted to paths. These paths were areas where ticks would have dropped off of moose. We created paths of moose in the fall by connecting GPS locations. Fall paths were overlaid with spring movement paths to identify areas where moose could acquire ticks. Overlaps of the 2011 - 2012 spring and fall path accounted for 6 and 13 % (3. 1 ± 0. 4 ha and 2. 2 ± 0. 5 ha) of the paths. All moose overlapped with their own path in the fall for about 4 % of their spring paths (1. 1 ha). The greatest areas of overlap occurred in mixedwood and wet cover types (p = 0. 0002). Mixedwood and wet cover types, especially with open canopies and shallow litter depths, have the highest potential to produce high larval tick densities. Mixedwood and wet cover types also have the greatest area of overlap between spring and fall paths and could be the areas with the highest tick transfer. Tick densities estimated from walking surveys and tick densities estimated from flag surveys were similar (p= 0. 9). Walking surveys with chaps allowed us to identify the height of winter ticks on the vegetation. The largest clumps of ticks were found at 38. 2 ± 3. 4 cm, but ticks were found from 0 - 100 cm. When more ticks were collected with walking surveys, ticks were generally found below 66 cm. When more ticks were collected with flag surveys, ticks were found above 66 cm and were likely higher than chap height...|$|R

In particular, long-term land planning strategies at local and regional scales require better understanding of agricultural ecosystem capacity to exchange CO 2 and water. One of the more elaborate models for flux modelling is the Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-Soil Algorithm (ACASA) model (Pyles et al., 2000), which provides micro-scale and regional-scale fluxes. The ACASA model allows for characterization of energy and carbon fluxes. It is a higher-order closure model used to estimate fluxes and profiles of heat, water vapor, carbon and momentum within and above <b>canopy</b> using third-order <b>closure</b> equations.

The model was mainly used over dense canopies (Pyles et al. 2000, 2003) in the past, so the aim of this work was to test the ACASA model over a sparse canopy for estimating mass and energy fluxes, comparing model output with field measurements taken over a vineyard located in Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy...|$|R

The model was applied to a 40 m tall Australian temperate Eucalyptus forest at the Tumbarumba Ozflux site. A comparison between modelled and measured trunk temperatures showed agreement to within 1 degrees C, providing confidence in the model. Hourly values of J(tr) peaked at 61 W m(- 2) for this site. Similar values of J(tr) were obtained using an adaptation of the force-restore method. Additional calculations {{for a range of}} leaf area indices and trunk radii enable a quick estimate of the maximum hourly value of J(tr) for any forest with given leaf area index, quadratic mean trunk radius (at breast height) and biomass. Inclusion of heat storage fluxes in the hourly available energy budget for the forest improved agreement between available energy and measured heat fluxes above the <b>canopy,</b> with energy <b>closure</b> rising from 90 to 101 %. Accounting for J(tr) in the SVAT model also improved agreement between measured and modelled fluxes of sensible and latent heat. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relationship between rapid <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> and grain yield in wheat and to identify the traits that affect rapid <b>canopy</b> <b>closure,</b> a research was conducted using 5 wheat cultivars (Atrak, Tajan, Zagros, Golestan and Viniak). A field experiment with randomized complete blocks was carried out at the Gorgan University of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources, in 2003 - 2004. Rapid <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> had significant effect on grain yield, cultivars with faster <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> produced comparatively more grain yield per unit area. Leaf area index and seedling dry weight {{at the beginning of the}} exponential growth phase; relative leaf area development rate and relative growth rate during the exponential phase and the average of individual leaf area and leaf area ratio were detected as the effective traits in rapid <b>canopy</b> <b>closure.</b> It was concluded that the RCC is an appropriate way especially in the environment where growing season is limited and there is little scope for lengthening the growing season in order to increase dry matter production and yield...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} of <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> with the signal response of individual thematic mapper simulator (TMS) bands for selected forest {{sites in the}} San Juan National Forest, Colorado was investigated. Ground truth consisted of a photointerpreted determination of percent <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> of 0 to 100 percent for 32 sites. The sites selected were situated on plateaus at an elevation of approximately 3 km with slope or = 10 percent. The predominant tree species were ponderosa pine and aspen. The mean TMS response per band per site was calculated from data acquired by aircraft during mid-September, 1981. A correlation analysis of TMS response vs. <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> resulted in the following correlation coefficients for bands 1 through 7, respectively: - 0. 757, - 0. 663, - 0. 666, - 0. 088, - 0. 797, - 0. 763. Two model regressions were applied to the TMS data set to create a map of predicted percent forest <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> for the study area. Results indicated percent predictive accuracies of 71, 74, and 57 for percent <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> classes of 0 - 25, 25 - 75, and 75 - 100, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the feasibility of nation-wide medium footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for derivation of forest parameters. The comparison of <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> as one important parameter for many forest functions derived from ALS data and aerial photo interpretation was conducted. The present study was carried out in the framework of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). Three study areas of different size, topographic and forest characteristics were selected. In a first step, canopy height models (CHM) were obtained by subtracting the interpolated terrain altitudes of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) DTM from the interpolated canopy altitudes (LiDAR DSM). Then a binary forest layer with CHM larger or equal 3 m was calculated according to the Swiss NFI forest definition. The Distinction between deciduous and coniferous forest (degree of composition) was performed using the surface cover classes (broadleaved tree, coniferous tree, larch) of the aerial photo interpretation of the NFI for 7, 696 sample plots. In a second step, <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> derived from the aerial photo interpretation was compared to <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> calculated from binary CHM. The study reveals that the <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> is underestimated in the binary CHM from LiDAR data and highlights significant differences between coniferous and deciduous predominated forest plots and significant differences between compared <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> from winter and summer data. The study shows limitations of <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> derived from national LiDAR data but also stresses its practical relevance for many protective functions of forests in alpine conditions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Structural {{measurements}} of woody vegetation are important {{monitoring and management}} tools. Their direct measurement involves work-intensive destructive approaches. For that reason, indirect methods are usually preferred even though the margin of errors is larger than with direct approaches. Amongst indirect methods, the evaluation of <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> is an essential measurement for quantitative remote sensing of forest becau it directly relates {{to the amount of}} vegetation and what is captured by remote sensing platforms. However, relatively few studies of <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> have been applied to woody cerrado vegetation. One reason might just be that cerrado does not comply with other higher more homogeneous forests structures like planted forests. This article compares the results of a visual tree crown template matching approach with hemispherical photograph processed with the Gap Light Analyzer program. <b>Canopy</b> <b>closure</b> of a total of sixteen plots were compared and analyzed. The result show a significant difference in about half of the plots which were attributed mostly to the fact that woody cerrado, is very heterogeneous and a much denser set of hemispherical photographs should be used than what is usually acceptable for other forest formations. Otherwise, the results tend to suggest that template matching tend to always overestimate the <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> with respect to hemispherical photographs. Suggestion are made to improve field measumrements of <b>canopy</b> <b>closure.</b> Pages: 3059 - 306...|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{multispectral}} sensors combine many of {{the advantages}} inherent in both satellite systems and aerial photography. However, {{they have not been}} used in remote sensing studies of mangrove areas which have traditionally utilised the latter two approaches. High resolution (1 m) multispectral imagery of mangroves in the Turks and Caicos Islands was collected using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Hierarchical agglomerative clustering with group-average sorting identified six mangrove classes which were used to direct a supervised classification (overall accuracy 78. 2 %). Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated from CASI data: linear regression models were used to predict leaf area index and percent <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> from NDVI. LAI and <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> data, estimated from field measurements for a set of sites different to those used to derive the regression models, were used to test the accuracy of LAI and <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> prediction. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of accuracy sites at which the LAI or percent <b>canopy</b> <b>closure</b> value (as estimated from field measurements) lay within the 95 % confidence interval for the predicted value. Accuracy was high: 94 % for LAI and 80 % for <b>canopy</b> <b>closure.</b> The superior spatial and spectral resolution of CASI allows mangrove areas to be assessed to a greator level of detail and accuracy than with satellite sensors. Some logistics for planning CASI campaigns are discussed...|$|E
