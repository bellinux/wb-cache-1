5|$|The {{decision}} prompted {{complaints that}} Metro was inconveniencing its many customers, including tourists and other infrequent users, {{who did not}} own a SmarTrip card. In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line. One exit lane at each station accepts credit <b>card</b> <b>payments</b> through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target. WMATA has since {{announced that it will}} make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay-on-exit parking facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ticket {{vending machines}} {{were designed by}} Thorn EMI. In 2005 GMPTE announced that rail passengers travelling from within Greater Manchester into Manchester city centre can use the Metrolink service between the nine City Zone stops for free. Passengers must present a valid rail ticket, correctly dated with Manchester Ctlz as the destination. In 2007 TfGM rolled out new ticket vending machines, designed to accept credit/debit <b>card</b> <b>payments</b> and permit the purchase of multiple tickets in a single transaction. These were replaced in 2009 with touchscreen machines, designed with the Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress system. In October 2012, TfGM announced it was devising a simpler zonal fare system, comparable to London fare zones, and preparing to introduce get me there, the region's new contactless smartcard system, for use on all public transport modes in Greater Manchester, including Metrolink.|$|E
5|$|Usage of the Octopus {{card was}} {{extended}} to Macau and the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus. Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus <b>card</b> <b>payments</b> are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese pataca and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1. The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.|$|E

He knew that every month Zuma spent more money than his salary, and that he was writing bad cheques and failing to meet debit <b>card</b> <b>payments.</b> Shaik did not expect to be paid back, however, as he was buying influence with Zuma, which was used to win government contracts for his company, Nkobi Holdings.|$|E
25|$|The one ban coin {{was rarely}} seen {{and not in}} demand by either banks or many retailers; the 'situation' has changed and the coin is not uncommonly found (as of 2015). Supermarkets {{continue}} habitually to advertise prices such as 9.99 (lei), and frequently price goods to the precise ban such as 9,47; indeed, as of 2014, {{very few of the}} prices displayed at the Carrefour online site (for example) display prices to the nearest 5 or 10 bani. In practice, manyretailers round totals to the nearest 5 or 10 bani for cash payments, or even whole Leu, although (inter)national supermarket chains generally give exact change. For <b>card</b> <b>payments</b> the exact amount (not rounded) is always charged. The reversion to single ban pricing (and change giving) is perhaps due to the (effective) government drive for shops/businesses to give a receipt, an accurate bon fiscal (to avoid tax evasion) for every transaction. Official notices must be prominently displayed in all shops/restaurants that an accurate receipt must be given.|$|E

2500|$|The Anacostia {{station has}} been used several times for {{experiments}} in improving Metrorail's operations. In July 1997, Anacostia was one of five Metrorail stations used to test a premium monthly parking fee which would guarantee the purchaser a spot at the station's parking garage. The $50-a-month pass {{was the most popular}} at Anacostia, and the pricing scheme was expanded throughout the Metro system in March 1998. Although Metro reserved on 15 percent of all spaces for such parking at most stations, at Anacostia this was raised to 25 percent. In March 1999, Metro tested a new emergency call box system at Anacostia and two other Metrorail stations. When Metro established a carsharing program with Flexcar in 2001, the Anacostia station was one of 12 Metrorail stations at which the system was tested. Metro also tested its [...] "Next Bus" [...] real-time information system (designed to let riders know how long they {{have to wait for the}} bus) at Anacostia and four other Metrorail stations. Technical problems and funding issues delayed implementation of the project on a wider scale. Metro relaunched the system in June 2009, and once more Metrobus [...] "Next Bus" [...] signs were activated at Anacostia and two other pilot Metrorail stations. When Metro announced a pilot program in the spring of 2006 to encourage food and other vendors to sell goods in Metrorail stations, Anacostia was one of 12 stations chosen for the test. The program stalled due to cleanliness, safety, and other concerns, but was reinvigorated in 2009, and Anacostia was one of three Metrorail stations chosen again to experiment with the initiative. When Metro adopted the SmarTrip fare care program the same year, Anacostia was one of three stations chosen to experiment with SmarTrip fare gate express lanes. The express lane program was canceled when too few riders used the express lanes. Anacostia was also one of six parking garages and lots where Metro experimented with accepting credit <b>card</b> <b>payments</b> rather than SmarTrip cards in 2007. Anacostia was also one of eight Metro stations which first sold SmarTrip cards in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Ticket {{machines}} {{operate at}} every Luas stop {{and these are}} the only source of single-journey and return tickets. They also sell 1-day, 7-day and 30-day tickets, valid in either some or all the fare zones, for adults, children and students. It is also possible to purchase 'Combi' tickets valid on Dublin Bus and Luas. DART and Luas 'Combi' tickets have been produced since Luas opened but despite this being a major ticket option these LUAS-DART Combis are not available at either ticket newsagents or online from either Iarnród Éireann or Luas, nor are they available in Luas vending machines. They are available only from Iarnród Éireann ticket offices. Transport user lobby groups like 'Rail Users Ireland' have written to both Luas and Iarnród Éireann asking for an explanation for this and none has been forthcoming. [...] While it is also possible to purchase Luas-DART-Dublin Bus triple combi tickets (from Iarnród Éireann booking offices) from monthly ramblers upward, these are often more expensive than simply topping up a Leap card to its weekly cap rate (currently €40 for Adults). Certain ticket combinations are not possible (for example a one-day student ticket), and tickets can only be valid from the stop at which they are purchased and must commence their validity within 90 minutes, valid until a specific time shown on the card. Certain tickets require the user to hold an ID card and write the number on the ticket, to prevent the ticket from being transferred to another person.
