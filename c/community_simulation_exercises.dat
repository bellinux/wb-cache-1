40|$|AbstractSince the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, the disorganized land occupation of Rio de Janeiro with houses being built on landplaning high risk areas (known as “favelas”, or slums, in English) allied to the geological and geographical special characteristics of the city, transformed Rio in a very susceptible place to disasters related to landslides during heavy rains. With the goal of protecting the people living in those slums, especially the ones living in the risky areas, the Civil Defense of Rio de Janeiro has created the Community Protection Program focusing on three subjects: (i) Training of Local Agents, (ii) Community Alarm and Alert System, and (iii) <b>Simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> at public schools. Local Agents live and work in the community and their training is of a huge importance mainly because these residents know about the vulnerabilities and they are great multipliers, advising other people about the danger. Currently there are almost 6, 000 trained Local Agents acting in the community. The Alert and Alarm System for rainfall consists of sending SMS messages (Alert) and activation of sirens (Alarm). The alert is rung when the meteorologists identify the possibility of rain and the Local Agents and Community Leaders, registered to receive these messages on their cell phones, are ready to support the community. Afterwards, the Alarm (sirens) is triggered when the rain gauge indicates that rainfall has reached critical levels, what can provoke accidents - sirens were installed in 103 <b>communities,</b> receiving also <b>Simulation</b> <b>Exercises.</b> The <b>Simulation</b> <b>Exercises</b> at public schools consists of training for the evacuation of the community in case of heavy rains. The school represents the community, while the Civil Defense tents assembled in the courtyard represent the support points, which are safe places around the community where residents can take shelter temporarily during an emergency. The students from the 5 th grade act as monitors, helping the younger students and playing the role of Public Officials and volunteers. This whole mise-en-scène has been helping a lot of communities to overcome the challenges raised by the rains in Rio de Janeiro...|$|R

40|$|The thesis aims {{to examine}} <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> {{comparatively}} in Korea and the UK, and provide practical suggestions {{for the future of}} Korean <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises,</b> based on lessons from the UK experiences and practices, regarding effective planning and execution of <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises.</b> To achieve this aim, two research questions were formulated. Firstly, ‘How are <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in Korea and the UK organised and conducted, and how can this knowledge be used to respond to crises or disasters more effectively?’. Secondly, ‘Why are new methodological changes to organise and conduct <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> needed in Korea?’. In order to practically assess whether or not <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in Korea are sufficient in dealing with the nature and characteristics of a large-scale disaster, this thesis carries out an in-depth investigation of two real-life underground fires: the King’s Cross Underground Fire in the UK and the Daegu Subway Fire in Korea. <b>Simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> are influenced by the social, political, and cultural contexts of emergency management arrangements, and hence, the study also conducts a comparative study of emergency management frameworks in Korea and the UK. The current practices of <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in Korea can be categorised into the four main themes: ‘Top-level Commitment and Support’, ‘Repeating Training through Rehearsals’, ‘The Politics of Box Seats, Ill-structured Scenario-Scripts and a Lack of Adaptation’, and ‘The Politics of Podium and Speech-based Debriefs’. However, critical analysis of the empirical data in the study reveals that a complex and highly-coupled ‘socio-technical’ crisis does not respect such a conventional training and exercising methodology of Korean <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises,</b> and that a degree of ‘adaptation’ is indispensable to effective crisis response. Thus, it is proposed in the study that Korean <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> need to allow adaptation and diversion to take place, encouraging communication and discussion between exercise players. Furthermore, ensuing afteraction reviews in Korea should be transformed into a discussion-based debriefing style to maximise learning effectiveness. Finally, it is suggested that emergency management arrangements in Korea should also evolve into a more flexible, decentralised, bottom-up model in terms of effective response to ‘socio-technical’ crises or disasters along with changes in <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> and subsequent after-action reviews.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} explain how {{negotiation}} <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> {{can be used to}} develop management insights and theory in the areas of business continuity and international security. Design/methodology/approach – An extended multi-cultural communication model for disaster and emergency management <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> and a nine-stage international security negotiation <b>simulation</b> <b>exercise</b> are outlined. Findings – The critical friendship group approach and the case study research approach can be used to provide insights into business continuity planning. Complex <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises,</b> underpinned by scenario planning, are useful with respect to providing training and educational support vis-à-vis crisis/disaster/emergency planning. A more focused approach to teaching the subject of negotiation, which takes into account the business-international relations dimension and security in particular, will enable business and management students to link more firmly real world events with company-government relations. This will {{contribute to the development of}} management theory and ensure that business continuity managers, employed by private sector and public sector organisations, utilise more fully <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> than is the case at present. Research limitations/implications – Research needs to be undertaken into how academics and practitioners can work together in order to develop management simulation models that are methodologically different from those that exist at present, and which facilitate the theory building process. Practical implications – By working closely with simulation designers, academics will be able to produce interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary crisis/disaster/emergency <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises.</b> Originality/value – A nine-stage negotiation <b>simulation</b> <b>exercise</b> is outlined which will allow management/business studies students to place business continuity planning within an international security context...|$|R

Simulation, augmented by feedback, affords learners {{the opportunity to learn}} critical clinical decision-making skills. More detailed feedback following <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> has the potential to further enhance student learning, particularly in relation to developing improved clinical decision-making skills. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of head-mounted video camera recordings, to augment feedback, following acute patient deterioration simulations. DESIGN: Pilot study using an observational design. METHODS: Ten final-year nursing students participated in three <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises,</b> each focussed on detection and management of patient deterioration. Two observers collected behavioural data using an adapted version of Gaba 2 ̆ 7 s Clinical Simulation Tool, to provide verbal feedback to each participant, following each <b>simulation</b> <b>exercise.</b> Participants wore a head-mounted video camera during the second <b>simulation</b> <b>exercise</b> only. Video recordings were replayed to participants to augment feedback, following the second <b>simulation</b> <b>exercise.</b> Data were collected on: participant performance (observed and perceived); participant perceptions of feedback methods; and head-mounted video camera recording feasibility and capability for detailed audio-visual feedback. RESULTS: Management of patient deterioration improved for six participants (60...|$|R

Further, we propose a scenario generator that partly automates the scenario selection and adaptively responds to the exercise evolvement. Policy Analysi...|$|R
