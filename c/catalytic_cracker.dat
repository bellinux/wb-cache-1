New catalysts are tested together with a reference catalyst in both the MAT and Pilot Unit reactors.

An extensive particulate matter (PM) monitoring and analysis program was conducted to quantify elemental concentrations of PM. Size-resolved PM samples (PM 2. 5 and PM 10 - 2. 5) from the La Paz and Las Condes stations in Santiago (2004 - 2005) were analyzed using ICP-MS. Most trace element concentrations (Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, V, Sb, Pb and As) were higher during winter than during summer and were also higher at the La Paz station than at the Las Condes station. During the highest pollution events, As concentrations in PM 2. 5 (16 ng m(- 3)) exceeded the annual average standard value (6 ng m(- 3)). A 10 -year time series showed decreasing Pb and As concentrations and slightly increasing Zn, Cu and Mn concentrations. Concentrations of Cr and Ni remained relatively constant. The implementation of new public policies in 1998 may explain the decreasing concentrations of Pb and As. Enrichment factor (EF) calculations identified two principal groups: elements with EF 10 (Rb, K, Cs, Fe, P, Ba, Mn, Ni, Cr, Co, Zn, Sn, Pb, Cu, Mo, Cd, As, Ag, and Sb), which were related to natural and anthropogenic PM sources, respectively.

Examples include fluidized <b>catalytic</b> <b>crackers,</b> distillation columns, biochemical reactors as well as {{chemical process}} networks {{in which the individual}} processes evolve in a fast time-scale and the network dynamics evolve in a slow time-scale. Traditionally, the design of advanced model-based control systems for chemical processes has followed the centralized paradigm in which one control system is used to compute the control actions of all manipulated inputs. While the centralized paradigm to model-based process control has been successful, when the number of the process state variables, manipulated inputs and measurements in a chemical plant becomes large - a common occurrence in modern plants -, the computational time needed for the solution of the centralized control problem may increase significantly and may impede the ability of centralized control systems (particularly when nonlinear constrained optimization-based control systems like model predictive control-MPC are used), to carry out real-time calculations within the limits set by process dynamics and operating conditions. One feasible alternative to overcome this problem is to utilize cooperative, distributed control architectures in which the manipulated inputs are computed by solving more than one control (optimization) problems in separate processors in a coordinated fashion. Motivated by the above considerations, this dissertation presents rigorous, yet practical, methods for the design of distributed model predictive control systems for nonlinear and two-time-scale process networks. Beginning with a review of results on the subject, {{the first part of this}} dissertation presents the design of two, sequential and iterative, distributed MPC architectures via Lyapunov-based control techniques for general nonlinear process systems. Key practical issues like the feedback of asynchronous and delayed measurements as well as the utilization of cost functions that explicitly account for economic considerations are explicitly addressed in the formulation and design of the controllers and of their communication strategy. In the second part of the dissertation, we focus on the design of model predictive control systems for nonlinear two-times-scale process networks within the framework of singular perturbations. Both centralized and distributed MPC designs are presented. Throughout the thesis, the applicability, effectiveness and computational efficiencyof the control methods are evaluated via simulations using numerous, large-scale chemical process networks...|$|R

40|$|To address public {{concerns}} regarding {{the consequences of}} climate change from anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) emissions, the U. S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/NETL) is actively funding a CO{sub 2 } management program to develop technologies capable of mitigating CO{sub 2 } emissions from power plant and industrial facilities. Over the past decade, this program has focused on reducing the costs of {{carbon capture and storage}} technologies. Recently, DOE/NETL launched an alternative CO{sub 2 } mitigation program focused on beneficial CO{sub 2 } reuse to support the development of technologies that mitigate emissions by converting CO{sub 2 } into valuable chemicals and fuels. RTI, with DOE/NETL support, has been developing an innovative beneficial CO{sub 2 } reuse process for converting CO{sub 2 } into substitute natural gas (SNG) by using by-product hydrogen (H{sub 2) -containing fuel gas from petrochemical facilities. This process leveraged commercial reactor technology currently used in fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>crackers</b> in petroleum refining and a novel nickel (Ni) -based catalyst developed by RTI. The goal was to generate an SNG product that meets the pipeline specifications for natural gas, making the SNG product completely compatible with the existing natural gas infrastructure. RTI's technology development efforts focused on demonstrating the technical feasibility of this novel CO{sub 2 } reuse process and obtaining the necessary engineering information to design a pilot demonstration unit for converting about 4 tons per day (tons/day) of CO{sub 2 } into SNG at a suitable host site. This final report describes the results of the Phase I catalyst and process development efforts. The methanation activity of several commercial fixed-bed catalysts was evaluated under fluidized-bed conditions in a bench-scale reactor to identify catalyst performance targets. RTI developed two fluidizable Ni-based catalyst formulations (Cat- 1 and Cat- 3) that demonstrated equal or better performance than that of commercial methanation catalysts. The Cat- 1 and Cat- 3 formulations were successfully scaled up using commercial manufacturing equipment at the Sud-Chemie Inc. pilot-plant facility in Louisville, KY. Pilot transport reactor testing with RTI's Cat- 1 formulation at Kellog Brown & Root's Technology Center demonstrated the ability of the process to achieve high single-pass CO{sub 2 } conversion. Using information acquired from bench- and pilot-scale testing, a basic engineering design package was prepared for a 4 -ton/day CO{sub 2 } pilot demonstration unit, including process and instrumentation diagrams, equipment list, control philosophy, and preliminary cost estimate...|$|R

The model predicts the detailed mass and energy balances, minor compounds emissions (such as NOx, SOx, aromatics,etc.). It is based on a phenomenological approach for dryer, reactors (gasification and combustion) and scrubber modeling. Process units are modeled with Aspen Plus models completed with dedicated Fortran sub-models when more details are required. The gasifier is a Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB). It is decomposed in three sections, describing the three main mechanisms occurring in the reactor: wood pyrolysis, secondary reactions and char combustion. At the outlet of the gasifier, the complete composition of the syngas is predicted, which includes water, permanent gases, inorganics, particles and tars (phenol, benzene, toluene, styrene, indene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene). Simulation results were validated against measurements from a pilot plant and other literature data. A wet conventional syngas cleaning system for gasification plant, including cyclone, <b>catalytic</b> tar <b>cracker,</b> syngas cooler, bag filters, water scrubber and wastewater treatment was considered and modeled. The complexity of tar composition allows a reliable determination of tar dew point. At the outlet of the cleaning system, syngas is burned in gas engines. Gaseous emissions (NOx, SOx, etc.) of the gas engines and the DFB combustor are also handled by the model as well as ashes and liquid waste. The predicted electrical and thermal efficiencies are 27 and 39 % respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe CO 2 Capture Project (CCP) is a {{partnership}} of six energy companies working {{to advance the}} technologies that will underpin the deployment of industrial-scale CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). Harnessing the unique expertise of its members, the CCP has worked in collaboration with government bodies and more than 60 academic institutions, industry and leading environmental groups. Initiated in 2000, the overall objective of CCP is to deliver major cost reductions for CO 2 capture and demonstrate that geological storage is efficient, verifiable and secure. Phase 3 of The CO 2 Capture Project (CCP 3) has been undertaken during 2009 - 2014 and with continuing support of R&D work for capture and storage technologies at multiple levels of development, including exploratory research to demonstration. Demonstration {{of the next generation}} technologies being developed by CCP is a key aspect of this third phase of the project and several capture and storage technologies have been or will be deployed (or made deployment-ready) within the CCP 3 timeframe:•The regenerator of a large pilot Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit in a Brazilian refinery owned by Petrobras was retrofit to oxy-firing with CO 2 recycle. A successful demonstration was completed in 2012. •The retrofit to oxy-firing of a commercial Once Through Steam Generator (OTSG) used in oil sands extraction operations in Canada (duty of 50 million BTU/hr) was performed in 2013, following completion of a feasibility study by Praxair. A demonstration run is scheduled in early 2014 and the main results will be included in the conference paper. •Field deployment and performance assessments of new CO 2 storage monitoring techniques at third party pilot / demonstration sites include: a modular borehole monitoring (MBM) assembly at Citronelle Dome (Alabama), Borehole Gravity at Cranfield Field (Mississippi) and InSAR at Decatur (Illinois) and electromagnetics at Aquistore (Saskatchewan). Other R&D projects completed in 2013 or early 2014 with co-funding of the CCP include:•Investigation of novel oxygen carriers (none Nickel-based) for Chemical Looping Combustion. •Pilot testing of commercial burners for refinery crude process heaters in oxy-firing mode. •Prolonged laboratory test of palladium alloy membranes in Water Gas Shift operating conditions and design of a pilot membrane module. •Pilot and bench-scale testing of several novel solvents for post-combustion application, including non- aqueous and enzyme-enhanced solvents. •Geomechanical hysteresis of top seal from prior oil extraction processes and potential impacts on CO 2 storage containment•Fundamental studies of subsurface physico-chemical processes to simulation of through seal CO 2 leakage and intervention options. •Design of a bench-field scale “fracture sealing” experiment to test candidate sealant performanceSelected scenarios for application of the CCP capture technologies are:•Oil refinery (capture from steam boilers, process heaters, fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>crackers,</b> hydrogen plants) •Steam production for extraction of heavy oils•Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power stationThese represent major sources of CO 2 emissions for the CCP member companies and some of their customers. Storage venues may range from saline formations to CO 2 EOR and possibly unconventional gas reservoirs. Relevant findings and technologies may be leveraged for oil and gas exploration and production characterization and surveillance. An assessment of the performance and economics of state-of-the-art post combustion, oxy-firing and precombustion for the above applications has been carried out. Foster Wheeler was commissioned to conduct technical evaluation studies, while an in-house economic model was developed, which included capture, transportation, and storage costs. The objective of these studies was to provide material for a CO 2 capture handbook to be used to support CO 2 capture technology selection in the oil and gas industry.

40|$|This PhD Thesis {{analyses}} {{the technical}} and economic feasibility of the gasification {{of one of the}} most promising energy crops in terms of biomass yield and plantation costs: Cynara cardunculus L. (cynara). The aim of this analysis is to assess the bioenergy production via fluidized bed gasification (FBG) and the ulterior treatment of the synthesis gas (syngas) produced in the FBG reactor to adequate it to end-use applications such as gas turbines and internal combustion engines. To achieve this objective, this thesis proposes a formulation model approach for evaluating the electricity generation costs (Chapter 2), the reactor performance (Chapter 3) and the syngas conditioning efficiency (Chapter 4). For this purpose, the Autonomous Community of Madrid (CAM) has been taken as study case. The analysis estimates that the cynara has the potential to provide 1708 GWh yr- 1, that is, around 42 % of national biomass-based electricity supply and exceeds 72 % of total renewable-based electricity supply in CAM. Therefore, the implementation of cynara projects could help reducing the total energy consumption of CAM by 0. 05 %, what would suppose to avoid up to 66 % of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. The economic assessment performed in the present work evaluates the use of two thermochemical technologies for cynara conversion into electricity to be used for different applications or sold to the national grid. The technological solutions considered are: a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) power generator. The CCGT solution was studied for an installed capacity range of 5 - 30 MW, while the ICE solution was analysed for a range of 1 - 30 MW. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of variables such as biomass yield, discount rate, transport cost, operation and maintenance. For a cynara yield of 17 t/ha in an 8 MW plant as base case, the economic analysis estimates a production costs of 21. 60 c€/kWh and 24. 32 c€/kW for the CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Accordingly, CCGT plants are the best choice for a plant size above 8 MW, while ICE plants constitute the most suitable technology below 8 MW. With regards to the discount rate, the results show that for the same base case (8 MW), for a discount rate of 10 % the cost of electricity is estimated to be 16. 69 c€/kWh for CCGT plants and 19. 08 c€/kWh for ICE plants. On the contrary, the use of the lowest discount rate (1 %) yields a cost of electricity of 12. 70 and 15. 13 c€/kWh for CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Concerning to the total capital investment, it grows with the plant size, representing up to 93 and 92 % of the total CCGT and ICE plant cost, respectively. Such percentages correspond to 42. 17 M€ and 41. 46 M€ for a CCGT and ICE plant for a base case of 8 MW. Nevertheless, the ICE plants show a stronger economy of scale in energy production than the CCGT solution. In addition to this, the total operating costs for an 8 MW CCGT scenario is estimated to be 2. 94 M€ and around 3. 65 M€ for an ICE plant. In relation to the thermochemical conversion route of cynara, the gasification of biomass in a FB reactor has been modelled to analyse such process for Cynara cardunculus L. taking into consideration the particular biomass behavior. It is well known that the FB reactor thermal state and the biomass volatiles generation are crucial in its operation and performance. Hence, the bubble flow pattern controls the FB temperature profile driving devolatilization and tars cracking kinetics. This underlies in the fact that alkali compounds of biomass fuels, which are featured by a low melting point, can transform into vapours and ash fly that are prone to deposit on heat surfaces in boilers and/or react with the particles of the inert bed material inside the FB. Thus, the formation of agglomerates (the so-called bed agglomeration) would start and then, the defluidization of FB leading to the shut-down of the FBG reactor. Therefore, a modelling approach focused on the bubble phase, which can act as “bypassing” hot spots inside the FB region influencing on ash-related problems, can help to monitor the location of ash sintering and bed agglomeration risk regions and predict undesired FBG reactor performance. A new formulation for biomass FBG reactor modelling that considers the instantaneous devolatilization and temperature peaks due to volatiles combustion inside the FB region is proposed in the present work. A bubble phase and a FB energy balance are used to monitor the gradual release of biomass volatiles along the FB and to check the performance of the FBG reactor. The one-dimensional, steady-state proposed model uses a two-phase (bubble and emulsion) and two zone (bottom dense bed and upper freeboard) modelling approach to account for the complex nature of FBG reactor dynamics. Furthermore, no catalytic effects of ash composition from biomass are taken into consideration. For further validation and tuning up of the model proposed, a sensitivity analysis of cynara gasification in FB, under bubbling regime, was performed considering the specification design of the pilot-plant scale FBG reactor in the Thermal and Fluid Engineering Department facilities at Carlos III University of Madrid. The simulation campaign yields a syngas composition (on dry basis) of 4. 79 - 14. 84 % for CO, 19. 77 - 21. 35 % for CO 2, 6. 11 - 15. 00 % for H 2 and 2. 16 - 5. 73 % for CH 4. Besides, the lower heating value and tar content of the syngas fall in the range of 2. 25 - 6. 25 MJ/Nm 3 and 60 - 180 g/Nm 3, respectively. These results correspond to a syngas-biomass flows ratio in the range of 1. 309 - 2. 392 Nm 3 /kg, accounting for N 2 in the raw syngas produced. The analysis of the results in comparison with previous experiments stands out: 1) the good predictive capability of the model proposed and 2) the discrepancies between simulations and experimental works are attributable to the data heterogeneity found in the literature, that is, different biomass compositions, operating conditions, (catalytic) bed material used, sampling methods for syngas and tar compositions, etc. Hence, further experimental research would help improving the predictive capability of the proposed model. Finally, the conditioning of the syngas produced from the FBG reactor is needed in order to achieve end-use requirements in ICE and gas turbines (GT) plants, since the lack or inefficiency of syngas clean-up could lead to operational problems in downstream equipment and then, unscheduled shut-down and extra maintenance and repair costs. For example, particulate material can cause clogging and fouling, while tars can condensate producing blockage and attrition in filters, exit pipes, heat exchangers, etc. Furthermore, the syngas treatment to reduce its pollutants would influence the performance, investment and operational costs of the gas cleaning devices. Nowadays, gas cleaning systems are aimed to reduce particulate and tars material levels below the allowable concentrations (mg/Nm 3) for ICE and GT devices: 50 - 50 and 30 - 5, respectively. Thus, as a part of the present thesis, the modelling and analysis of a moving bed heat exchange filter (MBHEF) is proposed as hot gas clean-up equipment. The MBHEF stands out because its benefits: high temperature operation (700 - 800 ºC the exhaust gas temperature from the FB reactor), no-clogging and non-pressure increase during operation, which can lead to unscheduled shut-down if using other typical hot gas cleaning devices such as ceramic filters, bag filters. Additionally, the MBHEF would provide a high contact area between gas and solids without entrainment nor elutriation of solids. This compact size equipment would allow saving costs. Eventually, the MBHEF solution for hot gas cleaning would also avoid extra costs derived from the reactor design modification and the use of additives/catalysts in order to remove tars. It is presented a modelling approach for simulating tars and particulate removal in a MBHEF. The two-dimension, adiabatic, steady-state proposed model accounts for twophase (gas and solid) and neglects conduction and mass diffusion. Tars condensation is modelled through representative tar class lumps: phenol (class 2), naphthalene (class 4), and pyrene (class 5) according to the literature. The model also considers tar concentration influence on tar dew point, while the filtration model is taken from literature. Furthermore, an exergy study was conducted in order to optimise the equipment size and help the choice of the less expensive operating conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed varying the particle size and superficial gas velocity as key operating parameters. To accomplish this, a syngas composition from experiments reported in the literature has been taken as study case. Thus, maps of temperature, tars abatement and particulate removal efficiencies are presented, which show the MBHEF performance for reducing impurities content. The simulation results indicate the feasibility of use a MBHEF as tars removal equipment benefiting its advantages against other gas-cleaning methods with acceptable pollutant removal efficiencies, ranging 88 - 94 %. As observed, the MBHEF yields efficiencies, at least, the same order of magnitude of the ones attainable with the use of <b>catalytic</b> <b>crackers,</b> venture scrubbers or sand filter at much lower temperatures and higher than the ones achieved by means of wash towers, wet electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters and fixed bed absorbers. In case of not reaching the reduction level for each end-use application, the MBHEF device can be used as effective secondary removal method for eliminating tars from the syngas, with the advantages stated above as opposed the rest of removal technologies. Results also point out that low gas velocities (0. 5 - 1 m/s) and high particle size (400 - 700 μm) for saving costs are the most suitable|$|R

Matching secondary processing facilities such Residue Fluidized <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> (RFCC), Diesel Hydro treating (DHDT), Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) have been added. Theses {{state of the art}} eco-friendly technologies have enabled the refinery to produce environment- friendly green fuels complying with international standards.|$|E
50|$|Milford Haven Refinery is {{situated}} on a 1200-acre site near Milford Haven. The refinery came on stream in 1973 under Amoco's ownership. A major upgrade {{was carried out}} in 1981, and a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> was added. In the same year (1981) Murco (a subsidiary of Murphy Oil) purchased a 30% share of the refinery. Since then further units have been added, notably a naptha isomerisation unit and a hydrodesulphurisation unit. In August 1983, a major boilover fire required 150 firemen, 50 fire engines and two days to extinguish. Elf bought Amoco's interest in 1990 and Elf was acquired by Total in 2000. In December 2007 Murco purchased Total's 70% interest in the refinery to become the 100% owner.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 Esso {{embarked}} {{on the construction}} of a new refinery, and a further 1200 hectares of land were acquired. The first stage of this expansion, which came on-stream in 1951, consisted of primary distillation units, a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> and numerous treating units. The refinery was opened by British prime minister Clement Attlee on 14 September 1951. It had an initial estimated capacity of 157,000 barrels per day, or around one third of UK demand at that time. The chemical plant was created in 1958. Additional refining capacity was added, and Fawley's capacity reached around 19,500,000 tonnes of crude oil per annum in 1973 (approximately 400,000 barrels per day), and has since decreased, partly because of reduced demand for oil.|$|E
50|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 5, {{expansion}} of the flue gas through a turboexpander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor. The electrical motor-generator in the power recovery system can consume or produce electrical power. If the {{expansion of the}} flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor, the electric motor-generator provides the needed additional power. If the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor, than the electric motor-generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinery's electrical system. The steam turbine shown in Figure 5 is used to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor during start-ups of the fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task.|$|E
50|$|Shell Oil Products US, a {{subsidiary}} of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, operates the Puget Sound Refinery located on March Point outside of Anacortes, WA. The plant is the largest taxpayer in Skagit County {{and one of the}} county's largest employers. The refinery has a 145,000 b/d capacity, making it the 52nd largest in the USA, in 2015, with facilities that include a delayed coker, fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> polymerization unit and alkylation units. Based on the secondary processing units in place, the facility likely follows a 3-2-1 crack spread. Shell’s refinery produces three grades of gasoline, fuel oil, diesel fuel, propane and butane. This plant is currently the only refinery in Washington state unable to accommodate tight oil via rail. The permitting process is currently underway for the proposed 60,000 b/d unloading capacity of the East Gate Rail Project.|$|E
