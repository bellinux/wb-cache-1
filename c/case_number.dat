30|$|In theory {{this enables}} {{descriptive}} analysis on all combinations of the sampling frame (19 × 10 × 16).

Therefore before commencing descriptive analysis the underlying <b>case</b> <b>numbers</b> have to be checked even within the sampling framework.|$|R

25|$|Sanskrit pronouns are {{declined}} for <b>case,</b> <b>number,</b> and gender. Many pronouns have alternative enclitic forms. The {{first and}} second person pronouns are declined {{for the most part}} alike, having by analogy assimilated themselves with one another. Ablatives in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable -tas; thus mat or mattas, asmat or asmattas. Sanskrit does not have true third person pronouns, but its demonstratives fulfil this function instead by standing independently without a modified substantive.|$|E
25|$|Some {{details of}} Zoya's {{assignment}} and arrest were classified for about sixty years because treachery {{might have been}} involved. The criminal <b>case</b> <b>number</b> 16440 was declassified in 2002. The case was then reviewed by Russia's Chief Military Prosecutor Office, and {{it was decided that}} Vasily Klubkov, who betrayed Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, was not eligible for rehabilitation. According to criminal case 16440, three Soviet combatants: Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Vasily Klubkov, and their commander Boris Krainov had to perform acts of sabotage in Reichskommissariat Ostland. They had been given the task of setting fire to houses in the village of Petrishchevo, where German troops were quartered. Krainov was to operate in {{the central part of the}} village, Kosmodemyanskaya in the southern and Klubkov in the northern parts. Krainov was the first to carry out his task and returned to the base. Zoya performed her task too, as was evidenced by three columns of flame in the southern part of Petrischevo seen from the base. Only the northern part was not set on fire. According to Klubkov, he was captured by two German soldiers and taken to their headquarters. A German officer threatened to kill him, and Klubkov gave him the names of Kosmodemyanskaya and Krainov. After this, Kosmodemyanskaya was captured by the Germans.|$|E
500|$|Bell further alleged in his 2003 {{lawsuit that}} a forged appeal <b>case,</b> <b>number</b> 99-30210, was {{entered into the}} court record. He stated that [...] "Ninth Circuit Court {{personnel}} ... began corruptly falsifying, forging, and improperly adding to and deleting from the Ninth Circuit Court documentary record ... with regard to appeal #99-30210." [...] Bell's October 2004 amendment further alleges that, a handwritten note, [...] "purportedly signed by Bell, but not in Bell's handwriting style", was forged to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He alleges that this notice of appeal was filed around June 20, 1999 (claim 505), and that, [...] "... Ninth Circuit personnel agreed to and did continually add false records to that docket, and at various times they deleted some of those false records and substituted new false records, {{for the purposes of}} concealing the true events and for continuing to obstruct Bell’s access to justice and his constitutional rights." [...] (Claim 510) In his lawsuit, Bell seeks to establish that over a dozen government employees were guilty of numerous felonies.|$|E
40|$|Measles vaccine {{efficacy}} is higher at 12 months than 9 months because of maternal immunity, but delaying vaccination exposes the children {{most vulnerable to}} measles mortality to infection. We explored how this trade-off changes {{as a function of}} regionally varying epidemiological drivers, e. g. demography, transmission seasonality, and vaccination coverage. High birth rates and low coverage both favour early vaccination, and initiating vaccination at 9 - 11 months, then switching to 12 - 14 months can reduce <b>case</b> <b>numbers.</b> Overall however, increasing the age-window of vaccination decreases <b>case</b> <b>numbers</b> relative to vaccinating within a narrow age-window (e. g. 9 - 11 months). The width of the age-window that minimizes mortality varies as a function of birth rate, vaccination coverage and patterns of access to care. Our results suggest that locally age-targeted strategies, at both national and sub-national scales, tuned to local variation in birth rate, seasonality, and access to care may substantially decrease <b>case</b> <b>numbers</b> and fatalities for routine vaccination...|$|R
