The syntax and semantics of hybrid terminological <b>cycles</b> <b>in</b> description logic εL are given. Under the requirement of the LCS and MSC reasoning of hybrid terminological <b>cycles</b> <b>in</b> description logic εL, TBox-completion is presented, and the description graph is redefined. The LCS and MSC reasoning algorithms of hybrid terminological <b>cycles</b> <b>in</b> description logic εL w. r. t. greatest fixpoint semantics are presented by using TBox-completion and description graph.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac <b>cycle,</b> <b>in</b> early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
