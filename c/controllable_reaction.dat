Multi-enzyme systems are complex in nature, but unique synergistic effects and the coupling of steps may even push unfavorable equilibria towards the formation of desired products under cascade-type processes (i.e. continuous flow conditions).

In this paper, {{we study}} a {{three-dimensional}} nonlinear {{model of a}} <b>controllable</b> <b>reaction</b> [X] + [Y] + [Z] → [Z], where the reaction rate is given by a unspecified nonlinear function.

For this control model, we analytically study the corresponding attainable set and parameterize it by the moments of switching of piecewise constant control functions. This allows us to visualize the attainable sets using a numerical procedure. These analytical results generalize the earlier findings, which were obtained for a trilinear reaction rate (which corresponds {{to the law of}} mass action) and reported in [18, 19], to the case of a general rate of reaction.

However, the common coordinating solvents and ligands and the similar precursors for the II-VI system do not work well for the synthesis of III-V NQDs. Both nucleation and crystal growth processes in these approaches needed long reaction times, all together 2 to 7 days, to yield a crystalline particle [1 – 4]. Some researchers reported an approach using fatty acids and a mixture of fatty acids and amines and applying a non-coordinating solvent, 1 -octadecene [ODE] [5 – 8].

In the synthesis of high-quality InP or InP/ZnS NQDs in terms of size uniformity and crystallinity, a choice of an indium [In] precursor is flexible, but that of a phosphorus [P] precursor is quite limited, mostly relying on a highly expensive, toxic, flammable P source such as P(SiMe 3) 3.|$|E

ZnO nanowires cannot be formed unless the growth temperature at the precursor is higher than 930 °C, while the average diameter and number density of nanowires array can be controlled by the growth temperature. SEM data indicated that nanowire diameters are inversely proportional to the growth temperature; the smallest nanowires can be obtained at 950 – 1, 000 °C and are around 40 nm in diameter.

We propose a tracking control framework in which the avatar is controlled so as to track input motion from a motion capture device as well as system generated motion.

From a combination of multiple spectroscopic techniques, it was shown that {{the driving force behind}} the transfer was originated from a change in conformation of the PEG chain of the IL upon temperature variation. By utilizing the novel property of this class of ILs, a highly efficient and <b>controllable</b> CuI-catalyzed cycloaddition <b>reaction</b> was achieved wherein the IL was used to entrain, activate, and recycle the catalyst, as well as to control the reaction. </p...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric {{beta-cyclodextrin}} (beta CD) films tunable {{with respect}} to thickness and beta CD content were prepared {{in order to develop}} a suitable platform, allowing for inclusion of nonpolar guest molecules in the beta CD cavity, while suppressing nonspecific protein adsorption. The beta CD films were synthesized from linear beta CD dextran polymers, and grafted onto silicon oxide surfaces by "click" chemistry. Topographic and morphological characteristics are <b>controllable</b> by <b>reaction</b> conditions and polymer type, with average film heights from 2. 5 to 12. 5 nm. Reversible introduction of electrostatic charges in the beta CD dextran by complex formation with 1 -adamantanecarboxylic acid prior to surface grafting resulted in a thinner and denser film, presumably by decompaction of the polymers. Total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy (TIRF) was employed to evaluate the accessibility of beta CD cavities to the fluorescent probe 2 -anilinonaphthalene- 6 -sulfonic acid. Only a minor fraction of the beta CD cavities was accessible in the thicker and less dense films; however, accessibility was largely improved with increased ionic strength using NaCl up to 1 M. Antifouling properties of the beta CD dextran polymer films were assessed by TIRF real-time monitoring, using bovine serum albumin as a model protein, and showed a 5 - to 10 -fold reduction in nonspecific adsorption as compared to a bare quartz surface with the degree of reduction reflecting film thickness and interfacial polymer density...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{efforts to control}} a {{tethered}} formation flight spacecraft array for NASA's SPECS mission using the SPHERES test-bed developed by the MIT Space Systems Laboratory. Specifically, advances in methodology and experimental results realized since the 2005 SPIE paper are emphasized. These include a new test-bed setup with a reaction wheel assembly, a novel relative attitude measurement system using force torque sensors, and modeling of non-ideal tethers to account for tether vibration modes. The nonlinear equations of motion of multi-vehicle tethered spacecraft with elastic flexible tethers are derived from Lagrange's equations. The controllability analysis indicates that both array resizing and spin-up are fully <b>controllable</b> by the <b>reaction</b> wheels and the tether motor, thereby saving thruster fuel consumption. Based upon this analysis, linear and nonlinear controllers have been successfully implemented on the tethered SPHERES testbed, and tested at the NASA MSFC's flat floor facility using two and three SPHERES configurations...|$|R
