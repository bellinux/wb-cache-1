50|$|Hordenine (N,N-dimethyltyramine) is an {{alkaloid}} of the phenethylamine {{class that}} occurs naturally {{in a variety}} of plants, taking its name from one of the most <b>common,</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum species). Chemically, hordenine is the N-methyl derivative of N-methyltyramine, and the N,N-dimethyl derivative of the well-known biogenic amine tyramine, from which it is biosynthetically derived and with which it shares some pharmacological properties (see below). Currently, hordenine is widely sold as an ingredient of nutritional supplements, with the claims that it is a stimulant of the central nervous system, and has the ability to promote weight loss by enhancing metabolism. In experimental animals, given sufficiently large doses parenterally (i.e. by injection), hordenine does produce an increase in blood pressure, as well as other disturbances of the cardio-vascular, respiratory and nervous systems. These effects are generally not reproduced by oral administration of the drug in test animals, and there are virtually no scientific reports of the effects of hordenine in human beings. More detailed discussions of hordenine pharmacology and toxicology are given below this section.|$|E

The rotation was managed under four different farming systems: two conventional: {{with and without}} mineral fertilizers and two organic, both with winter cover crops (later ploughed and used as green manure) and one where cattle manure was added yearly. The measurements conducted were penetration resistance, soil water content, porosity, water permeability, and organic carbon. Yearly variations were linked {{to the number of}} tillage operations, and a cumulative effect of soil organic carbon in the soil {{as a result of the}} different fertilization amendments, organic or mineral. All the systems showed similar tendencies along the three years of study and differences were only found between the control and the other systems. Mineral fertilizers enhanced the overall physical soil conditions due to the higher yield in the system. In the organic systems, cover crops and cattle manure did not have a significant effect on soil physical properties in comparison with the conventional ones, which were kept bare during the winter period. The extra organic matter boosted the positive effect of crop rotation, but the higher number of tillage operations in both organic systems counteracted this effect to a greater or lesser extent...|$|E
40|$|A lack of {{information}} about nutritional and digestibility characteristics of <b>common</b> <b>barley</b> varieties grown for silage in western Canada has resulted in producers selecting varieties more on yield and other agronomic characteristics as opposed to nutritional value. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate nutritional and 30 -h NDF digestibility (NDFD 30 h) characteristics of common Canadian barley varieties, changes in NDFD 30 h characteristics of these varieties with advancing maturity and the effect of feeding these varieties on the performance of feedlot steers. A nutritional evaluation of commercial barley silage samples harvested at mid-dough stage indicated that CDC Cowboy had a greater (P 0. 05) result in variability in NDFD 30 h. A feedlot and metabolism trial utilizing the 3 barley varieties at 2 (HIGH and LOW) levels of inclusion indicated that backgrounding steers fed CDC Cowboy and HIGH silage diets had lower (P 0. 05) across treatments. When CDC Cowboy, CDC Copeland and Xena were seeded, treated and harvested from replicated plots at four stages of maturity (milk, early-, mid- and hard-dough) over 2 crop years, there was a variety × maturity interaction with CDC Cowboy having greater (P < 0. 01) NDFD 30 h at early-dough than Xena and greater (P < 0. 01) NDFD 30 h at hard-dough than CDC Copeland. As such, there is potential for producers to select barley varieties with enhanced nutritional and agronomic characteristics. Harvesting CDC cowboy at early-dough for silage for dairy and CDC Cowboy and Xena at hard-dough for swath grazing would likely improve the nutritive value of forage and could lead to specific maturity targets for different farm operations (beef vs. dairy) ...|$|E

A 2 -years field study was conducted at the College of Agricultural, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran to evaluate the effects of different barley residue and N rates on some physiological indices and soil moisture contents of two dryland barley cultivars. The experiment was conducted as strip split plot with four replications. Vertical plots included two dryland <b>common</b> <b>barley</b> cultivars (Afzal and Reyhan), horizontal plots were three crop residue rates (0, 750 and 1500 kg ha- 1) and sub plots were three N rates (0, 40, and 80 kg N ha- 1). The results showed that when the crop residues were applied, N rates should be increased accordingly. Increasing N rates (from 0 to 80 kg N ha- 1) accompanied by residue application increased leaf area index in both cultivars. When the crop residues were completely applied, but N rates were not appropriated with crop residue application, LAI decreased in both cultivars. The lowest LAI (1. 14) was obtained from 1500 kg ha- 1 crop residue and 0 kg N ha- 1 in both cultivars. The highest (1196 g/m 2) and the lowest (595 g/m 2) dry matter yield was obtained from 80 kg N ha- 1 and % 100 crop residue and from 0 kg N ha- 1 and 1500 kg ha- 1 crop residue in both cultivars, respectively.

A traditional floor maltings germinates the grains in a thin layer on a solid floor, and the grain is manually raked and turned to keep the grains loose and aerated. In a modern malt house the process is more automated, and the grain is germinated on a floor that is slotted to allow air to be forced through the grain bed. Large mechanical turners keep the much thicker bed loose with higher productivity and better energy efficiency.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of Azosprillium inoculation and molybdenum application on <b>common</b> <b>barley</b> grown in saline condition, a greenhouse experiment was conducted at Azad university, branch of Eghlid, Iran. The experimental design was factorial based on complete randomized design with four replications. The first factor comprised of four salinity treatments (1 as control, 5, 10 and 15 ds m − 1), second factor comprised the levels of Mo application (1 : treated and 2 : untreated = control) and the third factor included two levels of Azosprillum inoculation (inoculated and uninoculated = control). The measured parameters were chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis (Ps) rates, carbohydrates, nitrate, ammonium and protein content, nitrogenase activity, grain yield (GY) and yield components. The results showed that salinity decreased GY in all levels. GY reduction in inoculated treatment was lower (12. 9 %) than uninoculated treatment (29. 7 %). GY reduction was highly related to the reduction of grain number (GN) rather than reduction in ear mX 2. Inoculation and application of Mo reduced harmful effects of salinity especially on mean kernel weight and grain number. Soluble saccharides and protein contents increased with increasing salinity. Inoculation and Mo application significantly increased the content of fructan and sucrose respectively. The mean values of Fv/Fm and photosynthesis rate reduced in the salinity treatments compared to the control. Inoculation and Mo application significantly increased photosynthesis rates at all salinity levels. The highest plant N content was obtained from inoculated, control salinity treatment by applying Mo. In inoculated barley roots with application of Mo, nitrogenase activity (NA) was not severely inhibited by salinity. Data also showed that Mo application positively affected nitrogenase activity. Inoculation, caused plant to cope on the stress, effectively by increasing fructan content and NO 3 /NH 4 ratio and lower decrease in whole plant N content and Fv/Fm ratio. Generally, Azosprillium inoculation helped plants perform better under salinity treatments and Mo application ameliorated plant nitrogen status...|$|E

In Jumla (high-hill), the barley seed system is completely informal and is mainly from farmer to farmer. In the present study, the seed flows and the pattern of genetic diversity in barley were investigated to detect {{differences between the two}} varieties and test the divergence among populations of each variety These data suggested that Chawali, the more common variety, was less subject to homogenising gene flow between farms than was Lekali. A total of 128 farming households were surveyed for seed supply information and 128 populations for each landrace from two villages: Kartikswami and Talium were collected for SSR diversity analysis. Some 92 SSRs were screened in an initial sample of 20 barley populations of both landraces and 2 improved varieties (LG- 51 and Soluwa). Of the 81 SSRs that consistently amplified, only 15 SSRs (19 %) were polymorphic with gene diversity values ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 71. A medium to low diversity was detected among the landrace populations of barley varieties. Chawali populations were less polymorphic within ecological groups, and more divergent between than were Lekail populations.

40|$|Improved cultivars loose their {{identity}} and healthiness unless maintained properly. Contaminating and degrading forces, such as outcrossing, volunteer plants, mixing, natural selection, mutation and seed-borne diseases, {{are at the}} root of this. Maintenance selection can prevent this deterioration. How it is carried out depends on the reproduction system of the crop. Crops are therefore classified into four categories; typical cross-pollinating crops, self-pollinating crops with a substantial amount of outcrossing, typical self-pollinating crops with little outcrossing, and the vegetatively reproduced crops. Generally some of the ¿breeder seed¿ is used to plant a small plot with spaced plants. A fair number of healthy plants of the cultivar type is selected and the seed is harvested per plant. The progenies of the selected plants are grown in small plots. Non-uniform or deviating plots and plots with a seed-borne disease are removed. The seed of the progenies that are healthy, uniform and similar (and so of the cultivar type) are harvested per progeny to be tested next season on larger plots. The same selection is applied and only the seed of the progenies that are healthy, uniform and similar are harvested together to produce the ¿breeder seed¿.

This is also the site of Hapton Tower around which, in the late 15th century, Sir John Towneley was given licence to create a deer park of 1,000 Lancashire arces. [...] From Mill Hill Lane it shares {{the route of the}} Hyndburn Clog and Huncoat Trail through Castle Clough Wood before crossing the Railway, M65 motorway and the canal near Shuttleworth Hall. The sixth section descends to the River Calder, and enters Padiham through Memorial Park. At Padiham Town Hall it follows the Calder out of the town on the Grove Lane Greenway, with views of Gawthorpe Hall and Burnley FC's training ground. To cross the Calder, the route again joins the Brontë Way and at this point connects to the Pendle Way for the Forest of Pendle and Pendle Hill. Passing though Ightenhill, the route again joins the canal towpath to pass over the M65 aqueduct and return to the old cotton mills of the Weavers' triangle.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{previously}} {{performed in}} vitro studies, {{which showed that}} hulless barley varieties could reduce large intestinal Salmonella Typhimurium var. Copenhagen proliferation in pigs, two in vivo experiments were conducted to prove these observations. In Experiment (Exp.) 1, 126 weaning piglets were randomly allocated into pens of seven animals each and fed one of six experimental diets. Three diets contained (75 % as-fed) one of three hulless barley varieties with beta-glucan (BG) contents ranging from 5 to 11 % and amylose from 5 to 40 %, and two diets contained a low BG and amylose hulless barley supplemented with isolated barley BG or raw potato starch. A hulled barley diet served as a control. Two piglets per pen ("Trojan" pigs) were orally infected with Salmonella Typhimurium var. Copenhagen (ST). The remaining five pigs per pen were designated "Contact" pigs. The ST shedding was determined over one week after infection. On day 6, the two Trojans and two random Contacts from each pen were euthanised and intestinal contents and mesenteric lymph nodes cultured for ST. Intestinal volatile fatty acids and microbial composition were determined. In Exp. 2, 126 piglets were {{assigned to one of}} three diets based on hulled or hulless barleys. The timeline, infection, sampling and analyses were similar as in Exp. 1 except samples were taken from four Contact pigs. Hulless barley varieties with high BG and amylose tended to decrease ST persistence in Exp. 1. Clostridia from cluster I in the colon were reduced with high amylose hulless barley or diets supplemented with potato starch (p < 0. 05), whereas other microbial groups were not. Propionate increased (p < 0. 05) and acetate decreased (p < 0. 05) with hulless barley inclusion. Exp. 2 revealed a reduced ST shedding and reduced number of clostridia for high BG hulless barley as compared to <b>common</b> hulled <b>barley</b> and a low BG variety (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, high BG hulless barley do not prevent ST colonisation but might help to reduce transmission in pigs, likely by supporting an intestinal environment limiting growth of this zoopathogen...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} knowing the {{variation}} of starch synthase I (SSI) in Triticum L. and Aegilops and exploiting new gene {{resources for the}} improving of starch quality in common wheat, using PCR cloning, eight sequences of SSI genes were obtained from AS 60 (DD, Aegilops tauschii), AS 2255 (AABB, Triticum turgidum), SHW-L 1 (AABBDD, synthetic hexaploid wheat) and Chuanmai 32 (AABBDD, Triticum aestivum), respectively. These sequences of SSI gene showed the higher conservative characterization between different materials. A total of 10 variable nucleotide bases and two substitutions of amino acid residues (Ser/Asn and Ala/Val) were observed in the cloning sequences. Alignment of all sequences, including SSI gene from T. aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays and Oryza sativa suggested that the sequences from Ae, tauschii, T. turgidum and synthetic hexaploid wheat, were more similar to SSI gene from <b>common</b> wheat and <b>barley</b> and far distance with sequences from Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays and Oryza sativa. Using neighbor-joining method, phylogenetic tree including a total of 28 sequences could be clustered into four groups. Most of sequences of SSI from different species were clustered together and SSI gene showed the clear difference with other starch synthases, including Granule-bound Starch Synthase (GBSS), SSII, SSIII and SSIV. These results suggested that there was variation fro SSI gene in Triticum L. and Aegilops. It necessary to developing molecular markers for exploit genetic resources and the improving of wheat starch quality...|$|R
