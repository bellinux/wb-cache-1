Through a tightly integrated approach to quality audit, programmers would be empowered to use any chosen methodology to advantage, supported by intelligent monitoring of the essential interactions which occur in the development process.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} the current state of transfusion practice at a large metropolitan hospital in South AU 8 tralia, with a view to making recommendations to improve safety. Transfusion practice was monitored using a questionnaire and a <b>concurrent</b> <b>audit</b> design. Patients identified as having received a packed red blood cell transfusion in the previous 24 h, were selected by a random number generator. Questions included those about blood pack identification, documentation of the transfusion process, and patient observation. The results of this audit indicated that areas of documentation, primarily patient consent, blood pack administration times and patient monitoring required re-evaluation. Recommendations to improve practice were made based on these results. This is an ongoing service provided by the hospital, which has proven invaluable in identifying deficiencies in transfusion practice in order to improve patient care...|$|E

"May 2011 "I investigate if the presence of an audit failure in an auditor office location in a given fiscal year indicates the presence of a contagion effect on the quality of other <b>concurrent</b> <b>audits</b> conducted by the office. Audit quality is inferred by cross-sectional differences in clients' audited earnings, specifically, abnormal accruals. I find that the presence of at least one audit failure (defined as a downward restatement of net income by a client) is indicative of contagion within the office. Specifically, for offices with one or more client restatements, abnormal accruals of other clients in the office are significantly larger (on average) than in those offices that have no restatements. This result holds for offices of both Big Four and non-Big Four auditors. Further analysis indicates the contagion in Big Four offices occurs in smaller offices and in Big Four offices where a low percentage of audits are conducted in those industries in which an office is the city-level industry leader (irrespective of office size) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to identify those factors that should affect treatment planning for patients who have lower third molars, using decision-analytic techniques. Utility values based on data from 104 patients indicated that the respondents considered that postoperative complications (except mild pain and temporary paresthesia) reduced health to a greater degree than did complications following non-intervention. A decision analysis indicated that the maximum expected utility of prophylactic third-molar surgery (60. 25) was lower than that for non-intervention (76. 96). The decision was sensitive to changes in the probabilities of occurrence of recurrent pericoronitis (threshold = 0. 52), resorption of an adjacent tooth (threshold = 0. 29), loss of an adjacent tooth (threshold = 0. 32), and cystic change (threshold = 0. 34). These thresholds are much higher than the incidence of problems affecting the lower third molar shown by a <b>concurrent</b> clinical <b>audit</b> and literature review. This study therefore suggests that lower third molars should not be removed prophylactically. Key words: decision analysis; utility values; third molar surgery. (Med Decis Making 1995; 15 : 143 - 151) With decision analysis, procedures and treatment op-tions relevant to a given condition can be explicitl...|$|R
40|$|An {{antibiotic}} {{order form}} was implemented for all inpatient antibiotic orders at an 800 -bed hospital in April 1981 {{to provide an}} ongoing, <b>concurrent</b> <b>audit</b> of antibiotic use. The prescribing physician provided the clinical indication for the antibiotic order, and in-dividual patient treatment courses were identified. During the 25 -month study period, cephalosporins, penicillin plus ampicillin, and aminoglycosides accounted for 44070, 22 %, and 17 % of all treatment courses, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of first-generation cephalosporin treatment courses were for prophylaxis, whereas the remaining antibiotics were used for either empirical therapy or documented infection in 56 %- 79 % of cases. After {{the introduction of the}} antibiotic order form, there was a significant de-cline in both the number of antibiotic treatment courses (P =. 025) and the percentage of patients receiving any antibiotic (P =. 007). We conclude that a specialized antibiotic order form is an effective method for antibiotic utilization review and can have a signifi-cant impact on a physician's prescribing patterns. In recent years, issues of quality assurance and cost control have often focused on the use of antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Studies {{show that}} when it comes to an {{integration}} of Cloud computing into enterprises, chief information officers and management still see some dark Clouds on the horizon. The biggest one is the lack of security, which results in distrust and skepticism against the technology, mainly originating from an intransparency of Cloud environments. To increase this transparency, the Cloud Research Lab at Furtwangen University develops the Security Audit as a Service (SAaaS) architecture for Infrastructure as a Service Cloud environments. It is targeted to ensure that a desired security level is reached and maintained within a frequently changing Cloud infrastructure. Despite a traditional security audit, which includes a comprehensive and therefore time-consuming security check of a whole infrastruc-ture, a Cloud security audit needs to be lightweight enough to be executed right after an infrastructure change occurred, and precisely target-oriented to perform an audit of the specific infrastructure components affected by this change. This is called a <b>concurrent</b> security <b>audit.</b> In this paper, a Cloud audit policy language for the SAaaS architecture gets presented. First, the design and implementation of the automated audit system of vir-tual machine images, which ensures legal and company policies, is described. Second, on-demand deployed software audit agents that maintain and validate the security compliance of running Cloud services, are discussed. Keywords—Cloud computing, security policies, Cloud audits, agents I...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has grown}} largely {{over the past}} three years and is widely popular amongst today's IT landscape. In a comparative study between 250 IT decision makers of UK companies they said, that they already use cloud services for 61 % of their systems. Cloud vendors promise "infinite scalability and resources" combined with on-demand access from everywhere. This lets cloud users quickly forget, that there is still a real IT infrastructure behind a cloud. Due to virtualization and multi-tenancy the complexity of these infrastructures is even increased compared to traditional data centers, while it is hidden from the user and outside of his control. This makes management of service provisioning, monitoring, backup, disaster recovery and especially security more complicated. Due to this, and a number of severe security incidents at commercial providers in recent years there is a growing lack of trust in cloud infrastructures. This thesis presents research on cloud security challenges and how they can be addressed by cloud security audits. Security requirements of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud are identified and it is shown how they differ from traditional data centres. To address cloud specific security challenges, a new cloud audit criteria catalogue is developed. Subsequently, a novel cloud security audit system gets developed, which provides a flexible audit architecture for frequently changing cloud infrastructures. It is based on lightweight software agents, which monitor key events in a cloud and trigger specific targeted security audits on demand - on a customer and a cloud provider perspective. To enable these <b>concurrent</b> cloud <b>audits,</b> a Cloud Audit Policy Language is developed and integrated into the audit architecture. Furthermore, to address advanced cloud specific security challenges, an anomaly detection system based on machine learning technology is developed. By creating cloud usage profiles, a continuous evaluation of events - customer specific as well as customer overspanning - helps to detect anomalies within an IaaS cloud. The feasibility of the research is presented as a prototype and its functionality is presented in three demonstrations. Results prove, that the developed cloud audit architecture is able to mitigate cloud specific security challenges...|$|R
