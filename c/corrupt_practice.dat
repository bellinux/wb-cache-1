25|$|The {{successful}} {{election of}} a candidate found guilty (whether personally or by his agents) of a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> is void, and anyone found personally guilty of a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> is prohibited from holding any elected office (and for some offences, also from voting in any election) {{for a period of}} five years. In addition, if the offender is a solicitor, barrister, advocate or member of another regulated profession (such as a medical doctor) then the offence is also reported to the appropriate regulatory body which is empowered to deal with {{it as if it were}} professional misconduct, and thus could result in suspension or being struck off their professional register. If an election court finds that someone with a licence for the sale of alcohol allows bribery or treating to take place on his premises, they can also report the matter to the licensing authority which may consider it grounds to refuse to renew the licence.|$|E

Failure to comply with this requirement amounts to a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> and attracts a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. In addition, a convicted person is subject to the disqualifications referred to earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{penalty for}} bribery, personation, {{treating}} and undue influence {{is a fine}} of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of {{up to three years}} or both. On conviction for making a false statement, a person is liable to be fined or imprisoned up to 12 months or both. In addition, a person convicted of a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> is incapable for a seven-year period of being registered as an elector, or voting at any election, being elected the President or an MP. If, on the date of conviction, a person has already been elected an MP, the election is vacated.|$|E

25|$|The punishments for corrupt {{practices}} {{fall into}} two broad categories: non-criminal sanctions, and criminal punishments. The reporting, by an election court, of a person as guilty of a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> renders them immediately liable to the non-criminal sanctions, and they may additionally be prosecuted and subjected to the criminal punishments (but if they are prosecuted and acquitted, then the non-criminal sanctions are revoked). Where the election was not challenged by a petition at the time, but suspected corrupt practices are subsequently identified, a criminal prosecution can be instigated (but only within one year of the election concerned), and anyone found guilty is subject to both criminal punishment and the non-criminal sanctions.|$|E

[...] As he did with many citywide improvement projects, Shepherd awarded contracts to businesses in which he owned large amounts of stock.

2500|$|The {{result of}} an {{election}} can challenged {{on the grounds that}} corrupt practices have taken place by the presentation of an election petition to the courts within the period of 21 days after the date of the election. If the election court which hears the petition determines that a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> has taken place, it issues a report finding the relevant individuals guilty. A candidate may be reported as personally guilty if they were directly involved with the <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice,</b> or if it was committed with their knowledge or consent. A candidate may also be reported as [...] "guilty by his agents" [...] where his election agent or those working on his campaign commit corrupt practices.|$|E

2500|$|The post-Civil War {{period of}} the {{constitutional}} monarchy saw the rise of competing manifestations of liberal ideology and their adherents. Gastão Pereira de Sande, Count of Taipa, {{then one of the}} oppositionists (commonly referred to as [...] "radicals"), described the government as a [...] "gang made up to devour the country under the shadow of a child" [...] (a figure of speech wherein the [...] "child" [...] represented the young Queen, Maria II of Portugal). This was one of the earliest references to Devorismo (Devourism), i.e., the <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> of using the public treasury to enrich oneself or to benefit another.|$|E
60|$|Before {{his time}} the enormities of {{the worship of}} Jaghernauth, and {{the horrors of the}} car, beneath which human victims threw themselves, had hardly been realized; and his very {{effective}} style of writing brought into full prominence the atrocities of the Suttee, or burning of widows on the funeral pile, a custom with which {{it was supposed to be}} impossible to interfere, but which has been proved to be entirely a <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice,</b> unsanctioned by any ancient law, only encouraged by the Brahmins out of avarice. Happily the present generation only knows of these atrocities as almost proverbial expressions, but when the century came in they were in full force.|$|E
60|$|This example had {{its use in}} the way {{in which}} it was {{intended}} to operate, and in which alone it could operate. It did not discourage forgeries: they went on at their usual rate, neither more nor less: but it put an end to all accusations against all persons in power for any <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice.</b> Mr. Hastings observes, that no man in India complains of him. It is generally true. The voice of all India is stopped. All complaint was strangled with the same cord that strangled Nundcomar. This murdered not only that accuser, but all future accusation; and not only defeated, but totally vitiated and reversed all the ends for which this country, to its eternal and indelible dishonor, had sent out a pompous embassy of justice to the remotest parts of the globe.|$|E

60|$|Your Lordships {{will see}} that there are grounds for suspicion, not {{supported}} with the same evidence, but with evidence of great probability, that there was another entertainment given at the expense of another lac of rupees; and there is also great probability that Mr. Hastings received two lac of rupees, and Mr. Middleton another lac. The whole of the Nabob's revenues would have been exhausted by these two men, if they had stayed there a whole year: and they stayed three months. Nothing will be secured from the Company's servants, so long as they can find, under this name, or under pretence of any corrupt custom of the country, a vicious excuse for this <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice.</b> The excuse is worse than the thing itself. I leave it, then, with your judgment to decide whether you will or not, if this justification comes before you, establish a principle which would put all Bengal in a worse situation than an hostile army could do, and ruin all the Company's servants by sending them from their duty to go round robbing the whole country under the name of entertainments.|$|E
6000|$|But {{nothing is}} more false than that despotism is the {{constitution}} of any country in Asia that we are acquainted with. It is certainly not true of any Mahomedan constitution. But if it were, do your Lordships really think that the nation would bear, that any human creature would bear, to hear an English governor defend himself on such principles? or, if he can defend himself on such principles, {{is it possible to}} deny the conclusion, that no man in India has a security for anything, but by being totally independent of the British government? Here he has declared his opinion, that he is a despotic prince, that he is to use arbitrary power; and of course all his acts are covered with that shield. [...] "I know," [...] says he, [...] "the constitution of Asia only from its practice." [...] Will your Lordships submit to hear the corrupt practices of mankind made the principles of government? No! it will be your pride and glory to teach men intrusted with power, that, in their use of it, they are to conform to principles, and not to draw their principles from the <b>corrupt</b> <b>practice</b> of any man whatever. Was there ever heard, or could it be conceived, that a governor would dare to heap up all the evil practices, all the cruelties, oppressions, extortions, corruptions, briberies, of all the ferocious usurpers, desperate robbers, thieves, cheats, and jugglers, that ever had office, from one end of Asia to another, and, consolidating all this mass of the crimes and absurdities of barbarous domination into one code, establish it as the whole duty of an English governor? I believe that till this time so audacious a thing was never attempted by man.|$|E
