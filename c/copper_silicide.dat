50|$|Chromium has {{excellent}} adhesion to many materials {{because of}} its reactivity. Its affinity for oxygen forms a thin stable oxide coat on the outer surface, creating a passivation layer which prevents further oxidation of the chromium, and of the underlying metal (if any), even in corrosive environments. Chromium plating on steel for automotive use involves three diffusion barrier layers—copper, nickel, then chromium—to provide long term durability where {{there will be many}} large temperature changes. If chromium is plated directly onto the steel, then their different thermal expansion coefficients will cause the chrome plating to peel off the steel. Nickel, Nichrome, tantalum, hafnium, niobium, zirconium, vanadium, and tungsten {{are a few of the}} metal combinations used to form diffusion barriers for specific applications. Conductive ceramics can be also used, such as tantalum nitride, indium oxide, <b>copper</b> <b>silicide,</b> tungsten nitride, and titanium nitride.|$|E

This {{is a good example}} to illustrate the differences between the reaction chemistry of the Si and Ge surfaces. In the case of Si, nanostructures of <b>copper</b> <b>silicides</b> can be routinely achieved, {{but in the case of}} Ge, we only observed the formation of pits, which can be a result of the much lower sublimation temperature of copper germanide. The insets in Figure 3 d, e, f show the magnified images of individual pits. Nanopits in shapes of triangle, square, and wire were observed on Ge(111), Ge(100), and Ge(110) substrates, respectively, and all the nanopits have the same orientation in a given sample. The equilateral triangle and square pits exhibit lateral dimensions approximately from 1 to 2 μm, and approximately from 500 nm to 2 μm, respectively. The wire-shaped pits have widths approximately between 2 and 3 μm, and lengths approximately between 7 and 15 μm. In addition, the orientations of the pits on Ge are consistent with the ones on Si, which give further support to the formation mechanism, but in general, we found that the Ge surfaces are much more volatile than the Si surfaces, and the control of patterning on the Ge surfaces is quite challenging, which clearly warrants further investigations.|$|R

40|$|A macrocrystalline {{or single}} crystal semiconductive {{material}} is formed from a primary substrate including a single crystal or several very large crystals {{of a relatively}} low melting material. This primary substrate is deposited on a base such as steel or ceramic, {{and it may be}} formed from such metals as zinc, cadmium, germanium, aluminum, tin, lead, <b>copper,</b> brass, magnesium <b>silicide,</b> or magnesium stannide. These materials generally have a melting point below about 1000 C and form on the base crystals the size of fingernails or greater. The primary substrate has an epitaxial relationship with a subsequently applied layer of material, and because of this epitaxial relationship, the material deposited on the primary substrate will have essentially the same crystal size as the crystals in the primary substrate. If required, successive layers are formed, each of a material which has an epitaxial relationship with the previously deposited layer, until a layer is formed which has an epitaxial relationship with the semiconductive material.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} study of copper CVD {{deposition}} on different types of substrates used for microelectronic devices. The influence of substrate temperature, pressure, flux and contamination effect of the gas phase has been determined to obtain the deposition conditions of the metallic films on substrate as clean Si and CrN. Copper acetylacetonate {{has been used as}} precursor. The CVD reactor is coupled to an ultra high vacuum chamber with Auger electrons spectroscopy which allows in situ surface characterizations. The chemical composition of the film has been measured for different deposition conditions. These surface techniques have been used with X-ray diffraction to characterize the deposited layers. In the case of silicon substrate the deposited film can either be a pure metal or a metal rich silicide near Cu 4 Si at low or high substrate temperatures respectively.

40|$|In this study, synchrotron-based x-ray {{absorption}} microspectroscopy (mu-XAS) {{is applied}} to identifying the chemical states of copper-rich clusters within a variety of silicon materials, including as-grown cast multicrystalline silicon solar cell material with high oxygen concentration and other silicon materials {{with varying degrees of}} oxygen concentration and copper contamination pathways. In all samples, <b>copper</b> <b>silicide</b> (Cu 3 Si) is the only phase of copper identified. It is noted from thermodynamic considerations that unlike certain metal species, copper tends to form a silicide and not an oxidized compound because of the strong silicon-oxygen bonding energy; consequently the likelihood of encountering an oxidized copper particle in silicon is small, in agreement with experimental data. In light of these results, the effectiveness of aluminum gettering for the removal of copper from bulk silicon is quantified via x-ray fluorescence microscopy (mu-XRF), and a segregation coefficient is determined from experimental data to be at least (1 - 2) ' 103. Additionally, mu-XAS data directly demonstrates that the segregation mechanism of Cu in Al is the higher solubility of Cu in the liquid phase.

30|$|Here, we {{take the}} shape-controlled {{synthesis}} of <b>copper</b> <b>silicide</b> nanostructures as an example to illustrate the mechanism. According to the Au-Si binary phase diagram, at temperatures as low as 300 °C to 400 °C, Au NPs already start forming Au-Si eutectic alloys with the Si substrate. As the synthesis temperature rises beyond approximately 600 °C, copper oxide in the source powder is reduced by graphite to generate Cu vapor, which is then absorbed by the Au-Si alloy NPs to form Au-Si-Cu alloy nanoparticles. As the substrate temperature rises higher, Cu 3 Si gradually precipitates from the alloy NPs and endoepitaxially grows on the Si surface. The growth of the Cu 3 Si nanostructures slows down as their size becomes larger because the Cu vapor must diffuse through the formed silicide to continue the reaction with Si, and uniform sizes {{can be achieved by}} controlling the growth time. We should note that Cu 3 Si nanostructures can still be grown even without the Au NPs, which may be a result of the preferred trapping and absorption of Cu vapor at some defective features on the Si surface, but the density and size of the Cu 3 Si nanostructures are less controlled.|$|E
30|$|The above-revealed {{mechanism}} of forming nanostructures and pits applies to both Si and Ge as {{they belong to}} the same group IV elements and have similar chemical properties. Both Si and Ge crystallize in a diamond cubic crystal structure, and their lattice mismatch is about 4 %. Also, their heat of vaporization is similar: 359 and 334 kJ·mol- 1 for Si and Ge, respectively. Processing temperature and pressure have determining effects on both the growth and the sublimation of silicides/germanides; therefore, they must be carefully controlled. It is very {{important to note that the}} chemical properties of Si and Ge surfaces are different, so the reaction conditions must be tailored individually. Unlike Si whose surface in air is readily covered by oxide, elemental Ge oxidizes slowly at 250 °C. Furthermore, Si has a high melting point of approximately 1, 400 °C, while Ge melts at a much lower temperature of 938 °C. Although the surface of a particular material often melts at a lower temperature than the bulk, we can expect that melting of the Ge surface is more readily to occur than that of the Si surface. Indeed, in general, we found that Ge appears to be more volatile, and the micro-/nanoscale reactions on the Ge surface are more difficult to control. For example, <b>copper</b> <b>silicide</b> can form regular nanostructures on Si surfaces, but our attempt to form copper germanide on Ge surfaces was not successful although extensive search of the appropriate growth windows was conducted. Instead, iron germanide gave much better results in terms of synthesis controls, and the detailed mechanisms behind these element-dependent reactions remain largely unknown. We also found that the sublimation temperatures of silicides and germanides are quite different even when the same metal is used; therefore, as illustrated, we used the reactions with different metals to illustrate the patterning strategies.|$|E
