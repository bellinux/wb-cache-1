5|$|The Huggins tables {{have not}} been officially tested, but are more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> the 1956 US Navy tables. They have been {{calculated}} from limits which would theoretically produce venous bubbles 10 to 20% of the time.|$|E
50|$|In {{most of his}} terms Antonio López de Santa Anna {{was closer}} to <b>conservatives</b> <b>than</b> liberals.|$|R
2500|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{the results were}} even more {{favourable}} to the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> the poll predicted, with the Conservatives obtaining 330 seats, an absolute majority. Ashdown and Campbell were presented with hat- and kilt-shaped cakes (labelled [...] "eat me") on BBC Question Time on 8 May.|$|R
50|$|On a {{slightly}} increased turnout, {{the result was}} a narrow victory for Shepherd. His share of the vote was lower than in 1924, when there had been no Liberal candidate, but the presence of a Liberal in the by-election impacted more heavily on the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> on Labour.|$|R
5|$|The Swiss tables use the 80 minute tissue {{compartment}} {{for control}} of repetitive dive calculations, which tends to be less <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> the US Navy tables for this application.|$|E
5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> his senior colleague, George Aiken, and {{reflected}} Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, a Republican majority allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{has been}} {{politically}} conservative {{for much of}} its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). During this time, it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman. However, Oklahoma Democrats were {{generally considered to be}} more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> Democrats in other states.|$|E

50|$|A 2008 {{research}} {{report found that}} <b>conservatives</b> are happier <b>than</b> liberals, and that as income inequality increases, this difference in relative happiness increases, because <b>conservatives</b> (more <b>than</b> liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of economic inequality.|$|R
50|$|David Lloyd George, (1863-1945) {{from the}} British Liberal Party {{was a highly}} {{effective}} leader of the coalition government that took power in late 1916 and managed the British war effort. However his coalition premiership was supported more by <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> by his own Liberals, and the subsequent split was {{a key factor in}} the decline of the Liberal Party as a serious political force.|$|R
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. To fend off Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{successfully}} {{steered the}} repeal of the Corn Laws through Parliament, and was then defeated by an alliance of all his enemies on the issue of Irish law and order; he resigned in June 1846. The Tories remained split and the Queen sent for Lord John Russell, the Whig leader. In the 1847 general election, Disraeli stood, successfully, for the Buckinghamshire constituency. The new House of Commons had more <b>Conservative</b> <b>than</b> Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue to govern. The Conservatives were led by Bentinck in the Commons and Stanley in the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} {{that a strong}} conservative would run in the 1980 Republican primary, Mathias did not face any major opposition for his seat. He easily won his party's nomination, and was re-elected by a substantial margin in November. His Democratic counterpart in the election, Edward T. Conroy, positioned himself as more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> Mathias. Conroy also made national defense the primary issue of his campaign, where he accused Mathias of being weak. Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion in defense spending during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland Republican to win election to a third Senate term, and also the only Republican to win the city of Baltimore up to that point. He also secured support from several precincts of Baltimore's Democratic political machine, and several labor unions.|$|E
5000|$|... 1979-1983: The SNP {{suffered}} severe splits as {{the result}} of the 1979 drop in support. Labour also was riven by internal strife as the Social Democratic Party split away. Despite this, the 1983 election still saw Labour remain the majority party in Scotland, with a smaller swing to the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> in England. The SNP's vote declined further, to 11%, although it won two seats.|$|R
5000|$|From its {{creation}} in 1983 to the present, {{it has been}} a safe [...] Conservative seat, with the primary opposition until the 2015 election being the Liberal Democrats and their predecessors the [...] Liberal party. In 2015, however, the severe fall in Lib Dem support saw [...] Labour's candidate come second in the seat {{for the first time in}} its history, although much further behind the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> the Lib Dem candidates of elections past have tended to be.|$|R
50|$|It is indisputable that Whieldon was {{a highly}} {{successful}} businessman but was necessarily a more <b>conservative</b> potter <b>than</b> Wedgwood, whose exceptional achievements cannot be matched.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, {{most of the state}} and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> Specter, they were only able to take 4% of the vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} Coalition government {{attempted to}} redraw {{the boundaries of}} the UK’s Parliamentary constituencies in order to remove a perceived bias against them, and towards the Labour Party. Though contentious, it was reckoned that the system made it harder to win a majority for the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> it did for Labour. Tim Smith argues that Labour’s loss of Scotland, amongst other factors, has changed this dynamic, meaning that the resurrected boundary reforms – if passed – will simply build upon an already existing Tory advantage...|$|R
5000|$|At creation, Luton North {{included}} eight wards {{from the}} neighbouring districts of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire; these {{made it a}} much safer seat for the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> Luton South, which included only one ward from outside the Borough of Luton. Boundary changes in [...] 1997 reduced the Conservative majority from 13,094 to 7,357, and it was 81st on Labour's list of target seats; Labour duly gained it on a 17.1% swing, and since then the Labour MP elected in 1997, Kelvin Hopkins, has held the seat with comfortable majorities.|$|R

25|$|Although Oregon as a {{whole is}} {{generally}} considered a blue state, Eastern Oregon is far more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> the west. In the 2012 presidential election, Mitt Romney received at least 60% of the vote in every county in Eastern Oregon.|$|E
50|$|The Liberal Democrats {{accepted}} these proposals, but Nick Clegg {{has said}} he still hoped for a four-way leaders debate involving the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP (as the four main parties as defined by Ofcom). However, Labour and UKIP responded that they are only aware of the prior proposal from the broadcasters for three debates, which they still supported. The SNP, likewise, called on Cameron {{to take part in}} the three debates previously proposed. Commentators argued that the new proposed format would be better for the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> having three debates including a head-to-head with Miliband.|$|R
50|$|In {{boundary}} changes {{which took}} effect at the 1950 general election, Stockport {{was divided into}} two single-member constituencies. Hulbert was chosen for Stockport North, which was slightly better territory for the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> the South division. He retained the seat and in the new Parliament was designated as a Temporary Chairman of the House and as a Chairman of Standing Committees. From 1952, Hulbert was a Deputy Lieutenant of Middlesex, {{and he was also}} appointed as Honorary Colonel of no. 461 HAA Regiment of the Royal Artillery (Territorial Army) in the same year. He received a Knighthood in 1955.|$|R
5000|$|The Peelites {{numbered}} about a {{third of}} the old Conservative party following the 1847 general election. Their main political positions at that time were closer to the Protectionist <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> to the Whigs and Radicals in parliament, except on the issue of Free Trade. The split had been so bitter on a personal level, though, with attacks on Peel by protectionist conservatives such as Lord George Bentinck and Benjamin Disraeli, that the Conservative Party was unable to reconcile the Peelites, even after the Conservatives officially abandoned protection in 1852. The Peelites also had their own newspaper The_Morning Chronicle to highlight their political position, ...|$|R

25|$|Most of Northern Ontario is {{a hotbed}} for Liberal and NDP support. The {{southern}} border areas are more <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> the northern areas, however, both fiscally and socially. This is most notable in the Parry Sound and Muskoka, Nipissing Districts.|$|E
25|$|Utah is {{much more}} <b>conservative</b> <b>than</b> the United States as a whole, {{particularly}} on social issues.

50|$|Following their {{review of}} {{parliamentary}} representation in North London, the Boundary Commission for England {{have created a}} modified Harrow West constituency to reflect parts of Greater London where population has increased more. The western border district, town or neighbourhood of Pinner has been {{moved to a new}} constituency, Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, making Harrow West based on 2005 ward voting statistics, and on local elections, a stronger Labour seat {{at the expense of the}} <b>Conservatives</b> <b>than</b> in 2005 — both two leading parties won fewer votes in 2010. Harrow West saw a notional swing in favour of the Conservative Party's Rachel Joyce of 5.7% in the election.|$|R
