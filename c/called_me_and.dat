However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, [...] "I don't say anything that I don't mean. I meant every word that I said.

500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you}} think about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy?

[...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago".

500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E

On October 15, 2009, a spokesperson for Williams confirmed to MTV, that reports of Gaga and Beyoncé working on the music video together were true. It was shot at Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, under tight security. The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video. She said, [...] "When I was doing her video with her, she <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> she said, 'What {{do you want to}} do?' [...] And I'm like, 'I don't want to show up in some frickin' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video.' I said, 'I want to do you.' [...] I want to do my version of Beyoncé.

500|$|Tucci {{was one of}} {{the last}} actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before {{shooting}} started. The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney's creative director Simon Doonan and E!'s Robert Verdi, both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the BBC's Graham Norton also auditioned. Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris). Tucci claims he was unaware of this: [...] "All I know is that someone <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I realized this was a great part." [...] He based the character on various people he was acquainted with, insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore. Daniel Sunjata had originally read for Tucci's part, rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character, but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it. Simon Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself, wearing the same self-designed green jacket he has on when he and Andrea meet for the first time.|$|E
500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{told me that it was}} top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. American rock band Ween guest starred as themselves in [...] "Your Shoe's Untied". The band performed [...] "Loop de Loop", a song they written for the episode. Before SpongeBob SquarePants aired on television in 1999, Hillenburg had approached band guitarist Dean Ween to compose a song for the show. Dean Ween said [...] " [...] <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> told me [...] was a marine biologist who was starting a cartoon about underwater sea creatures and that The Mollusk was a big reference point for him creatively and would we {{like to do a}} song for the show." [...] The band conceived the song and wrote it in about three minutes. Ween's 1997 song [...] "Ocean Man" [...] would also be used four years later during the end credits sequence in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and as part of the film's soundtrack.
