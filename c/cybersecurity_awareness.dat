30|$|Representational fluency is an {{important}} aspect of deep conceptual understanding. It was mainly discussed in pedagogical literature about promoting the transfer between learning and the development of “expertise”. In our context of visual analytics, we borrowed this concept to describe how to let the analyst better comprehending the multiple visualizations of “when, where, and what” for <b>cybersecurity</b> situational <b>awareness.</b> Representational fluency is more skillfulness than skill [[12]]. Skillfulness connotes continuous adaptation and dynamism along with the ability to perform with facility, adeptness, and expertise. Skillfulness of representational fluency in visual analytics includes several capabilities, such as abstractly visualizing and conceptualizing transformation processes, qualifying quantitative data, working with patterns, and working with continuously changing qualities and trends. To achieve these goals, analysts should be supported with proper tools to interpret visualizations more efficiently.|$|R
25|$|In <b>cybersecurity,</b> {{consider}} situational <b>awareness,</b> for threat operations, {{is being}} able to perceive threat activity and vulnerability in context so that the following can be actively defended: data, information, knowledge, and wisdom from compromise. Situational awareness is achieved by developing and using solutions that often consume data and information from many different sources. Technology and algorithms are then used to apply knowledge and wisdom in order to discern patterns of behavior that point to possible, probable, and real threats.|$|R
40|$|Currently, perimeter-based {{approaches}} are {{the mainstay of}} cybersecurity. While this paradigm is necessary, there is mounting evidence of its insufficiency with respect to sophisticated and coordinated attacks. In contrast to perimeter-based security, mission-centric <b>cybersecurity</b> provides <b>awareness</b> of how attacks can influence mission success and therefore focuses resources for mitigating vulnerabilities and protecting critical assets. This is strategic as opposed to tactical perimeter-based cybersecurity. We propose MISSION AWARE, which assists {{in the identification of}} parts of a system that destabilize the overall mission of the system if compromised. MSSION AWARE starts with a structured elicitation process that leads to hazards analysis. It employs hierarchical modeling methods to capture mission requirements, admissible functional behaviors, and system architectures. It then generates evidence [...] -attacks applicable to elements that directly correlate with mission success. Finally, MISSION AWARE traces evidence back to mission requirements to determine the evidence with the highest impact relative to mission objectives...|$|R

40|$|Cybersecurity {{threats and}} {{vulnerabilities}} are causing substantial financial losses for governments and organizations {{all over the}} world. Intentional and unintentional users’ misuse of information systems (IS) resources represents 50 % to 75 % of cybersecurity threats. Computer Crime and Security Survey revealed that nearly 60 % of security breaches occurred from inside the organization by authorized users. Computer users are deemed {{as one of the}} weakest links in the IS security chain. In this study, we examined the effect of user computer self-efficacy (CSE), <b>cybersecurity</b> countermeasures <b>awareness</b> (CCA), and <b>cybersecurity</b> skills (CS) on users’ computer misuse intention (CMI) at a government agency. Our results show that the factor of users’ awareness of computer monitoring (UAC-M) and cybersecurity initiative skill (CIS) were significant contributors to CMI. UAC-M and CSE were significant contributors to cybersecurity computing skill (CCS). Users’ awareness of security policy (UAS-P) was a significant contributor to cybersecurity action skill (CAS). However, CSE had no direct influence on misuse behavior. We conclude the paper with discussion about the results along with suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Bhutan is {{becoming}} increasingly dependent on Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs), especially the Internet for performing the daily activities of governments, businesses, and individuals. Consequently, information systems and networks are becoming more exposed and vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. This paper highlights {{the findings of the}} survey study carried out to understand the perceptions of cybersecurity implementation among government organizations in Bhutan. About 280 ICT personnel were surveyed about the effectiveness of cybersecurity implementation in their organizations. A questionnaire based on a 5 point Likert scale was used to assess the perceptions of respondents. The questions were asked on cybersecurity practices such as <b>cybersecurity</b> policies, <b>awareness</b> and training, and risk management. The survey results show that less than 50 % of respondents believe that the cybersecurity implementation is effective: cybersecurity policy (40 %), risk management (23 %), training and awareness (28 %), system development life cycle (34 %); incident management (26 %), and communications and operational management (40 %). The findings suggest that many of the cybersecurity practices are inadequately implemented and therefore, there exist a gap in achieving a required cybersecurity posture. This study recommends government organizations to establish a comprehensive cybersecurity program with emphasis on cybersecurity policy, risk management, and awareness and training. In addition, the research study has practical implications to both government and private organizations for implementing and managing cybersecurity...|$|R
40|$|Situation {{awareness}} {{is often described}} as the perception and comprehension of the current situation, and the projection of future status. Whilst this may be well understood in an organisational cybersecurity context, there is a strong case to be made for effective <b>cybersecurity</b> situation <b>awareness</b> that is tailored {{to the needs of the}} Non-Expert User (NEU). Our online usage habits are rapidly evolving with smartphones and tablets being widely used to access resources online. In order for NEUs to remain safe online, there is a need to enhance awareness and understanding of cybersecurity concerns, such as how devices may be acting online, and what data is being shared between devices. In this paper, we extend our proposal of the Enhanced Personal Situation Awareness (ePSA) framework to consider the key details of cyber situation awareness that would be of concern to NEUs, and we consider how such information can be effectively conveyed using a visual analytic approach. We present the design of our visual analytics approach to show how this can represent the key details of cyber situation awareness whilst maintaining a simple and clean design scheme so as to not result in information-overload for the user. The guidance developed through the course of this work can help practitioners develop tools that could help NEUs better understand their online actions, with the aim of giving users greater control and safer experiences when their personal devices are acting online...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{exponential}} increase in the usage of the internet, particularly among students since the introduction of e-learning and Bring Your Own Device (BYO) initiatives into the education system. In New Zealand {{the percentage of the}} population using the internet is now 93. 8 % and this increase in internet usage has increased the risk of cybersecurity attacks This makes it necessary to provide awareness and education on cybersecurity to students who are potential targets for exploitation. However, to provide this awareness it is necessary to understand what their current knowledge on cybersecurity is which forms the basis of this paper. This paper presents the results of a survey conducted on internet usage and <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>awareness</b> among three age groups between 8 years and 21 years. A questionnaire consisting of various questions on internet usage and cybersecurity concepts was prepared. For this survey, we considered both computers (desktops & laptops) and mobile devices (tablets & smartphones). The results of the survey showed that <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>awareness</b> among the surveyed students was generally low with the lowest level in the 8 - 12 -year age group. The students of 8 - 12 age group were able to answer only 19 % of survey questions. Furthermore, most of the students were not familiar with common cybersecurity terms and did not demonstrate enough awareness of common threats such as phishing. The results further show {{that the majority of the}} students were not aware of cybersecurity tools for tablets and smartphones which are frequently used devices for BYOD. The key contribution of this paper is to emphasize the necessity to create <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>awareness</b> among students...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} examining attitudinal differences of Internet utilization and security {{with the objective}} of understanding the relationships that cyber usability have with cybercrime and then determine best practices needed to promote the secure use of the Internet. The research was designed as a quantitative study that used judgment sampling to survey 433 cases to explain the relationship that exists between cyber utilization and security. To achieve this objective, research questions and hypothesis were designed to guide the analysis. Cross tabulation analysis was used to compare the dependent and independent variables while Chi-square, Lambda and Gamma statistical tests were used to verify the relationship and identify statistical significance of the relationship. The findings revealed that while variables like being IT savvy, amount of financial loss, education, age, gender and residence location did not have evidence of a relationship with security, research participants had concern for secure cyber use and thought that <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>awareness</b> training and type of transaction conducted on the Internet were associated to security even though the strength of each relationship was weak. The study highlighted the damaging effects of cybercrime and recommended that cyber users should embrace best practice principles as they browse the Internet and utilize <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>awareness</b> training as an important function of secure IT utilization...|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} process on a spatiotemporal dataset often happens conditionally and in sequence [[21]]. At first the temporal aspect is analyzed, {{and then the}} spatial aspect, or vice versa. It is difficult to have a joint integral modeling approach. We have observed such sequential {{analysis process}}es in our own practice [[22]] while solving the VAST 2012 challenge MC 2 [[17]], and in other winning entries [[23],[24]] {{when they tried to}} solve the VAST 2013 challenge MC 3 [[25]]. Many times when looking for issues, the user first examined the temporal aspect by looking at the time series curves to find out the anomalies (e.g., huge peak in the curve), then checked out other detailed visualizations to allocate the affecting hosts (IP addresses). Sometimes the analysis starts with a detailed visualization, e.g., an IP address showing abnormal behavior. To understand the overall picture of the affected computers, the user will then need to examine the time series curves. Sometimes this process happens iteratively. The user starts from one visualization, then goes to others, returns to the first visualization with a different parameter (e.g. time or place), and goes on to gain comprehensive <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>awareness.</b> To investigate the detail, the analyst usually need to narrow down and even to read the raw data such as the log file.|$|E
