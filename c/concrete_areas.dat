The goals of feminist legal theory, as defined by leading theorist Claire Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be committed to. This is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to <b>concrete</b> <b>areas</b> of law.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015 {{part of the}} {{accommodation}} facilities at RAF Scampton underwent significant refurbishment, particularly those of Gibson Barracks. The improvements consisted of replacement of windows, refurbishment and repair of external <b>concrete</b> <b>areas</b> and provision of new escape stairs.The barracks had lain unused for over 20 years, {{and as a consequence}} of the neglect had fallen into a state of disrepair. The building was converted into teaching space in the 1980s, but with the subsequent lack of investment on the station the block was allowed to fall into disuse. Following a re-examination of the viability of the base undertaken following the closure of RAF Kirton in Lindsey and the resulting transfer of personnel, as well as the realisation by English Heritage of the importance of the structure and its association with the Dams Raid, it was decided to convert the block back to residential use. [...] Although the building is not a listed structure it is situated within a site of significant heritage value due to its links to Operation Chastise. The accommodation consists of 48 bedrooms with communal facilities.|$|E
5000|$|The first Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference of the Internet & Jurisdiction Policy Network {{took place}} on November 14-16, 2016 in Paris, France. It was institutionally {{supported}} by the OECD, the European Commission, UNESCO, the Council of Europe, the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and ICANN. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided its Ministerial Conference Center as the venue. It {{was the first time}} that more than 200 senior representatives from more than 40 countries from states, Internet companies, technical operators, civil society, academia and international organizations gathered to specifically address the issue of jurisdiction on the Internet. As The Economist reported: “If nothing is done, many who met the Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference in Paris worried, the open internet could be a thing of the past within a decade or two. What is needed, they said, is more international co-operation—but not of the old kind.” As an outcome, stakeholders identified <b>concrete</b> <b>areas</b> for cooperation to help the development of shared policy standards and frameworks for legal interoperability and due process across borders. The Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference firmly placed the topic of jurisdiction on the Internet governance agenda, as recommended in the 2014 NETmundial Roadmap for the Future Evolution of Internet Governance Ecosystem. The first Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference was recognized by the 2017 United Nations Secretary-General's Report [...] "Progress Made in the Implementation of and Follow-up to the Outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society at the Regional and International Levels", and the I&J Secretariat was invited to present outcomes to the G7 Cyber Group in March 2017 and the G20 Multistakeholder Conference on the Digital Future in April 2017. The second Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference is taking place on February 26-28, 2018 in Ottawa, Canada.|$|E
