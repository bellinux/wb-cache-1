5|$|The {{mission was}} {{reported}} as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1. The major {{concern with the}} weather was a major tropical storm in the Atlantic, though there were also worries over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> problem for recovery operations. On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E
25|$|The 9th Parachute Battalion {{took part}} in two major {{parachute}} landings in the Normandy invasion, and the River Rhine crossing in Germany. In Normandy they {{were responsible for the}} attack on the Merville Gun Battery, which, if not eliminated, <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> danger to the Normandy landings.|$|E

25|$|Coming {{into the}} three Test series against India {{predictions}} about how Steyn would fare were mixed, with some commentators identifying him {{a crucial part}} of a South African team which <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> serious challenge to India, whilst others predicted he might struggle playing against a strong batting lineup on lifeless subcontinent pitches.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, Scout {{and several}} of her sister ships participated in relief efforts in the Gulf of Mexico {{following}} Hurricane Katrina. The mine countermeasure ships spent weeks surveying waterways around the Louisiana coast and offshore oil platforms, using their high-tech sonar systems to locate sunken debris that <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> hazard to navigation.|$|E
25|$|No {{nuclear tests}} {{took place in}} Area26, the most arid section of the NNSS. An old {{abandoned}} mine, the Horn Silver Mine, was used for waste disposal between 1959 and the 1970s; some of the waste is radioactive. Water flow past the shaft <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> human health risk, so corrective action has been planned.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>an</b> unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|R
25|$|The NMFS {{suggested}} it {{would agree to}} the Namgis contract if the OOF provided a metal detector to screen the wild salmon for fish hooks which <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> danger to Springer. After OOF members pledged they would inspect the mouth of each fish for hooks prior to their placement into the seapen, the motion passed and the Namgis were contracted.|$|E
25|$|Marine Debris {{is defined}} as “any {{persistent}} solid material that is manufactured or processed and directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally, disposed of or abandoned into the marine environment or the Great Lakes”. This debris can injure or even kill marine organisms; it can also interfere with navigation safety and <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to human health. Marine debris can range from soda cans to plastic bags and can even include abandoned vessels or neglected fishing gear.|$|E
25|$|During the {{investigation}} {{there was a}} large media coverage of a dispute between the Swedish Airline Pilots Association (SPF) and the Swedish Air Traffic Controllers Association (SFTF). The former accused the F10 air traffic control for not following correct civil aviation procedures. SFTF responded by an official letter to the government questioning why the pilots were represented in the commission, as this <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> potential conflict of interest. Both parties were criticized for speculating about the cause of the accident before the conclusion of the commission.|$|E
50|$|An {{article in}} The New York Times {{discussed}} the possible threats for humanity of intentionally sending messages aimed at extraterrestrial {{life into the}} cosmos {{in the context of}} the SETI efforts. Several renowned public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have argued against sending such messages on the grounds that extraterrestrial civilizations are probably technologically far more advanced than humanity and <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>an</b> existential threat to humanity.|$|R
2500|$|The {{panel was}} briefed on U.S. {{military}} activities and intelligence; hence {{the report was}} originally classified Secret. Later declassified, the Robertson Panel's report concluded that UFOs were not {{a direct threat to}} national security, but <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>an</b> indirect threat by overwhelming standard military communications due to public interest in the subject. Most UFO reports, they concluded, could be explained as misidentification of mundane aerial objects, and the remaining minority could, in all likelihood, be similarly explained with further study.|$|R

25|$|The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB) has a {{long history}} of eruptions and poses a threat to the {{surrounding}} region. Any volcanic hazard ranging from landslides to eruptions <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> significant risk to humans and wildlife. Although Mount Meager has not erupted for more than 2,000years, it could produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would be quickly organized. Teams such as the Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions in Canada.|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of lore about fairies revolves around changelings, fairy children left {{in the place of}} stolen human babies. In particular, folklore describes how to prevent the fairies from stealing babies and substituting changelings, and abducting older people as well. The theme of the swapped child is common in medieval literature and reflects concern over infants thought to be afflicted with unexplained diseases, disorders, or developmental disabilities. In pre-industrial Europe, a peasant family's subsistence frequently depended upon the productive labor of each member, and a person who was a permanent drain on the family's scarce resources <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to the survival of the entire family.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and President Barack Obama {{announced}} that the United States would station troops in Australia {{for the first time}} since World War II. The agreement between the United States and Australia would involve a contingent of 250 Marines arriving in Darwin in 2012, with the total number rising to a maximum of 2,500 troops by 2017 on six-month rotations as well as a supporting air element including F-22 Raptors, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and KC-135 refuelers. China and Indonesia have expressed concern about the decision. Some analysts have argued that an expanded U.S. presence <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to security.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Russian Northern Sea Route and the Canadian Northwest Passage to {{commercial}} traffic <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>an</b> alternative to the canal in the long term. Warmer waters in the Arctic Ocean could open the passage for {{an increasing number of}} months each year, making it more attractive as a major shipping route. However, the passage through the Arctic would require significant investment in escort vessels and staging ports. The Canadian commercial marine transport industry does not anticipate that this route will be a viable alternative to the Panama Canal within the next 10 to 20 years.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>an</b> unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|R
2500|$|At low speeds, electric-drive cars {{produced}} less roadway {{noise as}} compared to vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and hybrids <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>an</b> unexpected hazard. Tests have shown {{that this is a}} valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below [...] for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.|$|R
25|$|Even {{before the}} Liberals' second electoral {{victory in the}} 1997 election, there was much {{speculation}} {{in the media and}} in Ottawa that Martin was after Chrétien's job and wanted to force the Prime Minister to retire. As the Liberals emerged with a smaller majority government after the 1997 election, though it was unlikely that any opposition party <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> serious challenge, Martin began to gain support from those who began to disagree with Chrétien. Chrétien, however, resolved to stay on after the Liberals were re-elected in 2000, having regained much of the ground lost in 1997. By this time, Martin had gained control of much of the party machinery.|$|E
25|$|After British and French {{forces had}} landed in and {{occupied}} the major {{port city of}} Duala in September 1914, the German garrison that had once protected it retreated inland. One group withdrew along the northern rail line to Dschang, while another traveled up the Wuri River to Jabassi. The largest group which included Kamerun's governor, Karl Ebermaier and commandant, Major Zimmermann, had moved southeast along the southern railway line {{to the village of}} Edea. During their retreat, German forces damaged or destroyed much of the railway. General Dobell, the British commander at Duala feared that the German forces that had retreated <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to his new acquisitions, prompting attacks on Jabassi and Edea in October 1914.|$|E
25|$|As {{is common}} {{with other members}} of the family Theridiidae, S. grossa {{constructs}} a cobweb, i.e. an irregular tangle of sticky silken fibers. As with other web weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend mostly on vibrations reaching them through their webs to orient themselves to prey or warn them of larger animals that <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> danger. They are not aggressive, and most injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets unintentionally squeezed or pinched. It is possible that some bites may result when a spider mistakes a finger thrust into its web for its normal prey, but ordinarily intrusion by any large creature will cause these spiders to flee.|$|E

25|$|On 27 January, 2008 {{information}} about the orbital decay of USA-193 {{was given to the}} media. Several of the initial reports projected that the satellite would return to earth sometime in late February, early March. Additionally, these reports suggested that likely no action would need to be taken as the satellite or any debris would have a small chance of hitting any inhabited area. However, White House National Security Council spokesmen Gordon Johndroe, did mention that the U.S. government was monitoring the satellite’s decay and that it was examining different options to “mitigate any damage”. Also, four anonymous U.S. Officials did report that the satellite, which never became operational, would have toxic rocket fuel (hydrazine fuel) that <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> danger if the tank did not explode on re-entry.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 {{provided}} an opportunity to improve a highly contaminated area known as the Homebush Bay site. A study commissioned by the New South Wales Government Olympic Coordination Authority, which {{was responsible for the}} Games’ site preparation, looked at soil contamination prior to the Games. The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney’s winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the “greenest” single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Public {{activities}} such as main roads, traffic control, public transport, policing, education, and major infrastructure projects are controlled by the New South Wales Government. It has tended to resist attempts to amalgamate Sydney's more populated local government areas as merged councils <b>could</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to its governmental power. Established in 1842, the City of Sydney is one such local government area and includes the central business district and some adjoining inner suburbs. It is responsible for fostering development in the local area, providing local services (waste collection and recycling, libraries, parks, sporting facilities), representing and promoting the interests of residents, supporting organisations that target the local community, and attracting and providing infrastructure for commerce, tourism, and industry. The City of Sydney is led by an elected Council and Lord Mayor who {{has in the past}} been treated {{as a representative of the}} entire city.|$|E
