5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are <b>computer</b> <b>controlled.</b> For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation [51075343]; Fundamental Research Funds of Xiamen University [201212 G 011]The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} corrective characteristics of {{three kinds of}} polishing methods for mid-frequency errors was studied, which was aimed to confirm the possibility that <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap can be replaced by bonnet polishing in the machining process. The {{first step was to}} calculate the removal functions of three kinds of polishing technologies and use fast Fourier transform to figure out the frequency spectrum of each method. After that, according to the frequency spectra, curves of cut-off frequencies related to the working ranges of spatial frequencies errors were obtained. It revealed that the affected scope of spatial frequencies is determined by the polishing method, diameter size of polishing tool and shape of removal function. Moreover, only low-frequency errors could be modified and mid-frequency errors could not be corrected or created by <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap, and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing can correct part of the mid-frequency errors and low-frequency errors in the polishing process, {{but at the same time}} can produce some new mid-frequency errors; as for bonnet polishing, it can be <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap-like in smoothing which only modified and created the low-frequency errors or <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing-like which corrected and created the mid-frequency errors in local polishing. Otherwise, the efficiency of bonnet polishing is higher than the other two methods. As a result, seen from the point of correction ability of mid-frequency or polishing efficiency, bonnet polishing could replace <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing for finishing two polishing stages by only one tool, which is significant to extending the application of bonnet polishing in optical manufacturing...|$|R

50|$|Data General Corp. v. Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls,</b> Inc. was a 1971 case {{in which}} the Delaware Court of Chancery {{determined}} that widespread, confidential disclosure of trade secrets does not necessarily compromise their secrecy. Data General Corporation distributed design documentation with its Nova 1200 minicomputer, notifying owners of the confidentiality of these design drawings through contractual agreements and explicit text on the drawings (essentially a shrinkwrap license). After acquiring drawings with a Nova 1200 purchase, Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> designed its own nearly identical minicomputer. Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> maintained that its use of the documentation was proper because Data General Corporation inadequately maintained the secrecy of the design drawings by distributing them to many customers. The court found that Data General Corporation had sufficiently protected the secrecy of the drawings and that Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> was thus in violation of trade secret law for improperly using confidential information.|$|R
