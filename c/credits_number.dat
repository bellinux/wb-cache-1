40|$|Abstract. Theft of stored {{credit card}} {{information}} {{is an increasing}} threat to e-commerce. We propose a dynamic virtual <b>credit</b> card <b>number</b> scheme that reduces {{the damage caused by}} stolen <b>credit</b> card <b>numbers.</b> A user can use an existing credit card account to generate multiple virtual <b>credit</b> card <b>numbers</b> that are either usable for a single transaction or are tied with a particular merchant. We call the scheme dynamic because the virtual <b>credit</b> card <b>numbers</b> can be generated without online contact with the credit card issuers. These numbers can be processed without changing any of the infrastructure currently in place; the only changes will be at the end points, namely, the card users and the card issuers. We analyze the security requirements for dynamic virtual <b>credit</b> card <b>numbers,</b> discuss the design space, propose a scheme using HMAC, and prove its security under the assumption that HMAC is a PRF. Key words: e-commerce, credit card theft...|$|R
