Understory vegetation was removed from both stands using mechanical harvest and herbicide application in late July and early August 2002. Ikonos data was acquired both prior and subsequent to understory removal and were evaluated for NDVI response. Total vegetative biomass removed under the canopies was estimated using the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument combined with digital hemispherical photography (DHP).

The North Carolina site results showed a smaller percentage of reduced understory LAI detected by the Ikonos sensor (1. 8 percent) when compared to the actual LAI reduction as measured in situ (17. 4 percent).

On early 1945 the demand for the development of photogrammetric products – photomaps – reported six ministries, including the Ministry of Forestry. Forest applications of photogrammetry were developed by workers employed in Forest Research Institute – Gieruszyński (1948) and Stanecki (1951) published first books concerning the use of aerial photographs for measuring and determining the forest characteristics and estimation of wood volume. Aerial photographs found wide use in forestry from {{the second half of the}} 1950 s, but after 1970 a decline of interest in the use of photogrammetry is to be noticed. The need for a broader use of photogrammetry in forestry pointed the authors of many studies appearing in the scientific literature. In the seventies, research related to the use of simple photogrammetry methods and tools to determine the selected characteristucs of forest stands. There was big interest in methods of determining the amount of trees within stands, their height, <b>crowns</b> <b>closure,</b> and species composition.

Outside Japan, several studies that addressed the effects of thinning on understory vegetation have been conducted in young plantations where thinning was implemented to increase food biomass for deer that would be hunted (Sullivan et al. 2007, 2010; Cole et al. 2010).

40|$|The {{storage of}} beer in plastic bottles is problematical {{because of the}} bad barrier quality of {{plastics}} against oxygen or carbon dioxide. The author looks for possibilities to store up beer in plastic bottles {{with respect to a}} high imperishability. The permeation quality of different plastic bottles with respect to oxygen and carbon dioxide is investigated using different plastic materials such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene naphthalate) or composits of both with ethylene vinyl alcohol or polyamide. Furthermore, different <b>closures</b> such as <b>crown</b> cork <b>closure,</b> a single plastic screw cap or a plastic screw cap with a sealing. The permeation of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the plastic bottle is investigated by different methods. Oxygen content is measured electrolytically and by means of the determination of sulfur dioxide content. The loss of carbon dioxide in the bottled beer is measured using the method of Blom/Lund. The entrance of oxygen into the plastics bottle depends on the medium inside the bottle. The permeation of oxygen is reduced {{in the case of a}} gas mixture. After a certain storage duration, a certain equilibrium concentration of oxygen in the beer is existent. The value of this equilibrium concentration depends on gas permeability of the plastics bottles and the rate of reaction of oxygen with the beer components. The oxygen concentration existing ultimatively after the bottling only influences the time duration according to the development of the equilibrium concentration. There is a mutual superimposition of different influences of the aging of beer such as temperature, entrance of oxygen and time. The aging of beer only on the basis of oxygen entrance can be studied. The titrimetrical measurement of the loss of carbon dioxide during the storage is the best measuring technique. Due to the limited passage of gas, different closures positively influence the imperishability of beer. In order to realize migration experiments, clear bottles of the type PENg (poly(ethylene naphthalate) and Pils from Weihenstephaner Staatsbrauerei (Weihenstephan, Germany)) as a beer are used. Due to the migration of the aging components into the wall of the plastic bottle, the taste stability of the beer does not alter after a new filling of the bottle with beer. The endangering of the stability of the bottles can be minimized by suitable chemicals such as chain lubricants and cleaning agents. The stability of the plastic bottles can be minimized by suitable chemicals such as chain lubricants and cleaning agents. The stability of the plastic bottles depends on its material and procedure. Sulfuric dioxide is suitable to improve the imperishability of the beer while ferulic acid and (+) -catechol as antioxidizer make the beer clouder. The imperishability of beer in gastight multilayer plastic bottles with scavenger closures is comparable to that in glass bottles.

30|$|The {{results from}} this trial suggest that species {{selection}} and mix, planting density, and age of plantings are key factors in ensuring a successful erosion mitigation outcome for areas of land identified as erosion-prone and marginal for pastoral production but ideally suited for conversion to indigenous shrubland. Options that promote full soil-root reinforcement the quickest {{are likely to be}} the most effective in enhancing slope stability (Phillips et al. 2001). The mechanical reinforcement of soil by roots (Watson et al. 1999) improves land stability, but it is also the means by which trees extract moisture from the soil to reduce pore-water pressures (Ekanayake et al. 1997). However, the role of the tree canopy through the processes of interception (Kelliher et al. 1992) and transpiration (Pearce et al. 1987) also plays a significant role in lessening the initiation of shallow slope failures. It is clear from the published literature that a relationship exists between rainfall intensity/duration, landslide density, and vegetation type and maturity (Selby 1976, Salter et al. 1983) even though the magnitude of interception loss as a percentage of rainfall during extreme rainfall events is small (Blake 1965; Rowe et al. 1999; Aldridge and Jackson 1968, 1973; Jackson and Aldridge 1973). Indeed, the occurrence of landslides initiated during a major storm (Cyclone Bola in 1988) was considerably less in areas of well-established naturally regenerating shrubland and indigenous forest compared to adjacent pastoral hill country, and damage was greatest in areas that received the most rainfall (Marden et al. 1995). Furthermore, while seral vegetation during the initial years after establishment would afford little protection against the initiation of landslides {{in the event of a}} major storm, the reduction in storm-initiated slope failures was shown to be significant once canopy closure had been attained (Marden and Rowan 1993). Thus, the combined benefits of soil-root reinforcement and hydrological influences become most effective when full root occupancy (lateral roots of adjacent trees overlap) and canopy <b>closure</b> (<b>crowns</b> of individual trees touch) first occur (Kelliher et al. 1992).|$|R
40|$|Crown {{architecture}} affects {{tree growth}} through {{the control of}} leaf area and its display. Yet the linkages between crown structure, leaf traits, and productivity of elite selections of forest trees and responses to intensive silviculture are not fully understood. It was hypothesized that trees with crown and leaf traits governing efficient light capture and photosynthesis at the canopy scale {{would be the most}} productive. To this end, families of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii) were grown at three experimental sites in the West Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas and Louisiana under two silvicultural treatments, including repeated fertilization with control of competing vegetation (HI), and a control (C) consisting of fertilization at planting. Families and species differed in crown traits and aboveground productivity, and genotype differences increased throughout the first 5 years of stand development. Crown shape was important for light interception and growth initially, but at the onset of canopy <b>closure,</b> <b>crown</b> size, stand leaf area and its distribution within crowns affected canopy light interception and tree growth. Among all families and treatments, aboveground biomass productivity was positively related to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and canopy photosynthesis. Light-use efficiency (?) varied from 0. 41 to 0. 56 g MJ- 1 among families and was lowest in slash pine. Variability in aboveground biomass growth was related more to stand leaf area and APAR than to differences in light-use efficiency in these young stands. Leaf physiological, chemical and morphological attributes changed within crowns in accordance with developing light availability gradients. Physiological attributes, such as net photosynthesis, were better predictors of family performance when integrated at the canopy level than leaf level in the examined pine species. Crown size, light absorption, and aboveground growth generally ranked higher in the HI treatment than in the control, although the effects of the intensive silvicultural treatments did not differ statistically. Family performance was independent of treatment. Crown and canopy attributes, such as high leaf area index and large crowns with low leaf area density per crown volume, may be useful in the selection of highly productive genotypes of loblolly and slash pine under intensive silviculture...|$|R

Indeed, LiDAR data have been shown to provide accurate estimates to forest structural parameters and measures of higher trophic levels (e. g., avian abundance and diversity). However, links between forest structure and tree function have not been evaluated using LiDAR. This study was designed and scaled to assess the relationship of LiDAR to multiple aspects of forest structure and higher trophic levels (arthropod and bird populations), which included the ground-based collection of percent <b>crown</b> and understory <b>closure,</b> as well as arthropod and avian abundance and diversity data. Additional plot-based measures were added to assess the relationship of LiDAR to forest health and productivity. High-resolution discrete-return LiDAR data (flown summer of 2009) were acquired for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA. LiDAR data were classified into four canopy structural categories: 1) high crown and high understory <b>closure,</b> 2) high <b>crown</b> and low understory <b>closure,</b> 3) low <b>crown</b> and high understory closure, and 4) low crown and low understory closure. Nearby plots from each of the four LiDAR categories were grouped into 2 ̆ 2 blocks 2 ̆ 2 to assess the spatial consistency of data. Ground-based measures of forest canopy structure, site, stand and individual tree measures were collected on nine 50 m-plots from each LiDAR category (36 plots total), during summer of 2012. Analysis of variance was used to assess the relationships between LiDAR and a suite of tree function measures. Our results show the novel ability of LiDAR to assess forest health and productivity at the stand and individual tree level. We found significant correspondence between LiDAR categories and our ground-based measures of tree function, including xylem increment growth, foliar nutrition, crown health, and stand mortality. Furthermore, we found consistent reductions in xylem increment growth, decreases in foliar nutrition and crown health, and increases in stand mortality related to high understory closure. This suggests that LiDAR measures can reflect competitive interactions, not just among overstory trees for light, but also interactions between overstory trees and understory vegetation for resources other than light (e. g., nutrients).
