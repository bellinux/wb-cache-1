We established a novel assay method using gene-gun delivery of partially deleted promoters to string-containing vascular bundles excised from the petiole of Brassica napus for the rapid identifi cation of cis-elements. To test this system, we analyzed the Arabidopsis METALLOTHIONEIN 2 B (MT 2 B) gene, which is expressed in <b>companion</b> <b>cells.</b> The assay revealed a 49 -bp region possessing two predicted cis-regulatory elements: a G-box and an evening element-related sequence (EEr), and EEr showed higher activity. We confi rmed the reliability of the result with stable transformants harboring a deleted MT 2 B promoter: GUS transgene. The lack of EEr completely eliminated the MT 2 B-like expression, but the lack of G-box did not eliminate it. We conclude that EEr is a major cis-regulatory element of the MT 2 B promoter.

In plant, sucrose transporter proteins {{play a vital}} role in driving fluid flow through the phloem by generating chemical potential. In this study, we investigate these nanoscale phenomena of protein directed active transport in a microscale biologi-cal system. We presented a mathematical model for protein facilitated sucrose loading considering six different states of the sucrose transporter protein. In addition, we devel-oped a quasi-one dimensional transport model to study protein facilitated pumping mech-anisms in plant phloem. Here we specifically study the influence of transporter protein reaction rates, apoplast proton concentration, membrane electrical potential, and cell membrane hydraulic permeability on flow through the phloem. This study reveals that increasing <b>companion</b> <b>cell</b> side deprotonation rate significantly enhances the sieve tube sugar concentrations, which results in much higher water transport. Lower apoplast pH increases the transport rate, but the flow control is less noticeable for a pH less than 5. A more negative membrane electrical potential difference will significantly accelerate the transporter proteins ’ ability to pump water and nutrients. Higher <b>companion</b> <b>cell</b> and sieve element membrane hydraulic permeability also promotes flows through the phloem; however, the flow difference is less noticeable at higher permeabilities when near typical plant cell membrane ranges.

40|$|A major {{question}} in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of cell types. This {{is in the}} context of constraints imposed by networks of cell walls that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element cell walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM 26, binds to the cell wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis thaliana, Miscanthus x giganteus and notably sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of sucrose. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM 26 epitope has been identified as a β- 1, 6 -galactosyl substitution of β- 1, 4 -galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic bulbs in which the LM 26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell walls including those of phloem cells. Garlic bulb cell wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM 26 epitope with cell wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM 26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM 5 linear β- 1, 4 -galactan epitope which is detected only in <b>companion</b> <b>cell</b> walls.

40|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} higher {{plants such as}} Arabidopsis thaliana is the sophisticated vascular transport system throughout the entire plant organism. This vascular system consists of two conducting tissues, xylem and phloem.

Closely associated with the sieve elements are the <b>companion</b> <b>cells,</b> which derive from the same precursor cells. The vasculature of higher plants – phloem, xylem, and procambium – derives from a discrete population of stem cells, the vascular meristem. Sieve elements (SE), also known as sieve tube elements, form the conductive part of the phloem.

40|$|In higher plants, {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} proton pump (H(+) -ATPase) is encoded by a surprisingly large multigene family {{whose members are}} expressed in different tissues. Using an 18 -amino acid epitope tag derived from the animal oncogene c-Myc, we have performed immunocytolocalization measurements of the protein expressed by one member of this family, AHA 3 (Arabidopsis H(+) -ATPase isoform 3). Immunofluorescence studies with tissue sections of transgenic plants have revealed that c-Myc-tagged AHA 3 is restricted to the plasma membrane of phloem companion cells, whereas other AHA isoproteins are more widely distributed in the plasma membrane of other cell types. Electron microscopy with immunogold-labeled tissue sections {{suggests that there is}} a high concentration of proton pumps in the plasma membrane of companion cells but a much lower concentration in the plasma membrane of sieve elements. Due to plasmodesmata connecting the plasma membrane of these two adjacent cell types, {{it is likely that the}} proton motive force generated by the proton pump in companion cells can serve to power the uptake of sugar by proton-coupled symporters in either the <b>companion</b> <b>cell</b> or sieve element cell. The abundance of the proton pump in the plasma membrane of companion cells supports an apoplastic model for phloem loading in which the metabolic energy that drives sugar uptake is consumed by AHA 3 at the <b>companion</b> <b>cell</b> plasma membrane. These experiments with a genetically altered integral plasma membrane protein demonstrate the utility of using a short c-Myc sequence as an epitope tag in Arabidopsis.

From this syncytial complex of modified root cells, both fluorescent and radioactive labels were withdrawn by feeding nematodes. Movement of CF was unidirectional from the phloem to the syncytium. A range of low-molecular-weight fluorescent probes (including CF) microinjected into the syncytium stayed in this structure, demonstrating that it is symplastically isolated from the surrounding root tissue.

The benzylisoquinoline alkaloids of opium poppy accumulate in the cytoplasm, or latex, of specialized laticifers that accompany vascular tissues throughout the plant.

[14 C]sucrose accumulation was prevented by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, an inhibitor of sucrose-proton cotransport from the apoplast. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid largely, but not entirely, inhibited exudation of radiolabeled photoassimilate.

40|$|SummarySeveral {{endogenous}} {{and environmental}} factors need to be integrated to time the onset of flowering [1 – 3]. Genetic and molecular analyses, primarily in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, have shown that CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play central roles in photoperiod-dependent flowering [4 – 13]. The overall picture is that CO acts in the phloem <b>companion</b> <b>cells</b> of leaves and that its main effect is to induce FT mRNA in these cells [11, 12, 14 – 19]. Surprisingly, FT, a small globular protein of 20 kDa, interacts at the shoot apex with the bZIP transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) to induce downstream targets [17, 18]. Given that green fluorescent protein (GFP), which as a monomer is 27 kDa, can be easily exported to sink tissue including flowers when expressed in phloem <b>companion</b> <b>cells,</b> the latter finding strongly implied that FT protein is the mobile floral-inductive signal [17 – 19]. In agreement with this hypothesis, an FT-GFP fusion, just like GFP, can be exported from the phloem of both rice and Arabidopsis[20, 21]. It has been unknown, however, whether mobile FT protein is sufficient for transmitting the flowering signal. Here we show that FT mRNA is required in phloem <b>companion</b> <b>cells</b> where it acts partially redundant with its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) to induce flowering. Furthermore, we have devised a method that uncouples FT mRNA and protein effects in vivo.

On the other hand, no increases were observed in tubulin levels as quantitated by a colchicine-binding assay. The lack of change in tubulin concentration was accounted for by a 2 -fold increase in the rate of degradation that is compensated by a similar increase in the rate of synthesis. The consequence of such changes in both transformed cell types is a 2 -fold increase in the calmodulin-to-tubulin protein ratio relative to that in their nontransformed counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Macromolecular {{trafficking}} {{within the}} sieve element–companion cell complex, phloem unloading, and post-phloem transport were studied using the jellyfish {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP). The GFP gene was expressed in Arabidopsis and tobacco {{under the control of}} the AtSUC 2 promoter. In wild-type Arabidopsis plants, this promoter regulates expression of the companion cell–specific AtSUC 2 sucrose–H � symporter gene. Analyses of the AtSUC 2 promoter–GFP plants demonstrated that the 27 -kD GFP protein can traffic through plasmodesmata from companion cells into sieve elements and migrate within the phloem. With the stream of assimilates, the GFP is partitioned between different sinks, such as petals, root tips, anthers, funiculi, or young rosette leaves. Eventually, the GFP can be unloaded symplastically from the phloem into sink tissues, such as the seed coat, the anther connective tissue, cells of the root tip, and sink leaf mesophyll cells. In all of these tissues, the GFP can traffic cell to cell by symplastic post-phloem transport. The presented data show that plasmodesmata of the sieve element–companion cell complex, as well as plasmodesmata into and within the analyzed sinks, allow trafficking of the 27 -kD nonphloem GFP protein. The data also show that the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata can change during organ development.

The present work aims to identify how Mg deficiency alters carbon partitioning in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) plants. Fresh biomass, Mg and sugar contents were followed in diverse organs over 20 days under Mg-sufficient and Mg-deficient conditions. At the end of the treatment, the aerial biomass, but not the root biomass, of Mg-deficient plants was lower compared to control plants. A clear inverse relationship between Mg and sugar contents in leaves was found. Mg deficiency promoted a marked increase in sucrose and starch accumulation in the uppermost expanded leaves, which also had the lowest content of Mg among all the leaves of the rosette. The oldest leaves maintained a higher Mg content. [14 C]Sucrose labelling showed that sucrose export from the uppermost expanded leaves was inhibited. In contrast, sucrose export from the oldest leaves, which are close to, and export mainly to, the roots, was not restricted. In response to Mg deficiency, the BvSUT 1 gene encoding a <b>companion</b> <b>cell</b> sucrose/H+ symporter was induced in the uppermost expanded leaves, but without further enhancement of sucrose loading into the phloem.
