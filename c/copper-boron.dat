40|$|The paper {{analyses}} afresh {{the data}} of Russell and Hastings on the changes in lattice parameter during post-irradiation annealing of <b>copper-boron</b> alloy in the temperature range 823 - 923 K. The changes in lattice parameter are {{brought about by the}} generation of helium during irradiation through (n, α) reaction and its subsequent behavior during annealing. The new analytical procedure adopted here follows chemical kinetics route to determine the appropriate activation energies associated with the rate processes controlling the changes in lattice parameter. During the first stage of annealing, the lattice parameter decreases to a value which is below the equilibrium one. The second stage involves the recovery of lattice parameter to the equilibrium value. The diffusion of monovacancy and the jump of helium atom to a vacancy on its nearest neighbor site are identified as the unit processes for the first and second stages of annealing respectively. Finally, it is suggested that a helium–monovacancy complex may act as nucleus for the formation of helium gas bubbles...|$|E

EdgarPure boron {{exists in}} two main polymorphs, the common β-rhombohedral boron and the {{relatively}} rare α-rhombohedral boron. α-rhombohedral boron (α-B) possesses several extraordinary properties: self-healing from radiation damage and a high hole mobility. In addition, the [superscript] 10 B isotope has a large thermal neutron capture cross section. Such properties make it an excellent candidate for novel electronic device, such as direct energy conversion devices (alphacells and betacells) and neutron detectors. However, research on the properties and applications of α-B has been limited due to the difficulty to produce high quality α-B crystals of significant size. The preparation of α-rhombohedral boron is challenging for several reasons: first, α-rhombohedral boron has a low thermodynamic stability; it is only stable below 1100 °C, at higher temperature β-rhombohedral boron is the stable polymorph. In addition, at elevated temperatures, boron is highly reactive, which make {{it is difficult to}} produce pure boron crystals. The primary goal of this research was to produce high quality α-B crystals of significant size. The main focus {{of this study was to}} explore the feasibility of producing α-B from a copper flux. Copper is a promising solvent for α-B crystal growth: the eutectic temperature of <b>copper-boron</b> is low, 996 °C, and the phase diagram of <b>copper-boron</b> is relatively simple, and there are not many intermediate boride-copper compounds. In addition, copper is easily removed from crystals by etching with concentrated nitric acid. Last but not least, copper is less expensive than other metal solvents such as platinum. Boron crystal growth from a platinum solvent and vapor-liquid-solid growth by chemical vapor deposition were also performed for comparison. A series of crystals were grown over a range of initial boron concentrations (9. 9 to 27. 7 mole %) and cooling rates. Small irregular-shaped black crystals (> 100 μm) and well-faceted red crystals in various shapes, as large as 500 microns were produced. The crystals were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between experiment results and experimental parameters (source materials, the purity of growth atmosphere, and crucible materials, etc.) are reported. Suggestions about further investigation for α-B crystal growth are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Changes which {{occur in}} the lattice {{parameter}} of a neutron irradiated <b>copper-boron</b> alloy {{during the early stages}} of annealing, have been measured. After irradiation at 100 ° C, the lattice parameter is larger than that of the unirradiated alloy. During annealing, the lattice parameter decreases until it becomes smaller than that of the unirradiated alloy, and then increases. After complete annealing, the lattice parameter is equal to that of the original untreated alloy. Initially the helium atoms, which are formed by an (n, α) reaction from B 10, occupy interstitial positions. During annealing, each helium atom captures two vacancies and enters substitutional solution, before migrating to form gas bubbles. This process causes the lattice to contract. As bubbles form, helium leaves solution and the concentration of heliumvacancy complexes is reduced. There is a corresponding expansion of the lattice parameter. The activation energy for the first stage is 0. 76 ± 0. 1 eV. The activation energy for the second stage is 0. 96 ± 0. 1 eV, which is possibly the energy required to move a helium atom-vacancy complex through the lattice...|$|E
