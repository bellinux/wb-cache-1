5|$|The {{disappearance}} of <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> {{became a national}} topic {{of the news media}} in the summer of 2001, with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy's parents from the moment they decided to go to Washington, D.C. in search of their daughter. According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E

Police questioned Condit twice, and both times he denied having an affair with her; however, Levy's aunt eventually went public with conversations she had with her about their relationship. Police questioned Condit a third time, and he confessed to the relationship. When the affair began, Condit was 53 and Levy was 23.|$|E

500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not going to respond to that question out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E
500|$|Levy's {{death has}} had a lasting impact, {{due in part to}} the efforts of her family and friends. Levy's {{disappearance}} came after a number of other high-profile cases that led to the creation of resources for missing young adults. For example, Levy's parents quickly turned for help to the Carole Sund/Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation, a nonprofit group that was established in Modesto after three female hikers disappeared from a 1999 trip to Yosemite National Park and were later found slain. That foundation, which offered the Levys staff support and contributed towards a cash reward for information about Chandra's disappearance, was merged into the Laci & Conner Search and Rescue Fund in 2009; Susan Levy had previously participated in the efforts to find Laci Peterson, another missing woman from Modesto. In 1997, when Kristen Modafferi mysteriously disappeared from the San Francisco Bay Area just three weeks after her 18th birthday, her parents turned to their congresswoman for help they were ineligible to receive from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. As a result, Congress enacted [...] "Kristen's Law" [...] in October 2000, which established the National Center for Missing Adults (NCMA) within the U.S. Department of Justice to coordinate such missing person cases. By the time Levy disappeared, institutions were in place to provide her family with support and to assist in a nationwide search to locate her. Although the Levy family moved quickly to mobilize all such available resources, including offering a cash reward for information, hiring their own investigators, and seeking media attention, those efforts to locate <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> or find her killer were overshadowed by the speculation surrounding her possible relationship with Condit. Susan Levy later joined with Donna Raley, the mother of another young woman who disappeared in 1999 from Modesto, to form [...] "Wings of Protection", a support group for people with missing loved ones. The Mary Ann Liebert company, publishers of the Journal of Women's Health and Gender-Based Medicine, presented their annual Criterion Award in May 2002 to Susan Levy for her work with [...] "Wings of Protection".|$|E
2500|$|However, on June 4, 2015, D.C. Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher {{granted a}} motion for the retrial of Guandique {{after it was}} {{revealed}} that the sole witness against him, a jailhouse snitch named Armando Morales, had lied about prior jailhouse testimony. Prosecutors dropped all charges against Guandique on July 28, 2016 after an associate of Morales came forward with secret recordings in which he admitted to falsifying testimony about the murder of <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy.</b> [...] The murder of <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> therefore remains unsolved.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Chung {{made the}} jump to ABC News as a {{reporter}} on 20/20, and co-host of the Monday edition of the program alongside Charles Gibson. [...] In 2001, she conducted an interview with Gary Condit on Primetime Thursday, focusing on his relationship with murdered Washington, D.C. intern <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In July 2006, Condit {{sued the}} Sonoran News, a free weekly circular, for {{defamation}} of character, {{after the publication}} wrote [...] "that Condit was the 'main focus in the <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> case in 2001, after lying to investigators about his affair with Levy.'" [...] The case was dismissed in July 2007 when the judge ruled that Condit had not proved the statement was false, or that the paper had published it with malice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, {{during the}} Monica Lewinsky scandal, Condit {{publicly}} demanded that Clinton [...] "come clean" [...] on {{his relationship with}} the young woman; a video of this demand was aired almost daily during Condit's own scandal involving a relationship with intern <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy.</b> [...] Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, interest in the Levy case declined. [...] Condit kept his seat on the Intelligence Committee, retained his security clearance, and was one of a small number of members of Congress who were cleared to see the most sensitive information on the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
2500|$|Chung's {{interviews}} were largely gentle, but often they were punctuated by a rapid-fire barrage of sharp questions. Despite this, her {{interviews were}} still {{widely recognized as}} being decidedly softer than those of other interviewers, such as Barbara Walters or Mike Wallace. Consequently, her interviews were often used as a public relations move by those looking to overcome scandal or controversy. Some of her more famous interview subjects include Claus von Bülow and U.S. Representative Gary Condit, whom Chung interviewed first after the <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> disappearance. Chung was the first journalist to interview basketball legend Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson after he went public about being HIV-positive.|$|E
2500|$|Condit gained {{significant}} {{national attention}} for an extramarital affair with intern <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy,</b> which was exposed after Levy's disappearance in May 2001. Condit was not candid and forthcoming with investigators {{about his relationship}} with Levy, bringing him considerable negative attention and speculation that he was somehow involved in her murder. [...] Condit lost the 2002 Democratic primary based in large part on negative publicity from the scandal. [...] Prosecutors later convicted an illegal immigrant and Mara Salvatrucha member, Ingmar Guandique, who had committed other assaults with similar characteristics. [...] However, lacking physical evidence, the verdict was overturned and charges subsequently dropped by Washington D.C. prosecutors after the testimony of a jailhouse informant was determined to be unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|She {{has been}} an anchor and {{reporter}} for the U.S. television news networks NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, and MSNBC. Some of her more famous interview subjects include Claus von Bülow and U.S. Representative Gary Condit, whom Chung interviewed first after the <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy</b> disappearance, and basketball legend Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson after he went public about being HIV-positive. In 1993, she became only the second female to co-anchor a network newscast as part of CBS Evening News. [...] She was removed in 1995 as CBS Evening News co-anchor after a controversial interview with a fireman, during rescue efforts at the Oklahoma City bombing, which seemed inappropriately combative, and her interview tactics to get Newt Gingrich's mother to admit her unguarded thoughts about Hillary Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|While Condit was {{not named}} as an {{official}} suspect in the disappearance, Levy's family suspected that Condit was withholding important information about her disappearance. Public interest was high, and Condit's reputation suffered from the contrast between his [...] "pro-family" [...] politics, adultery with a woman younger than his daughter, and his attempts to mislead the police regarding his relationship with her. In July, two months after Levy vanished, Condit agreed to let investigators search his apartment and, hours before the search, police said he was spotted throwing out a gift box he had received from another woman into a dumpster in one of Washington's Virginia suburbs. This followed news reports that Condit had {{had an affair with}} a flight attendant. [...] Because of the Levy scandal, Condit was portrayed on an episode of South Park, where he was considered responsible for the disappearance of <b>Chandra</b> <b>Levy.</b>|$|E
