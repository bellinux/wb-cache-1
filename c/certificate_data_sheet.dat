50|$|Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC): A {{specific}} {{chord line}} of a tapered wing. At the mean aerodynamic chord, the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does {{on the rest of}} the wing. The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions. On some aircraft, the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC. In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time. This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the aircraft's flight manual and also on the aircraft's type <b>certificate</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet.</b> If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge mean aerodynamic chord) and a TeMAC (trailing edge mean aerodynamic chord) are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line) then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.|$|E

Flight data {{collected}} by various P 2 V and P 3 A air tankers in actual operation over several seasons {{have been used to}} construct statistical information on aircraft usage and maneuver load spectra in this role. The data used for this report consist of 5316 flight files, collected during the 2008 and 2009 fire seasons. Flights have been divided into multiple phases, separating the segments when retardant is dropped from others. Basic flight parameters such as airspeed, altitude, flight duration and distance, bank, and pitch angles are shown in statistical form. Vertical accelerations are used to construct V - n diagrams for comparison with the manufacturers' data. Airframe cycle tunes are shown to be approximately 45 min. Several coincident flight events are shown and compared with operational limits when available. The altitudes, the normal accelerations, and the airspeeds have not revealed any operation outside of the established boundaries. Relatively large dive and roll angles were prominently present during all but the drop phases. Nonetheless, they are shown to remain within the limits stated by the manufacturer or imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration type <b>certificate</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheets.</b> Cumulative occurrences of maneuver loads have been examined and compared with data from other sources when available. It is shown that the cumulative occurrences of maneuver load factor varies by flight phase, with the largest values associated with the drop and exit phases. For the overall flight, maneuver loads were shown to occur at lower frequencies than those stated in Military specification MIL-A- 8866 C(AS).

5000|$|The Mooney M10 Cadet {{is a light}} {{airplane}} {{manufactured by}} the Mooney Aircraft Company in 1969 and 1970. The M10 {{is derived from the}} ERCO Ercoupe, the type certificates for which Mooney purchased from the Alon Corporation in 1967. [...] The M10 is similar to the Alon A2-A, and indeed a handful of [...] "Mooney A2-As" [...] were built in Kerrville in 1968 before changeover of Mooney's production line was completed. [...] According to the FAA Type <b>Certificate</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheet,</b> the [...] "Model 10 is similar to Model A2-A except for new design empennage, ailerons and fuel tank vent." [...] The most obvious difference is that the M10 replaces the iconic Ercoupe-style dual vertical stabilizer with a tail designed to allow the airplane to spin. Changes to the ailerons, along with replacement of the A2-A's tail, were motivated by Mooney's intent to market the M10 as a trainer: student pilots receiving training in a non-spinnable airplane, as the Ercoupe was, were issued FAA pilot certificates carrying the restriction that they could only fly airplanes which were [...] "characteristically incapable of spinning"; thus the spinnable tail was necessary to turn the A2-A into a general-purpose trainer. Given that they were replacing the tail, Mooney's engineers opted to give it the [...] "backward" [...] profile characteristic of the M20 series. Note however that although the M10's empennage has the same silhouette as the [...] "big Mooneys", it does not swivel the way the M20's does ... the Cadet's tail is a conventional design with fixed horizontal stabilizer, hinged elevator, and trim tabs.|$|E
40|$|The {{registration}} of an aircraft {{is a prerequisite}} for issuance of a U. S. certificate of airworthiness by the FAA. The procedures and requirements for aircraft registration, and the subsequent issuance of registration numbers, are contained in FAR Part 47. However, the process/method(s) for applying the requirements of Parts 45 & 47 to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has not been defined. This task resolved the application of 14 CFR Parts 45 and 47 to UAS. Key Findings: UAS are aircraft systems and as such the recommended approach to registration is to follow the same process for registration as manned aircraft. This will require manufacturers to comply with the requirements for 14 CFR 47, Aircraft Registration and 14 CFR 45, Identification and Registration Marking. In addition, only the UA should be identified with the N number registration markings. There should also be a documentation link showing the applicability of the control station and communication link to the UA. The documentation link can be {{in the form of a}} Type <b>Certificate</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheet</b> (TCDS) entry or a UAS logbook entry. The recommended process for the {{registration of}} UAS is similar to the manned aircraft process and is outlined in a 6 -step process in the paper...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: We are {{adopting}} a new airworthiness directive (AD) to revise AD 68 - 17 - 03, which {{applies to all}} Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) PC- 6 series airplanes. AD 68 - 17 - 03 requires you to repetitively inspect the rudder end rib for cracks and replace the rudder end rib with a modified rudder end rib when you find cracks. Installing the modified rudder end rib terminates the repetitive inspection requirements of AD 68 - 17 - 03. Under a licensing agreement with Pilatus, Fairchild Republic Company (also identified as Fairchild Industries, Fairchild Heli Porter, or Fairchild-Hiller Corporation) produced Model PC- 6 series airplanes (manufacturer serial numbers 2001 through 2092) in the United States. AD 68 - 17 - 03 was intended to apply to all affected serial numbers of Model PC- 6 series airplanes listed on Type <b>Certificate</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheet</b> (TCDS) No. 7 A 15, including the Fairchild-produced airplanes. Consequently, this AD clarifies that all models of the PC- 6 airplane on TCDS No. 7 A 15 (including those models produced under the licensing agreement by Fairchild Republic Company) {{are included in the}} applicability. We are issuing this AD to detect and correct cracks in the rudder end rib, which could result in failure of the rudder end rib. This failure could result in loss of rudder control...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} racial/ethnic information in California birth <b>certificate</b> <b>data.</b> DATA SOURCES: Computerized birth <b>certificate</b> <b>data</b> and postpartum interviews with California mothers. STUDY DESIGN AND <b>DATA</b> COLLECTION: Birth <b>certificates</b> were matched with face-to-face structured postpartum interviews with 7, 428 mothers to compare racial/ethnic information between the two data sources. Interviews were conducted in Spanish or English during delivery stays at 16 California hospitals, 1994 - 1995. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sensitivity of racial/ethnic classification in birth <b>certificate</b> <b>data</b> was very high (94 percent to 99 percent) for African Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Europeans/Middle Easterners, and Latinas (Hispanics). For Native Americans, however, the sensitivity was only 54 percent. The positive predictive value of birth certificate classification of race/ethnicity was high for all racial/ethnic groups (96 percent to 97 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited training of birth clerks, the maternal racial/ethnic information in California birth <b>certificate</b> <b>data</b> {{appears to be a}} valid measure of self-identified race and Hispanic ethnicity for groups other than Native Americans...|$|R

On the other hand the derivation of model parameters for the modeling of irradiation dependent efficiency of PV modules based on <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> is associated with high uncertainties.
