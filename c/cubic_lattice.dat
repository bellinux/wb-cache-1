5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice.</b> It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|Silver is an {{extremely}} soft, ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the nitrate, the oxide {{is similar}} to the {{corresponding}} samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> upon heating to 600°C. Further annealing at 800°C and then at 1750°C irreversibly transforms it to a monoclinic and hexagonal phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.|$|E
5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice.</b> In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is the allotrope {{of carbon}} {{in which the}} carbon atoms are {{arranged}} in the specific type of <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> called diamond cubic. Diamond is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good. The precise tensile strength of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60GPa has been observed, {{and it could be}} as high as 90–225GPa depending on the crystal orientation. The anisotropy of diamond hardness is carefully considered during diamond cutting. Diamond has a high refractive index (2.417) and moderate dispersion (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's crystal structure, and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide range of colors seen in diamond. Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors. Unlike many other minerals, the specific gravity of diamond crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from diamond to diamond.|$|E

5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice.</b> These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

25|$|In metal borides, {{the bonding}} of boron varies {{depending}} on the atomic ratio B/M. Diborides have B/M = 2, as in the well-known superconductor MgB2; they crystallize in a hexagonal AlB2-type layered structure. Hexaborides have B/M = 6 and form a three-dimensional boron framework based on a boron octahedron (Fig. 1a). Tetraborides, i.e. B/M = 4, are mixtures of diboride and hexaboride structures. Cuboctahedron (Fig. 1b) is the structural unit of dodecaborides, which have a <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> and B/M = 12. When the composition ratio exceeds 12, boron forms B12 icosahedra (Fig. 1c) which are linked into a three-dimensional boron framework, and the metal atoms reside in the voids of this framework.|$|E
25|$|Silicon crystallises {{in a giant}} {{covalent}} structure at standard conditions, {{specifically in}} a diamond <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice.</b> It thus has a high melting point of 1414°C. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642°C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent {{with the fact that}} the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.|$|E
25|$|The caesium {{chloride}} structure {{adopts a}} primitive <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> with a two-atom basis, where both atoms have eightfold coordination. The chloride atoms lie upon the lattice {{points at the}} edges of the cube, while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the center of the cubes. This structure is shared with CsBr and CsI and many binary metallic alloys. In contrast, the other alkaline halides have the sodium chloride (rocksalt) structure. When both ions are similar in size (Cs+ ionic radius 174 pm for this coordination number, Cl− 181 pm) the CsCl structure is adopted, when they are different (Na+ ionic radius 102 pm, Cl− 181 pm) the sodium chloride structure is adopted. Upon heating to above 445°C, the normal caesium chloride structure (α-CsCl) converts to the β-CsCl form with the rocksalt structure (space group Fmm). The rocksalt structure is also observed at ambient conditions in nanometer-thin CsCl films grown on mica, LiF, KBr and NaCl substrates.|$|E

25|$|A vertex-first {{cross-section}} uses some hyperplane {{orthogonal to}} a line joining opposite vertices {{of one of the}} 24-cells. For instance, one could take any of the coordinate hyperplanes in the coordinate system given above (i.e. the planes determined by x'i = 0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by one of these hyperplanes gives a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. Each of the rhombic dodecahedra corresponds to a maximal cross-section of one of the 24-cells intersecting the hyperplane (the center of each such (4-dimensional) 24-cell lies in the hyperplane). Accordingly, the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb is the Voronoi tessellation of the D3 root lattice (a face-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice).</b> Shifting this hyperplane halfway to one of the vertices (e.g. x'i = ½) gives rise to a regular cubic honeycomb. In this case the center of each 24-cell lies off the hyperplane. Shifting again, so the hyperplane intersects the vertex, gives another rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb but with new 24-cells (the former ones having shrunk to points). In general, for any integer n, the cross-section through x'i = n is a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, and the cross-section through x'i = n + ½ is a cubic honeycomb. As the hyperplane moves through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between the two periodically.|$|E

500|$|As {{molten iron}} cools past its {{freezing}} point of 1538°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite. At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E
