40|$|AbstractGiven two {{commutative}} A-algebras B and C and a B⊗AC-module W, the modules Hn(A,B,C,W) {{are useful}} for comparing the ordinary André-Quillen homology modules Hn(A,B,W) and Hn(C,B⊗AC,W); they have been studied for small values of n. In this pa per, we focus our attention on the module H 5 (A,B,C,B⊗AC). As a corollary of our computations, we obtain some new results {{in the theory of}} the <b>contangent</b> complex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper condsiders a {{singular}} integral equation which {{appears in the}} analysis of plane wave diffraction on a planar periodic metal strip grating. The kernel of the equation is the <b>contangent</b> function which depends on the difference of the arguments. By transfering the equation into the complex domain a solution of the equation is found in a closed analytical form. Key-Words:- Plane wave diffraction, singular integral equation, residue techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{continuous}} {{version of}} Szegö's theorem gives {{the first two}} terms of the asymptotics as α → ∞ of the determinants of certain convolution operators on L 2 (0, α) with scalar-valued kernels. Generalizations are known if the kernel is matrix valued or if the interval (0, α) is replaced by αΩ with Ω a bounded set in Rn with smooth boundary. This paper treats the higher-dimensional matrix case. The coefficient in the interesting (second) term is an integral over the <b>contangent</b> bundle of ∂Ω of the correponding coefficients of one-dimensional problems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLet E be a vector bundle on Pn. We say E is Buchsbaum if Hp(EM(∗)) has trivial module {{structure}} for each linear space M {{and for all}} 1 ≤p≤dimM− 1. In this note, we show that a Buchsbaum bundle is either an Ω-bundle (i. e. a direct sum of Ωp(h) 's, where Ωp is the pth exterior power of the <b>contangent</b> bundle of Pn) or the quotient of an Ω-bundle by a direct sum of line bundles. We also give a strategy to characterize/construct Buchsbaum bundles, give conditions for an Ω-bundle to be extendable...|$|E
40|$|Let Q be a Riemannian {{manifold}} {{such that}} the Betti numbers of its free loop space with respect to some coefficient field are unbounded. We show that every contact form on its unit <b>contangent</b> bundle supporting the natural contact structure has infinitely many simple Reeb orbits. This {{is an extension of}} a theorem by Gromoll and Meyer. We also show that if a compact manifold admits a Stein fillable contact structure then there is a possibly different such structure which also has infinitely many simple Reeb orbits for every supporting contact form. We use local Floer homology along with symplectic homology to prove these facts. Comment: 21 pages, many small mistakes and typos correcte...|$|E
40|$|Let V be {{a complex}} vector space of {{dimension}} n, G (resp. G*) the Grassmann manifold of p-dimensional (resp. (n-p) -dimensional) subspaces of V, and of Omega {{the relation of}} transversality in G x G*. In a previous note we announced in equivalences between derived categories of sheaves and of D-modules on G and G* defined by the integral transforms associated to Omega. We show here that these transforms exchange the D-modules associated to the holomorphic lines bundles on G and G*. This is equivalent to ''quantizing'' the underlying contact transformation between certain open dense subsets of the <b>contangent</b> bundles. In the case p = 1, we recover already known results for the projective duality...|$|E
40|$|Let F be a {{function}} field of one variable over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, X a geometrically irreducible smooth projective variety over F, and L a line bundle on X. In this note, we will prove that if the <b>contangent</b> bundle of X is ample and X is non-isotrivial, then there are a proper closed algebraic set Y of X and a constant A > 0 such that h_L(P) <= A d(P) + O(1) for all P ∈ X(F̅) Y(F̅), where h_L(P) is a geometric height of P with respect to L and d(P) is the geometric logarithmic discriminant of P. As corollary of the above height inequality, we can recover Noguchi's theorem, i. e. there is a non-empty Zariski open set U of X with U(F) = ∅. Comment: 9 pages, AmSTe...|$|E
40|$|New {{results are}} {{announced}} linking {{properties of the}} symbol module and characteristic variety of a differential complex with test estimates near the characteristic variety of the type considered by Hörmander (½-estimate). The first result is the invariance of the test estimates under pseudo-differential change of coordinates, and {{this leads to the}} introduction of a normal form for the complex in the neighborhood of a Cohen-MacCauley point of the symbol module. If the characteristic variety V is a manifold near the Cohen-MacCauley point (x 0,ζ 0) with parametrizing functions p 1, [...] .,pq, where q is the codimension of the characteristic variety in the complexified <b>contangent</b> bundle, the matrix [Formula: see text] of Poisson brackets defines invariantly a Hermitian form Q on the normal space to V at (x 0,ζ 0) when the dpζ(x 0,ζ 0) are used as basis, and the test estimates are satisfied at the ith stage of the complex if sig. Q (signature of Q) is ≥ n - i + 1 (n the dimension of the base manifold) or rank Q - sig. Q ≥ i + 1. Finally, conditions are given in order that, on a manifold with smooth boundary, the associated boundary complexes satisfy the ½-estimate...|$|E
40|$|These maps {{correspond}} respectively to {{the families}} index theorem of Atiyah and Singer for fibrewise pseudodifferential operators for a smooth fibration of a compact manifold M − → Y, to the equivariant index for invariant and transversally elliptic operators for the smooth action of a compact Lie group on a compact manifold Z and to the pseudodifferential extension of the numerical index map of Atiyah, Patodi and Singer for a compact manifold with boundary Z. The K-groups forming the domains are respectively the topological (compactly supported) K-theory of the fibrewise <b>contangent</b> bundle of the fibration, the G-equivariant K-theory of the (generally singular) space of fibre conormals of the group action and the compactly supported K-theory of the cotangent bundle of the manifold with boundary with the fibration of the boundary smashed to its base, the conormal line. The targets {{for the first two}} maps are the K-theory of the base and the ring of virtual representations of the group. In this talk I had planned to try to present approaches to the analytic definitions of these maps, and the corresponding theorems – identifying them with topological push-forward maps – which I hoped would indicate how one can freely combine them to give an equivariant, families index of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type. Unfortunately due to limitiations of time I {{will not be able to}} discuss the boundary case (in joint work with Frédéric Rochon) so will be content here with discussing an approach to a families equivariant index theorem. I will also discuss the closely related problem of deriving a Chern character formula, for the image of the index in an appropriate cohomology. First consider the families index theorem. Here is a diagram of the construction of the analytic index which corresponds to push-forward under the map π: T ∗ (M/Y) − → Y which has fibres diffeomorphic to T ∗Z, where Z is the model fibre of the fibration M − → Y...|$|E
