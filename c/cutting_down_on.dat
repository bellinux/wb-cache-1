25|$|Insomnia is {{a general}} term for {{difficulty}} falling asleep and staying asleep. Insomnia {{is the most common}} sleep problem, with many adults reporting occasional insomnia, and 10–15% reporting a chronic condition. Insomnia can have many different causes, including psychological stress, a poor sleep environment, an inconsistent sleep schedule, or excessive mental or physical stimulation in the hours before bedtime. Insomnia is often treated through behavioral changes like keeping a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating or stressful activities before bedtime, and <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> stimulants such as caffeine. The sleep environment may be improved by installing heavy drapes to shut out all sunlight, and keeping computers, televisions and work materials out of the sleeping area.|$|E
25|$|These {{conflicts}} put {{an enormous}} {{strain on the}} resources of the Republic, however, and for that reason the Republic (like its opponent, the France of Louis XIV) was deeply in debt {{at the end of the}} War of the Spanish Succession. The regents of the Republic more or less abandoned its Great-Power pretensions after 1713, <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> its military preparedness in a vain attempt to pay down this overhang of public debt. That debt brought a significant rentier class into being that helped change the nature of the economy from one invested primarily in trade and industry into one in which a significant financial sector played a dominant role. By the end of the 18th century the Republic was the major market for sovereign debt, and a major source of foreign direct investment.|$|E

Legal experts believe that the bylaw is unconstitutional and a Supreme Court case will be imminent.|$|R
25|$|Park {{and ride}} {{facilities}} {{have been provided}} {{on the outskirts of}} the city, such as at Ingliston near Newbridge in the west of Edinburgh with spaces for 535 cars, as well as at Hermiston on the Edinburgh City Bypass, Newcraighall in the east of the city and at Ferrytoll in Fife. The schemes consist of large surface car parks off the main roads into the city where buses take passengers from these peripheral facilities into the city centre via a number dedicated stops, thus <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the number of cars making the journey into the congested city centre.

25|$|Community and {{business}} leaders in Edinburgh have voiced support {{for the construction of}} a high-speed rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh to reduce current journey times between Scotland's two main cities. Currently First ScotRail operate a shuttle service, every 15 minutes between 7am and 7pm, between the two cities on the Glasgow to Edinburgh (via Falkirk High) line, with journeys taking around 50 minutes. It is estimated that a high-speed maglev system would halve the journey time between the two cities. The UK Government has also conducted a feasibility study into ascertaining whether a high-speed Maglev network between Edinburgh and London would be economically beneficial and thus <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the growth of domestic air traffic between the two cities. Such a system would, however require a complete new infrastructure as it is not compatible with the existing rail infrastructure.|$|E

It was the first top division yūshō by a wrestler from Tomozuna stable since Tachiyama in 1916. He attributed his victory partly to <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his beer consumption. Set a target of eleven wins by the Japan Sumo Association for promotion to ōzeki in the following tournament in July 2000, he achieved the necessary total {{on the final day}} and his promotion was confirmed a few days later. He was 28 years of age, and the 44 tournaments it took him to reach ōzeki from his top division debut was the second slowest ever.

25|$|His {{simplified}} teachings {{were designed}} to appeal primarily {{to the poor and}} the peasants. He attempted to win supporters by <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> ceremonies and complex doctrines, eschewing the use of temples. He won over followers by offering free consultations and performing purported miracle cures with simple herbs and acupuncture, and preaching at street corners and canal intersections. He quickly built up a following in the southern Mekong Delta and was looked to by his disciples for guidance in their daily lifestyles. In a time of colonial occupation, a native religion appealed to the masses who were displaying nationalist sentiment. Unlike Gautama Buddha or Jesus, Sổ was Vietnamese. As a result, Sổ became a nationalist icon and became a wanted man for the French colonial authorities, having gained 100,000 followers in less than a year. He predicted that politics would be the cause of his premature death.The cult must stem much more from internal faith than from a pompous appearance. It is better to pray with a pure heart before the family altar than to perform gaudy ceremonies in a pagoda, clad in the robes of an unworthy bonze.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover was {{designed}} to only be in production {{for two or three}} years to gain some cash flow and export orders for the Rover Company so it could restart up-market car production. Once car production restarted, however, it was greatly outsold by the off-road Land Rover, which developed into its own brand that remains successful today. Many of the defining and successful features of the Land Rover design were in fact the result of Rover's drive to simplify the tooling required for the vehicle and to use the minimum amount of rationed materials. As well as the aluminium alloy bodywork (which has been retained throughout production despite it now being more expensive than a conventional steel body due to its ideal properties of light weight and corrosion resistance) other examples include the distinctive flat body panels with only simple, constant-radius curves (originally used because they could be cut and formed by hand from aluminium sheet on a basic jig) and the sturdy box-section ladder chassis, which on Series vehicles was made up from four strips of steel welded at each side to form a box, thus <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the complex welding operations required when making a more conventional U- or I-section frame.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{breakthrough}} for {{in vitro}} fertilization {{is the use of}} blastocysts. A blastocyst would be implanted five to six days after the eggs had been fertilized.

Knowing which embryos will succeed allows just one blastocyst to be implanted, <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> dramatically <b>on</b> the health risk and expense of multiple births.

50|$|The Flagstaff War {{took place}} in the far north of New Zealand, around the Bay of Islands, between March 1845 and January 1846.

At this time Hōne Heke challenged the authority of the British, beginning by <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> the flagstaff <b>on</b> Flagstaff Hill at Kororāreka.

30|$|Two other {{potential}} explanations come to mind. First, displaced households face {{a lot of}} uncertainty {{about the future and}} try to prepare themselves by <b>cutting</b> <b>down</b> spending <b>on</b> every non-vital position, which includes education expenditure. In a simple two period model, an agent with convex marginal utility reduces consumption in the first period if the risk of period 2 income increases. Kimball (1990) calls this phenomenon prudence and defines it as “the propensity to prepare and forearm oneself in the face of uncertainty”. In 2001 the restitution of property to internally displaced households and the possibility {{to return to their homes}} from before the war was still an issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many displaced households probably faced a highly uncertain future. On the other hand one could argue that increased uncertainty through displacement prompts households to invest more in highly mobile assets, such as human capital, which they could take with them if they ever had to change location again.|$|R

Hence--and {{this is a}} most {{important}} secondary function--roots bind together the ragged edges of rocks as a hem does the torn edge of a dress: they literally stitch the stones together; so that, while it is always dangerous to pass under a treeless edge of overhanging crag, {{as soon as it}} has become beautiful with trees, it is safe also. The rending power of roots on rocks has been greatly overrated. Capillary attraction in a willow wand will indeed split granite, and swelling roots sometimes heave considerable masses aside, but on the whole, roots, small and great, bind, and do not rend.[15] The surfaces of mountains are dissolved and disordered, by rain, and frost, and chemical decomposition, into mere heaps of loose stones on their desolate summits; but, where the forests grow, soil accumulates and disintegration ceases.
