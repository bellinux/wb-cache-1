40|$|The gold {{standard}} {{began to emerge}} as a universal monetary system in the late 1870 s, and it had spread throughout the world economy by 1900. It was unusual for nations to be off the {{gold standard}}, and it meant that they were detached from the international financial community. Spain never joined the gold standard club in any of its varieties, either before or after 1914. Unlike {{the vast majority of}} the European currencies, the peseta’s exchange rate fluctuated, sometimes widely, against gold and gold <b>currencies.</b> Gold <b>convertibility</b> was suspended in 1883 and never resumed. Nevertheless, the monetary authorities were aware that the Spanish economy, off the gold standard, was an outlier in the international economy and made plans to put the peseta on gold both before and after 1914. Why Spain never adopted the gold standard is a complex issue, and our paper offers a possible answer by examining the behaviour of an issuing bank that refused to accept, or resisted, its role as a central bank. Our study also provides a basis for a comparison between the Bank of Spain, some of its features and policies, with other peripheral issuing institutions.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{proposal}} for a controlled approach to capital account liberalization for economies experiencing large capital inflows. The proposal essentially involves securitizing a portion of capital inflows through closed-end mutual funds that issue shares in domestic currency, use the proceeds to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank and then invest the proceeds abroad. This would eliminate the fiscal costs of sterilizing those inflows, give domestic investors opportunities for international portfolio diversification and stimulate the development of domestic financial markets. More importantly, it would allow central banks to control both the timing and quantity of capital outflows. This proposal could be part of a broader toolkit of measures to liberalize the capital account cautiously when external circumstances are favorable. It is not a substitute for other necessary policies such as strengthening of the domestic financial sector or, in some cases, greater exchange rate flexibility. But it could in fact help create a supportive environment for these essential reforms.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the way in}} which Hong Kong's currency board has operated since its re-introduction in 1983. It discusses currency board design {{and the extent to which}} Hong Kong has conformed to particular principles. The core of the paper is an assessment of the rules-versus-discretion question. From 1983 to 1988 the <b>currency</b> board <b>convertibility</b> obligation applied, in effect, to physical cash only. Arbitrage could not be relied upon to ensure that the market rate converged to 7. 80, so intervention - mostly in the foreign exchange market - played a significant role. In 1988 the authorities acquired the means to apply currency board principles also to the reserve balance of the banking system, but over the next ten years they did not exploit that to full advantage in the currency board context. They gave no convertibility promise for the reserve balance and seldom allowed foreign exchange transactions to trigger currency-board-type adjustment. They concentrated instead on managing bank liquidity or interest rates, very often via money market intervention, albeit subject to the overriding goal of a stable exchange rate. But the range which defined that stability was never revealed. Although this exercise of discretion and the departures from strict currency board principles were not obviously damaging, they may have complicated official procedures unnecessarily, and may have raised doubts as to the authorities' longterm commitment to 7. 80. In other words, rather than helping to settle markets, the tactics may at times have disturbed them. Reforms in 1998 included a weak-side convertibility undertaking for banks' reserve money at 7. 80 (after transition), but left strong-side intervention to the discretion of the Monetary Authority. It was only in 2005 that a firm strong-side undertaking was introduced at 7. 75, with the weak side bound being moved to 7. 85 in order to provide symmetry. Now, only one minor element of discretion - for intrazone intervention - remains. Whereas discretionary interventions were probably very necessary in the early years after 1983, the authorities could have moved more quickly after 1988 to reach the almost completely rule-based status of today. But the stability of the exchange rate over the entire period speaks for itself, and it is not obvious that stricter adherence to currency board principles would have delivered a materially different outcome. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper pays brief attention, {{although}} {{more than the}} recent flood of 1914 centenary books, to economic causes of the First World War before turning to it fateful economic consequences for Southeastern Europe. The Austrian lack of economic leverage over Serbia is cited {{as a reason for}} its resort to the military option. At the war’s end, the option of the victorious powers to provide significant economic relief to the region where the conflict had begun was not taken. After tracking the brief, limited assistance provided, the paper reviews to the massive economic problems confronting four of the five of independent states, neglecting Albania as a special case, that could now be called Southeastern Europe. First Greece and then Bulgaria faced forced inflow of refugees. Romania and the Yugoslav Kingdom faced the economic integration of large new, formerly Austro-Hungarian lands. All of them were left not only with war deaths and destruction but also with large war debts, or in Bulgaria’s case, reparations. The paper concentrates on the primary Western response to these four economies, an effort led by the Bank of England to replace immediate postwar inflation with the deflation needed to reestablish <b>currencies</b> with prewar <b>convertibility</b> to gold, now with Pound Sterling added to a gold reserve standard. Independent central banks, the major positive legacy of this initiative, were to lead the way. But the financial stability that all four economies did eventually achieve in the 1920 s served only to reduce their war debts. Otherwise, maintaining the fixed and overvalued exchange rates restricted domestic credit, encouraged protective tariffs, and did not attract the foreign capital, especially new state loans, that this emphasis on a single, European financial framework had promised. A concluding section considers the lessons learned from a postwar period that promoted economic disintegration by the 1930 s. Looking at the period {{since the end of the}} Cold War and then the wars of Yugoslavia’s dissolution, we see EU leadership in the reduction of trade barriers, the promotion of common fiscal practice and the prospect of genuine European integration as Western lessons learned.

The unfavorable investment climate has caused foreign investment inflows to dwindle to a trickle. It is believed that Uzbekistan has {{the lowest level of}} foreign direct investment per capita in the CIS. Since Uzbekistan's independence, U.S. firms have invested roughly $500 million in the country, but due to declining investor confidence, harassment, and <b>currency</b> <b>convertibility</b> problems, numerous international investors have left the country or are considering leaving. In 2005, the Central Bank has revoked the license of the nascent Biznes Bank citing unspecified violations of local currency exchange rules. The revocation prompted immediate bankruptcy procedures, under which clients' deposits stay arrested for two month. No interest was accrued during that two-month period. In 2006, the Government of Uzbekistan forced out Newmont Mining Corporation (at the time the largest U.S. investor) from its gold mining joint venture in the Muruntau gold mine. Newmont and the government resolved their dispute, but the action adversely affected Uzbekistan's image among foreign investors. The government attempted the same with British-owned Oxus Mining. Coscom, a U.S.-owned telecommunications company, involuntarily sold its stake in a joint venture to another foreign company. GM-DAT, a Korean subsidiary of GM, is the only known U.S. business to have entered Uzbekistan in over two years.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 157 - 165. This thesis {{analyses}} the impediments of inconvertible currencies on intra-regional trade {{within the}} Eastern and Southern African region. Currency inconvertibility is a non-tariff trade barrier which limits and distorts international trade expansion. Therefore, alternative arrangements {{that may be}} used in order to remedy this problem are considered. Exchange rate misalignment is identified as a major cause of currency inconvertibility. It is shown that the implementation of macroeconomic policies and exchange rate regimes which are not complementary cause exchange rate misalignment resulting in balance of payments disequilibria leading to currency inconvertibility. Since the preconditions for transformation to full <b>currency</b> <b>convertibility</b> have not been met by most countries in the region this thesis suggests a mechanism that will enable the use of local currencies for intra-regional trade (partial <b>currency</b> <b>convertibility).</b> The most viable arrangement under the prevailing conditions in the Eastern and Southern African region is the reserve fund to which member countries contribute a fraction of their international reserves. This contribution will be determined according to the levels of intra-regional trade in which they engage. This arrangement will guarantee that even if a member state cannot honour its payments' obligation {{it will be able to}} draw on the facility to make payment. The advantages of this facility are that it will guarantee that payments for intra-regional trade will be made and that the contributions by member countries will be more affordable than the other arrangements as well as its potential for assisting in creating closer economic relations in the region.

Theoretical and empirical literature suggests that capital account liberalization generally leads to capital inflow in developing countries, generating an appreciation in the real exchange rate (RER) and thus a loss in competitiveness. However, preserving competitiveness is a key challenge for monetary authorities, who have to conciliate these two apparently conflicting purposes. To guide their decisions with respect to the prescribed procedure for capital liberalization, we need to evaluate the impact of each capital component flow on the RER. The question is addressed by analyzing impulse response functions (IRF) resulting from a VAR model, covering 1970 to 2010 and gathering the RER, its fundamental determinants, monetary variables and an estimated capital control (CC) variable. Results show that a relaxation of CC overappreciates the RER to its long-term level, and liberalizing portfolio investment is the most compromising for competitiveness...|$|E
