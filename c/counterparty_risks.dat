5000|$|Like regular banks, shadow banks provide {{credit and}} {{generally}} increase the liquidity {{of the financial}} sector. Yet unlike their more regulated competitors, they lack access to central bank funding or safety nets such as deposit insurance and debt guarantees. [...] In contrast to traditional banks, shadow banks do not take deposits. Instead, they rely on short-term funding provided either by asset-backed commercial paper or by the repo market, in which borrowers in substance offer collateral as security against a cash loan, through the mechanism of selling the security to a lender and agreeing to repurchase it at an agreed {{time in the future}} for an agreed price. Money market funds do not rely on short-term funding; rather, they are investment pools that provide short-term funding by investing in short-term debt instruments issued by banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other borrowers. The shadow banking sector operates across the American, European, and Chinese financial sectors, and in perceived tax havens worldwide. Shadow banks can be involved in the provision of long-term loans like mortgages, facilitating credit across the financial system by matching investors and borrowers individually or by becoming part of a chain involving numerous entities, some of which may be mainstream banks. Due in part to their specialized structure, shadow banks can sometimes provide credit more cost-efficiently than traditional banks. A headline study by the International Monetary Fund defines the two key functions of the shadow banking system as securitization - to create safe assets, and collateral intermediation - to help reduce <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> and facilitate secured transactions. In the US, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the shadow banking system had overtaken the regular banking system in supplying loans to various types of borrower; including businesses, home and car buyers, students and credit users. As they are often less risk averse than regular banks, entities from the shadow banking system will sometimes provide loans to borrowers who might otherwise be refused credit. Money market funds are considered more risk averse than regular banks and thus lack this risk characteristic.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{we will see a}} {{pronounced}} increase in the speed at which payment transactions are executed and in the share of cross-border transactions, particularly in the euro area. <b>Counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> and liquidity needs connected with the transfer of funds continue to evolve and to provoke discussion. The fact that funds transfers occur and systems operate on a real-time and gross basis will significantly alter the operational character and technical solutions in this field. Systems following a daily timetable are being replaced by continuously operating systems, which will {{have a significant impact on}} banks' liquidity management. The trend toward immediate real-time payment transactions seems inevitable in the light of present trends. It is generally presumed that RTGS systems operating on a gross basis require more liquidity than netting systems. Liquidity needs depend on payment system structures and payment flows. An even flow of payments requires less liquidity than an uneven flow. Liquidity needs can be significantly reduced by choosing an appropriate payment system structure, taking measures to even out payment flows and agreeing on market practices. The pricing, collateral and reserve requirement policies of the central bank affect also the efficiency of alternative payment systems. Thus the overall efficiency of a gross or net system depends on many factors. Factors arguing for a gross system are differences in <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks,</b> lack of reciprocity, steady interday payment flows and stable liquidity needs, both within and between days. Factors favouring net systems are the existence of small and varying <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> and structurally unsteady payment flows that result in large interday variations in liquidity, even though overnight variations may be moderate. Current, daily-oriented practices have focused on overnight liquidity needs. In a continuously operating environment, liquidity needs are continuously monitored across time-period borders. This means that banks' liquidity management will in the future operate under a new and broader time perspective. Significant liquidity needs and large <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> are inherent parts of Finland's present funds-transfer solutions. Liquidity can be freed for other uses and <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> reduced by changing the structures.

In this study, we establish a financial credit derivative pricing model for a contract which is subject to <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> The model leads to a fully nonlinear partial differential equation problem.

40|$|Foreword In recent years, {{both the}} Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Euro-currency Standing Committee have {{published}} {{reports on the}} implications of the very rapid growth of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in terms of risks to banks and other counterparties to those transactions and risks to the financial system as a whole. However, none of these reports has provided a comprehensive survey and analysis of the practices and procedures that participants in these markets actually use to manage their <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> The two Committees jointly organised a study group to fill this gap. This report presents the study group's work. The study group, chaired by Mr. Patrick Parkinson of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, was given two specific objectives. First, it was to coordinate a survey of OTC derivatives dealers designed to develop a clear and comprehensive understanding of existing policies and procedures for documenting, processing and settling OTC transactions and for managing the associated <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> Secondly, it was to identify any weaknesses in practices that appear to exacerbate <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> significantly or even possibly pose risks to the financial system generally, and to consider changes in practices, including new services, that could mitigate those risks. The study group coordinated interviews with 30 leading dealers in OTC derivatives, including two or more from each of the G- 10 countries. Overall, the results of the interviews indicate that practices for processing trades and managing <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> are broadly similar in all the G- 10 countries. Standard legal agreements and confirmation templates are used to document most transactions. Transaction processing, from data capture through to confirmation and settlement, is increasingly automated, although the more structured transactions still usually require manual intervention. Netting and, to a growing extent, collateral agreements are used to mitigate counterparty credit risks. Finally, the vast majority of OTC transactions are settled bilaterally between the counterparties, rather than through clearing houses. A potential weakness in practices that was identified in the interviews was the existence of significant backlogs of unsigned master agreements and outstanding confirmations. The degree to which risks are exacerbated by these practices cannot be reliably assessed {{on the basis of the}} interview results. Given the size of some of the reported backlogs, this clearly deserves further attention. The study group recommends that both derivatives counterparties and prudential supervisors review the backlogs, assess the risks entailed and take appropriate steps to ensure that the risks are adequately controlled. A development that the study group believes could significantly mitigate risks in OTC derivatives transactions is the rapidly expanding use of collateral. However, to ensure that the benefits concerned are realised, counterparties must effectively manage the liquidity, legal, custody and operational risks of using collateral. The study group recommends that counterparties carefully assess these risks and that prudential supervisors consider developing supervisory guidance in this area. The expansion of clearing houses for OTC derivatives may also reduce <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> The study group recommends that counterparties assess the benefits of clearing, taking into account the effectiveness of the clearing house's risk management procedures and the effects of clearing on credit risks on uncleared contracts. National authorities should ensure that there are no unnecessary legal or regulatory impediments to clearing and that clearing houses adopt effective risk management safeguards.
