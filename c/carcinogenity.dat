However, they are environmentally problematic {{due to their}} <b>carcinogenity</b> and genotoxicity. Among the potential alternatives, treatments based on rare-earth compounds have drawn attention due to the stability of their oxides and their environmental acceptability. Despite {{the amount of work}} published, there is not yet an industrially suitable alternative treatment for aircraft aluminium alloys that is able to provide the required corrosion protection. A common feature of these alloys is the high level of copper in their chemical composition. Although the presence of copper in an alloy may enhance cerium deposition, high copper content alloys (AA 2024, AA 7075) have proven the most difficult to protect with Ce conversion coatings. In the present work, a commercial 8090 -T 8 aluminium alloy containing 1. 15 weight percent (wt. %) Cu was coated with a Ce conversion coating at room temperature from a Ce bath without prior pretreatment of the specimens. Polarisation curves revealed that the presence of a cerium conversion coating (CeCC) reduces by two orders of magnitude the corrosion rate of the AA 8090 alloy in a sodium chloride solution. Impedance measurements exhibited capacitive behaviour for the CeCC up to 216 h, showing that the cerium layer protects the bare alloy in the aggressive solution.

40|$|Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are among}} the most {{widespread}} organic pollutants in the environment. PAHs are of great concern because some of them show strong mutagenicity and <b>carcinogenity.</b> Bioremediation, which involves the use of microorganisms to reduce the concentration of various chemical pollutants, has become nowadays {{one of the most promising}} approach for environmental clean-up. Unfortunately, the presence of heavy metals in environments contaminated by organic compounds often hamper the environmental restoration. Several species of bacteria have been isolated from polluted environments able to degrade recalcitrant compounds. We have recently characterized a novel Sphingomonadales, Novosphingobium sp. PP 1 Y, isolated from surface seawater samples collected inside the harbour of Pozzuoli (Naples, Italy). The strain PP 1 Y not only uses a surprisingly large number of mono and polycyclic aromatic compounds as the sole carbon and energy sources but it shows a very interesting and effective adaptation to grow on complex mixtures of aromatic compounds dissolved in oil phases like diesel-oil and gasoline. Novosphingobium sp. PP 1 Y showed the ability to form “biofilm” on several types of hydrophobic surfaces and, in water/oil systems. It is well known that biofilm formation make bacteria able to adhere to growing substrates and to confer the resistance towards heavy metals and organic pollutants. We investigated the biodegradation abilities of Novosphingobium sp. PP 1 Y in natural soil and compost, artificially contaminated by PAHs and heavy metals such as nickel, copper and zinc, in small-scale experiments. N. sp. PP 1 Y showed the ability to quickly remove phenanthrene from the compost after addition of the organic compound in crystal form or dissolved in oil phase. The bacterium was also able to metabolize phenanthrene in the presence of heavy metals, showing the most significant delay in phenanthrene removal only at high nickel concentration. When a mixture of PAHs in paraffin containing naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene, was added to the compost, the bacterium was able to remove all the three compounds, although with different rates. Furthermore, the addition of N. sp. PP 1 Y to a natural soil contaminated by heavy metals and PAHs, already endowed with a microbial community adapted to use PAHs in the presence of heavy metals, halved the time of natural self-purifying of the soil, thus suggesting the ability of N. sp. PP 1 Y to compete with the adapted endogenous microbial community. In conclusion Novosphingobium sp. PP 1 Y is a good candidate for the bioremediation of organic compound contaminated soils in the presence of heavy metals...|$|E
40|$|Air {{being an}} {{important}} part of the environment is always required to be in a satisfactory condition for the proper functioning of the entire eco system. Air quality is being affected adversely due to several reasons such as increasing number of industries without having proper emission handling systems and increasing number of vehicles. Many industrial stacks observed in Sri Lanka today are not constructed according to the proper stack design requirements. The quality of stack emissions or the dispersion of pollutants from a specific stack is seldom analyzed mainly because of the high costs involved. Even analysis is done on the dispersion from a specific stack it is difficult to get good representative results because the meteorological conditions vary frequently. In this study a stack emission dispersion model named AUSPLUME which is developed by the Victorian Environmental Protection Authority and recommended by several organizations for 'regulatory purpose was studied. This work mainly looks at the following: 1. The applicability of the model in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 11. Model emissions from the stacks at Holcim Lanka cement plant at Puttlam with the use of AUSPLUME before and after installing a new dust handling system The purpose of the EIA is to predict and identify potentially significant environmental impacts of development projects and to suggest mitigation measures to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts. Main stages in the EIA process are, 1. Screening (find out whether an EIA is required) 11. Scoping (identification of main issues) lll. Collection and analysis of information IV. Public involvement v. Communicating the findings In the process of analyzing the information AUSPLUME can be used. With available information about the stack, emissions and the meteorological data of the area of concern, the model can predict the concentrations of selected constituents at ground level or elevated levels in the down wind direction. The areas of worst impact, limit of the buffer zone, effects to the high rise buildings or effects to the selected areas of important like high bio diversity, archeology, and residences can be identified using the results obtained with AUSPLUME. For the analysis of the stack emission dispersion from the Holcim Lanka cement plant at Puttlam, the meteorological data obtained at the Palavi weather monitoring station of the Meteorological Department were used. There are two similar stacks at the factory which are placed close by and therefore both of them were considered as a single point source with an equivalent diameter. The area was considered to be a flat terrain since there were no disturbances in the vicinity. The analysis results on the dispersion of particulate matter, NOz and SOz emissions from the stack were compared with ambient air quantity standards for Sri Lanka and European Guideline values which were established by considering human health hazards other than <b>carcinogenity.</b> Certain values were found to be above the limits and the rest below the limit. Anyway in this analysis raw emission data were used and in the real life the raw emissions are mixed with clean air before released to the atmosphere. Therefore due to the dilution the real values can be expected to be much lower. Predicted values were compared with field measurement values available and with predicted values from SCREEN 3 model. The results obtained can be used for decision making purposes with a good understanding about their inaccuracy...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{toxicology}} puts together {{existing knowledge}} of classical biology with {{new technologies to}} study effects of perturbations and to predict adverse outcomes resulting from those perturbations. Modern toxicology employs high throughput technology as microarray and cell lines as in vitro models to investigate the effect of potential toxic compounds. In my thesis I evaluate the usefulness and reproducibility of microarray technology and cell line models. I have been mainly interested {{in the study of}} the effects on the regulation of gene transcription in cell lines. I used HepG 2 cell line as a model for liver to study cadmium-induced cytotoxicity, Caco- 2 as model for intestinal epithelial to study nanoparticles and HeLa cells from cervical cancer to evaluate genomic instability. Cadmium is currently classified as carcinogen for human. In my first study, gene expression is used to explain the possible toxic mechanism of cadmium <b>carcinogenity,</b> using HepG 2 cell line. A suggested mechanism of cadmium-induced carcinogenicity involves defects in the cell response to DNA damage and in the resistance to apoptosis. In this regard, I focused on the tumour suppressor protein P 53, since its inactivation is a common feature found in human cancers and it is a crucial component of the cellular response to DNA damage. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that in HepG 2 cells exposed to cadmium, P 53 was correctly moved and accumulated into the nucleus to accomplish its function as a transcription factor. However, in spite of this correct nuclear localization, the signals for the cell cycle arrest were not activated. In this context, the important mediator of cell cycle arrest P 21, a P 53 downstream protein, was upregulated at the gene level but not at the protein level. These results could be explained by the involvement of a post-transcriptional activity mediated by miRNA, as demonstrated by the upregulation of mir- 372 in cadmium-treated HepG 2 cells, which was able to affect p 21 expression and to promote cell proliferation. Recent advances in materials science have resulted in the creation of particles in the nano-scale range and their use is spreading. This creates the need to evaluate their possible toxic effect on human health. In the second study, gene expression is applied to evaluate nanoparticle effect on Caco- 2 cells as in vitro model of intestinal epithelial cells. The main focus was to compare the effect of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) of two sizes (30 nm and 5 nm), using microarray technology. Smaller AuNPs (5 nm) inhibit Caco- 2 cell growth. Gene expression analysis shows a broad range of responses induced by small size AuNPs. A bioinformatics reconstruction of the possible pathways regulated by smaller AuNPs indicates that Caco- 2 cells activate defence responses even if it was not enough to prevent the observed toxic effect. The response at the transcriptome level upon exposure to larger AuNPs (30 nm) is very weak. This effect can be due to the low uptake of these larger AuNPs. The third study focuses on the issue concerning cell line variability using different batches of HeLa cells obtained from different laboratories. The microarray expression analysis was performed on different batches of HeLa cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In response to a hypoxic stimulus, each cell line batch activated different pathways, although the regulation of genes related to hypoxia is conserved. A genetic analysis show the high level of extensive chromosome instability in HeLa clones obtained from different laboratories. Each clone accumulates genomic variability in a time-dependent manner. The large differences in gene expression profiles suggest that the use of uncharacterized clones may lead to faulty conclusions and to irreproducible results in studies of gene function and pathway analysis. In the three papers presented in this thesis I have not only shown the reproducibility of microarray by comparison to real time PCR, the gold standard technique for mRNA quantification, but also the potential to create possible model for the mechanistic effects on biological pathways. In my thesis I have used different cell lines as in vitro models. They have shown that they have many advantages and that can give strong support for modern toxicology and be used to study biological mechanism. However, a possible drawback, which should be taken into account, is highlighted in the third study showing a high variability in the responses of different batches of the same cell line...|$|E
