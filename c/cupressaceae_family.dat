40|$|Xylite is a lithotype of lignite, mainly {{used for}} fuel. The wood {{from which it}} was formed {{in a long term}} process (duration ca. 2 {{millions}} of years) was subjected to drastic changes. We conducted anatomical characterization of xylite, evaluated preservation of wood from which it was formed, defined its basic physical properties, and compared it with modern wood. We recognized ground tissue composed of tracheids, uniseriate and homocellular rays, taxodioid like crossfield pits, and abundant axial parenchyma with inclusions. The observed features are typical of coniferous wood species of the Taxodiaceae and <b>Cupressaceae</b> <b>families.</b> Colourimetric properties of xylite in CIE Lab* system are comparable to those of heartwood of ebony or wenge.

5000|$|The tree is also {{grown in}} gardens and parks in cool summer climates, {{including}} the Pacific Northwest in the Northwestern United States and British Columbia, eastern Great Britain and continental Northern Europe. In these areas it can develop an especially narrow columnar crown, an unexplained {{consequence of the}} cooler climatic conditions that is rare in trees within its warm summer natural range in the California Floristic Province. Other cultivated species from the <b>Cupressaceae</b> <b>family</b> can have similar crown forms. [...] This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5000|$|The amber {{specimen}} [...] "AMNH NJ-90", which {{preserved the}} two holotypes, also preserved {{a number of}} other inclusions that give indications as to what the ecology of Archaeomarasmius may have been. Of the approximately forty insect inclusions present, flies in the families Ceratopogonidae and Chironomidae, together with caddisflies of the order Trichoptera, suggest that the mushroom was growing near fresh water. Beetles from the family Elateridae, a termite and a pseudoscorpion, in addition to the mushroom, are indicators of rotting wood, probably from a tree in the <b>Cupressaceae</b> <b>family.</b> Modern Marasmiaceae members are saprobic—obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter—and specimens included with Archaeomarasmius indicate a similar habit for the mushroom.|$|E

30|$|In the Pinaceae, Cupressacaeae (the two {{and only}} {{representatives of the}} {{conifers}} in our study) and Oleaceae, leaf out timing was better explained by species relatedness compared to local climate, indicating that species’ leaf-out strategy within these families is conserved {{as a consequence of}} the constraints of past evolutionary history. Interestingly, both Pinaceae and <b>Cupressaceae</b> <b>families</b> include a large number of evergreen species (in this study, 67 out of 73 and 17 out of 20 in Pinaceae and Cupressaceae, respectively) which are thought to be less sensitive to climatic conditions than deciduous species (Bai et al. 2015). In these evergreen species, leaves from past years can still photosynthesize during early spring. New leaves can therefore develop long after the risk of frost has passed and do not need fine-tuning of their physiological responses to environmental cues (Panchen et al. 2014).|$|R
