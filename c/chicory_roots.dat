The objectives {{of this study}} were: (1) to assess SLRH for two commonly grown root crops in Belgium, i. e. <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and sugar beet, (2) to investigate some factors controlling the spatial and temporal variation of SLRH, and (3) to evaluate the contribution of this sail degradation process to overall soil loss in the study area. Soil losses due to harvesting of witloof <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> were assessed by measuring dirt tare from 43 root samples whereas SLRH for inuline <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and sugar beet were calculated from dirt tare data provided by factories processing these roots. Mean soil loss was 11. 8 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for witloof <b>chicory</b> <b>roots,</b> 8. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for inuline <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> and 9. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for sugar beet. Assuming that root crops are grown once in 2 years in the study area, mean annual SLRH equals 5. 0 ton ha(- 1) year(- 1) (0. 33 mm/year). Since these root crops have been grown {{over a period of}} at least 200 years in Belgium, this implies a mean sail profile truncation of 66 mm. However, important spatial and temporal variability in SLRH data was observed, depending on soil texture, soil moisture at harvest time and harvesting technique.

30|$|A {{reduction}} of skatole {{production in the}} pig hindgut by adding the inulin rich feed component <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> to the diet has been reported (Wesoly and Weiler 2012; Zammerini et al. 2012), and was also observed in the present study. Three main underlying mechanisms behind this effect have been proposed in the literature: (i) a high content of fermentable fiber in the hindgut increases the microbial activity, resulting in more tryptophan incorporated as bacterial biomass and thereby leaving less substrate for skatole production (Jensen et al. 1995; Xu et al. 2002); (ii) an increased butyrate production, due to inulin-type fructans in the diet (Falony et al. 2006), reduces sloughing of enterocytes, whereby less endogenous tryptophan from cell debris is available for skatole production (Claus et al. 2003). Both of these mechanisms result in a reduced level of tryptophan as substrate for skatole production. Therefore, (iii) an altered gut microbiota characterized by a lower abundance of skatole-producing bacteria could be expected when adding high levels of dietary fermentable fiber. However, the present study demonstrated that the skatole-reducing effect of <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> amended-diets is apparently not by inhibiting the growth of skatole-producing bacteria in the pig hindgut.

40|$|Background: Cichorium intybus L. {{commonly}} known as chicory {{is one of the}} important medicinal plants commonly used in Ayurvedic system of medicine. It is commonly used for the treatment of diseases involving a khapa and pitta doshas. Traditionally, C. intybus is used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, but there are only few in vitro studies reporting the anti-inflammatory activity of roots of chicory. Objective: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of roots of chicory and mechanisms involved in it using in vivo models of inflammation. Materials and Methods: Albino Wistar rats of either sex weighing 150 - 200 g were used. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of roots of chicory were prepared with the help of Soxhlet′s apparatus. The anti-inflammatory activity was studied using carrageenan-induced paw edema method and cotton pellet granuloma method. Levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and IL- 1 and activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were estimated. Results: <b>Chicory</b> <b>roots</b> demonstrated significant dose-dependent decrease in paw edema in carrageenan-induced paw edema method. <b>Chicory</b> <b>roots</b> diminished the serum TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 levels. They also significantly attenuated the malonylaldehyde levels and increased the activities of CAT and GPx in paw tissue. Similarly, <b>chicory</b> <b>roots</b> demonstrated a significant decrease in granuloma formation in cotton pellet induced granuloma method. Conclusion: <b>Chicory</b> <b>roots</b> possess anti-inflammatory activity, and this might be due to the inhibition of various cytokines, antioxidant effects, and their free radical scavenging activity...|$|E

In the third trial, intact male pigs were given the dried chicory diet for either 2 or 1 week before slaughter. In all trials the chicory diets were offered on a scale at 0 · 95 of the Danish recommendation for energy intake, and pig performance was compared with a control group given the organic concentrate at 0 · 95 of recommended energy intake plus silage ad libitum. In trial 1 an additional control group was offered the organic concentrate at a daily energy intake level of 1 · 0 of Danish recommendations. The pigs in trials 1, 2, and 3 were slaughtered at an average live weight of 118, 124, and 110 kg, respectively, in order to ensure that they had achieved sexual maturity. Overall, skatole concentrations in blood plasma and backfat at slaughter were reduced to almost zero levels by including crude or dried chicory or inulin in the diet. This occurred irrespective of sex and length of feeding period (1 to 9 weeks). In trial 3 a significant effect on blood plasma concentration was observed after 3 days of feeding a diet containing dried chicory.

In this group, 13 patients showed at least 20 % improvement in the defined response domains of pain, stiffness and global assessment: 9 of 10 (90 %) patients randomized to active treatment with chicory and 4 of 8 (50 %) patients randomized to placebo (P = 0. 06). In general, the treatment was well-tolerated. Only one patient who was treated with the highest dose of chicory had to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event. Conclusions The results of this pilot study suggest that a proprietary bioactive extract of <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> has a potential role in the management of OA and merits further investigation.

40|$|In pigs the endogenously {{produced}} compound androstenone is metabolised in {{the liver}} in two steps by 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD) and sulphotransferase 2 A 1 (SULT 2 A 1). The present study investigated the effect of selected sex-steroids (0. 01 – 1 μM androstenone, testosterone and estradiol), skatole (1 - 100 μM) and secondary plant metabolites (1 – 100 μM) on the expression of 3 β-HSD and SULT 2 A 1 mRNA. Additionally {{the effect of a}} global methanolic extract of dried <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> was investigated and compared to previous obtained in vivo effects. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of piglets (crossbreed: Landrace × Yorkshire and Duroc) and cultured for 24 h before treatment for an additionally 24 h. RNA was isolated from the hepatocytes and specific gene expression determined by RT-PCR using TaqMan probes. The investigated sex-steroids had no effect on the mRNA expression of 3 β-HSD and SULT 2 A 1, while skatole decreased the content of SULT 2 A 1 30 % compared to control. Of the investigated secondary plant metabolites artemisinin and scoparone (found in Artemisia sp.) lowered the content of SULT 2 A 1 by 20 and 30 % compared to control, respectively. Moreover, we tested three secondary plant metabolites (lactucin, esculetin and esculin) found in <b>chicory</b> <b>root.</b> Lactucin increased the mRNA content of both 3 β-HSD and SULT 2 A 1 by 200 % compared to control. An extract of <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> was shown to decrease the expression of both 3 β-HSD and SULT 2 A 1. It is concluded that the gene expression of enzymes with importance for androstenone metabolism is regulated by secondary plant metabolites in a complex manner...|$|R
50|$|Confederate soldiers, on {{the other}} hand, had more access to tobacco than their Union counterparts. While {{opposing}} troops were on picket duty, it was common for Union soldiers to trade their coffee with the Confederate soldiers in exchange for tobacco (away from the eyes of officers). Southern soldiers could also use roasted <b>chicory</b> <b>root</b> as a coffee substitute. The peanut, due to its wide availability throughout southern North America, was also {{an important source of}} food for Confederate soldiers.|$|R
