5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonus,</b> and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E
25|$|During Ferré's administration, Puerto Rico {{was in an}} {{economic}} boom at 7% GDP Growth and the unemployment at 10%, the lowest until 1999.

In 1970, his first wife, Lorencita, died at La Fortaleza after being bed-ridden for years.

500|$|Lane has {{breakfast with}} a member of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, who praises his fiscal track record and asks him to serve as head of the association's fiscal control committee. He accepts. Examining the company {{financial}} records, Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) finds Lane's forged check and accuses Don of giving an unauthorized <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonus.</b> Don calls Lane into his office, shows him the check and serves him a drink. Lane pretends to be ignorant at first, but then apologizes while arguing that he was only taking his own money that he had previously invested and for which he had not been compensated. Don demands his resignation and gives him the weekend to think of an [...] "elegant exit", assuring him that this is the worst part of starting over. Lane wanders over to Joan's (Christina Hendricks) office with the drink still in his hand, but she [...] sends him away after he makes a lewd comment.|$|E
500|$|Playing a close-passing {{game that}} made them better {{able to cope with}} the high winds and blizzards that had caused the {{postponement}} of several League matches, Nottingham Forest earned themselves a <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonus</b> of 10s a man for inflicting Small Heath's first home defeat of the season. Boxing Day produced a 2–0 defeat to a Sheffield Wednesday team playing a better all-round game, and the next day, Small Heath beat a touring Scottish Borderers side 11–1. Injury deprived Small Heath of four regular first-team players for the last game of the year, at home to Liverpool, and both Tilson Pritchard and Ernie Moore made their debuts at full-back. Jenkyns moved back to play behind the other half-backs to protect the understandably nervous reserves, and once the nerves wore off, Pritchard in particular [...] "could scarcely be improved upon." [...] Mobley opened the scoring in the first half, and with the wind behind them in the second half, Small Heath won 3–0 to go into the new year in 10th place in the League.|$|E

5000|$|Employee {{benefits}} included free life insurance, {{two weeks}} paid vacation, and <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonuses</b> {{of up to}} $15 in gold. Only a few Murphy stores were organized by unions, [...] "partially because of intense antiunion campaigns mounted by management, but, more importantly, because many of G. C. Murphy's twenty-three thousand employees didn't feel the need for protection from a company they viewed as benevolent and even generous." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1970, the Armed Forces Vocational Schools and the Vocational Advancement Organization {{extended}} their {{services for the}} first time to conscripts, “so far as military duty permitted.” New enlistment bonuses were authorized and previous bonus schemes were improved, and new pay regulations were introduced that improved the financial situation of military personnel and civil servants. In July 1973, the 3rd Amendment to the Civilian Service Act came into force; “a prerequisite for the creation of additional civilian service places for recognized conscientious objectors.” The amendment provided that men recognized as conscientious objectors while performing military service should immediately be transferred to a civilian service assignment. The maximum amount for servicemen enlisting for at least 12 years was increased from DM 6,000 to DM 9,000, and from October 1971 onwards, long-term personnel were paid grants towards the cost ‘of attending educational institutes of the “second educational route" [...] or participating in state-recognized general education courses provided by private correspondence schools and the “television college."' In 1972, two Bundeswehr universities were established; a reform which, according to one historian, “fought against the closed nature of the military and guaranteed that officers would be better able to successfully interact with the civilian world.” From April 1973, the general maintenance payments under the Law amending the Maintenance Security Act and the Workplace Protection Act were increased, while increases were also made in the special allowance (<b>Christmas</b> <b>bonus)</b> for conscripts, together with the dismissal allowance. The expense allowance for troops on duty-related absence from place of employment was improved, together with travel subsidies and provisions for military service damaged soldiers and their families. In addition, the position of non-commissioned officers was improved.|$|E

50|$|Lane calls a {{partners}} {{meeting to}} announce they can hand out <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonuses</b> {{thanks to a}} $50,000 surplus; however, Don recommends waiting until the Christmas party.

5000|$|By the 1960s, many Buffalo {{family members}} viewed Stefano as a {{paranoid}} and greedy leader who {{could no longer}} be trusted to lead the family.

Frank decides not to press charges and explains the situation to his wife and the authorities, who both scold him for his decision to scrap the bonuses, and decides to reinstate them (with Clark getting an add-on of 20% of his salary).|$|R
50|$|The {{employer}} {{takes out}} additional accident insurance for his employees, costing about an additional €60 per year. The {{cost of the}} accident insurance differs from state to state. Employees of mini jobs must be treated the same as full-time employees, except with cause. If full-time employees receive benefits, part-time employees receive a pro-rata share. A mini job can be taken during the six weeks of maternity leave prior to giving birth and during parental leave. However, the worker {{is not allowed to}} work more than 30 hours a week. <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonuses</b> or holiday pay may cause the €450 limit to be exceeded. The employer must pay tax on such income.|$|R
