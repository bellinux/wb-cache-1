Too much of the focus has been on efficiency: arbitrary cut-off ages provide a simple means for ascertaining a person 2 ̆ 7 s competence to exer- cise rights, but they are not always an accurate means to such an end.

40|$|Modern, {{forensics}} laboratories need Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) implementations {{that allow}} the lab to track evidentiary items through their examination lifecycle and also serve all pertinent laboratory personnel. The research presented here presents LIMS core requirements as viewed by respondents serving in different forensic laboratory capacities as well as different forensic laboratory environments. A product-development methodology was employed to evaluate the relative value of the key features that constitute a LIMS, {{in order to develop}} a set of relative values for these features and the specifics of their implementation. In addition to the results of the product development analysis, this paper also provides an extensive review of LIMS and provides an overview of the preparation and planning process for the successful upgrade or implementation of a LIMS. Analysis of the data indicate that the relative value of LIMS components are viewed differently depending upon respondents' job roles (i. e., evidence technicians, scientists, and lab management), as well as by laboratory size. Specifically, the data show that: (1) Evidence technicians place the most value on chain of evidence capabilities and on chain of custody tracking; (2) Scientists generally place greatest value on report writing and generation, and on tracking daughter evidence that develops during their analyses; (3) Lab. Managers place the greatest value on chain of custody, daughter evidence, and not surprisingly, management reporting capabilities; and (4) Lab size affects LIMS preference in that, while all labs place daughter evidence tracking, chain of <b>custody,</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> and analyst report generation as their top three priorities, the order of this prioritization is size dependent...|$|E

40|$|This thesis’ initial aim is {{to study}} the {{life-cycle}} of metadata from its creation, its development and management and the role they play during digitization processes. Three memory institutions and their respective digitization projects are studied in order {{to know how they}} carry out the digital object production process, what is the life-cycle of metadata, by who, how and when are generated and to know {{what is the best way}} to generate and implement metadata in digitization projects. The research method is based on a qualitative approach and the research strategy is based in case studies. Data were collected with different techniques: documentation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. These questionnaires were sent to 3 key informants (one person for each institution) and subsequently interviews to the same informants were made in order to get deeper and more concrete information. The collected data suggest that most institutions do not have explicit guidelines but follow leading organizations’ standards. Because of the use of standards no institution had to cope with interoperability problems. Also in the opinion of respondents digitizing and creating metadata is not a remarkable challenge, they perceive it as another process among others. Considering the problems or challenges the informants stated to have, the emphasis can be put on budget. That is probably the aspect that most influences on the result, the institution with no budget limitations is the one that best and more complete metadata generates. Also budget has appeared to be a problem for preservation, and the institution with lower budget availability had to delegate the <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of its preservation copies to another institution.

40|$|What {{is unique}} in terms of “trusted digital preservation” in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry? What are the specific legal and regulatory requirements {{and what are the}} typical types of data concerned in the core business processes of research, development and manufacturing? Life science is a “high-risk industry”. While products are targeted to treat illness and prolong lives they can also be life-threatening if used wrongly. In order to gain approval for marketing authorizations, terabytes of data and documentation are being generated to prove efficacy and safety of a compound. This data will be subject to regulatory review before an approval is granted. Global Good Practice and resulting national regulations require the retention of vital data up to several generations of software and hardware. This paper discusses some of these problems, drawing on the experience of building practical solutions {{in the context of an}} example in the area of registration documentation. Data in Pharmaceutical Industry The life cycle of a typical pharmaceutical product spans over several decades from first discovery through development to marketing authorization and distribution until the product is withdrawn from the market. Even after decades old compounds may be rediscovered for use in new indications. In addition, during the life time of a compound, terabytes of data and resulting documentation (records) are being generated to support the marketing authorization and further extensions to this authorization. Multiple partners are normally included in the development of a drug including third parties. An actual discovery may have happened in a small biotech company or university off-spring, development activities are then spread over several Contract Research Organizations (CROs), while the marketing may be shared by two Pharma companies and production could be done as toll manufacturing. This shows how broad the variety of sources and originators of data production may be, indicating potential issues of <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of data ownership through time. Not less is the variety of types of data which are generated by very specific (and often proprietary) systems and high tech equipment...|$|E
