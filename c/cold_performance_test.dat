40|$|The IRAS {{mission is}} the result of an {{international}} project involving the cooperation of the U. S., the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. The Infrared Astronmical Satellite was placed into orbit on January 25, 1983. Its main function is to provide a survey of the entire sky as viewed in four octaves of infrared radiation in the wavelenth region from 8 to 120 microns. The cylindrical structure of the satellite contains a large dewar vessel with 70 liters of superfluid helium. The helium has the function to maintain the contents of the vessel at 2. 5 K {{for the duration of the}} mission. The IRAS optics is a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 24 inches aperture. Because of the operational requirements of the mission, it had been specified that all optical components should be beryllium.

40|$|The {{demonstrator}} is {{a prototype}} of {{the first section of}} the proposed cw-LINAC@GSI, comprising a superconducting CH-cavity embedded by two superconducting solenoids. The sc CH-structure is the key component and offers a variety of research and development. The beam focusing solenoids provide maximum fields of 9. 3 T at an overall length of 380 mm and a free beam aperture of 30 mm. The magnetic induction of the fringe is minimized to 50 mT at the inner NbTi-surface of the neighboring cavity. The fabrication of the key components is still in progress and is near to completion. After <b>cold</b> <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> of the RF cavity, the helium jacket will be welded on. The cryostat is partly assembled and will be finished in the next weeks.

40|$|Two {{new test}} benches have been {{developed}} for the combined measurement of the thermal properties and overall optical efficiencies of receivers for the use in parabolic trough collectors. In the first test bench two receivers are simultaneously irradiated by natural sunlight via parabolic troughs that are mounted on a two axis tracking stage. Shutters enable the variation of the aperture for quasi constant solar input power over the test period. The second, the solar simulator test bench consists of an elliptical cylinder with flat end reflectors. Metal halide lamps (HMI) and the receiver are positioned in the two respective focal lines. The test benches are operated in two modes: <b>Cold</b> <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> with water flow through the receiver at near ambient temperature in order to measure the optical efficiency in the stationary enthalpy increase, secondly hot testing with the empty receiver at typical operating temperature in order to compare irradiant power and steady state thermal loss power and calculate the efficiency.

40|$|On February 3, 1994, IMPCO Technologies, Inc. {{started the}} {{development}} of a dedicated LPG Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) under contract to the Midwest Research Institute National Renewable Energy Laboratory Division (NREL). The objective was to develop a dedicated propane vehicle that would meet or exceed the California ULEV emissions standards. The project is broken into four phases to be performed over a two year period. The four phases of the project include: (Phase 1) system design, (Phase 2) prototype hardware assembly and testing, (Phase 3) full-scale systems testing and integration, (Phase 4) vehicle demonstration. This report describes the approach taken for {{the development of}} the vehicle and the work performed through the completion of Phase II dynamometer test results. Work was started on Phase 2 (Hardware Assembly and Prototype Testing) in May 1994 prior to completion of Phase 1 to ensure that long lead items would be available in a timely fashion for the Phase 2 work. In addition, the construction and testing of the interim electronic control module (ECM), which was used to test components, was begun prior to the formal start of Phase 2. This was done so that the shortened revised schedule for the project (24 months) could be met. In this report, a brief summary of the activities of each combined Phase 1 and 2 tasks will be presented, as well as project management activities. A technical review of the system is also given, along with test results and analysis. During the course of Phase 2 activities, IMPCO staff also had the opportunity to conduct <b>cold</b> start <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> of the injectors.

Three different self-reports and a <b>performance</b> <b>test</b> were used to measure physical performance. Additionally, rating of perceived exertion was measured after the subjects lifted a reference weight to predict maximal lifting performance. The controls were age, gender, educational level, subject’s participation in fitness, availability of reference data, motivation, attitude, general self-efficacy, and mood.
