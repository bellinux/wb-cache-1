25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of S. pneumoniae to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the prime}} {{problems}} of immunology today deals with {{the potential of the}} immune <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> to produce antibody of a given specificity. In studying this problem, we are faced with three principal possibilities: (a) The <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> has a limited amount of information in its genome which confers upon it the ability to synthesize antibody to one or a very few antigenic determinants (1 - 5). (b) The <b>cell</b> <b>competent</b> to produce antibody is omniscient; that is, its genome codes for all necessary sequences observed in the varied antibody response of the organism (6, 7). (c) The immune <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> does not possess in its genome any information for specific antibody, and the specificity is conferred in an "instructional " manner, at a higher (transcription, translation, etc.) level (8). One possible approach to differentiate between the first mechanism and the two others is the study of antibody formation by single cells. Evidently, if after immunization with two arbitrarily chosen antigens, each immune <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> can form antibodies of more than one specificity, this will exclude the first possibility as the cellular basis for antibody production.

40|$|A {{thorough}} examination of cotransformation of two unlinked genetic markers in Bacillus subtilis 168 {{shows that the}} two recombinational events do not occur randomly. The cotransformation frequency {{is dependent on the}} distance between the two markers {{as well as on the}} order in which they replicate in the <b>competent</b> <b>cell.</b> These results indicate that uptake and/or integration of DNA molecules bearing these genetic markers is enhanced at the time these markers replicate in the <b>competent</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Artificial {{competence}} can {{be induced}} in laboratory procedures that involve making the cell passively permeable to DNA by exposing it to conditions {{that do not}} normally occur in nature. Typically the cells are incubated in a solution containing divalent cations (often calcium chloride) under cold conditions, before being exposed to a heat pulse (heat shock). Calcium chloride partially disrupts the cell membrane, which allows the recombinant DNA enter the host cell. Cells {{that are able to}} take up the DNA are called <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In calcium {{chloride}} transformation, the cells are prepared by chilling {{cells in the}} presence of [...] (in [...] solution), making the cell become permeable to plasmid DNA. The cells are incubated on ice with the DNA, and then briefly heat-shocked (e.g., at 42°C for 30–120 seconds). [...] This method works very well for circular plasmid DNA. [...] Non-commercial preparations should normally give 106 to 107 transformants per microgram of plasmid; a poor preparation will be about 104/μg or less, but a good preparation of <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> can give up to ~108 colonies per microgram of plasmid. Protocols, however, exist for making supercompetent cells that may yield a transformation efficiency of over 109. The chemical method, however, usually does not work well for linear DNA, such as fragments of chromosomal DNA, probably because the cell's native exonuclease enzymes rapidly degrade linear DNA. [...] In contrast, cells that are naturally competent are usually transformed more efficiently with linear DNA than with plasmid DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{differences}} in structure of the cell envelope between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, there are some differences in the mechanisms of DNA uptake in these cells, however most of them share common features that involve related proteins. [...] The DNA first binds {{to the surface of}} the <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> on a DNA receptor, and passes through the cytoplasmic membrane via DNA translocase. Only single-stranded DNA may pass through, the other strand being degraded by nucleases in the process. [...] The translocated single-stranded DNA may then be integrated into the bacterial chromosomes by a RecA-dependent process. [...] In Gram-negative cells, due to the presence of an extra membrane, the DNA requires the presence of a channel formed by secretins on the outer membrane. Pilin may be required for competence, but its role is uncertain. The uptake of DNA is generally non-sequence specific, although in some species the presence of specific DNA uptake sequences may facilitate efficient DNA uptake.|$|E

40|$|Haemophilus influenzae Rd 9 {{lysogenic}} for temperate bacteriophage N 3 {{was found}} to be virtually nontransformable and nontransfectable. This inhibition of transformation and transfection was due partly to the decreased capacity of <b>competent</b> lysogenic <b>cells</b> for irreversible binding of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and partly to some events taking place after adsorption of the DNA.

40|$|Lysogenic {{strains of}} Bacillus subtilis 168 were reduced in {{their level of}} {{transformation}} as compared to non-lysogenic strains. The level of transformation decreased even further if the <b>competent</b> lysogenic <b>cells</b> were allowed to incubate in growth media prior to selection on minimal agar. This reduction {{in the frequency of}} transformation was attributable to the selective elimination of transformed lysogenic <b>cells</b> from the <b>competent</b> population. Concurrent with the {{decrease in the number of}} transformants from a lysogenic competent population was the release of bacteriophage by these cells. The lysogenic bacteria demonstrated this dramatic release of bacteriophage only if the cells were grown to competence. Both the selective elimination of transformed lysogens and the induction of prophage was prevented by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Additionally, <b>competent</b> lysogenic <b>cells</b> released significantly higher amounts of exogenous donor transforming deoxyribonucleic acid than did <b>competent</b> non-lysogenic <b>cells</b> or <b>competent</b> lysogenic <b>cells</b> incubated with erythromycin. These data establish that the induction of the prophage from the <b>competent</b> lysogenic <b>cells</b> was responsible for the selective elmination of the lysogenic transformants. A model is presented that accounts for the induction of the prophage from competent lysogenic bacteria via the induction of a repair system. It is postulated that a repair system is induced or derepressed by the accumulation of gaps in the chromosomes of competent bacteria. This hypothetical enzyme(s) is ultimately responsible for the induction of the prophage and the selective elimination of transformants...|$|R

40|$|In a cloned copy of comG open {{reading frame}} 3 (ORF 3), an {{in-frame}} deletion was generated by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis, removing the coding sequence for 15 amino acids from the central portion of this pilin-related protein. The mutagenized ORF 3 was incorporated into the Bacillus subtilis chromosome, replacing the wild-type ORF 3. The presence of the deleted ORF 3 in the chromosome, as confirmed by Southern analysis, {{was associated with the}} complete loss of competence by the mutant strain. The ability of the mutant cells to bind exogenous radiolabeled DNA was reduced to the level of nonspecific binding of DNA by noncompetent cells. The chromosomal ORF 3 mutation was partially complemented in trans by a plasmid-encoded wild-type ORF 3 copy under PSPAC control upon induction of the PSPAC promoter. Using antiserum raised against a synthetic 14 -mer oligopeptide deduced from the ORF 3 sequence, an immunoreactive band of approximately the expected molecular size was obtained in Western blot (immunoblot) experiments with extracts of cells containing the plasmid-encoded inducible gene. A signal was also detected when cells harboring the chromosomal wild-type or mutant ORF 3 in single copy were grown in competence medium.

50|$|Error prone PCR {{utilizes}} {{the fact}} that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication.
