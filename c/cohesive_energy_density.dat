40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an improved}} method of parameterizing the Groot-Warren version of Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) by exploiting a correspondence between DPD and Scatchard-Hildebrand regular solution theory. The new parameterization scheme widens {{the realm of}} applicability of DPD by first removing the restriction of equal repulsive interactions between like beads, and second, by relating all conservative interactions between beads directly to <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities.</b> We establish the correspondence by deriving an expression for the Helmoltz free energy of mixing obtaining a heat of mixing which {{is exactly the same}} form as that for a regular mixture (quadratic in the volume fraction) and an entropy of mixing which reduces to the ideal entropy of mixing for equal molar volumes. We equate the conservative interaction parameters in the DPD force law to the <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> of the pure fluids providing an alternative method of calculating the self-interaction parameters as well as a route to the cross-interaction parameter. We validate the new parameterization by modelling the binary system: SnI 4 /SiCl 4, which displays liquid-liquid coexistence below an upper critical solution temperature around 140 °C. A series of DPD simulations were conducted at a set of temperatures ranging from 0 °C to above the experimental upper critical solution temperature using conservative parameters based on extrapolated experimental data. These simulations can be regarded as being equivalent to a quench from a high temperature to a lower one at constant volume. Our simulations recover the expected phase behaviour ranging from solid-liquid coexistence to liquid-liquid co-existence and eventually leading to a homogeneous single phase system. The results yield a binodal curve in close agreement with one predicted using regular solution theory, but, significantly, in closer agreement with actual solubility measurements...|$|R

For blends of chemically-similar polymers, the entropic portion of χ, arising from non-ideal local packing, becomes more significant. Using polymer field theory, Fredrickson et al. predicted that a difference in backbone stiffness can result in a positive χ for chains consisting of chemically-identical monomers. To quantitatively investigate this phenomenon, we perform molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for bead-spring chains, which differ only in stiffness. From the simulations, we apply a novel thermodynamic integration to extract χ as low as 10 - 4 per monomer for blends with stiffness mismatch. To compare with experiments, we introduce a standardized effective monomer to map real polymers onto our bead-spring chains.

40|$|Extended Hildebrand {{solubility}} {{approach is}} used to estimate the solubility of satranidazole in binary solvent systems. The solubility of satranidazole in various propylene glycol-water mixtures was analyzed in terms of solute-solvent interactions using {{a modified version of}} Hildebrand-Scatchard treatment for regular solutions. The solubility equation employs term interaction energy (W) to replace the geometric mean (δ 1 δ 2), where δ 1 and δ 2 are the <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> for the solvent and solute, respectively. The new equation provides an accurate prediction of solubility once the interaction energy, W, is obtained. In this case, the energy term is regressed against a polynomial in δ 1 of the binary mixture. A quartic expression of W in terms of solvent solubility parameter was found for predicting the solubility of satranidazole in propylene glycol-water mixtures. The expression yields an error in mole fraction solubility of ~ 3. 74 %, a value approximating that of the experimentally determined solubility. The method has potential usefulness in preformulation and formulation studies during which solubility prediction is important for drug design...|$|R

Different mixtures containing APIs (theophylline or ibuprofen) and water soluble (triethyl citrate) or water insoluble plasticizer (acetyltributyl citrate or dibutyl sebacate) dissolved/dispersed in a cationic polymethacrylate (Eudragit® RS) were studied.

Therefore {{they are of}} great interest to explain the glass to rubber transition and to help to elucidate the different binder fractions and their specialized hindrances in molecular mobility. In a first step the van-der-Waals and electrostatic interactions between binders and plasticizers will be considered. Using the program package Materials StudioTM (MS) version 6 of company Accelrys an atomistic simulation of such interactions is possible. The substances used are hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), dioctyl adipate (DOA) and polypropylene oxide (PPO), which serves as a first step towards GAP (glycidyl azide polymer).

Vapor pressure predictions {{are required to}} determine the gas-particle partitioning of such organic compounds. We present here a method based on atomistic simulations combined with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to predict the liquid vapor pressure, enthalpies of vaporization, and heats of sublimation of atmospheric organic compounds. The resulting temperature-dependent vapor pressure equation {{is a function of}} the heat of vaporization at the normal boiling point [¢Hvap(Tb) ], normal boiling point (Tb), and the change in heat capacity (liquid to gas) of the compound upon phase change [¢Cp(Tb) ]. We show that heats of vaporization can be estimated from calculated <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> (CED) of the pure compound obtained from multiple sampling molecular dynamics. The simulation method (CED) uses a generic force field (Dreiding) and molecular models with atomic charges determined from quantum mechanics. The heats of vaporization of five dicarboxylic acids [malonic (C 3), succinic (C 4), glutaric (C 5), adipic (C 6), and pimelic (C 7) ] are calculated at 500 K.

Vapor pressures of the five dicarboxylic acids are also predicted using the derived Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Predicted liquid vapor pressures agree well with available literature data with an averaged error of 29 %, while the predicted solid vapor pressures at ambient temperature differ considerably from a recent study by Bilde et al.

We recognize the inherent limitations of c_ 12 due to its very definition, which is based on the assumption of no volume of mixing (true for incompressible systems), one of the assumptions in the random mixing approximation (RMA); no such limitations are present in the identification of c^P. We point out that the other severe restriction on c_ 12 is the use of pure components in its definition because of which c_ 12 is not merely controlled by mutual interactions. Another quantity c_ 12 ^SRS as a measure of mutual <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> that does not suffer from the above limitations of c_ 12 is introduced.

40|$|Enthalpy/entropy {{compensation}} {{is a general}} issue of intermolecular binding processes when {{the interaction between the}} partners can be roughly modelled with a single harmonic potential. Whereas linear H/S correlations are wished for by experimentalists, and often graphically justified, no inflexible law of thermodynamics supports the latter statement. On the contrary, the non-directional Ford's approach suggests logarithmic H/S relationships, which can be linearized only over narrow enthalpy/entropy ranges. Predictions covering larger domains require mathematical mapping obeying specific boundary conditions which are not compatible with linear plots. The analysis of solvent-free melting processes operating in six different classes of organic and inorganic materials shows that reciprocal Hill plots are acceptable functions for correlating melting enthalpies and entropies. The combination of H/S compensation with the observed linear dependence of the <b>cohesive</b> free <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> with respect to the melting temperature eventually provides an unprecedented interdependence between melting temperatures and molar volumes.

Particle sizes of rifampicin-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles (R-PLGA), rifampicin alone, and lactose and maltodextrin carrier particles (bulk and 75 - 125 -μm sieved fractions) were determined by electron microscopy for the projected area diameter (Dp) and laser diffraction for the volume diameter (Dv). Surface energies (Y) of R-PLGA, rifampicin alone, lactose, and maltodextrin were obtained by inverse phase gas chromatography, surface areas (Sa) by N 2 adsorption, and <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> by calculation. Particle dispersion was evaluated (Andersen nonviable impactor) for 10 % blends of R-PLGA and rifampicin alone with bulk and sieved fractions of the carriers. Dp for R-PLGA and rifampicin alone was 3. 02 and 2. 83 μm, respectively. Dv was 13 ± 1 and 2 ± 1 μm for R-PLGA and rifampicin alone, respectively, indicating that R-PLGA was more aggregated. This was evident in Y of 35 ± 1 and 19 ± 6 mJ/m 2 for R-PLGA and rifampicin alone. Dp for lactose and maltodextrin (sieved and bulk) was approximately 40 mm. Bulk maltodextrin (Dv= 119 ± 6 mm) was more aggregated than bulk lactose (Dv= 54 ± 2 mm). This was a result of the higher Sa for maltodextrin (0. 54 m 2 /g) than for lactose (0. 21 m 2 /g).

By attaching CO 2 -philic groups to polymer chains, previously insoluble polymers have exhibited miscibility with CO 2, allowing for applications such as emulsion polymerization, dispersion polymerization, dissolution of proteins, extraction of heavy metals, and other processes. Unfortunately, the most successful CO 2 -philes, the fluorinated polymers, have a very unfavorable economic drawback that makes their commercial use impractical. As a result, this work seeks to determine the characteristics that could be built into a carbon based polymer {{to allow for the}} polymer to be miscible with CO 2 down to low pressures. Several design elements were considered in this work: the <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> the free volume, and the Lewis acid/base interactions with CO 2 acting as a Lewis acid. Lowering the <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> and increasing the free volume limited undesirable polymer-polymer interactions, while the addition of Lewis base groups to the polymer in the backbone and as grafted side chains increased the favorable polymer-CO 2 interactions. Several side chains containing Lewis base groups were first grafted onto silicon-backbone polymers. The effects of the grafting and degree of substitution were determined, and the best performing side chains were then grafted onto a polyether backbone to investigate their interactions with the carbon/oxygen backbone. This work made clear the importance of adding optimal amounts of a Lewis base group to the polymer, whether in the backbone or as a grafted side chain. While attaining a low <b>cohesive</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> and maintaining a low glass transition temperature are important, polymers with these features alone performed very poorly in CO 2. The addition of Lewis base groups in the backbone or as a side chain dramatically improved the solubility of the polymers and showed the importance of favorable polymer-CO 2 interactions.
