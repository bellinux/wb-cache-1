50|$|According to the USDA, an {{international}} group of cotton industry representatives met 1907 in Atlanta, Georgia to address serious problems that had {{developed in the}} marketing of cotton. A resolution was passed which recommended the establishment of uniform cotton standards to “eliminate price differences between markets, provide a means of settling disputes, make the farmer more cognizant {{of the value of}} his product, and, therefore, put him in a better bargaining position, and in general be of great benefit to the cotton trade.” In response to this and similar calls for action over the next several years, laws were passed authorizing the USDA to develop cotton grade standards and offer <b>cotton</b> <b>classification</b> services.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the identification of}} trash objects in cotton using machine vision-based systems. Soft computing techniques such as neural networks and fuzzy inference systems can classify trash objects into individual categories such as bark, stick, leaf, and pepper trash types with great accuracies. High speed trash measurements, enables the implementation of these techniques for on-line identification of trash. This identification of trash objects to individual categories {{can be used for}} the dynamic allocation of trash extraction equipment during the ginning process. Such a system can be implemented in a modern gin, to configure an optimal set of equipment during ginning to produce quality <b>cotton.</b> <b>Classification</b> of cotton in real-time allows for an automated means for assignment of trash grades to cotton, and could {{have a significant impact on}} the cotton industry...|$|E

40|$|Cotton is a {{significant}} cash crop of China. Timely and accurate cotton area and yield estimation is useful for management decisions related to the cotton procurement and sales. This study is a first research on cotton area and yield estimation based on remote sensing at Zhanhua County {{which is one of}} the high-quality cotton production demonstration bases of China. After normalization of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series derived from Huanjin 1 A/B satellite (HJ- 1 A/B), decision tree classifier was used to identify the cotton, and then K-Means classifier was applied to estimate cotton yield. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 95 % for the cotton area estimation and 91 % for the <b>cotton</b> yield <b>classification.</b> With further validation, it suggests that this method can be used to timely achieve the cotton area and growth information of this region...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} spectrum of a platinum {{hollow cathode lamp}} has been recently recorded {{by means of a}} grating spectrograph at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (N. I. S. T.) and by Fourier transform spectrometry at Kitt Peak National Observatory and at Laboratoire Aimé <b>Cotton.</b> The <b>classification</b> of Pt I lines is revised and extended. One hundred-nineteen new energy levels {{have been added to the}} 83 earlier ones, four of which are assigned revised J-values. Seventy percent of the levels are interpreted theoretically by means of Slater-Condon type calculations of (5 d + 6 s) 10, 5 d 96 d, 5 d 97 s, 5 d 97 d, 5 d 98 s and (5 d 96 p + 5 d 86 s 6 p + 5 d 76 s 26 p + 5 d 97 p). The ionisation limit 5 d 9 2 D 5 / 2 at 72 230 ± 50  cm- 1 (8. 956 ± 0. 006  eV) has been derived from 5 d 9 ns, 5 d 96 f and 5 d 86 s 5 f levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{training}} stage of a supervised classification should account for {{the properties of the}} classifier to be used. Consideration of the way the classifier operates may enable the training stage to be designed in a manner which ensures that the aim of the classification is satisfied {{with the use of a}} small, inexpensive, training set. It may, therefore, be possible to reduce the training set size requirements from that generally expected with the use of standard heuristics. Substantial reductions in training set size may be possible if interest is focused on a single class. This is illustrated for mapping cotton in north-western India by support vector machine type classifiers. Four approaches to reducing training set size were used: intelligent selection of the most informative training samples, selective class exclusion, acceptance of imprecise descriptions for spectrally distinct classes and the adoption of a one-class classifier. All four approaches were able to reduce the training set size required considerably below that suggested by conventional widely used heuristics without significant impact on the accuracy with which the class of interest was classified. For example, reductions in training set size of ? 90 % from that suggested by a conventional heuristic are reported with the accuracy of <b>cotton</b> <b>classification</b> remaining nearly constant at ? 95 % and ? 97 % from the user's and producer's perspectives respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Differences {{among native}} cottons {{which have been}} {{recognized}} the textile industry for many years, and have {{formed the basis for}} <b>Cotton</b> <b>classification</b> in commerce and ultimate utilization, include Factors such as fiber length, fineness and spinnability. Recent, detailed investigations have established that, in addition, cotton types wary in their fundamental mechanical properties. The object of the present work has been to ascertain whether the variation in fiber properties are due to differences which exist at the ultrafine and molecular levels of the structure. Furthermore, with the advent of man-made fibers, modifications of the properties of natural fibers has become a compelling requirement, for their survival in the competitive world markets; and for this reason a detailed study {{of the structure of the}} cotton fiber has particular relevance. The ultrafine and molecular structure of several varieties of cottons have been examined by means of transmission electron micro-scope and X-ray and electron diffraction techniques. It has been possible to establish that there are no significant differences in: (i) the size of the particles (obtained after hydrolysis) whose dimensions may be taken to represent the combined crystalline and Para-crystalline regions, and (ii) the crystal structure (cellulose I), between different cotton types. X-ray studies have shown that differences in the orientation of the 'crystallites' I have an effect on the mechanical properties of the fiber. Thus, the evidence leads to the conclusion that variation in fiber properties are due to differences at higher (fibrillar) levels of structural organization. Electron diffraction results have conclusively shown the inadequacies of the widely accepted model for the fundamental structural unit of crystalline cellulose I (unit cell), proposed by Meyer and Misch on the basis of X-ray diffraction studies. A possible unit cell to fit the observed data, from electron (and X-ray) diffraction, has been postulated, even though a detailed elaboration of a unit cell for cellulose I was outside the scope of this work. The present study has laid the foundations for further |investigations into the structure of cotton fibres at the fibrillar level and a more rigorous study of the unit cell of native cellulose means of electron diffraction.
