5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|The attacks {{succeeded in}} {{permanently}} destroying 90% {{of the facilities}} struck and <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> out power in North Korea for two weeks, as well as reducing available power to northeast China by 23%. North Korea, however, built new facilities but did not restore its previous capacity until after the armistice in 1953. Their effect on the truce talks was also nil, as highly publicized repercussions in both the UK and the United States Congress undermined their impact.|$|E

25|$|A December 1957 strike {{shut down}} {{much of the}} BMT Division. Brighton Local trains ran in two sections, from Coney Island via tunnel to 57th Street-Seventh Avenue and from Whitehall Street to Jamaica–179th Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Due to the differing unions predominating on the various divisions, the IND was <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> out of service, while the IRT ran {{virtually}} normal service. The BMT was about half affected, with makeshift service patterns being {{set up for the}} duration of the strike.|$|E
25|$|Olympique Lyonnais began {{play at the}} Gerland in 1950 {{and have}} {{remained}} at the stadium since. The stadia originally had a cycling track, but was removed to increase the seating capacity to 50,000. In 1984, minor renovations {{were made to the}} stadium by architect Rene Gagis. This included construction of the Jean Bouin and Jean Jaurès stands. Further renovations were needed to prepare the stadium for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as by that time FIFA had mandated that all stadiums used for international matches, including the World Cup, had to be all-seated. The north and south stands, known as the Jean Jaurès and Jean Bouin stand, respectively, were <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> down and rebuilt, and the athletics track that had remained, even after the cycling track had been removed, was taken out. The renovations were done by architect Albert Constantin. The new incarnation of Gerland has a maximum capacity of 40,500.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{blind and}} unable to {{effectively}} fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes {{by most of the}} ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima, beginning around midnight on 15 November. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 26 hits—some of which did not explode—that <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to South Dakota as to, [...] "render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent." [...] South Dakotas crew casualties were 39killed and 59wounded, and she turned away from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo's lookouts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the heat}} of the battle, Major Carden lost his nerve and {{surrendered}} his command to one of his junior officers. This was a major turning point for the Americans. At one point, Capt. Rousselet of the Legion infantry led a charge and forced many Sumter's men back. Lack of ammunition made it impossible for Sumter to <b>completely</b> <b>knock</b> out the British. The battle raged for 3 hours without pause, causing many men to faint from the heat and thirst.|$|R

But Sedan was really great, and I will pick no holes. The batteries under fire, the red-cross folk, the county charge - perhaps, above all, Major Bouroche and the operations, all beyond discussion; and every word about the Emperor splendid.|$|R
2500|$|One {{vehicle was}} {{assembled}} from a <b>Completely</b> <b>Knocked</b> Down (CKD) kit by Australian Motor Industries in Port Melbourne, Victoria, Australia for evaluation purposes. AMI assembled and marketed other AMC models (AMX, Hornet, Javelin, and Matador) in Australia. It was branded as a [...] "Rambler" [...] Gremlin (AMI-made AMCs were branded as Ramblers) and {{powered by the}} standard [...] I6 with three-speed manual transmission. The car featured right-hand drive and the mandated percentage of locally produced content.|$|E
2500|$|The compact Rambler Americans were {{exported}} {{from the}} U.S. and Canada, {{as well as}} produced in other markets by AMC subsidiaries or assembled under license. It was manufactured in Australia, Iran, Mexico, and in Argentina, an offspring of the third generation American restyled by Pininfarina, the IKA Torino, later Renault Torino, was developed and made between 1966 and 1982. In Iran it was assembled from <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> down (CKD) kits and the models were named Aria [...] and Shahin. Rambler Americans were built in South Africa starting in 1961 by Stanley Motors (controlled by the Rootes Group) and from 1964 by American Motors South Africa (Pty) Ltd.|$|E
2500|$|... 4-door {{sedan and}} station wagon Rebels from CKD (<b>Completely</b> <b>Knocked</b> Down) kits were {{assembled}} by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Australian models {{were made with}} a RHD version of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and two-dial instrument pack rather than the North American dash and rectangular speedo. The dash and cluster were reused for all subsequent models, including the Matador. The cars were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in Australia. Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights fitted in the boot (trunk) lid to 1969 and amber lenses fitted behind the clear reverse lenses on 1970 models, as flashing red indicators were barred in Australia. Also in Australia, numerous other parts and components such as brakes, seats, carpet, lights, heaters, etc. were sourced locally to gain tariff concessions. As AMI also assembled Toyota vehicles, some parts used on the AMI Rebels were sourced from Toyota.|$|E

While speaking on This Morning, Cavanagh revealed her character is unaware of why Brian is not as excited about the pregnancy as she is. The actress said [...] "Obviously they've been trying extremely hard to make babies! It's going to <b>completely</b> <b>knock</b> her for six." [...] The couple visit Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor) at the medical centre looking for an explanation. Doctor Carter reveals that a vasectomy is not always 100% effective.

50|$|The Ontos crews {{liked the}} vehicle, and its commanders praised it. The {{relatively}} light {{weight of the}} M50s meant that they could also go where tanks got bogged down. The Ontos, with its lower ground pressure, could drag timbers up to the tanks to help get them unstuck. In one operation, the Ontos was the only tracked vehicle light enough to cross a pontoon bridge. In the Battle of Hue, Regimental Commander Colonel Stanley S. Hughes felt the Ontos was the most effective of all Marine supporting arms. Its mobility made it less vulnerable than tanks, which suffered heavy losses, while at ranges of 300 to 500 yd, its recoilless rifles could knock holes in or <b>completely</b> <b>knock</b> down walls. The appearance of an Ontos was sometimes {{enough to make the}} enemy break and run, and anecdotal accounts describe the enemy fleeing occupied buildings when an Ontos's spotting round entered a window. In Operation Desoto, the introduction of the large CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter made possible moving a platoon 25 mi south of Quan Ngai City carrying Ontos in slings underneath the aircraft.|$|R
