As a software platform for assessing the fire danger the geographic information systems with a number of plugins were used. To assess the forest fire danger it is suggested to calculate the spectral indices and surface temperat ure according to the satellite imagery.

A risk cartogram for fires was developed with the help of the ArcGIS 10. 1 software, by the generation of maps of slope, aspects and land use. These maps were intercrossed, enabling the determination of the areas most susceptible to fires. Tested methodologies varied in the form of assigning grades to each predictor <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> as well as in the division of risk classes.

Finally, a brief look at the etymologies reveals that there are very few terms that can be securely traced back to proto-Indo-European.

As well, using fire map data interpreted from Landsat imagery (both MSS and TM) and NOAA-AVHRR for two of these scene areas, the size <b>class</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> was determined principally to assess the reliability <b>of</b> mapping small <b>fires</b> with NOAA-AVHRR imagery.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} comparing the cost effectiveness of two ways <b>of</b> improving the <b>fire</b> protection in a community: the installation of detection-alarm systems (DAS) in dwellings and the addition <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> companies. The method is developed {{from a number of}} relatively simple models and assumptions. One is a relationship that predicts average travel time from the number <b>of</b> "covered" <b>fire</b> stations {{and the size of the}} area being served. A second is a set of regressions of the percentage of the property value destroyed vs. response time for five <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> in one- and two-family homes. And a third is the effect of installing detection-alarm systems on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> among the five classes at the time <b>of</b> detection. Adding <b>fire</b> companies increases the number of covered stations, thus reducing response time, and thence expected loss. Installing detectors increases the proportion <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> in the less serious classes, thus reducing expected loss. The method was applied to data from Calgary, Canada. The results for this case show that, from a base case with no DAS and 16 fire stations, adding detectors would be more cost effective than adding fire stations to reduce fire losses if a DAS for a one- or two-family home costs less than $ 2500 to install and $ 1700 a year to maintain (or the equivalent cost mix using present values). The methodology can be extended to other types of occupancies (e. g., high-rise buildings and commercial properties), and to other types of losses (e. g., indirect and life). It could then become a useful tool in helping to choose fire protection levels for a community, as well as determining how to allocate a given amount of resources among different means <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> protection. government: services, fire, policy analysis, facilities/equipment planning...|$|R
