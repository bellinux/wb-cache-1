Five freight trains {{that would have}} run via the classic lines were diverted to run over the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link instead: three southbound intermodal trains on 3 April 2004 and two northbound intermodal trains on 4 April 2004.|$|E
5|$|Waterloo International {{closed on}} 13 November 2007 when the Eurostar service {{transferred}} to the new St Pancras railway station {{with the opening of}} the second phase of High Speed 1, also known as the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link. Ownership of the former Waterloo International terminal then passed to BRB (Residuary) Limited.|$|E
5|$|The next {{plan for}} the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link {{involved}} a tunnel reaching London from the south-east, and an underground terminus {{in the vicinity of}} King's Cross station. A late change in the plans, principally driven by the then Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine's desire for urban regeneration in east London, led to a change of route, with the new line approaching London from the east. This opened the possibility of reusing the underused St Pancras station as the terminus, with access via the North London Line that crosses the throat of the station.|$|E
50|$|A cross <b>channel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1802 and construction actually started in 1881 before being abandoned. Roll-on Roll-off ferry services provided links across the channel for vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Port of Dover is the world's busiest {{passenger}} port, with 16 million travellers, 2.1 million lorries, 2.8 {{million cars}} and motorcycles and 86,000 coaches passing through it each year. P&O Ferries is the UK's largest ferry operator at Dover. Built in 1994, the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is a <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> linking Folkestone, Kent, in England with Coquelles in northern France, beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. The <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> stretches 31 miles, {{and at its}} lowest point the tunnel is 250 feet undersea. The tunnel carries high-speed Eurostar passenger trains, the Eurotunnel Shuttle for road vehicles—the largest such transport in the world—and international freight trains.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} of human habitation around Ashford since the Iron Age, with a barrow {{on what is}} now Barrow Hill dating back to 1500 BC. Two axes from the Lower Paleolithic period have been found near Ashford. During {{the construction of the}} Park Farm estate in the late 1990s, excavation in the area revealed tools from the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic period dating back to the 7th century BC. A number of other Mesolithic tools were discovered during construction of the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link through Ashford.|$|E
5|$|By the 1780s, {{local farmers}} {{had begun to}} hold {{informal}} market days, and advertised the town's ideal location between London, Chatham and the Kent Coast. The market {{was held in the}} High Street until 1856, when local farmers and businessmen relocated to Elwick Road and formed a market company that is the oldest surviving registered company in England and Wales. There is still a regular street market in the town, but the market company relocated outside Ashford town centre after part of the 19th-century site was demolished {{to make way for the}} <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link. It is still used by around 5,000 farmers.|$|E

40|$|Public-private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{involve the}} supply {{by the private}} sector of infrastructure and services deriving from infrastructure assets which have traditionally been supplied by the public sector. PPPs are spreading all over the world. It may be quite plausible that such arrangements were initially an attempt to evade expenditure controls and hide public budget deficits. But if they are properly designed and transparently reported, PPPs can enhance the efficiency of the provision of services that were formerly supplied solely by the public sector.

5000|$|For instance, the {{incorporation}} of metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in US DOT programs and emergence of metropolitan governments worldwide are evidence {{of the impact of}} metropolitan economies. Other concrete examples include building the Metrorail system, which required coordinated agreement between the Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland environs; likewise, high-speed rail in Spain which connects virtually every large metro in the country. Chicago's Plan for Transformation in overhauling the city's public housing stock has to work together with local stakeholders on lease agreements, land use, economic development, and local taxes. The Triangle Area's high tech life sciences research hub, the Research Triangle Park, continually works together with surrounding research universities in Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill. Denver's expanded metropolitan transportation system needed a surrounding mayor caucus for joint efforts. The Hong Kong Airport and Shenzhen Airport dual services link that aim to capitalize on [...] "the synergy of their complimentary flight networks" [...] required agreement between Hong Kong and China. The <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> an undersea <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the English Channel, required cooperation and financing between the French and Britain governments. The Port of Rio de Janeiro serves the city and surrounding states in Brazil. All these partnered, comprehensive initiatives are crucial in metropolitan economies.|$|R
25|$|The {{completion}} of the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>rail</b> link (High Speed 1) and the {{completion of}} the lines from Brussels to Amsterdam and Cologne led to news reports in November 2007 that both Eurostar and Deutsche Bahn were pursuing direct services from London to Amsterdam and Cologne. Both journeys would be under 4hours, the length generally considered competitive with air travel.|$|E
25|$|The Eurostar service began {{operation}} in 1994, connecting continental Europe to London via the Channel Tunnel and the LGV Nord-Europe with {{a version of}} the TGV designed for use in the tunnel and the United Kingdom. The first phase of the British High Speed 1 line, or <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link, was completed in 2003, the second phase in November 2007. The fastest trains take 2hours 15minutes London–Paris and 1hour 51minutes London–Brussels.|$|E
25|$|The planned {{transport}} legacy for {{the capital}} included new bus transit schemes, extensions to existing Underground lines, redevelopments of London Underground stations and upgrades to the trains used. There were also to be many upgrades to National Rail services with the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link, a new high-speed rail link, several new stations and upgrades to stations such as Kings Cross St. Pancras. Please view the Legacy Map to see the upgrades to the London Transport network in context.|$|E
50|$|On {{a number}} of special {{occasions}} since 1993, crossings have been made directly using the bidirectional <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> service tunnel, positioned between the two <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> bores. This central service tunnel has airlocks at both ends, and a concrete screed road surface.|$|R
50|$|The Gibraltar Tunnel is {{proposed}} to be a <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> linking Africa and Europe. Due to {{the depth of}} the Strait of Gibraltar (300-900 metres / 1000-2950 feet), {{it would be a great}} challenge to remove automobile exhaust from this depth. Any tunnel would most likely be an electrified <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel,</b> similar to the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> linking the UK and France. There have also been proposals for a bridge over the Strait. There are car ferries across the strait.|$|R
50|$|In {{road and}} <b>rail</b> <b>tunnels,</b> {{narrower}} escape tunnels are provided to {{enable people to}} escape on foot {{in the event of}} a fire or other accident in the main tunnel.

25|$|The west of {{the county}} (including Tunbridge Wells, Tonbridge and Sevenoaks) has less than 50% of the average {{claimant}} count for low incomes or worklessness as the coastal districts of Dover, Shepway (main conurbation: Folkestone and Hythe) and Thanet (chiefly three resorts: Ramsgate, Broadstairs and Margate). West and Central Kent has long had many City of London commuters. Since the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link improvements of 2009 to High Speed 1, services from Ebbsfleet near Dartford and from Ashford have become frequent, express to Central London, Paris and Brussels.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the Channel Tunnel, completed in 1994, provided {{the impetus for the}} first cross-border high-speed rail line. In 1993, the LGV Nord, which connects Paris to the Belgian border and the Channel Tunnel via Lille, was opened. Initial travel times through the tunnel from London to Paris and Brussels were about 3hours. In 1997, a dedicated high-speed line to Brussels, HSL 1, was opened. In 2007, High Speed 1, the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link to London, was completed after a partial opening in 2003. All three lines were built to the French LGV standards, including electrification at 25 kV.|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in the {{planning}} of mega-projects is {{the high level of}} misinformation about costs (and benefits) that decision-makers face in deciding whether to build and the high risks such misinformation generates. The inaccuracy of construction cost estimates is typically measured as the size of cost overrun. There are many well-known mega-projects with major cost overruns. One of the most famous ‘project disasters’ in this respect is the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> This undersea <b>rail</b> <b>tunnel</b> linking the United Kingdom and France is the longest of its kind in Europe with a length of about 50 km. Construction costs increased from £ 2600 million to £ 4650 million (1985 prices), which is 80 per cent higher than the forecasted costs (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003 a). Another well-known mega-project failure is the Central Artery/Tunnel project in Boston, USA, also known as the ‘Big Dig’ or Big Dug’ due to persistent tunnel leaks. This large and complex underground highway project suffered a cost overrun of US $ 11 billion or 275 per cent (Flyvbjerg, 2007). Bangkok’s underground subway was 67 per cent over budget. Many other examples of projects with cost overruns exist, for example, the Great Belt link in Denmark (54 per cent overrun),the Humber Bridge in the UK (175 per cent overrun) and the Paris Nord TGV in France (25 per cent overrun) (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003 a). Cost overruns appear to be a global phenomenon, existing across 20 nations on five continents (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003 b) ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{protests against}} the {{original}} alignment of the base tunnel in the Susa valley, its length was increased from 52 to 57 km. This will make it, when it opens, {{one of the longest}} <b>rail</b> <b>tunnels</b> in the world, ranking with the Gotthard Base Tunnel (57.1 km) the Seikan Tunnel (54 km) and the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (50 km).|$|R

25|$|The <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link (CTRL), {{now known}} as High Speed 1 (HS1), was the first new {{mainline}} railway {{to be built in}} the UK for a century and was constructed by London and Continental Railways. After a lengthy process of route selection and public enquiries {{in the second half of}} the 1990s, work got under way on Section 1 from the Channel Tunnel to west of the Medway in 1998 and the line opened in 2003. Section 2, continuing the line to London St Pancras, started soon after Section 1 and was opened to the public on 14 November 2007.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel {{was built}} by the Great Western Railway (GWR) between 1873 and 1886. Its {{completion}} represented the crowning achievement of the great Victorian civil engineer Sir John Hawkshaw. It is 4miles 624yd (7,008m) long, although only miles (3.62km) of the tunnel are under the river. For well over 100 years it was the longest mainline railway tunnel within the UK, until the two major High Speed 1 tunnels (London East and West) were opened in 2007 {{as part of the}} <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link. It was also the longest underwater tunnel in the world until 1987. It takes approximately 3 minutes 40 seconds to travel through the tunnel.|$|E
25|$|High Speed 1 (HS1) (previously {{known as}} the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Rail</b> Link) is a high speed railway built to French 'LGV' (Ligne à Grande Vitesse) standards, {{connecting}} the Channel Tunnel to London. Since December 2009, high speed commuter services from Dover have called at Folkestone and then, using the South Eastern Main Line to Ashford International, the services join HS1 for the journey to Ebbsfleet, Stratford and London St Pancras. The journey time to London via this route {{has been reduced to}} under 1 hour; some trains from Folkestone West take as little as 52 minutes to reach the capital by High Speed Train.|$|E
