60|$|They {{would build}} small vessels, or rather boats, of osiers, {{covering}} them with skins, and in fleets of these frail floats they would sally forth among the howling winds and foaming surges of the German Ocean. On these expeditions, they all embarked as {{in a common}} cause, and felt a common interest. The leaders shared in all the toils and exposures of the men, and the men {{took part in the}} counsels and plans of the leaders. Their intelligence and activity, and their resistless courage and ardor, combined with their cool and calculating sagacity, made them successful in every attempt. If they fought, they conquered; if they pursued their enemies, they were sure to overtake them; if they retreated, they were sure to make their escape. They were clothed in a loose and flowing dress, and wore their hair long and hanging about their shoulders; and they had the art, as their descendants have now, of contriving and fabricating arms of such superior <b>construction</b> <b>and</b> <b>workmanship,</b> as to give them, on this account alone, a great advantage over all cotemporary nations. There were two other points in which there was a remarkable similarity between this parent stock in its rude, early form, and the extended social progeny which represents it at the present day. One was the extreme strictness of their ideas of conjugal fidelity, and the stern and rigid severity with which all violations of female virtue were judged. The woman who violated her marriage vows was compelled to hang herself. Her body was then burned in public, and the accomplice of her crime was executed over the ashes. The other point of resemblance between the ancient Anglo-Saxons and their modern descendants was their indomitable pride. They could never endure any thing like submission. Though sometimes overpowered, they were never conquered. Though taken prisoners and carried captive, the indomitable spirit which animated them could never be really subdued. The Romans used sometimes to compel their prisoners to fight as gladiators, to make spectacles for the amusement {{of the people of the}} city. On one occasion, thirty Anglo-Saxons, who had been taken captive and were reserved for this fate, strangled themselves rather than submit to this indignity. The whole nation manifested on all occasions a very unbending and unsubmissive will, encountering every possible danger and braving every conceivable ill rather than succumb or submit to any power except such as they had themselves created for their own ends; and their descendants, whether in England or America, evince much the same spirit still.|$|E

40|$|Waterproof {{membrane}} type roofing {{systems have}} not always given the performance {{that might have been}} expected of them, even when <b>construction</b> conditions <b>and</b> <b>workmanship</b> have been good. Analysis of all the factors that cause failure indicates a need for a building science approach to the design of roofing sytems, with some arrangement of the components different from the conventional. The protected membrane system has been promoted by the Division of Building Research for some years. This paper describes this approach to roofing as it has been applied to roofs at the University of Marburg in Western Germany. The term " inverted" or "upside down" has sometimes been used to describe protected membrane roofs, with all the bad connotations that this invokes. The author tries to indicate that they should be called "right-side-up" rather than "inverted". SOMMAIRE FRANCAIS A SUIVREPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|A {{prescriptive}} approach {{describes the}} way a building asset must be constructed, rather than {{the end result of}} the building process, and is related to the type and quality of materials used, the method of <b>construction,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>workmanship,</b> etc.This type of approach is strictly mandated by a combination of law, codes, standards, and regulations, etc., and is based on past experience and consolidated know-how. The content of prescriptive codes and standards is usually a consequence of an accident causing injury or death which requires a remedy to avoid a repeat, as a consequence of some hazardous situation, or as a consequence of some recognized social need. In many countries, in both the public and private sector, research is taking place into a different set of codes, methods and tools based on performance criteria to complement the traditional prescriptive codes.In the 1970s, this search produced the “Nordic Model” (NKB 1978), which constituted the reference model of next performance-based codes. This model links easily to one of the key characteristics of the Performance approach, the dialog between the WHY, the WHAT and the HOW.|$|R

Bala is a township located 50 km southeast from Ankara city in Turkey. The majority of the buildings in the affected region are built in masonry. Most of masonry buildings were formed with random or coursed stone and mud brick walls without any reinforcement. Many of these buildings were damaged or had collapsed. The cracking and failure patterns of the buildings are examined and interpreted according to current provisions for earthquake resistance of masonry structures. The damages are due to several reasons such as poor <b>construction</b> quality <b>and</b> poor <b>workmanship</b> of the buildings.

Fibre reinforced polymers has been used successfully in many such applications for reasons like low weight, high strength and durability. Many previous research works on torsional strengthening were focused on solid rectangular RC beams with different strip layouts and different types of fibres. Various analytical models were developed to predict torsional behavior of strengthened rectangular beams and successfully used for validation of the experimental works. But literature on torsional strengthening of RC T- beam is limited. In the present work experimental {{study was conducted in}} order to have a better understanding the behavior of torsional strengthening of solid RC flanged T-beams. An RC T-beam is analyzed and designed for torsion like an RC rectangular beam; the effect of concrete on flange is neglected by codes. In the present study effect of flange part in resisting torsion is studied by changing flange width of controlled beams. The other parameters studied are strengthening configurations and fiber orientations. The objective of present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of epoxy-bonded GFRP fabrics as external transverse reinforced to reinforced concrete beams with flanged cross sections (T-beam) subjected to torsion. Torsional results from strengthened beams are compared with the experimental result of the control beams without FRP application. The study shows remarkable improvement in torsional behavior of all the GFRP strengthen beams. The experimentally obtained results are validated with analytical model presented by A. Deifalla and A. Ghobarah and found in good agreement...|$|R

5000|$|The King {{appeared}} seated {{upon his}} throne, {{at the end}} of the great hall, in the most magnificent attire. His vest was of white and delicately flowered satin, with a silk and gold embroidery of the finest texture. The turban, of gold cloth, had an aigrette whose base was composed of diamonds of an extraordinary size and value, besides an Oriental topaz, which may be pronounced unparalleled, exhibiting a lustre like the sun. A necklace of immense pearls, suspended from his neck, reached to the stomach, in the same manner as many of the Gentiles wear their strings of beads.The throne was supported by six massive feet, said to be of solid gold, sprinkled over with rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. I cannot tell you with accuracy the number or value of this vast collection of precious stones, because no person may approach sufficiently near to reckon them, or judge of their water and clearness; but I can assure you that there is a confusion of diamonds, as well as other jewels, and that the throne, to the best of my recollection, is valued at four crores of Rupees. I observed elsewhere that a lakh is one hundred thousand rupees, and that a crore is a hundred lakh; so that the throne is estimated at forty millions of rupees, worth sixty millions of pounds livres or thereabouts. It was constructed by Shah Jahan, the father of Aurangzeb, for the purpose of displaying the immense quantity of precious stones accumulated successively in the treasury from the spoils of ancient Rajas and Patans, and the annual presents to the Monarch, which every Omrah is bound to makeon certain festivals. The <b>construction</b> <b>and</b> <b>workmanship</b> of the throne are not worthy of the materials; but twopeacocks, covered with jewels and pearls, are well conceived and executed. They were made by a workman of astonishing powers, a Frenchman by birth, named..... who, after defrauding several of the Princes of Europe, by means of false gems, which he fabricated with peculiar skill, sought refuge in the Great Mogul's court, where he made his fortune.At the foot of the throne were assembled all the Omralis, in splendid apparel, upon a platform surrounded by a silver railing, and covered by a spacious canopy of brocade with deep fringes of gold. The pillars of the hallwere hung with brocades of a gold ground, and flowered satin canopies were raised over the whole expanse of theextensive apartment fastened with red silken cords, from which were suspended large tassels of silk and gold. The floor was covered entirely with carpets of the richest silk, of immense length and breadth.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} technical guidance on timber facade design. The study involved a state-of-the-art review; an exposure trial of external cladding made from Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) {{and the production of}} <b>construction</b> details <b>and</b> associated information. It was undertaken because timber is an increasingly common cladding material in the UK, being used on low-rise residential buildings and for medium-rise and non-domestic buildings. The risks have, therefore, increased but this is not reflected in published guidance. Sitka spruce was used due to its availability in the UK and its similarity to Norway spruce (P. abies) which is widely used for cladding in Scandinavia. The exposure trial indicated that the moisture content range in timber facades is wider than accepted. The minimum moisture content of around 10 % appears to be similar for all types of timber cladding and all species. The maximum appears to vary between species according to their fibre saturation point and is influenced by <b>construction</b> detailing <b>and</b> <b>workmanship.</b> A preliminary model of these interactions is proposed. From a theoretical standpoint, the moisture conditions observed in the trial mean that the (commonly quoted) mean moisture content is all but irrelevant. The mode is a more representative statistic as in most cases the data are skewed towards the fibre saturation point for the species concerned. Most detailing combinations had a moisture content near to the fibre saturation point throughout the winter. Sitka spruce is, therefore, only suitable as external cladding in the UK if preservative treated. Around 40 construction details were produced. They integrate, for the first time, all of the performance requirements applicable to low- and medium-rise timber facades in the UK. The work's key benefit is that the guidance arising from this study rationalises and improves facade design. Further research is, however, needed to validate the moisture content model and extend it to other timber species. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Large-diameter {{bored piles}} {{are a common}} type of {{foundations}} adopted in Hong Kong. As bored piles are constructed underground, visual examinations of potential pile defects are not feasible. Thus, quality assurance measures such as integrity tests and static loading tests {{play an important role}} to ensure the <b>construction</b> <b>workmanship</b> <b>and</b> quality. According to results from quality assurance tests, pile imperfections, especially at the pile toe, are not uncommon. As large-diameter bored piles are usually designed as end bearing piles, engineers concern much about how toe defects affect the pile performance. This thesis aims to investigate the occurrence of pile defects and the effect of pile defects on the behavior of large diameter bored piles. The <b>construction</b> <b>and</b> quality assurance of large diameter bored piles in Hong Kong were first reviewed. Survey studies on the causes and occurrence rates of pile defects were then carried out. Lastly, five centrifuge model tests and corresponding numerical simulations were carried out to study the effect of pile defects on the performance of pile foundations. In the survey study, a questionnaire survey on quality assurance measures and occurrences of potential pile defects was conducted. Besides, several case studies in Hong Kong on potential defects such as toe debris and cracks were carried out. About 86 % of the pile toes in the investigated projects are found intact. Moreover, the occurrence rate of toe debris has been decreased gradually with time {{as a result of the}} extra attention paid to the <b>construction</b> <b>workmanship</b> <b>and</b> advances in <b>construction</b> techniques. In the centrifuge modeling, two series of static loading tests were performed to simulate large-diameter bored piles 2 m in diameter. The first series of tests included two tests on single piles while the second series of tests included three tests on pile groups. Excessive settlement was measured from the defective single pile and there was a 30 % reduction in its ultimate capacity. In the pile groups with defective piles, the applied load was largely taken by piles without defects. The reductions in the ultimate capacities of the pile group with soft toes and the pile group with short piles were 14 % and 51 %, respectively. When the applied vertical load was large, lateral failure mechanisms could also be induced even if the applied vertical load was concentric. FB-Pier, a finite element program, was adopted for the analysis of the defective single piles and pile groups simulated in the centrifuge. In general, the results from the numerical analysis were in good agreement with the results obtained from the centrifuge tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Petrography {{has been}} used by geologists to {{investigate}} rocks for over 150 years. More recently, petrographic techniques have been applied to the investigation {{of a wide range of}} construction geomaterials, most notably building stone, aggregates, concrete and mortar. The service life perfor-mance of buildings and infrastructure assets is dependent on good design and specification, the availability of high-quality construction materials, good <b>construction</b> <b>workmanship</b> <b>and</b> adequate maintenance. This paper reviews the state of practice for the petrography of geomaterials, as applied to construction projects worldwide. Petrographic methods and standards specific to geomaterials are introduced. Application of the techniques at various stages of the life cycle of structures is discussed including resource assessment, quality assurance, condition assessment, forensic engineering of failures and conservation of historic buildings. The contribution of petrography to sustainable construc-tion is also discussed. Geomaterials are of huge economic importance to the global construction industry as they include some of the most widely used construction materials.
