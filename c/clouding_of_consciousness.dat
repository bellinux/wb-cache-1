5000|$|The term <b>clouding</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{has always}} denoted the main pathogenetic feature of {{delirium}} since Greiner first pioneered the term (Verdunkelung des Bewusstseins) in 1817. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has historically {{used the term}} in its definition of delirium. However, the DSM-III-R and the DSM-IV replaced [...] "clouding of consciousness" [...] with [...] "disturbance of consciousness" [...] {{to make it easier}} to operationalize, but it is still fundamentally the same thing. There now appears to be a trend among many doctors to redefine <b>clouding</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to be less severe than delirium on a spectrum of abnormal consciousness. In this case, it can be said that <b>clouding</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> is synonymous with subsyndromal delirium.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Pilomotor seizure (PS) {{is a rare}} subtype {{of simple}} and complex partial seizures, often related to {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy and occasionally linked to alterations of amygdala. The physiologic role played by this latter region in the coordination of autonomic responses to fear-induced emotional changes raises {{the question as to}} whether the involvement of amygdala in PS might elicit a disconnection between subjective symptoms and neurovegetative signs. Methods: We report a case of idiopathic bilateral PS studied with video electroencephalogram, polygraphic 24 -hour Holter electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging, plus spectral functional magnetic resonance imaging, in which the seizures were associated with abrupt tachycardia occurring in a state of emotional neutrality, without either <b>clouding</b> or loss <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Results: Electroencephalogram documented PS episodes occurring during waking, rapid eyes movements, and nonrapid eye movement sleep stages. Although no morphologic alteration was detected, spectral magnetic resonance imaging visualized alterations of the metabolic ratios of N-acetylaspartate and creatine-phosphocreatine in hippocampus and amygdala, whereas no apparent involvement of the temporal lobe was found. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the limited involvement of amygdala and hippocampus in PS triggers the repertoire of fear-related sympathetic responses uncoupled from alterations in emotional status. This phenomenon supports the possibility that autonomic responses involved in fear or extreme alertness follow a kind of "ethological" modularit...|$|R

One sufferer described it as [...] "I thought it became like misty, in some way... the outlines were sort of fuzzy". Others may describe a [...] "spaced out" [...] feeling. Sufferers compare their overall experience {{to that of a}} dream because as in a dream consciousness, attention, orientation to time and place, perceptions, and awareness are disturbed. Barbara Schildkrout, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and clinical instructor in psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School described her subjective experience of <b>clouding</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> or what she also called [...] "mental fog", after taking a single dose of the antihistamine chlorpheniramine for her cottonwood allergy while on a cross-country road trip. She described feeling [...] "out of it" [...] and being in a [...] "dreamy state". She described a sense of not trusting her own judgment and a dulled awareness, not knowing how long time went by. <b>Clouding</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{is not the same thing}} as depersonalization even though both sufferers compare their experience to that of a dream.

40|$|Abstract: Every Science has a {{philosophy}} in its background and every computation has a natural phenomenon in it’s background. One {{of the most}} pronounced research domains in the recent times is study <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> what we have chosen as our area of research. This field of research conglomerates both philosophy and phenomenology. Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> helped to derive the scientific interpretation of it, and phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> helped us to derive the computational aspect <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Scientific study <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> is historically being the most challenging and has a history which is prolonged to origin of human civilisation. In all age, saints, philosophers, mathematicians and scientists have expressed their depiction about consciousness as the peak of their scientific arena. In recent times, one new dimension of scientific study <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> has emerged i. e., phenomenal view <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> which is proposed to develop computational aspect of it. The present paper is the resultant of my Phd research work on computational consciousness where we have started with philosophical interpretation <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in context with Vedic philosophy and derived few noble scientific definition and logical explanations <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Then, we have used the phenomenal aspects <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to design a computational model <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> architecture.

40|$|This {{theoretical}} study {{contains a}} systematic analysis of altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The study {{is based on a}} reflection of the qualitative altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> that offers some potential and attempts to describe altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in their complexity as well as to map all their aspects in a structured. It utilises the notion <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to define the altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The chosen method is to work with literary sources where an emphasis is placed on an interdisciplinary approach. The structure of the thesis is divided into three chapters. The key topic of the first chapter is an examination of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and interdisciplinary theories <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The second chapter is focused on the description and analysis of altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> concentrates on the history and methods of research of altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and delineates their basic characteristic and their functions.

50|$|Oneirophenia and {{schizophrenia}} {{are often}} confused {{although there are}} distinct differences between the conditions. Oneirophrenia {{has some of the}} characteristics of simple schizophrenia, such as a confusional state and <b>clouding</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> but without presenting the dissociative symptoms which are typical of that disorder. Oneiophrenia often begins with the inability to focus on things while schizophrenia frequently starts with a traumatic event. Persons affected by oneirophrenia have a feeling of dream-like derealization which, in its extreme form, may progress to delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, it is considered a schizophrenia-like acute form of psychosis which remits in about 60% of cases within a period of two years. It is estimated that 50% or more of schizophrenic patients present oneirophrenia at least once.|$|E

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy reduces quality of life by impairing work activities, social interactions, and driving, but it does not affect basic daily life activities such as dressing, personal hygiene, eating, shopping, answering the phone, or taking public transportation.
