40|$|Abstract— Telemetry {{systems is}} an {{innovative}} design of electronics and computer system {{which can be}} used to take measurements from a remote site by using any type of link like Radio link, optical fiber, <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables</b> etc. Telemetry systems can take any of the measurement like pressure, temperature, density, humidity etc. from a target location and sends the taken measurements via wired or wireless links that may be sent over few meters or may be sent over wide range. There are great and flawless changes in various telemetry systems from some past years that brought a nice popularity to use these systems rather than keeping a human eye on measurements. Telemetry systems have made a user free from taking measurements at target site, noting down the readings, turning the machines on or off. In this paper adaptive neuro fuzzy Logic is combined with wireless telemetry systems to control water flow in water/any fluid Tank used in industries. This paper presents the design of a wireless telemetry system for controlling the flow of water in water tanks used in industrial process using adaptive neuro fuzzy logic called adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. To incorporate artificial intelligence basically fuzzy logic and artificial networks are used. In this research these two models are initially studied. The advantages and disadvantages of both are discussed. Then these two models are compared by taking different parameters. By combining positive measures of fuzzy logic and artificial neural network, adaptive neuro fuzzy logic is considered as better method to incorporate artificial intelligence in the present research work. The resultant system is an assemblage of computer and communication equipments designed to work together for the purpose of measuring and controlling the flow of water in water tanks(tanks may contain any liquid) placed at far side. Besides control, The systems performs monitoring, data logging, alarming and diagnostic functions so that large, complicated process systems can be operated in a safe manner and maintained by a relatively small staff or just by a computer...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} and ongoing {{developments}} in telecommunication and electronic warfare technology, {{faster and more}} flexible systems are in demand. Wideband signal processing is thus needed to implement such systems. Microwave photonics has been introduced {{as a tool for}} achieving such ultra broadband signal processing. Instantaneous Frequency Measurement (IFM) receivers {{play an important role in}} electronic warfare. They have been developed as a means of obtaining a rapid indication of the presence of a threat and to roughly identify the frequency of the threat signals. They also have the advantages of low-cost, compactness and moderate to good sorting capability in an interference-free environment. The main limitation of the traditional RF IFM receivers is constrained bandwidth. Microwave Photonic IFMs have been considered, but the main disadvantages of photonic realization of the recent IFM receiver is cost. This work aims to propose and demonstrate low-cost photonic IFM receivers with a broad frequency measurement range. The proposed methods are based on the use of photonic mixing to down-convert the RF modulated optical signals to DC. In a RADAR warning receiver, usually a bank of IFMs is required. Increasing the numbers of IFMs requires an increase in the number of photo-detectors. Thus if low-frequency, low-cost detectors can be used, then the net system cost will be reduced significantly. The concept is proven and the issues arising are analyzed. In the proof of concept system, measurement of the RF frequency required advance knowledge of the RF power. Secondly, the use of <b>co-axial</b> RF <b>cables</b> as delay elements limited the bandwidth and increased bulk. Using a photonic hybrid approach to achieve orthogonal measurements was demonstrated as a means of dentifying both RF frequency and power simultaneously and independently. Employing all optical mixing removed the need for <b>co-axial</b> RF <b>cables</b> delays using non-linear optical devices such as Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) and Highly Non-Linear Fiber (HLNF). The last investigation is to improve the sensitivity of the implemented IFM system. The sensitivity of the implemented system is characterized first and a lock-in technique is employed to improve the sensitivity of the system. The final system achieves a sensitivity of - 41 dBm which is comparable with the traditional RF IFM receivers...|$|R

Results: All procedures were technically successful. Accessory port (3 mm) was used in 3 patients. Mean age in nephrectomized patients was 3. 14 ± 1. 7 years, the mean oper-ative room time (ORT) was 97. 5 ± 12. 54 minutes. In the pyeloplasty group, mean ORT was 192 ± 47. 16 minutes and mean age was 2. 43 ± 2. 3 years. Bilateral pyeloplasty was done in a 4 -month-old infant. The ORT {{in this case was}} 180 minutes.

40|$|The highly-redshifted 21 cm line {{of neutral}} {{hydrogen}} {{is one of}} the most promising and unique probes of cosmology for the next decade and beyond. The past few years have seen a number of dedicated experiments targeting the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) begin operation, including the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER). For these experiments to yield cosmological results, they require new calibration and analysis algorithms which will need to achieve unprecedented levels of separation between the 21 cm signal and contaminating foreground emission. Although much work has been spent developing these algorithms over the past decade, their success or failure will ultimately depend on their ability to overcome the complications associated with real-world systems and their inherent complications. The work in this dissertation is closely tied to the late-stage commissioning and early observations with PAPER. The first two chapters focus on developing calibration algorithms to overcome unique problems arising in the PAPER system. To test these algorithms, I rely on not only simulations, but on commissioning observations, ultimately tying the success of the algorithm to its performance on actual, celestial data. The first algorithm works to correct gain-drifts in the PAPER system caused by the heating and cooling of various components (the amplifiers and above ground <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables,</b> in particular). It is shown that a simple measurement of the ambient temperature can remove &# 8764; 10 % gain fluctuations in the observed brightness of calibrator sources. This result is highly encouraging for the ability of PAPER to remove a potentially dominant systematic in its power spectrum and cataloging measurements without resorting to a complicated system overhaul. The second new algorithm developed in this dissertation solves a major calibration challenge not just for PAPER, but for nearly all of a large class of new wide-field, drift- scanning radio telescopes: primary beam calibration in the presence of a poorly measured sky. Since these telescopes lack the ability to steer their primary beams, while seeing nearly the entire sky at once, a large number of calibrator sources are necessary to probe the entire beam response. However, the catalogs of radio sources at low-frequencies are not reliable enough to achieve the level of primary beam accuraccy needed for 21 cm cosmology experiments. I develop, test, and apply a new technique which [...] using only the assumption of symmetry around a 180 &# 9702; rotation [...] simultaneously solves for the primary beam and the flux density of large number of sources. In this dissertation, I also present the analysis of new observations from PAPER to test theoretical models which predict foreground emission is confined to a "wedge"-like region of cosmological Fourier space, leaving an "EoR window" free from contamination. For the first time in actual observations, these predictions are spectacularly confirmed. In many ways, this result shifts the burden for upcoming PAPER analysis from foreground removal to increased sensitivity. And although increasing sensitivity is no small feat in-and-of-itself, this result is highly encouraging for 21 cm studies, as foreground removal was long-viewed as the principal challenge for this field. The final result in this dissertation is the application of the all the lessons learned building PAPER and the MWA to design a new experiment for 21 cm studies at z ~ 1 with the goal of measuring baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The design of the BAO Broadband and Broad-beam (BAOBAB) Array is described, and cosmological forecasts are presented. The bottom line is highly encouraging, suggesting that z ~ 1 21 cm observations can detect the neutral hydrogen power spectrum with a very modest (16 &# 8722; 32 element) array, and that still reasonably sized (128 &# 8722; 256 elements) arrays can produce significant advances in our knowledge of dark energy...|$|R
