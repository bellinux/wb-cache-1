5|$|Initially, {{telephone}} service onto {{the island was}} disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was <b>cleared</b> <b>and</b> repaired, which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April12, or {{three days after the}} typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored. By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity.

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then <b>cleared</b> <b>and</b> ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were <b>cleared,</b> <b>and</b> some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E

40|$|<b>Clearing</b> <b>and</b> {{settlement}} {{systems are}} essential to the smooth functioning of a modern market-based economy such as Canada's. During the past decade, there have been significant efforts in Canada and abroad to improve electronic <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems that handle payments obligations, either uniquely or in conjunction with transactions related to the purchase and sale of a broad range of financial instruments such as debt, equity, foreign exchange, or derivatives. This article examines some of the risks faced by participants and end-users of these systems and reviews the Bank of Canada's role in relation to these systems. For a number of years, the Bank has been involved informally with major <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems with a view to ensuring that systemic risk is adequately controlled. In July 1996, the Payment <b>Clearing</b> <b>and</b> Settlement Act was proclaimed. This Act formalized the role of the Bank in the oversight of <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. The article provides an overview of the Bank's responsibilities. It also describes certain new powers that the Act made available to the Bank that could be exercised in its dealings with <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems. ...|$|R

Chapman was ordered to be sent to jail in the county seat of Hillsboro for 20 days and disbarred, but never went to jail and the order was revoked when Pratt was replaced on the court by justice Thomas Nelson.

40|$|Shoshana Smith {{now goes}} by her married name, Shoshana Brassfield: [URL] Descartes famously claims that {{everything}} we perceive clearly and distinctly is true. Although this rule {{is fundamental to}} Descartes’s theory of knowledge, readers from Gassendi and Leibniz onward have complained that unless Descartes can say explicitly what <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception is, how we know when we have it, and why it cannot be wrong, then the rule is empty. I offer {{a detailed analysis of}} <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception, showing how Descartes answers these questions. Many doubts about the usefulness of the clarity and distinctness rule arise from the mistaken assumption that in <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception, like sense perception, we must be able to establish a correspondence between perception and reality before we can have knowledge. I show that Descartes has a different metaphysical picture of <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception. <b>Clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception is direct perception, typically of essences. On this view, by relying on the intellect instead of the senses, we can have direct perception not only of our own ideas, but also of a mind-independent reality. Because <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception is direct perception, problems of correspondence do not arise. My account of <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception also yields unique insight into other issues in Descartes, such as the Cartesian Circle and the doctrine of the free creation of the eternal truths.
