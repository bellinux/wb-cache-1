40|$|The latest {{upgrade to}} the Aerospace Energy Systems Laboratory (AESL) is described. The AESL is a {{distributed}} digital system {{consisting of a}} <b>central</b> <b>system</b> and battery <b>servicing</b> stations connected by a high-speed serial data bus. The entire system is located in two adjoining rooms; the bus length is approximately 100 ft. Each battery station contains a digital processor, data acquisition, floppy diskette data storage, and operator interfaces. The operator initiates a servicing task and thereafter the battery station monitors {{the progress of the}} task and terminates it at the appropriate time.

25|$|Although CP/M {{provided}} some hardware abstraction to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, typically application programs still required installation {{to make use}} of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by escape sequences which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select bold face on a printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer's range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no <b>central</b> operating <b>system</b> <b>service</b> provided for these devices.|$|R

The volume oﬀers theoretical and empirical chapters on the transformative eﬀects of NPM-based reforms, based on a comparison between Antipodean (New Zealand and Australia) and Scandinavian (Norway and Sweden) countries over the past two decades. As editors, in the two introductory and concluding chapters, Tom Christensen and Per Lægreid collaborate to take seriously a threefold dimension of NPM reforms: understanding the processes; analysing the real eﬀects of reforms beyond the managerial talks; and considering the theoretical inﬂuences of NPM on democratic theory.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to properly assess whether energy has been used efficiently and effectively in a commercial building that {{is equipped with a}} <b>central</b> air-conditioning <b>system</b> and houses a mix of premises of largely different energy characteristics. Due to the inter-relationship between the energy use of individual tenants and of the <b>central</b> air-conditioning <b>system,</b> a building that consumes a large amount of energy may not be inefficient if a substantial portion of its area is occupied by premises that have intensive cooling requirements. The paper describes a proposed method for establishing energy consumption benchmarks for assessing the energy performance of this type of buildings, which are the dominant energy consumers in Hong Kong. The key feature of the method is that the benchmarks to be established would be specific to each individual building, dependent on the mix of premises in the building and on those characteristics of the building and its air-conditioning system that are unlikely to be changeable in the interest of reducing energy use. The energy consumption benchmarks would need to be established from an energy end-use database for commercial buildings, including energy end-uses of the <b>central</b> <b>services</b> <b>systems</b> and in various types of premises in commercial buildings.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a quantum <b>system,</b> called a <b>central</b> <b>system</b> in what follows, and its environment affects {{the state of}} the former. Intuitively, we expect that by turning on the interaction with the environment, the fluctuations in the environment will lead to a reduc-tion of the coherence in the <b>central</b> <b>system.</b> This process is called decoherence [1, 2]. In general, there are two different mechanisms that contribute to decoherence. If the environment is dissipative (or coupled to a dissipa-tive system), the total energy is not conserved and the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> + environment relax to a stationary equi-librium state, for instance the thermal equilibrium state. In this paper, we exclude this class of dissipative pro-cesses and restrict ourselves to closed quantum systems in which a small, <b>central</b> <b>system</b> is brought in contact with a larger quantum system that is prepared in its ground state. Then, the decoherence is solely due to fact that the initial product state (the wave function of the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> times the wave function of the environ-ment) evolves into an entangled state of the whole sys-tem. The interaction with the environment causes the initial pure state of the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> to evolve into a mixed state described by a reduced density matrix [3] obtained by tracing out all the degrees of freedom of the environment [1, 2, 4, 5]. Not all initial states are equally sensitive to decoher-ence. The states that are robust with respect to the inter-action with the environment are called pointer states [2].
