25|$|In March 2001, 40 multi-national {{pharmaceutical}} companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act, which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, {{despite the fact}} that these drugs were on-patent. HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license),</b> or import them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.|$|E
40|$|<b>Compulsory</b> <b>licensing,</b> {{which is}} {{permissible}} under the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, allows domestic firms to produce inventions that are patented by foreign nationals, {{without the consent}} of patent owners. As an emergency measure, <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing</b> offers clear benefits: It helps deliver life-saving drugs to millions of patients. The long run effects of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing,</b> however, are unclear. This paper uses an exogenous event of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing</b> after World War I to measure the long-run effects of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing</b> on domestic invention. Specifically, the analysis compares changes in patents by domestic inventors across technologies that were differentially affected by <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing</b> under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Our data suggest that <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing</b> has a large positive effect on domestic invention.

5000|$|The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) also {{sets out}} {{specific}} provisions that shall be followed if a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> is issued, and {{the requirements of}} such licenses. All significant patent systems {{comply with the requirements}} of TRIPs. The principal requirement for the issue of a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> is that attempts to obtain a license under reasonable commercial terms must have failed over a reasonable period of time. Specific situations in which compulsory licenses may be issued are set out in the legislation of each patent system and vary between systems. Some examples of situations in which a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> may be granted include lack of working over an extended period in the territory of the patent, inventions funded by the government, failure or inability of a patentee to meet a demand for a patented product and where the refusal to grant a license leads to the inability to exploit an important technological advance, or to exploit a further patent. TRIPs also provides that the requirements for a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> may be waived in certain situations, in particular cases of national emergency or extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. Article 31.f of TRIPS requires that compulsory licenses be used [...] "predominantly" [...] for local markets, a requirement that complicates the ability of countries to import drugs manufactured overseas.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> provisions in United States copyright law, including for non-dramatic musical compositions, public broadcasting, retransmission by cable systems, subscription digital audio transmission, and non-subscription digital audio transmission such as Internet radio. The <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> for non-dramatic musical compositions under Section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976 [...] allows {{a person to}} distribute a new sound recording of a musical work, if that has been previously distributed to the public, by or {{under the authority of}} the copyright owner. There is no requirement that the new recording be identical to the previous work, as the <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> includes the privilege of rearranging the work to conform it to the recording artist's interpretation. This does not allow the artist to change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work. In order {{to take advantage of this}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> the recording artist must provide notice and pay a royalty. The notice must be sent to the copyright owner, or if unable to determine the copyright owner, to the Copyright Office, within thirty days of making the recording, but before distributing physical copies. Failure to provide this notice would constitute copyright infringement. In addition to the notice to the copyright owner, the recording artist must pay a royalty to the copyright owner. This royalty is set by three copyright royalty judges. Though the <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> allows one to make and distribute physical copies of a song for a set royalty, the owner of the copyright in the underlying musical composition can still control public performance of the work or transmission over the radio. If the underlying musical work is well known, the work can be licensed for public performance through a performance rights organization such as ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC.|$|E
