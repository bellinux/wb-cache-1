This study shows that a retrospective analysis based on the experiences and reflections of the CMCC alumni of their program presents a reliable and valid method for curriculum review.

40|$|Aim. Technetium- 99 m-d,l-hexameththylpropyleneamineoxime (99 mTc-d,l-HMPAO) {{prepared}} {{from the}} commercially available lyophilized kit, Ceretec™, (GE Healthcare, UK) {{is used to}} image regional cerebral blood flow and for in vitro leukocytes labeling. The aim of this work was to study {{the influence of the}} nature (pH, plastic ampoules stored away from light sources or glass ampoules) of 0, 9 % NaCl sodium chloride injection used to dilute generator produced sodium pertechnetate at 1, 2, 5 mL for the Ceretec™ reconstitution on the radiochemical purity and stability of 99 mTc-d,l-HMPAO. Materials and methods. 99 mTc-d,l-HMPAO is prepared using commercially available freeze-dried kits according to the procedure specified by the manufacturer. Kits were reconstituted with 1, 2 or 5 mL of fresh (not more 2 h old) generator eluted sodium [99 mTc]pertechnetate coming from a generator eluted not more than 24 h in 0, 9 % NaCl containing 0, 074 - 0, 22 GBq/mL. The radioactive concentration was obtained by diluting generator eluted sodium [99 mTc]pertechnetate with 0, 9 % NaCl Sodium Chloride Injection coming from stored away from light sources plastic ampoules and Sodium Chloride Injection from glass ampoules. The radiochemical purity was measured at 0, 15 and 30 min after preparation and was determined by methods specified by the manufacture. Results. We found no influence on the radiochemical purity and stability (at 30 min following the <b>preparation)</b> <b>of</b> 99 mTc-HMPAO based on the type and the pH of sodium chloride injection used for pertechnetate diluting. RCP values decreased proportionally with the decrease of the final volume <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> and in particular for 1 mL of diluted pertechnetate, the PCR at 30 minutes following the preparation is less than the required (80 %). Finally we found that pH average for 99 mTc-d,l-HMPAO is lower than indicated by the manufacturer (9, 0 - 9, 8). Conclusions. In summary in this work we found that instability of the neutral lipophilic 99 mTc-d,l-HMPAO complex is faster in reconstituted kits with smaller volumes than 2 mL of pertechnetate, as happens in routine preparations for in vitro leukocyte labeling, and in particular reconstituted kit with volume of 1 mL can’t be used beyond the 15 minutes <b>of</b> <b>preparation.</b> This suggests that any protocols that provide volumes smaller than 2 mL of pertechnetate for the Ceretec™ reconstitution should be carefully evaluated in terms of stability of the product. We also noted that the pH average for any <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> is lower than indicated by the manufacturer (9, 0 - 9, 8).

Altogether, 48 samples of food supplements in three dosage forms (22 samples of tablets, 18 samples of soft capsules, and 8 samples of hard capsules) were analysed. The amounts of lutein specified by the producer complied with their real contents only in 7 samples of the food supplements. Lutein in soft capsules showed the highest stability against oxidation; lutein in tablets was more prone to oxidation and lutein in hard capsules was most susceptible to oxidation process. Out of 21 Czech products, only four fell into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> satisfactory products, {{three of them were}} soft capsules and one was a tablet.

40|$|Background: Children {{frequently}} exhibit {{high levels}} of distress while undergoing routine blood sampling or injections. If the child is not treated with appropriate care, the feelings of distress may increase over time and result in needle-phobia. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe nurses´ possibilities to relieve distress in children undergoing needle sticks. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted through database search and screening of reference lists. Ten research articles with a quantitative approach were included, coded for quality and then analyzed. Results: Main results were presented in two <b>categories,</b> the effect <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> and the effect of distraction. To prepare children with information failed to reduce children’s distress, but in combination with application of EMLA the effect could reach significance. The effect of distraction was inconsistent but distress seemed to decrease when nurses interacted in distracting the child. Conclusions: Children´s distress while undergoing needle sticks are affected by many different variables and this study failed to present generalizable ways for nursing care. Nurses are important and have the potential to make a difference in caring for the child. However there is little guidance for nurses on how to relieve children´s distress in recent literature.
