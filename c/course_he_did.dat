5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
25|$|Edward Lorenz was {{an early}} pioneer of the theory. His {{interest}} in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run his weather simulation. He {{wanted to see a}} sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its <b>course.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions {{in the middle of the}} original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.|$|E
2500|$|Müller {{was born}} in the village of Windischholzhausen, near Erfurt in Thuringia, [...] Germany, the son of a minister. Müller had what would be seen today as a normal {{scientific}} education at the universities of Berlin (earning a BSc in Botany) and Greifswald, culminating in a doctoral degree in Biology. He subsequently decided to study medicine. As a medical student, he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist, joining the Free Congregations and supporting free love. Despite completing the <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath, which contained the phrase [...] "so help me God and his sacred Gospel".|$|E

50|$|As the {{internet}} and its many music communities grew, Marriott expanded his work, knowledge, and expertise online. Through working with and embracing new studio equipment and technology, he shares his expertise through online video <b>courses.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> these long before the existence of YouTube or Vimeo, allowing fans and studio junkies to see his work from the ground up, {{one of the first}} artist/musician/producers to do so on a regular basis.|$|R

50|$|Southgate {{was handed}} his first {{managerial}} role at Middlesbrough in June 2006 after Steve McClaren {{had left to}} manage England. His appointment drew controversy as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have the required coaching qualifications (the UEFA Pro Licence) to manage a top-flight club. He was allowed to stay on as manager, however, by the Premier League in November 2006; Middlesbrough successfully argued that, because Southgate had recently been an international player, he had no opportunity to undertake the coaching <b>courses.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> go on to complete his coaching qualifications.|$|R
