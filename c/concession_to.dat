5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE {{was also}} {{given the right}} to fly its first {{international}} scheduled flights {{for the first time}} in several decades.

At the same time, Air-X was granted <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989.

They {{also stated that}} {{they were willing to}} fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London.

5|$|The airline {{reached a}} non-public {{settlement}} with Thor Tjøntveit on 10 September regarding the latter's right to purchase one of Norway Airline's aircraft. Norway Airlines lost NOK12 million in 1990. In January 1991, the airline won {{the contract to}} fly personnel the Norwegian Armed Forces, as the airline priced half a million krone lower than Busy Bee. Operations started in April and secured sufficient business that the airline could order its third aircraft, along with a contract from Gullivers Reiser for additional charter flights. Within a week it received <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> operate scheduled flights between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm to London. A similar concession was also granted to Braathens SAFE, but they stated that the intense competition on the route would {{make it difficult for}} them to start a service. However, the five-year concession required that Norway Airlines not have any foreign citizens in the board; as two representatives for ILG sat on the board, they would have to resign for the <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> be valid. The Progress Party called for the law to be changed. Norway Airlines also applied for a route from Bergen and Stavanger to London.|$|E

Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E

The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air on the service. At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. In 1989, Coast Air received a one-year <b>concession</b> <b>to</b> operate from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger.

5|$|In 1920, Holmenkolbanen {{applied to}} build a branch from Frøen via Tåsen to Nydalen and Grefsen, along what is today the Ring Line. This {{proposal}} included a branch to Sognsvann.
