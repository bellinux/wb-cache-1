25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E

50|$|The term fatigue {{refers to}} the effect of cyclic or {{intermittent}} loads. Cyclic loading due to either oscillating mechanical stress or to alternate heating and cooling, is more detrimental than static loading. Under <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> the crack are initialized as localized sites within the part and these extend in size during cycling. Ultimately they expand and join {{to such an extent that}} the material can no longer hold and support the stress. Fractures can be characterized by a series of concentric crack growth bands that grow from the surface initiation site. Cyclic loading can bring about failure in polymer due to: chain scission, built up heat due to hysteresis, recrystallization of material and cumulative crack generation.|$|E
50|$|System {{reliability}} {{is affected}} by blade count primarily through the dynamic loading of the rotor into the drive train and tower systems. While aligning the wind turbine to changes in wind direction (yawing), each blade experiences a <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> at its root end depending on blade position. This is true of one, two, three blades or more. However, these cyclic loads when combined together at the drive train shaft are symmetrically balanced for three blades, yielding smoother operation during turbine yaw.

After validation by comparison against published triaxial test results, this model was applied to a numerical simulation developed for computing the axial bearing capacity of a pile foundation subjected to a cyclic loading. The axial bearing capacity degradation of a single pile under different <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> levels and different <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> numbers was studied.

In order to improve the computational efficiency, a simplified analysis method based on a simple nonlinear soil model is presented for the cyclic axial capacity degradation of single piles.

After each reconstruction, the reconstructed-knee was subjected to 500 -cycles of 0 to 100 -N anterior tibial loads using a material testing machine. The ATT before and after <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> and “laxity increase”, which indicated a permanent elongation of the graft construct, was also determined. Results The ATT after <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> increased in both single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction techniques compared to that without <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading.</b> Changes in ATT before and after <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> were 3. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 9 mm and 2. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 6 mm respectively, and were significantly different. Laxity increase was also significantly different (4. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 9 mm and 3. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 8 mm respectively). Although no graft rupture or graft fixation failure was found during <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading,</b> the graft deviated into an eccentric position within the tunnel. Conclusions Although ATT was significantly increased in both single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction with hamstring tendon after <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> test, there was significant difference. Double-bundle reconstruction might be superior to prevent increasing ATT under <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading.</b> Deformation of hamstring tendon after <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> might result in deterioration of knee stability after ACL reconstruction, and is one of disadvantages of soft tissue graft. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the mechanics and mechanisms of brittle rock fracture {{is a key element}} in the solution of many engineering problems that involve rock structures. Some rock structures, such as bridge and dam abutments and foundations, and tunnel walls, undergo both static and <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> caused by drilling and blasting, and vehicle-induced vibrations. This type of loading often causes rock to fail at a stress lower than its static strength, due to the effect of rock fatigue.

Axial load, confining pressures and axial and lateral deformations were measured continuously from start of loading until the post-peak state. Cyclic tests were carried out at different confining pressures, stress levels and unloading amplitudes. In <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> tests, a relatively uniform accumulation in axial, lateral and volumetric strain is observed followed by a rapid strain increase as it heads toward failure. This rapid accumulation in strain occurred on average at approximately 65 % of the cumulative axial strain. During systematic <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> a continuous degradation in the tangent Young's modulus, Etan, until beginning of large plastic deformation was observed. The rate of stiffness decrease increased rapidly during few cycles before the failure. Poisson's ratio showed a similar trend of behavior and increased continuously with <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading.</b> Moreover, Etan values measured during interval cyclic loadings were affected by two factors: (1) stiffening by <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> because of elasto-viscoplastic properties; and (2) damage effects {{that have taken place}} during <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading,</b> in particular, if <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> begins close to the monotonic peak strength.
