On 28 October 2011 the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled, that the UK FSCS and the Dutch DNB combined deposit repayments of respectively ISK 852.1bn (£4.459bn) and ISK 282.3bn (€1.668bn) should be repaid by the Landsbanki receivership as [...] "priority claims" [...] pursuant to Article 112 of [...] "Act No.21/1991 on Bankruptcy", and noted these mentioned figures included <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rates for the UK part and some extra penalty interest rates (6%) for the Dutch part for the period from 8 October 2008 until 22 April 2009.

Starting from a model of equity-constrained firms, where expected bankruptcy costs (reflecting each firm’s quality) imply a higher user cost of capital and, thus, a lower investment by each firm, we move to a context of adverse selection in the debt market, where banks offer a ‘one-size-fits-all’ <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rate. This implies that ‘poor’ firms tend to invest more vis-à-vis ‘good’ firms, since they now {{take into account that}} higher expected default rates may not be matched by comparably higher <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rates, therefore weakening the impact of bankruptcy costs on firms’ investment decisions. ...|$|E

40|$|Debt {{financing}} with subsidizes {{interest rate}} has a multidimensional {{impact on the}} firm. Value of the levered equity, value of the debt and overall firm value will be different of those values with debt financing at market rate. Subsidized interest rate on debt does not create any additional cash flow and all the changes in values {{and the cost of}} capital are the result of the redistribution of cash flows among debt, equity and government, and subsequent reduction in financial risk due to lower leverage. In this note we show that the levered firm value with the loan provided at a rate below market rate is lower (or equal, in a no tax world) compared to the same firm value with the loan at market rate. For the given nominal value of debt the cost of capital of the levered firm with the subsidized interest rate is higher than the cost of capital of the same firm with `the market cost of debt, and “intuitive” adjustment of the WACC by direct substitution of the <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rate into the classic WACC formulation produces inconsistent cost of capital estimate and flawed valuation. Debt financing with subsidized interest rate converts into the gain for the levered equity. This value gain originates from the value transfer from debt to equity and to ensure correct and consistent cost of capital and value estimates we need properly incorporate the effect of the subsidy in the interest rate on the cost of the levered equity. Required return to the levered equity with subsidized debt financing does not depend on the <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rate. “Extended APV valuation” performed by adding value of the loan subsidy to the sum of the unlevered firm value and the value of the tax shield is based on inconsistent value relationship and leads to false results. To illustrate our non-technical discussion we use perpetuity model and a simple numerical example. ...|$|E

There are four basic steps in the analysis of the decision whether or not to refund a currently outstanding bond issue prior to its maturity date. These steps are: a. the computation of the relevant cash flows (or the relevant costs), b. the choice of the rate of discount to be used in making the analysis, c. the treatment of uncertainty, d. the incorporation of qualitative factors. ...|$|E

The encroachment of expanding industrialization brought with it new social phenomena and pressures, new technology, and a fundamental restructuring of employment relationships. Master-servant relations still contained elements of the deeply stratified and paternalistic labour relationships ingrained in the cultural and social fabric of earlier eras, but increasingly began to exhibit the rudiments of purely contractual relationships which would come to define the modern industrial era.

The results show that banks have preferences for particularly liquid types of collateral, whereas they care little about the purpose for which the loan is used. Furthermore, the analysis allows quantification of the effects of socioeconomic attributes of farmers, different lending sources and government subsidies on interest rates. The latter effect is small compared with the officially declared reduction of the nominal interest rate.

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{performance of}} different systems of corporate governance, in turn, {{has been at}} the core of recent debates on how to reform financial market institutions. So far, the literature has treated the discussion of internal and external financial structures largely in isolation. However, few attempts have been made so far to combine these two strands of the literature and to analyze the interaction between internal and external financial structures. In this paper we argue that these linkages are important with the support of a stylized model featuring ex post asymmetries between domestic and foreign investors in the credit market. This simple model is able to generate an equity bias in capital imports relative to the internal financing structure. The intuition is that competition from the equity market drives the <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rate in the credit market down to a level where foreign creditors can no longer cover their cost of collecting on defaulting loans. Thus, only domestic creditors, who do not face such a cost, can compete with equity in equilibrium. Foreign creditors get crowded out. As a result, the overall financing structure of the economy reflects the indifference of firms between the two sources of financing in equilibrium, but capital imports consist only of equity. corporate finance, financing, Europe...|$|E

40|$|It {{was only}} in the {{aftermath}} of the industrial revolution that profits became a controversial issue and were confused with interest. Economists confused the two because both are surplus values; both are incomes from ownership, not from labor, and both are flow concepts. The hallmark difference between the two, however, which is also the reason why interest is a problem, is that interest is a contractual permanent income that is derived from ever-changing, transitory profits. ^ The transaction cost economics approach shows that equity financing must be the rule and not the last resort. A property-right approach shows that interest-based contracts lead to the overlapping of property rights between the lender and the borrower, and that efficiency is not property-right neutral. The introduction of interest brings about a tax-like affect upon investment. ^ The emergence of profit is conditional upon the occurrence of a dynamic change that brings about an uncertainty (a nonmeasurable risk) about the future. Profits are generated by the expenditures of households whose incomes are not the liability of the firm (or the private sector in general). ^ The monopolistic nature of <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> is traceable to the peculiar nature of money.

It would be inefficient to impose an outside constraint to its use like interest charges. The nature of the modern financial system further complicates the issue of money and interest.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how {{the legal}} sanctions prevailing under bankruptcy code {{impact on the}} design of debt contacts. Unlike most papers considering a passive behavior of the bank in case of default of the borrower, we assume the bank actively trades off between private renegotiation and costly bankruptcy procedure. Besides, the debtor’s investment policy – with a risk of asset substitution – and the creditor’s financial policy – endogenous interest rate – are explicitly modeled. The model focuses on three possible equilibriums. The first one encompasses situations where the firms stay with the best investment project (economic efficiency) and bankruptcy costs are avoided through private renegotiation (legal efficiency) : this equilibrium requires a condition on bankruptcy costs and is independent of legal sanctions. A second equilibrium cover situations where the firms turn to the less profitable and riskiest project (economic inefficiency) and the default is still privately solved (legal efficiency) : to avoid suboptimal investment, a minimal level of legal sanctions, whose threshold value depends on the interest rate, must apply. Last, we consider mixed strategies on the investment policy (partial economic efficiency) : when financial distress occurs, two bargaining equilibriums prevail – pooling or separating – so costly bankruptcy may apply (legal inefficiency). Simulated results illustrate how the bank finally chooses between these equilibriums while the legal environment becomes more severe. First, as expected, when sanctions are getting higher, the probability of choosing the best project increases: simulations provide minimal levels of sanctions which guarantee the occurrence of the best equilibrium. As a result, extreme severity is not needed to ensure both economic and legal efficiency. Second, an increase of legal sanctions is likely to reduce the <b>contractual</b> <b>interest</b> rate, as the bank is more protected by the law, and cannot charge a risk premium anymore. A noteworthy consequence is that the debtor benefits in some extent of increased severity, as he is inclined to invest in the most profitable projects and, consequently, pays a lower interest rate. Third, a slight change of the legal environment may involve a drastic adjustment of financial variables, so that small changes in the law may involve financial instability.

Two witnesses are required, unless the witness is a notary or a clerk of court (court registrar), any of whom will suffice. The formalities may be relaxed in certain cases, such as imminent death, a state of siege, a prevailing epidemic, etc. Freedom of testation is constrained by the rules of forced heirship: descendants, ascendants, and the spouse are all entitled to forced shares (aka legal right shares). Forced heirs may only be disinherited for certain specified kinds of misconduct.

Each line of thinking is utilised in an eclectic manner to distill how and what it can contribute to observe, interpret and explain the emergence of institutional arrangements that govern property rights in zones of violent conflict. Starting with a critical discussion of the dominating greed versus grievances debate, I will review the current debate on state failure and complex political emergencies which seek to explain the current breakdown of state institutions {{into a kind of}} anarchic condition.

The conflict transformation approach conceptualises the dynamics of social conflict. I distinguish the interest frame from the identity frame and emphasise the role that emotions can play in shaping the process of confrontation and conflict. Subsequently, I will draw some preliminary conclusion: {{what are the implications of}} these different debates for the analysis of institutional dynamics and institutional change in civil wars, prior, during and after the actual war...|$|R

Taxation was studied as a specific act of the agreement between the state and the business. Filling the state budget by tax revenue, the state solves important issues of socio-economic development and has a resource for its own functioning. Entrepreneurs are interested in providing the state with financial resources because the state is the provider of public goods and efficient structure of business activity regulation. It was proved that the relationship between the state and the business have transaction character. In this case, the taxes are considered as certain transaction costs, i. e., the fee for the use of public benefits and the institutions that govern the business relationships and establish "rules of the game” in the market. It was substantiated that the theory of transaction costs allows comprehensive researching into the interaction of state structures with taxpayers given the uncertainty, information asymmetry, limited rationality, opportunistic behavior, specificity of <b>interests,</b> <b>contractual</b> risks, etc. We established that this very theory provides a full description of mutual cooperation between the authorities and the businesses in the process of formation of tax policy and execution of tax management functions. Scientific novelty of the research is provided by the proposed theory of transaction costs for scientific substantiation of tax management in the period of structural transformations of the economy. The practical result is the use of institutional approaches to the formation of the reformation of the tax system in Ukraine and its transition from a purely fiscal to an investment model considering all participants of the process of taxation, as well as assistance in overcoming the contradictions between them and the opportunism in the behavior. A promising direction for further research in this area is the use of neoinstitutional approach at micro–level for the analysis of transactions between taxpayers and government agencies, as well as overcoming information asymmetry in the process of implementing peculiarities of tax management...|$|R
40|$|Contract rules can be {{justified}} by utilitarian theories (such as efficiency theory), which are concerned with promoting rules that enhance societal wealth and utility. Contract rules can also {{be justified}} by rights-based theories (such as promissory and reliance theories), which are concerned with protecting the <b>contractual</b> freedom and <b>interests</b> ofthe individual parties to the contract. Or, contract rules can be analyzed through the lenses {{of a host of}} other theories, including critical legal theory, bargain theory, and so on. Because no single, unitary theory can ever explain the complex body of laws and societal conventions surrounding contracts, the best rule to govern any particular situation is the one that {{can be justified}} by multiple normative theories. Such an approach would stand the best chance of achieving consensus, and would acknowledge the insight of pluralism theorists—that no single unified theory can explain the civil law. This Article applies a concordant approach to selecting contract rules to address the question of whether a parent company should be held liable in tort for directing the termination of a contract entered into by its subsidiary. Under ordinary circumstances, a simple breach of contract does not give rise to tort liability and punitive damages; one cannot tortiously interfere with one’s own contract. But the courts around the country are deeply divided {{on the question of whether}} parent companies are immune from tort liability for inducing a subsidiary to breach a contract. Some courts hold that because the parent and subsidiary share common interests, the parent is completely immune from tort liability, just as though it were a party to the contract (Category 1). Some courts take the similarly formalistic approach that because the parent and subsidiary are technically separate entities, the parent enjoys no immunity from tort liability (Category 2). Some courts impose tort liability only if the parent acted against the business interests of the parent and subsidiary or committed an independent tort (Category 3). Some courts impose tort liability even if the breach of contract was in the business interest of the parent and subsidiary if the parent company’s actions were “wrongful,” which can be something less than tortious behavior (Category 4). This Article presents an exhaustive survey and categorization of these conflicting rules and then applies normative contract theory to determine which is the best approach. In particular, the two most dominant contract law theories of our time are applied to the issue: efficiency theory and rights-based theory. Applying efficiency theory to the problem at hand, this Article begins with the proposition that, in order to facilitate efficient breaches of contract, no tort liability should be imposed. However, once one takes into account the underlying false assumption of efficiency theory that commercial actors always act rationally, allowing for tort liability to be imposed in those situations where the parent does not act out of business judgment makes sense. When rights-based theory is applied to this issue, it raises questions as to whether breach should be penalized to honor the promise made to the nonbreaching party and to protect the non-breaching party’s reliance on that promise. However, rights-based theory would also argue for protecting the parent company’s autonomy by allowing it to reject a promise it never accepted and to decline to honor reliance it never induced—but only if the parent is acting out of rational business interest. Accordingly, the parent company should be afforded autonomy in choosing to terminate a contract it did not bargain for (so long as it pays compensatory damages). If the parent company’s actions are not taken for rational business reasons, but rather for reasons of spite, malice, or oppression, then the law should punish and deter such behavior...|$|R
