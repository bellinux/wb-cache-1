50|$|As {{with any}} {{multipole}} moment, if a lower-order moment (monopole or dipole in this case) is non-zero, then {{the value of}} the quadrupole moment depends on the choice of the <b>coordinate</b> <b>origin.</b> For example, a dipole of two opposite-sign, same-strength point charges (which has no monopole moment) can have a nonzero quadrupole moment if the origin is shifted away {{from the center of the}} configuration (exactly between the two charges); or the quadrupole moment can be reduced to zero with the origin at the center. In contrast, if the monopole and dipole moments vanish, but the quadrupole moment does not (e.g., four same-strength charges, arranged in a square, with alternating signs), then the quadrupole moment is coordinate independent.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} important example of a radiating system {{is a pair of}} mass points with equal masses orbiting each other on a circular orbit (an approximation to e.g. special case of binary black holes). Since the dipole moment is constant, we can for convenience place the <b>coordinate</b> <b>origin</b> right between the two points. Then the dipole moment will be zero, and if we also scale the coordinates so that the points are at unit distance from the center, in opposite direction, the system's quadrupole moment will then simply bewhere M is the mass of each point, and [...] are components of the (unit) position vector of one of the points. As they orbit, this x-vector will rotate, which means that it will have a nonzero first, and also the second time derivative (this is of course true regardless the choice of the coordinate system). Therefore the system will radiate gravitational waves. Energy lost in this way was first inferred in the changing period of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, a pulsar in orbit with another neutron star of similar mass.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of replicons into clusters {{is believed to}} be of critical importance for genome duplication in higher eukaryotes, but its functional organization still remains to be fully clarified. The <b>coordinated</b> activation of <b>origins</b> is insufficient on its own to account for a timely completion of genome duplication when interorigin distances vary significantly and fork velocities are constant. Mechanisms <b>coordinating</b> <b>origin</b> distribution with fork progression are still poorly elucidated, because of technical difficulties of visualizing the process. Taking advantage of a single molecule approach, we delineated and compared the DNA replication kinetics at the genome level in human normal primary and malignant cells. Our results show that replication forks moving from one origin, as well as from neighboring origins, tend to exhibit the same velocity, although the plasticity of the replication program allows for their adaptation to variable interorigin distances. We also found that forks that emanated from closely spaced origins tended to move slower than those associated with long replicons. Taken together, our results indicate a functional role for origin clustering in the dynamic regulation of genome duplication...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{replication}} initiates at discrete origins along eukaryotic chromosomes. However, in most organisms, origin firing is not efficient; {{a specific}} origin will fire in some {{but not all}} cell cycles. This observation {{raises the question of}} how individual origins are selected to fire and whether origin firing is globally coordinated to ensure an even distribution of replication initiation across the genome. We have addressed these questions by determining the location of firing origins on individual fission yeast DNA molecules using DNA combing. We show that the firing of replication origins is stochastic, leading to a random distribution of replication initiation. Furthermore, origin firing is independent between cell cycles; there is no epigenetic mechanism causing an origin that fires in one cell cycle to preferentially fire in the next. Thus, the fission yeast strategy for the initiation of replication is different from models of eukaryotic replication that propose <b>coordinated</b> <b>origin</b> firing...|$|R
