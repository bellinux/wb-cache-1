40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel {{approaches for}} generating sequencing {{rules for the}} <b>car</b> <b>sequencing</b> (CS) problem in cases of two and multiple processing times per station. The CS problem decides on the succession of different car models launched down a mixed-model assembly line. It aims to avoid work overloads at the stations of the line by applying so-called sequencing rules, which restrict the maximum occurrence of labor-intensive options in a subsequence of a certain length. Thus to successfully avoid work overloads, suitable sequencing rules are essential. The paper shows that the only existing rule generation approach leads to sequencing rules which misclassify feasible sequences. We present a novel procedure which overcomes this drawback by generating multiple sequencing rules. Then, it is shown how to apply both procedures in case of multiple processing times per station. For both cases analytical and empirical results are derived to compare classification quality. Mixed-model assembly lines <b>Car</b> <b>sequencing</b> Sequencing rules...|$|R

40|$|The NP-hard {{problem of}} <b>car</b> <b>sequencing</b> appears {{as the heart}} of the {{logistic}} process of many car manufacturers. The subject of the ROADEF' 2005 challenge addressed a <b>car</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem proposed by the car manufacturer RENAULT, more complex than the academic problem generally addressed in the literature. This paper describes two local search approaches for this problem. In the first part, a new approach by very large-scale neighborhood search is presented. This approach, designed during the qualification stage preceding the final, is based on an original integer linear programming formulation. The second part is dedicated to the approach which enabled us to win the ROADEF' 2005 challenge. Inspired by the latest works on the subject, this one is based on very fast explorations of small neighborhoods. Our contribution here is mainly algorithmic, in particular by showing how much exploiting invariants speeds up the neighborhood evaluation and contributes to the diversification of the search. Finally, the two approaches are compared and discussed through an extensive computational study on RENAULT's benchmarks. The main conclusion drawn at this point is that sophisticated metaheuristics are useless to solve <b>car</b> <b>sequencing</b> problems. More generally, our victory on ROADEF' 2005 challenge demonstrates that algorithmic aspects, sometimes neglected, remain the key ingredients for designing and engineering high-performance local search heuristics. ...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturers in a {{wide range}} of {{industries}} nowadays face the challenge of providing a rich product variety at a very low cost.

40|$|We {{characterized}} the in vivo, cellular and molecular pathophysiology {{of a case}} of neonatal hyperparathyroidism (NHPT) resulting from a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation in the gene for the extracellular Ca 2 + (Ca 2 +(o)) -sensing receptor (CaR). The female neonate presented with moderately severe hypercalcemia, markedly undermineralized bones, and multiple metaphyseal fractures. Subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed at 6 wk; hypercalcemia recurred rapidly but the bone disease improved gradually with reversion to an asymptomatic state resembling familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH). Dispersed parathyroid cells from the resected tissue showed a set-point (the level of Ca 2 +(o) half maximally inhibiting PTH secretion) substantially higher than for normal human parathyroid cells (approximately 1. 8 vs. approximately 1. 0 mM, respectively); a similar increase in set-point was observed in vivo. The proband's CaR gene showed a missense mutation (R 185 Q) at codon 185, while her normocalcemic parents were homozygous for wild type (WT) <b>CaR</b> <b>sequence.</b> Transient expression of the mutant R 185 Q CaR in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells revealed a substantially attenuated Ca 2 +(o) -evoked accumulation of total inositol phosphates (IP), while cotransfection of normal and mutant receptors showed an EC 50 (the level of Ca 2 +(o) eliciting a half-maximal increase in IPs) 37 % higher than for WT CaR alone (6. 3 +/- 0. 4 vs. 4. 6 +/- 0. 3 mM Ca 2 +(o), respectively). Thus this de novo, heterozygous CaR mutation may exert a dominant negative action on the normal CaR, producing NHPT and more severe hypercalcemia than typically seen with FBHH. Moreover, normal maternal calcium homeostasis promoted additional secondary hyperparathyroidism in the fetus, contributing to {{the severity of the}} NHPT in this case with FBHH...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Bone resorbing osteoclasts require tight {{attachment}} {{of their}} plasma membrane {{to the bone}} surface in order to retain the specific microenvironment and thus {{to be able to}} dissolve the bone matrix underneath. Cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins usually mediating homophilic calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. In the present work we have studied the effects of the cadherin <b>CAR</b> <b>sequence</b> HAV-containing hexapeptide AHAVSE on osteoclasts. The primary attachment of osteoclasts to bone surface is not affected by the peptide, suggesting that it is not mediated by cadherins. Treatment of osteoclast cultures with AHAVSE decreased the number of resorption pits and the total resorbed area. Furthermore, we show rapid inactivation of osteoclasts with AHAVSE, which is seen as a decrease in the percentage of osteoclasts with actin rings. Pan-cadherin antibodies localized cadherin-like molecule in the sealing zone area of osteoclasts. These results suggest that cadherin-like molecules may mediate the tight attachment of osteoclasts in the sealing zone area and that the decrease of resorption in AHAVSE-treated osteoclast cultures is due to prevention of sealing zone formation. We studied the polarity of mesenchymal osteoblasts using osteosarcoma cell line UMR- 108 and endosteal osteoblasts in situ in bone tissue cultures. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) was targeted to the culture medium-facing surface. In endosteal osteoblasts, VSV G protein was found in the surface facing the bone marrow and circulation. On the contrary, Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) was localized to the bone substrate-facing surface of the UMR- 108 cells. Electron microscopy showed that VSV particles were budding from the culture medium-facing surface, whereas Influenza viruses budded from the bone substrate-facing plasma membrane. These findings suggest the bone attaching plasma membrane of osteoblasts is apical, and the circulation or bone marrow facing plasma membrane is basolateral in nature. Gap junctions often mediate communication between different cells and cell types. In the present work, we demonstrate that rat osteoclasts show connexin- 43 staining localizing in the plasma membrane of the cells in cell-cell contacts and over the basolateral membrane of osteoclasts. The effects of heptanol and Gap 27, known gap- junctional inhibitors, were studied using the well-characterized pit formation assay. The inhibitors decreased the number and activity of osteoclasts, suggesting a defect in the fusion of mononuclear osteoclast precursors to multinucleated mature osteoclasts. Furthermore, the total resorbed area and the number of resorption pits also decreased in the cultures. These results suggest that gap-junctional connexin- 43 plays a functional role in osteoclasts, and that the blocking of gap junctions decreases both the number and the activity of osteoclasts...|$|E

Both pseudo-polynomial algorithms and lower bounds are presented for parts of the problem or family of instances. With this set of lower bounds, we establish the optimality (up to the first non-trivial criteria) of 54 % of best known solutions for the benchmark used for the Roadef Challenge 2005. We also prove that the optimal penalty for a single ratio constraint N/P can be computed in O(P) and that determining the feasibility of a <b>car</b> <b>sequencing</b> instance limited to a pair of simple ratio constraints can be achieved by dynamic programming. Finally, we propose a solving algorithm exploiting these results within a local search approach. To achieve this goal, a new meta-heuristic (star relinking) is introduced, designed for the optimization of an aggregation of criteria, when the optimization of each single criterion is a polynomial problem. ...|$|R
