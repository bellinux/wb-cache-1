From the approximate representations of the equation of state, we obtain estimates of several universal amplitude ratios. The three-dimensional O(4) universality class is expected to describe the finite-temperature chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics with two light flavors.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{determining}} the <b>critical</b> <b>equation</b> of state of three-dimensional XY systems. For this purpose we first consider the small-field expansion of the effective potential (Helmholtz free energy) in the high-temperature phase. We compute the first few nontrivial zero-momentum ii-point renormalized couplings, which parametrize such expansion, by analyzing the high-temperature expansion of an improved lattice Hamiltonian with suppressed leading scaling corrections. These results are then used to construct parametric representations of the <b>critical</b> <b>equation</b> of state which are valid in the whole critical regime, satisfy the correct analytic properties (Griffith's analyticity), and take into account the Goldstone singularities at the coexistence curve. A systematic approximation scheme is introduced, which is limited essentially by the number of known terms in the small-field expansion df the effective potential. From our approximate representations of the equation of state, we derive estimates of universal ratios of amplitudes. For the specific-heat amplitude ratio we obtain A(+) /A(-) = 1. 055 (3), to be compared with the best experimental estimate A(+) /A(-) = 1. 054 (1) ...|$|E

We employ a method based on an exact flow equation for a coarse grained free energy. A suitable truncation is solved numerically. 1 A precise computation of the <b>critical</b> <b>equation</b> of state near a second order phase transition is an old problem. From a general renormalisation group analysis [1] one can prove the Widom scaling form [2] H = φ δ ˜ f((T − Tc) /φ 1 /β) for {{the relation between the}} magnetic field H, the magnetisation φ and the difference from the critical temperature T − Tc. In several models the critical exponents β and δ have been computed with high accuracy [3] but the scaling function ˜ f is more difficult to access. Previous attempts include an expansion in 4 −ǫ dimensions in second order in ǫ (third order for the Ising model) [3]. A particular difficulty for a direct computation in three dimensions arises from the existence of massless Goldstone modes in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking for models with continuous symmetry (e. g.
