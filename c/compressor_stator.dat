5000|$|The J79 was {{a brand-new}} engine, with {{development}} continuing throughout the YF-104A test phase and during service with the F-104A. The engine featured variable incidence <b>compressor</b> <b>stator</b> blades, a design feature that altered {{the angle of}} the stator blades automatically with altitude and temperature. A condition known as [...] "T-2 reset", a normal function that made large stator blade angle changes, caused several engine failures on takeoff. It was discovered that large and sudden temperature changes (e.g., from being parked in the sun prior to becoming airborne) were falsely causing the engine stator blades to close and choke the compressor. The dangers presented by these engine failures were compounded by the downward ejection seat, which gave the pilot little chance of a safe exit at low level. The engine systems were subsequently modified and the ejection seat changed to the more conventional upward type. Uncontrolled tip-tank oscillations sheared one wing off of an F-104B; this problem was apparent during testing of the XF-104 prototype and was eventually resolved by filling the tank compartments in a specific order.|$|E

The measured midspan loss of total pressure can be related to stator surface boundary layers, the chopped rotor wakes passing through the stator row, and the interaction between these flows. The interaction between rotor blade wake segments and stator blade surface boundary layers generates much higher losses than expected in both the stator wake and in the region of flow between stator boundary layers/wakes, if interaction effects are ignored...|$|R

The ratios of rear-segment to front-segment chord and camber were varied. Results were also compared to the analytical performance of a reference solid blade section. All tandem blade sections exhibited lower calculated losses than the solid stator. But no one geometric configuration exhibited clearly superior characteristics. The front segment accepts the major effect of overall incidence angle change. Rear- to front-segment camber ratios of 4 and greater appeared to be limited by boundary-layer separation from the pressure surface of the rear segment...|$|R

The original aluminium stators were replaced with steel ones in which configuration the engine developed 5.9 kN in August, and passed a 10-hour endurance run at 9.8 kN in December. The first flight test took place on March 15, 1942, when a 004A was carried aloft by a Messerschmitt Bf 110 to run up the engine in flight. The 004 used an eight-stage axial-flow compressor, with six axial combustion chambers (made from sheet steel), and a one-stage turbine with hollow blades.|$|R

The experimental results show that as the clocking positions vary, the upstream stator wake enters the following passage at different circumferential positions, and then mixes with the local fluid in the following passage. This is the main reason for the variation of the compressor performance resulted from the stator clocking effects. The variation of the compressor performance due to the clocking effect is less pronounced for the <b>compressor</b> with compound-lean <b>stators</b> than with the baseline. At a certain clocking position, the efficiency of the <b>compressor</b> with compound-lean <b>stators</b> is increased in comparison with that of the baseline, especially on small mass flow rate conditions, e. g., 0. 7 % at design condition and 3. 5 % at near-surge condition in this case.

40|$|Summary. Goal. To {{investigate}} the phase {{composition of the}} obtained sealing coatings based on aluminophosphate compound (APC) {{and the impact of}} temperature rise on it. Methods. Qualitative X-ray phase analysis (XRPA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) are used as the methods of research. Roentgenograms for structural analysis were obtained on a DRON- 4 - 07 using filtered copper radiation in the secondary beam. Registration and initial processing of diffraction patterns was performed using the software package PDOS with the output of the diffraction patterns on the screen. Using the "loupe" option allowed to identify weak interference lines, which increased the accuracy of the method of qualitative XRPA. The thermograms for DTA received on the device type Termoskan- 2. The results. It is revealed that base of coating is X-ray amorphous phase. There are following crystalline phases: Al, AlPO 4, Al (PO 3) 3, BN found in the coating. It is revealed that annealing doesn’t make a significant influence on the phase composition of the crystalline phases and the coating doesn’t lose properties after annealing during repeated thermal stress. Scientific novelty. The phase composition of the proposed sealing coatings based on APC and produced by plasma spraying, and the effect of annealing on the phase composition of the coating are investigated. The reaction of synthesis of primary material forming on the basis of APC for coating is offered. Practical significance. The results can be used in aviation technology in the development of gas turbine engines (GTE) and the design of the compressors. The sealing coating may be used to improve the reliability of the compressor and to increase the efficiency ratio of turbine engine. During the operation the compressor’s blades touch the sealing coating of <b>compressor’s</b> <b>stator</b> and grooves it without causing locking and destruction of the rotor.

In the case of rotor blades, fatigue cracks initiated from either side of the airfoil with multiple origins and propagated to form through thickness cracks.

As the rotor/stator axial gap decreases, although the diffusion capacity of the compressor increases obviously, the outlet flow field in the straight stator stages deteriorates quickly.
