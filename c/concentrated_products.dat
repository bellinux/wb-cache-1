40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{procedure}} for synthesizing proto-imogolite (an acid-soluble hydroxy-aluminium orthosilieate complex) and imogolite (a tubular aluminosilicate mineral) {{was used to}} produce ferruginous aluminosilicates over a range of A 1 /Fe ratios to determine whether Fe 3 + can be incorporated in the imogolite structure. Analysis of the synthesized products by transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and IR spectroscopy indicated that, while imogolite was formed {{in the presence of}} iron, increased Fe 3 + in the systems caused the formation of ferrihydrite and poorly-organized aluminosilicates resembling proto-imogolite allophane. Treatment of these materials with Na-citrate/dithionite/bicarbonate dissolved the ferrihydrite and poorly-organized aluminosilicate, and <b>concentrated</b> <b>products</b> with tubular morphology. Analysis of the structural Fe 3 + by ESR spectroscopy suggested that little or no Fe 3 + was incorporated inthe structure of imogolite, although the less crystalline proto-imogolite allophane may have accommodated some structural Fe 3 +. A separate iron-rich product, identified as ferrihydrite, was formed at low A 1 /Fe ratios. M 6 ssbauer spectroscopic analysis of 57 Fe 3 + doped at very low levels into proto-imogolite and imogolite indicated that the sites of substitution were better defined in the latter.

The farms are far distant from the consumption centers of the country which results in high freight rates and a need to produce <b>concentrated</b> <b>products</b> for market, and also in violent fluctuations in farm prices.

METHODS: In this single-blind randomized crossover study, 22 healthy subjects (age: 18 - 59 years old) were included and randomly divided into two groups of 11. Group A consumed commercial CSJ during the first four-week period. After a two-week washout period, they consumed natural CSJ for another four weeks. The procedure was reversed in group B. The participants were asked to drink 500 ml/day of either natural or commercial CSJ twice a day with breakfast and dinner. The effects of orange juice on blood pressure were evaluated. RESULTS: After drinking commercial CSJ, diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significantly decreased (5. 13 %; P = 0. 03 and- 5. 91 %; P = 0. 003, respectively).

40|$|Summary. The {{concentrated}} {{sodium sulfate}} solution is formed during {{the processing of}} waste battery scrap. A promising way to further treatment of the concentrated salt solution could be the conversion of these salts into acid and bases by electrodialysis, that can be reused in the same technical process cycle. For carrying out the process of conversion of salts into the corresponding acid and base several cells schemes with different combinations of cation, anion and bipolar membranes are used. At this article a comparative analysis of these cells is carried out. In the cells there were used the membranes МC- 40, МА- 41 and МB- 2 I. Acid and base solutions with higher concentration may be obtained {{during the process of}} electrodialysis in the circulation mode, when a predetermined amount of salt in the closed loop is run through a set of membranes to obtain the desired concentration of the product. The disadvantages of this method are the high cost of buffer tanks and the need to work with small volumes of treated solutions. In industrial applications it is advisable to use continuous electrodialysis with bipolar membranes, since this configuration allows {{to increase the number of}} repeating sections, which is necessary to reduce the energy costs. The increase of the removal rate of salts can be achieved by increasing the process steps, and to produce a more <b>concentrated</b> <b>products</b> after the conversion step can be applied electrodialysis-concentrator or evaporator...|$|E
40|$|For any {{separation}} {{procedure in}} the chemical industry, {{a certain amount}} of reversible work in the form of free energy is required, as dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Classical techniques for effecting liquid-phase separations, in particular distillation, essentially supply this energy in the form of heat which is converted to required free energy in the distillation column. The latter is in itself a heat engine, converting the heat source into work {{in the form of a}} stream of vapor moving down a temperature-pressure gradient. In general, the columns are very inefficient as heat engines, expressed as a percentage of their theoretical Carnot efficiency. The total percentage of energy used in separation processes, particularly distillation, in the chemical and related industries is very considerable. The majority of the energy used for these separations is thermal input in the form of the low heating-value of oil or gas. From the national viewpoint, it would be advantageous to examine the possible use of energy derived from abundant indigenous sources (coal, nuclear, hydro) to replace this hydrocarbon fuel input. The only practical energy vector for this application is electricity. Since the latter is work, it is important that it be used to perform separations directly, so that the maximum possible conservation of primary energy input can occur. The purpose of this paper is to discuss practical separation processes in which free energy is used directly. Such processes include those which allow a direct separation by means of phases with favorable free energy changes for separation which are accessible to available work inputs. Such processes might involve liquid-liquid, liquid-solid or liquid gas separations, but all involve a phase transition or phase boundary. The best known of such types of processes involve membrane separation techniques, but other possible schemes will be discussed in this paper. In particular, the potential for the incorporation of these techniques into more traditional chemical preparations to allow higher purity and more <b>concentrated</b> <b>products</b> with a lower total primary energy input will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Recent {{studies have}} shown that when milk fat is heated, a {{homologous}} series containing the n-alkyl members of methyl ketones with odd numbers of carbon in their chains are produced (48; 44; 38; and 3). The same series of compounds also is found in evaporated and dried whole milk and in these products the concentration increases during storage (70 and 46). It is believed by some investigators that the methyl ketones {{play an important role in}} flavor deterioration of milk fat and in the aforementioned <b>concentrated</b> <b>products.</b> At the present time, however, there is disagreement on the factors influencing methyl ketone production; some workers relate their formation to autoxidation (25), while there are others who report that heat and water are essential in the reaction (48; 38 and 3). Finally, a recent report indicates that anhydrous milk fat will give rise to methyl ketones when heated in the absence of oxygen (44). The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of various factors on the qualitative and quantitative composition of methyl ketones in heat treated milk fat. It is anticipated that the resulting information will contribute to a more thorough understanding of the reactions leading to ketone production in the fat; hence, to development of suitable processing measures for prevention of this type of deterioration in dairy products. Milk fat was prepared from raw cream two days after milking. It was washed free from phospholipids, centrifuged at 30, 000 x G for 20 minutes and degassed at two to five microns pressure for one hour. The fat was then heat treated in sealed vials at various temperatures and time periods under controlled conditions. The samples were quantitatively analyzed for methyl ketones by direct conversion of the ketones to 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) derivatives in the intact fat sample. The derivatives were isolated from the fat, separated and identified by a combination of column and paper chromatographic methods and by their absorption spectra. Methyl ketone formation in heated milk fat was shown to be non-oxidative. A plateau in ketone production was approached in the 120 °C to 140 °C range when the time of heat treatment was 30 minutes. Added water enhanced total methyl ketone production at 140 °C but not at 200 °C. Air did not hinder ketone production. Maximum ketone production (1. 733 mM/kg fat) was noted after three hours of heat treatment at two to five microns pressure, and 140 °C. Milk fat centrifuged at 30, 000 x G for 20 minutes and degassed at two to five microns pressure for one hour was found to contain 0. 27...|$|E
