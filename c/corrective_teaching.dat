40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of comprehesible input, explicit <b>teaching</b> and <b>corrective</b> feedback in <b>teaching</b> spoken hortatory exposition. This study relies on a case study design involving classroom observations, students’ texts documentation, and dependent t-test as strategies of data collection. The data from observations were analyzed by using four stages of analysis: organizing, transcribing, converting, classifying, describing, and interpreting. The students’ texts were analyzed by using SOLOM; that is, Students Oral Language Observation Matrix, and the rubric adapted from Butt, Fahey, Feez, spinks, and Yallop (2000) and Emilia (2011). The analysis shows that comprehensible input, explicit <b>teaching</b> and <b>corrective</b> feedback develop students’ skills in spoken hortatory exposition. Students were able to improve their ability in the general aspects of speaking including comprehension, fluency, grammar, and pronunciation. In addition, {{they were able to}} speak by following the genre moves of hortatory exposition. This study suggests that the techniques of comprehensible input, explicit <b>teaching,</b> and <b>corrective</b> feedback are recommended to be applied in a language teaching process.

40|$|Error {{correction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} contentious and misunderstood issues in both foreign and second language teaching. Despite varying positions on the effectiveness of error correction or the lack of it, corrective feedback remains an institution in the writing classes. Given this context, this action research endeavors to survey prevalent attitudes of teachers and students toward corrective feedback and examine their implications to classroom practices.   This paper poses the major problem:  How do teachers’ perspectives on corrective feedback match the students’ views and expectations about error treatment in their writing? Professors of the University of the Philippines who teach composition classes and over a hundred students enrolled in their classes were surveyed.   Results showed that there are differing perceptions of teachers and students regarding corrective feedback. These oppositions must be addressed as they have implications to current pedagogical practices which include constructing and establishing appropriate lesson goals, using alternative <b>corrective</b> strategies, <b>teaching</b> grammar points in class even in the tertiary level, and further understanding the learning process...|$|R

Students’ and Teachers’ Attitudes {{toward the}} Teacher’s <b>Corrective</b> Feedback in <b>Teaching</b> Writing of English as a Foreign Language (A Case Study at Surabaya State University of the Fifth Semester Students in the Academic Year of 2014 / 2015). Consultant I: Dra. Diah Kristina, M. A, Ph. d., Consultant II: Dr. Hersulastuti, M. Hum,. Thesis. Surakarta: English Education Department, Graduate school, Teacher Training and Education Faculty, Sebelas Maret University Surakarta Nowadays, {{corrective}} feedback in writing English is considered as the controversial issues being confronted among researchers {{and it has}} attracted a number of researches recently. However, most of the researches conducted recently concern more {{on the effectiveness of}} corrective feedback instead of the psychological aspect of attitude as their subject. Regarding with this, this research is conducted to discover more about the attitudes of the students and the teachers towards corrective feedback in writing English. The objectives of the research are to explore and describe: 1) the students’ attitudes towards the teachers’ corrective feedback; 2) the teachers’ attitudes towards the corrective feedback given; 3) the type of feedback that the students’ needs; 4) the consequences of the students’ attitudes towards their achievement in writing English. This research was conducted at Surabaya State University of the fifth semester students from October 2014 to January 2015 through a qualitative case study approach. The researcher used purposive sampling in selecting the participants of this research. Twelve students who are considered as high and low proficiency level of writing participated in answering the questionnaire. In order to have a deep understanding of the students’ attitudes towards corrective feedback, all of them were selected as the interviewees. Additionally, the English teacher was also interviewed to discover how they perceive the corrective feedback. In this study, questionnaires, interviews, classroom observations, and document collection were applied as instruments. Finally, the interactive model of data analysis proposed by Miles M. B and Huberman A. M (1984) was used in order to analyze the data. The findings demonstrate that: (1) Most of the informants have positive attitudes towards the teachers’ corrective feedback and the different levels of proficiency does not affect their attitudes; (2) All of the teachers also have positive attitudes towards the corrective feedback given; (3) There is a mismatch occurred between the implementation of corrective feedback given by the teachers and the students’ needs; (4) Attitudes significantly affect the students’ achievement in writing English However, the findings of this research cannot be generalized. Thus, the findings of this research can be used to address how the difference belief of students and teachers can be met accordingly in order to build better pedagogy.

40|$|The aim of {{research}} was to determine statistically significant canonical relations between functional abilities and achieved agility results in children with kyphotic posture. The realization of such task would create possibility {{to come up with}} a more rational procedure for optimal planning, programming and control of the process of <b>teaching</b> <b>corrective</b> gymnastics. The research was conducted on a sample of 46 students of primary schools in Niš, all male, aged 12 (± 6 months), included in regular classes of PE and exercises in order to correct kyphosis three times a week for 45 minutes at Niš Health Center. The results of canonical relations with the results of the functional abilities of children with agility kyphotic posture were statistically processed in a way to provide answers to the research goal. We used the program “Statistica” 8. 0 for Windows to calculate the descriptive statistical parameters and canonical correlation analysis. The results showed that there are statistically significant relations and influences between a set of variables for assessing functional ability, as a predictor system, and agility, as a criterion variable.    </div...|$|R

In achieving the objectives, the researcher used descriptive qualitative as an approach to collect and analyze the data. The research was held in SMP Negeri 2 Blora. The research took 33 students of the first grade students as {{the subject of the}} study. The writer gets the data of the research from event, informant, and document. The techniques of collecting data are the observation and interview about the writing teaching learning process. The result of the analysis shows that teacher corrective feedback technique is appropriate and effective for the first grade students of SMP Negeri 2 Blora in teaching writing descriptive text. The teacher in the SMP Negeri 2 Blora combined both oral corrective feedback and written corrective feedback. By using this technique, the students are capable of knowing their errors, the reason and correct it. Especially in oral corrective feedback, the researcher found a new technique that was used by the teacher. So it can facilitate the teaching learning writing process. The students feel comfortable and enjoy the class. The students were not afraid when they made an error. Corrective feedback could come from the other students. This condition make the students active because they could share their idea to another students when there is an error...|$|R
40|$|Assessment has a {{great deal}} of power over students. However, there is little {{research}} on how students experience assessment and its power in the school context. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is therefore to examine how students in one Finnish upper secondary school experienced assessment and (dis) empowerment in their EFL studies. The present study, which situates itself within the realm of teacher research, also aims to experiment with alternative assessment methods in order to investigate whether they could foster empowerment in upper secondary EFL studies. The study comprises five articles and a monograph, and is divided into two parts, each with its own research aims. Part 1 and its three articles focus on students’ experiences of assessment and (dis) empowerment and explore what factors might predict disempowerment in assessment. In addition, Part 1 focuses on feedback as well as stress and test anxiety in connection with high-stakes testing as possible predictors of disempowerment. The data for these articles was gathered in March 2014 by means of a web-based questionnaire. The aim of Part 2 is to explore whether less traditional assessment methods could promote students’ empowerment in assessment. The first article in Part 2 focuses on cheat-sheet tests as a way of engaging and empowering students. The second article explores individual choice in <b>corrective</b> feedback. These <b>teaching</b> experiments took place in six upper secondary groups in 2013 - 2016. The third study in Part 2 is a monograph describing an earlier portfolio programme in EFL teaching. The present study shows that although most students were quite satisfied with the assessment in their EFL studies, a significant minority of students found the assessment disempowering. Several factors, such as inadequate or unhelpful feedback or stress and anxiety caused by assessment, predicted assessment disempowerment. However, students seemed to react to assessment as well as to these factors in a highly individual way. Furthermore, although the alternative assessment methods investigated in the teaching experiments proved useful and also empowering additions to the EFL assessment repertoire, students experienced them in different ways. There should therefore be a range of assessment methods to cater for different assessment purposes as well as for students’ different learning strategies, needs and personalities...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: tendo em vista o conflito existente, no Ordenamento Jurídico brasileiro, entre o princípio da legalidade e o princípio da dignidade da pessoa humana no que diz respeito à prática da Ortodontia pelo cirurgião-dentista não-especialista, este trabalho teve como objetivo analisar a legislação e os julgados dos tribunais nesse assunto. MÉTODOS: realizou-se o levantamento da legislação referente ao ensino e à prática da Ortodontia no Diário Oficial da União e nos órgãos competentes. Com relação aos julgados dos tribunais, a pesquisa foi realizada nos Tribunais de Justiça e nos extintos Tribunais de Alçada de todos os Estados-membros da República Federativa do Brasil, bem como do Superior Tribunal de Justiça e do Supremo Tribunal Federal, utilizando as palavras-chave " Ortodontia", " ortodôntico" e " ortodontista". RESULTADOS: a legislação brasileira classifica os cursos de pós-graduação em stricto sensu e lato sensu, os quais possuem normas de funcionamento próprias. As Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais determinam que, no curso de graduação em Odontologia, seja apenas ministrada a Ortodontia Preventiva. Os tribunais brasileiros entendem que, para a prática da Ortodontia Corretiva, é necessária habilitação em curso de pós-graduação. CONCLUSÃO: o curso de graduação em Odontologia é competente para o ensino da Ortodontia Preventiva; somente os cursos de pós-graduação stricto sensu e lato sensu são competentes para ensinar a Ortodontia Corretiva; é inconcebível a interpretação de que o legislador faculta ao cirurgião-dentista não-especialista praticar a Ortodontia Corretiva; e o cirurgião-dentista não-especialista só pode praticar procedimentos que estejam incluídos na categoria de Ortodontia Preventiva e Interceptiva. OBJECTIVE: In {{view of the}} {{conflict}} in the Brazilian legal system between the principle of legality and the principle of human dignity with regard to the practice of orthodontics by General Practice Dentists, this study aimed to analyze the legislation and judgments passed by courts regarding this issue. METHODS: The authors conducted a survey of the legislation in the Federal Official Gazette and the competent authorities concerning the teaching and practice of orthodontics. As regards judgments passed, searches were performed in the Courts of Justice and the defunct Courts of Appeals in all Member States of the Federative Republic of Brazil, as well as the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Supreme Court, using the keywords " Orthodontics", " orthodontic" and " orthodontist". RESULTS: Brazilian legislation classifies postgraduate courses as strict sense (stricto sensu) or broad sense (lato sensu) courses, each with its own rules of operation. National Curriculum Guidelines provide that only Preventive Orthodontics be taught at the undergraduate level. It is the understanding of Brazilian courts that a postgraduate certificate is a prerequisite for the practice of Corrective Orthodontics. CONCLUSION: An undergraduate course in Dentistry is sufficient for the teaching of Preventive Orthodontics; only postgraduate programs in the strict and broad senses are competent to <b>teach</b> <b>Corrective</b> Orthodontics; any construal that legislation allows General Practice Dentists to practice Corrective Orthodontics is inconceivable; General Practice Dentists are only allowed to perform procedures comprised in the Preventive and Interceptive Orthodontics categories...|$|R
