5000|$|The chief threat {{faced by}} the <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> is hunting. Animals are killed for their meat and fur and also for medicine. Part of their range is in {{protected}} areas {{where they should be}} safe, but elsewhere populations are declining. This is thought to be due to overhunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> as being a [...] "vulnerable species".|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> (Nemorhaedus griseus), {{also known}} as the grey long-tailed goral, is a species of goral, a small goat-like ungulate, native to mountainous regions of Myanmar, China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and {{possibly}} Laos. In some parts of its range, it is overhunted. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as a [...] "vulnerable species".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> is {{native to}} parts of southeastern Asia. Its range extends from northeastern India, Myanmar and northwestern Thailand, through {{northern}} Vietnam and possibly northern Laos, to most of China apart from the extreme north and west. It is a mountain species and is found in rugged, inaccessible areas, on steep slopes and plateaus, normally staying in rocky areas, but sometimes venturing into nearby evergreen-deciduous forest and mixed woodland.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} screen {{microsatellites}} for conservation genetics {{studies of the}} species, a total of 23 microsatellite loci from Korean goral (Naemorhedus caudatus), including 15 previously developed loci and 8 new loci in this study, were tested. Eleven microsatellites were screened and subjected to cross-species amplification using a test panel of four Caprinae species, Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus), <b>Chinese</b> <b>gorals</b> (Naemorhedus goral), Northern chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and domestic goats (Capra hircus). In addition, all eleven microsatellites (SY 3 A, SY 12 A, SY 12 B, SY 48, SY 58, SY 71, SY 76, SY 84, SY 84 B, SY 112, and SY 129) satisfied the criteria to be a core set of microsatellites. This core set of microsatellites and cross-species amplification of Korean goral microsatellites {{were found to be}} helpful for high-resolution studies for conservation and management of Korean goral and other endangered Caprinae species...|$|R
50|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>gorals</b> live {{in small}} groups of up to 12 individuals, though older males are usually solitary. They are wary and retiring, {{spending}} their time on high rocky slopes where they can evade such predators as the wolf and leopard. They move to lower ground in winter. They browse predominately on twigs and leaves of bushes, but also consume grass, nuts, and acorns. Breeding takes place in late spring when one or two kids are born after a gestation period of about 215 days. The young can walk soon after birth and are weaned in the autumn, remaining with the mother throughout the winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{giant panda}} {{is the most}} famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are North-Chinese leopards, Ussuri dholes, Asian black bears, Asiatic golden cats, red pandas, hog badgers and yellow-throated martens. Hooved mammals are {{represented}} by Sichuan takins, wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, <b>Chinese</b> <b>gorals,</b> tufted deer and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden snub-nosed monkeys, Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> is {{intermediate}} {{between an}} antelope and a goat and grows to a shoulder height of 50 to 78 cm {{and length of}} 82 to 130 cm. It is stockily built with long, stout limbs and broad hooves. The horns are short and conical and the ears fairly long and pointed. The four teats are in contrast to sheep and goats which normally have two. The coat consists of a short, dense under layer and an upper layer of longer, semierect, coarse guard hairs. The colour is somewhat variable, ranging from pale grey to dark brown or reddish brown. A dark stripe runs along the back and the throat and underparts are pale.|$|E
50|$|The {{largest of}} these goat {{antelope}} is the takin, {{a relative of}} the musk ox. It lives in highlands from the eastern foothills of the Himalayas to the Qinling and shares habitat with the giant panda in Sichuan and Shaanxi. The takin is a Class I protected species.Serows are smaller than takins but significantly larger than gorals. Both serows and gorals live in rainy mountainous regions and are excellent climbers. Serows have shorter and coarser wool than gorals. The mainland serow is spread across southern China. The range of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> is even broader, extending to Korea in the northeast. The long-tailed goral lives in the northeast, along the borders with Russia and North Korea. The Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, and red goral are found in southern Tibet. The Taiwan serow is endemic to Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The {{organisation}} {{works in}} a variety of habitats. The high altitude program focuses on human wildlife conflicts and conservation of endangered species such as the snow leopard and the Tibetan gazelle. A livestock insurance program has been launched to prevent retaliatory killings of snow leopards by communities whose livestock were being preyed on. The organisation has partnered with the International Snow Leopard Trust and the Government of India to launch a Project Snow Leopard, similar to Project Tiger {{for the protection of the}} wildlife in the Himalayan landscapes. The Project Snow Leopard seeks to address the problem of species declines in the high-altitude Himalayan landscape through evidence-based conservation plans as well as local support. Species such as snow leopard, Asiatic ibex, argali, urial, chiru, takin, serow and musk deer will particularly benefit from this project.In 2003, three wildlife biologists from the foundation reported the <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> (Nemorhaedus caudatus) from Arunachal Pradesh, the first record for India In 2005, scientists from the foundation described the Arunachal macaque from western Arunachal Pradesh, India, a species new to science. The organisation runs a rainforest restoration program in the Anamalai hills in the Western Ghats where fragments of degraded patches of rainforests outside national parks or wildlife sanctuaries are restored in partnership with the private tea and coffee plantations.|$|E
50|$|The {{long-tailed goral}} (also {{known as the}} <b>Chinese</b> gray <b>goral)</b> was and is sparsely found in the wild {{throughout}} China, Russia, and Korea, {{as well as the}} Himalayas. The main population in the wild today is found in Russia where there is a population of about 600 which is in decline; in other places the populations are below 200.|$|R
50|$|A new exhibit {{for a pair}} of European wolves {{opened in}} 2011 as well as a new exhibit for Pallas cats. A {{bachelor}} herd of vicuna arrived from Edinburgh Zoo. European cranes also arrived.The Pallas cats have bred, raising 3 kittens.There are new aviaries for snowy and great grey owls.Two female musk ox have arrived at the park from the Netherlands, they are a mother/daughter pair and are the first musk ox imported into the UK in over 20 years. Five female white-lipped deer have arrived at the park from the Edinburgh Zoo, these are the only females of their species in the UK.A new enclosure for European forest reindeer has been built next to the European wolves.A new male polar bear and male Amur tiger arrived at the park. Five European wolves a Japanese serow and two northern lynx were born in 2012 a male musk ox arrived from Sweden, two red pandas also joined the collection.A new <b>Chinese</b> grey <b>goral</b> enclosure has been constructed; their former enclosure is being developed for wolverine.Wolverine have arrived and recent births (June 2013) include the park's first great grey owl, white-lipped deer, red panda and musk oxen along with Turkmenian markhor, European lynx, Amur tiger, Bactrian wapiti, and Mishmi takin.In 2014, a female European bison was returned for reintroduction to Romania, amongst the births at the park were 6 Pallas cat kittens, two female mishmi takin and a first hatching of satyr tragopan for the park.Summer 2014 saw the start of construction of a new enclosure for a sourced female polar bear that will be arriving at the park in spring 2015.It was confirmed in October 2014 that snow leopard and Amur leopard would arrive at the park in 2015.The last bharal and Japanese serow left the collection in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Staff at a {{wildlife}} conservation facility in western Appalachia believes an unidentified disease has killed {{many of the}} facility’s central <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> (Nemorhaedus goral arnouxianus) collection. A study was undertaken to determine all causes of goral mortality at the facility, to characterize the unidentified goral disease, {{to determine the extent}} of this disease in the herd, and to devise a diagnostic plan to identify the cause. The study results determined that the disease affects young adult gorals in mid summer, presents as lethargy, watery diarrhea, chemosis, and death within 4 - 7 days. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, pneumonia, variable renal lesions, and electrolyte imbalances are also present. The prevalence of the disease is less than expected, with only 3 suspected deaths over the past five years at the facility. A diagnostic plan was established to rule out top differentials, including bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, malignant catarrhal fever, clostridiosis, leptospirosis, pasteurellosis, salmonellosis, and toxicosis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- We {{have studied}} genetic {{divergence}} and phylogenetic relationships of Alpine, Spanish and Abruzzo chamois (genus Rupicapra) by sequencing {{a region of}} 330 nucleotides within the mito-chondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (mtDNA cyt 6). These sequences were aligned with additional ho-mologous sequences of Caprinae: Japanese serow, <b>Chinese</b> <b>goral,</b> Canadian mountain goat, Mishmi takin, muskox, Sardinian mouflon and domestic goat. Results suggest that, using representatives of the Bovini as outgroups, the Caprinae constitute a monophyletic clade. However, inferred phyloge-netic relationships among and within tribes of Caprinae were poorly defined and did not reflect cur-rent evolutionary and taxonomical views. In fact, the Asian Rupicaprini goral and serow constituted a strongly supported clade, which included the muskox, while the takin grouped with Uvis. Therefore, the monophyly of Ovibovini was not supported by cyt b sequences. Species of Rupicapra joined a strongly supported monophyletic clade, which was distantly related to the Asian rupicaprins and Ore-amnos. Therefore, the monophyly of the Rupicaprini was not supported by these cyt h sequences. There were sister species relationships within Rupicapra, Spanish and Alpine chamois and the Abruz-zo chamois (Rupicupru pyrenaica ornata) was strictly related to the Spanish chamois (Rupicapra pyre-naica parva), as previously suggested by allozyme data and hiogeographic reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>goral</b> (Naemorhedus griseus) are a {{threatened}} species in Thailand {{and the focus}} of captive breeding for possible reintroduction. However, little is known of their biology or what factors in the captive environment affect welfare. Our objective {{was to determine the}} impact of gender, season, and management on goral adrenal activity. We hypothesized that differences in fecal glucocorticoid concentrations would be related to animal density. Fecal samples were collected 3 days/ week for 1 year from 63 individuals (n = 32 males, 31 females) at two facilities that house the majority of goral in Thailand: Omkoi Wildlife Sanctuary (Omkoi), an off-exhibit breeding center that houses goral in individual pens (16 pens; n = 8 males, 8 females) and in small family groups (8 pens; n = 8 males, 8 females); and the Chiang Mai Night Safari (NS), a zoo that maintains 31 goral (n = 17 males, 14 females) in one large pen. Glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations were higher in male than female goral at Omkoi throughout the year, and there was a seasonal effect on adrenal activity (p, 0. 05). Goral at Omkoi and NS were used to test the effect of animal density on fecal glucocorticoid excretion of goral housed in similar-sized enclosures. Overall, the highest levels were found at NS (n = 31 adults/pen; 27 m 2 per animal) compared to Omkoi (n = 2 adults/pen; 400 m 2 per animal) (p, 0. 05). Overall findings support our hypothesis that animal density and aspects of the captive environment impact adrenal steroid activity in captive goral. In addition, gender and season also had significan...|$|E
