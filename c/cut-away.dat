25|$|To prevent {{wrinkles}} and other problems, the fabric must be stabilized. The method of stabilizing {{depends on the}} type of machine, the fabric type, and the design density. For example, knits and large designs typically require firm stabilization. There are many methods for stabilizing fabric, but most often one or more additional pieces of material called stabilizers or interfacing are added beneath or on top of the fabric, or both. Stabilizer types include <b>cut-away,</b> tear-away, solvy water-soluble, heat-n-gone, filmoplast, and open mesh, sometimes in various combinations.|$|E

It has a shorter chimney than the original to clear the bridge at Rainhill: the trackbed is deeper than in the 19th century, giving less headroom. Both of these replicas are now based at the National Railway Museum, York.|$|E
25|$|Maines hull {{was long}} and narrow, more like a cruiser than that of Texas, which was wide-beamed. Normally, this would have made Maine the faster ship of the two. However, Maines weight {{distribution}} was ill-balanced, which slowed her considerably. Her main turrets, awkwardly situated on a <b>cut-away</b> gundeck, were nearly awash in bad weather. Because they were mounted toward {{the ends of the}} ship, away from its center of gravity, Maine was also prone to greater motion in heavy seas. While she and Texas were both considered seaworthy, the latter's high hull and guns mounted on her main deck made her the drier ship.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the upper}} part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a {{close-fitting}} shirt-like garment called a chemise in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their gowns or robes, sometimes with petticoats over the chemise. Elaborately quilted petticoats might be displayed by a <b>cut-away</b> dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with reed or willow rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.|$|E

25|$|Parachute pack systems – The {{parachute}} {{is one of}} the trademarks of Force Recon, {{throughout its}} existence the operators have extensively used a wide variety of parachutes. In the mid-1950s, they used the T-10, then later adopting the Capewell canopy release which provided a <b>cut-away</b> to reduce the deadly effect of drag. The T-10 became the most frequented parachute; which had two variants, one for low-level static line (LLSL) and the other for military free fall (MFF) descends. They had numerous parachutes listed under the Table of Equipment (T/E) that had been contained in the Paraloft. Even in its formative days in the Marine Corps Test Unit#1, the operators and testers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) at El Centro had tested and sported numerous parachutes, adding modifications and suggestions that soon were adopted by other parachutists. By the 1990s, the MC-4 and MC-5 Ram Air Parachutes became the feasible choice, as it allows more detailed and accurate landing in smaller areas, easy to control—especially during oscillation of the canopy. Plus, it was formed to modulate between the LLSL and MFF without having to consort to a different pack.|$|E

500|$|As {{the live}} {{broadcast}} of [...] "Live Show" [...] was recorded with TV cameras edited live to video rather than film stock, the video quality for this episode was noticeably different from standard episodes of 30 Rock. Jack acknowledges {{this at the}} start of the episode by asking why everything looks like a [...] "Mexican soap opera." [...] Throughout the episode, the characters broke the fourth wall: Tracy Jordan's unprofessional acting within the TGS episode, Jack's references to the video quality, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' portrayal of Liz in <b>cut-away</b> sequences, and the re-hashing of standard sitcom plot elements.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{say that}} {{they did not want to}} force modernity onto the story. There were some {{creative}} challenges, such as the decision to include the sign [...] "221B" [...] on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having <b>cut-away</b> shots of a hand holding the phone.|$|E

We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was [...] "the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion." [...] Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics [...] "to emphasise {{a woman who was}} very set in her ways".|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "clock" [...] was {{provided}} to affiliates outlining the placement of news and commercial <b>cut-aways,</b> and differed throughout the day and weekends. The clock included options for a 2-, 3-, or 5-minute newscasts {{at the top of}} the hour, followed by other holes for local spots. While the programming was live, DJ's had to avoid references to the weather or anything else that would not be appropriate in many time zones. An 800-line was eventually added, allowing the live DJ's to take phoned in requests.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Schaefer notes two typical {{features}} of exploitation films, {{also found in}} The Wages of Sin. To expand the film to a marketable length, exploitation filmmakers like Kent used [...] "padding," [...] often setting the main characters in a nightclub, which became an excuse {{for a series of}} acts. <b>Cut-aways</b> at frequent intervals would show [...] "the story characters sitting at a table rapturously enjoying themselves". In addition, Kent's films usually began with a [...] "square-up", a statement {{at the beginning of the}} film justifying itself as a dramatic exposé of one of society's problems.|$|R

500|$|The band {{made three}} promotional clips for [...] "Hello, Goodbye". Filmed on 10 November 1967 at the Saville Theatre in London, the clips were {{directed}} by McCartney. The first one shows the Beatles {{dressed in their}} Sgt. Pepper uniforms, apart from a brief <b>cut-away</b> where the group are wearing their 1963-era matching collarless suits. In author John Winn's description of the three clips, this version shows the Beatles performing the song against a psychedelic backdrop, while over the coda they are joined on the stage by female hula dancers. Starr is seen playing a miniature drum kit and, unusually, Lennon appears without his granny glasses. In the second clip, the Beatles mime to the song dressed in more conventional attire and with the stage backdrop depicting a rural setting. The third version combines footage shot during these two scenes with the band playing the song before what Winn terms a [...] "glittery pastel backdrop".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no <b>cut-away</b> gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and going out on a limb even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship. He added that the episode was [...] "particularly great" [...] because it featured no cutaway gags and was a two-hander, noting that [...] "Clearly, the writers know exactly what the fans want." ...|$|E

50|$|The pilot's single, open cockpit was {{immediately}} {{in front of}} the wing-mounting pillar in an oval section forward fuselage {{similar to those of the}} motorless gliders. The position of the propeller disc just behind the wing required the rear fuselage to be rather shallow, so it was formed by four longerons with plywood covering, resulting in a rectangular section. The empennege was conventional, with a triangular tailplane sitting on a low, raised step with a curved leading edge and carrying straight tapered, square tipped, unbalanced elevators. The rear of the step mounted the rudder hinge bearing a tall, straight tapered and flat topped balanced rudder. The rudder extended to a rounded heel at the keel via <b>cut-aways</b> in the inner edges of the elevators.|$|R
5000|$|The AL 5's {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around four longerons, {{giving it a}} rectangular cross-section. The forward part had a high rounded decking between the nose and the pilot's open cockpit; this dropped away aft and ended about halfway to the tail. The engine was a [...] ABC Scorpion flat twin, mounted with its cylinder heads exposed for air-cooling and driving a two blade propeller. At the rear, the AL 5 had a low, rounded fin and a distinctly stepped, rounded, balanced rudder which reached down to the keel. A trapezoidal horizontal tail, braced to the fuselage, was mounted on the fin just above the fuselage; its camber was altered along {{with that of the}} wing and in a similar way, though the camber rage was greater and could be negative. It carried separate elevators which had inner <b>cut-aways</b> for rudder movement.|$|R
40|$|In flow visualization, {{integral}} {{surfaces are}} of particular interest {{for their ability to}} describe trajectories of massless particles. In areas of swirling motion, integral surfaces can become very complex and difficult to understand. Taking inspiration from traditional illustration techniques, such as <b>cut-aways</b> and exploded views, we propose a surface analysis tool based on surface splitting and focus+context visualization. Our surface splitting scheme is hierarchical and at every level of the hierarchy the best cut is chosen according to a surface complexity metric. In order to make the interpretation of the resulting pieces straightforward, cuts are always made along isocurves of specific flow attributes. Moreover, a degree of interest can be specified, so that the splitting procedure attempts to unveil the occluded interesting areas. Through practical examples, we show that our approach is able to overcome the lack of understanding originating from structural occlusion. Keywords: flow visualization, illustrative visualization, occlusion management. ...|$|R

Bremer, the CEO, also owned two northern New Jersey radio stations, WAAT (970 AM, now WNYM) and WAAT-FM (94.7 MHz., now WNSH). The three stations were based in the Mosque Theatre (now Symphony Hall) at 1020 Broad Street in Newark. WATV {{was the first of}} three new stations in the New York City television market to sign on the air during 1948, and was also the first independent station. One unusual daytime program, Daywatch, consisted of a camera focused on a teletypewriter printing wire service news stories, interspersed with <b>cut-aways</b> to mechanical toys against a light music soundtrack. Another early series by the station was Stairway to Stardom (1950-1951), one of the first TV series with an African-American host.|$|R
50|$|It was a single-engined two-seat biplane {{with single}} bay wings. These were unswept, carried no stagger and had {{parallel}} chord {{apart from the}} tips; notable was the large interplane gap and the large (6 ft 4 in, 1.93 m) overhang of the upper wing, wire braced from upward extensions of the interplane struts. It had unbalanced ailerons on the upper wing only. The most unusual feature of the aircraft, though no surprise given Saunders' previous experience was the fuselage, a wooden frame with Consuta-fastened plywood panels, {{one of the earliest}} monocoque aircraft structures. This carried a conventional tail, with an unbraced tailplane and fin bearing unbalanced control surfaces. The pilot's cockpit was below the wing trailing edge with a pair of inboard <b>cut-aways</b> in the trailing edge of the lower wing to improved downward visibility.
