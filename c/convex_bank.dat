40|$|This work {{addresses}} the signatures {{embedded in the}} planform geometry of meandering rivers consequent {{to the formation of}} floodplain heterogeneities as the river bends migrate. Two geomorphic features are specifically considered: scroll bars produced by lateral accretion of point bars at <b>convex</b> <b>banks</b> and oxbow lake fills consequent to neck cutoffs. The sedimentary architecture of these geomorphic units depends on the type and amount of sediment, and controls bank erodibility as the river impinges on them, favoring or contrasting the river migration. The geometry of numerically generated planforms obtained for different scenarios of floodplain heterogeneity is compared to that of natural meandering paths. Half meander metrics and spatial distribution of channel curvatures are used to disclose the complexity embedded in meandering geometry. Fourier Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Singular Spectrum Analysis and Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis are used to emphasize the subtle but crucial differences which may emerge between apparently similar configurations. A closer similarity between observed and simulated planforms is attained when fully coupling flow and sediment dynamics (fully-coupled models) and when considering self-formed heterogeneities that are less erodible than the surrounding floodplain...|$|R
40|$|Bend {{instability}} is {{the process}} whereby perturbations of the planform distribution of a channel relative to a straight configuration may grow, driven by erosion at concave banks and deposition at <b>convex</b> <b>banks,</b> leading {{to the development of}} a meandering pattern. Here we investigate the nature of this instability; that is, we ascertain under what conditions bend instability is convective or absolute. In the former case, an initial nonpersistent, small perturbation localized in space is convected away, eventually leaving the flow domain unperturbed. In the latter case, perturbations spread in both the upstream and downstream directions, eventually affecting the whole flow domain. In convective instabilities, the spatial-temporal development of perturbations is somewhat dependent on the characteristics of the initial perturbation which is required to be persistent in time. On the contrary, absolute instabilities are able to amplify perturbations, even if triggered at some initial time and then ceased. If bend instability is convective, planform information migrates only in one direction, while in the absolute regime, information is propagated in both directions. We show that bend instability is most often, though not invariably, convective at both a linear and nonlinear level. Moreover, the group velocity of perturbations changes sign as the width to depth ratio of the channel crosses some threshold value (the resonant value of Blondeaux and Seminara (1985)) : Below (above) resonance, information is propagated downstream (upstream). We discuss the implications that these findings have on the morphological characteristics of meandering rivers (in particular, the sense of skewing of meander bends and the direction of meander migration). We also clarify how the choice of appropriate boundary conditions in numerical simulations of planform evolution is crucially dependent on the nature of bend instability and on its subresonant or superresonant regime...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{circular}} {{path of a}} stream around a bend {{the surface of the}} water is slightly higher near the concave bank (the bank with the larger radius) than near the <b>convex</b> <b>bank.</b> This slight slope on the water surface of the stream causes a slightly greater water pressure on the floor of the stream near the concave bank than near the <b>convex</b> <b>bank.</b> This pressure gradient drives the slower boundary layer across the floor of the stream toward the <b>convex</b> <b>bank.</b> The pressure gradient is capable of driving the boundary layer up the shallow sloping floor of the point bar, causing sand, gravel and polished stones to be swept and rolled up-hill.|$|E

It emphasizes {{the relationship between the}} commercial banks rate and the lending rate of the central bank. The framework of imperfect competition is provided by the Salop [1979] model of horizontal differentiation which is applied to the banking sector and which is extended, to take account of the loan demand function elasticity. We shown that when the loan demand function is sufficiently convex (log <b>convex),</b> the <b>banking</b> sector exacerbates surprises in the monetary policy. This result is relevant for the efficiency of the monetary policy and for the behavior of the central bank when facing shocks of the loan demand function. Then, we study what should be the optimal implementation of the monetary policy when the central bank is concerned with both the price stability and the financial stability of the banking sector. In the model, the price stability is looked through an quantitative objective for the loans provided by the banking sector. We show that the trade-off between financial stability and price stability induces violent surprises in the monetary policy with respect to the volatility of the loan demand function. ...|$|R

40|$|Title page, {{abstract}} and {{table of contents}} only. The complete thesis in print form {{is available from the}} University of Adelaide Library. The interaction of tidal and fluvial processes in marginal marine settings, particularly tidally influenced channel systems, can produce profound lateral and vertical facies heterogeneity, in forms such as Lateral Accretion Packages (LAPs) and Inclined Heterolithic Stratification (IHS). LAPs form at the <b>convex</b> <b>banks</b> of sinuous channels, and can be composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous deposits. Within tidal reaches, they are often comprised of IHS deposits. IHS deposits are inclined alternating shale and sand layers that form by laterally accreting fluvial-estuarine point bars. Understanding the 3 D distribution of tidally influenced channel architectures in modern channel systems has important implications for the effective modelling of subsurface channel reservoir distribution, connectivity and fluid flow. In this research, 3 D geocellular modelling of a selected modern point bar from the Mitchell River system, Gulf of Carpentaria (GoC), Queensland, Australia, is used to predict heterogeneity and connectivity associated with a tidally influenced channel reservoir system. The modelling workflow consisted of four main stages: (a) data integration, (b) mapping, (c) geocellular modelling and (d) connectivity assessment. Analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery merged with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Models data for an area of 14. 57 km × 2. 34 km allowed direct mapping and measurement of dimensions and orientation of the stratigraphic architecture of the selected point bar geometry. Core and auger well log data and a stratigraphic cross section oriented perpendicular to the channel axis were used in order to constrain the stratigraphic architecture and the facies distribution. Five facies were identified in the studied point bar strata, including Lag Sand Deposits with rippled sandstone 2. 5 m thick, which is common in upstream locations on the point bar, and heterogeneous sand and mud facies. Inclined heterolithic mud deposits (IHS) are confined to the upper 3 m of the point bar. As the focus of this project is the impact of IHS on reservoir connectivity, a new approach was proposed to resolve the heterogeneity associated with tidally influenced channel systems, by developing three geological models based on the presence and continuity of IHS deposits (the products of fluvial and tidal interaction processes). Connectivity analysis of the three realisations showed marked contrast between models using point bar geobodies. The tide-dominated, fluvial-influenced channel system represents the worst reservoir connectivity in the subsurface, as the volume contains considerable bodies of mainly mud facies. Although there are significant objects in this point bar model, the majority of these bodies are very small and supposedly form 75 % mudstone of the total volume. In scenario two (Ft channel system; fluvial dominated, tidally influenced channel system), the model suggests fluid flow will preferentially concentrate in {{the lower part of the}} point bar, where clean sand sediments form a continuous body. The geo-volume in realization three (F channel system; fluvial dominated channel system) reflects the connectivity of the channel comprised of just the point bar object, which can represent best reservoir continuity and limited compartmentalization. Thus, reservoir quality increases as the fluvial process in the channel system becomes more dominant. We recommend that further field work, such as a new stratigraphic cross sections, should be obtained parallel to the channel axis in order to capture 3 D heterogeneity within tidally influenced channel systems, and that the Fullbore Formation Microimager tool should be used to obtain the corrected inclination of IHS deposits.

40|$|Curved river reaches were {{investigated}} {{as an example}} of river configurations where three-dimensional processes prevail. Similar processes occur, for example, in confluences and bifurcations, or near hydraulic structures such as bridge piers and abutments. Some important processes {{were investigated}} in detail in the laboratory, simulated numerically by means of eddy-resolving techniques, and finally parameterized in long-term and large-scale morphodynamic models. Investigated flow processes include secondary flow, large-scale coherent turbulence structures, shear layers and flow separation at the <b>convex</b> inner <b>bank.</b> Secondary flow causes a redistribution of the flow and a transverse inclination of the riverbed, which favour erosion of the outer bank and meander migration. Secondary flow generates vertical velocities that impinge on the riverbed, and are known to increase the erosive capacity of the flow. Large-scale turbulent coherent structures also increase the sediment entrainment and transport capacity. Both processes are not accounted for in sediment transport formulae, which leads to an underestimation of the bend scour and the erosion of the outer bank. Eddy-resolving numerical models are computationally too expensive to be implemented in long-term and large-scale morphodynamic models. But they provide insight in the flow processes and broaden the investigated parameter space. Results from laboratory experiments and eddy-resolving numerical models were at the basis of {{the development of a new}} parameterization without curvature restrictions of secondary flow effects, which is applicable in long-term and large-scale morphodynamic models. It also led to the development of a new engineering technique to modify the flow and the bed morphology by means of an air-bubble screen.

5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{secondary}} flow in the boundary layer along {{the floor of the}} river bed.

40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{is performed}} of a curved open-channel flow over topography {{based on the}} laboratory experiment by Blanckaert [“Topographic steering, flow circulation, velocity redistribution and bed topography in sharp meander bends,” Water Resour. Res., doi: 10. 1029 / 2009 WR 008303 (in press) ]. In the experiment, the large-scale bed topography had developed to {{a more or less}} stationary shape which was prescribed in the LES model as boundary conditions neglecting the small-scale dune forms by means of a straightforward immersed boundary scheme in combination with a simple wall-modeling approach. The small-scale dunes are accounted for in the numerical model by means of parametrization. Sensitivity of the flow to this roughness parametrization is examined by simulating the flow for three different roughness heights. It was found that, notwithstanding the coarse method of representing the dune forms, the qualitative agreement of the experimental results and the LES results is rather good. Comparison of the LES results with the Reynolds averaged numerical simulation results of Zeng et al. [“Flow and bathymetry in sharp open-channel bends: Experiments and predictions,” Water Resour. Res. 44, W 09401, doi: 10. 1029 / 2007 WR 006303 (2008) ] reveals surprisingly good agreement. This good agreement is explained by the minor importance of turbulence stress gradients in the contribution to the transverse and streamwise momentum balance. Moreover, it is found that in the bend the structure of the Reynolds stress tensor shows a tendency toward isotropy which enhances the performance of isotropic eddy viscosity closure models of turbulence. This observation is remarkable since highly anisotropic turbulence might well be expected considering the complex nature of the geometry. Furthermore, the LES results reveal a pronounced recirculation zone near the <b>convex</b> inner <b>bank</b> of the flume due to the shallowness of the flow and strong curvature of the flume. At the interface between the recirculation zone and the main flow, a curved mixing layer is identified as well as strong upwelling flow motion that is accompanied with large production of turbulent kinetic energy.

5000|$|When a river {{reaches a}} low-lying plain, often {{in its final}} course to the sea or a lake, it meanders widely. In the {{vicinity}} of a river bend, deposition occurs on the [...] bank (the bank with the smaller radius).

Continuous deposition on the <b>convex</b> <b>bank</b> and erosion of the concave bank of a meandering river cause {{the formation of a}} very pronounced meander with two [...] banks getting closer. The narrow neck of land between the two neighboring concave banks is finally cut through, either by lateral erosion of the two concave banks or by the strong currents of a flood. When this happens, a new straighter river channel is created and an abandoned meander loop, called a cutoff, is formed. When deposition finally seals off the cutoff from the river channel, an oxbow lake is formed. This process can occur over a time scale from a few years to several decades and may sometimes become essentially static.|$|E

Additionally, when the internal dip sets change direction, it may indicate that the channel pattern converts into another. Furthermore, the riffle zone is located in the bend inflection where one-way transverse circulation transforms into parallel circulation (the down-cut ability of parallel circulation is weak), which usually carries sand and results in thin sand body accumulation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three studies that respectively investigate the stock returns, risk management, and liquidity creation of banks. Chapter 2 focuses on the cross-section of bank stock returns and found that pricing factors such as leverage and beta, shown to be irrelevant to nonfinancial stocks, are important for pricing bank stocks. During the two decades prior to the subprime crisis, banks with high leverage have high stock returns. Beta {{appears to have a}} strong and <b>convex</b> relationship with <b>bank</b> stock returns. This chapter generally suggests that bank stocks seem to respond to a different set of pricing factors than other industries. Chapter 3 examines the drivers behind banks’ use of derivatives for hedging. Covering virtually all banks in the U. S. that have used derivative, one key finding of this chapter is that off-balance sheet loan commitment contracts, rather than on-balance sheet loans, determines the use of derivatives for hedging. Since loan commitment contracts are the primary channel of financing for commercial and industrial borrowers, {{this finding is consistent with}} the observation during the subprime crisis that the illiquidity of the financial market makes it difficult for firms to refinance their existing loans. Finally the last chapter of this thesis examines the liquidity creation of European banks and its relationship with bank equity capital, market power, and institutional context. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of European banks, this chapter shows that the impact of stronger capital base on bank liquidity creation is strictly negative. This means that capital regulations such as the Basel II Accord are likely to curtail banking activities and slow down economic recovery and growth. Next, this chapter shows that stronger creditor rights coupled with stronger market power reduces liquidity creation in developing countries, and vice versa for developed countries. This finding suggests that due to the less developed legal infrastructure, stronger creditor rights could be counterproductive in facilitating bank liquidity creation in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{the role}} of {{riparian}} trees {{in the formation of}} scroll bars, ridges, and swales during the evolution of meandering channels has been inferred largely from field observations with support from air photographs. In situ field observations are usually limited to relatively short periods of time, whereas the evolution of these morphological features may take decades. By combining field observations of inner bank morphology and overlying riparian woodland structure with a detailed historical analysis of airborne LiDAR data, panchromatic, and color images, we reconstruct the spatial and temporal evolution of the morphology and vegetation across four meander bends of the Tagliamento River, Italy. Specifically we reveal (i) the appearance of deposited trees and elongated vegetated patches on the inner bank of meander bends following flood events; (ii) temporal progression from deposited trees, through small to larger elongated vegetated patches (pioneer islands), to their coalescence into long, linear vegetated features that eventually become absorbed into the continuous vegetation cover of the riparian forest; and (iii) a spatial correspondence between the resulting scrolls and ridge and swale topography, and tree cover development and persistence. We provide a conceptual model of the mechanisms by which vegetation can contribute to the formation of sequence of ridges and swales on the <b>convex</b> <b>bank</b> of meander bends. We discuss how these insights into the biomorphological processes that control meander bends advance can inform modeling activities that aim to describe the lateral and vertical accretion of the floodplain during the evolution of vegetated river meanders...|$|E
40|$|We {{surveyed}} adjacent reaches with dif-fering {{riparian vegetation}} {{to explain why}} channels with forested banks are wider than channels with nonforested banks. Cross sec-tions and geomorphic mapping demonstrate that erosion occurs at cutbanks in curving reaches, while deposition is localized on active fl oodplains on the insides of bends. Our data indicate that rates of deposition and lateral migration are both higher in nonforested reaches than in forested reaches. Two dimensionless parameters, α and E, explain our observations. α represents the infl uence of grassy vegetation on rates of active fl oodplain deposition; it is 5 times higher in nonforested reaches than in forested reaches. E is proportional to rates of cutbank migration; it is 3 times higher in nonforested reaches than in forested reaches. Differences in width between forested and nonforested reaches are proportional to E/α. In forested reaches, channels are wide with banks that are diffi cult to erode. Dense tree roots create a low value of E, and the channel migrates slowly. E/α is high, however, because α is very low: shade from trees inhibits the growth of grass on active fl oodplains. In nonforested reaches, channels are narrow with banks {{that are easy to}} erode. E is high, and the channel migrates rapidly. E/α is low, however, due to a very large value of α: grass grows readily on nonforested <b>convex</b> <b>bank</b> fl oodplains. Thus, differences in width between forested and nonforested reaches are related to a balance between rates of cutbank erosion and rates of deposition on active fl oodplains, implying that equilibrium widths develop to equalize rates of cutbank erosion and vegetation-mediated rates of deposition on active fl ood-plains. These results suggest that accurate models of width adjustment should consider the combined effects of bank erodibility and fl oodplain depositional processes, rather than focusing on these processes in isolation from one another...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 A {{technique}} is developed and tested {{to analyze the}} interaction of flowing water, bed topography, and bedload sediment transport in meandering channels where gravel bars are removed. The method relates the local velocity distribution, bed shear stress and sediment transport conditions to the local bed configuration in river bends before and after gravel bar removal. Specific attention is given to pool-depth changes as an immediate result of gravel removal, the residual effects of boundary shear stress changes, and the potential long-term consequences from subsequent runoff events with brief periods of increased streamflow and sediment transport. The most significant new aspect of this work {{is the ability to}} predict whether or not periodic gravel "mining" by means of bar scalping has a residual or cumulative effect on channel morphology and pool depth, particularly in bends. This application is tested against field data collected for the Chetco River and South Santiam River in Oregon, the East Fork River in Wyoming, and the upper Rhone River in France. Some of these sites have been partially subjected to gravel mining; others offer contrasting circumstances to allow comparisons of effects. The study suggests that the maximum velocity distribution shifts inward toward the <b>convex</b> <b>bank</b> of a channel bend at high water levels after gravel removal from a point bar, assuming that sediment transport rates and resupply from upstream are the same as before bar scalping. The inward shift of the maximum velocity distribution causes changes of boundary shear stress distribution in pool zones. Weaker boundary shear stresses are expected in pool zones after bar scalping. This will result in fewer incipient motion events in pool zones over each runoff season. As a result, the pool will experience net sediment deposition as a long-term effect of sediment transport events separated by periods of bed stability...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new types}} of sandbars are found in {{distributary}} channels of the modern Ganjiang Delta, Poyang Lake, China, respectively named as branching-point bar (BPB) and merging-point bar (MPB). BPB is defined as sandbar formed at the branching point of a channel where one channel branches into two. MPB is defined as sandbar formed at the merging point of two channels. BPB results from current velocity decrease at the branching point. BPB, arrowhead-shaped and growing towards upstream through upstream accretion, {{can be divided into}} bar head, middle and tail. Bar head refers to {{the lower part of the}} bar below average low water level, submerges under water whether in rainy seasons or dry seasons, and no plants grow on it. Bar middle refers to the middle part of the bar between average low and average high water levels, and sparse plants grow on it. Bar tail refers to the upper part of the bar above average high water level, and plants grow densely on it. From bar head to bar tail, sediment becomes finer and sorting degree becomes poorer; plant fossils increase in number, and silting-mud layers increase both in number and thickness. Vertically BPB shows a fining-upward sequence. BPB can be classified into 3 types: baby BPB with only bar head, child BPB with bar head and middle, and adult BPB with bar head, middle and tail. Generally from the lower delta plain to upper delta plain, BPB becomes more and more mature. If a channel is suddenly abandoned, BPB at different stages may be preserved. MPB is very similar to BPB in depositional characteristics, and main differences lie in its origin and growth direction. Discovery of BPB and MPB has important implications in finding remaining oil in oilfields. Previously, geologists considered point bars on <b>convex</b> <b>bank</b> of meandering channels or longitudinal bars and transverse bars in the middle of braided channels as favorable locations for finding remaining oil. Our study shows such locations as branching points and merging points of channels are also significant because BPB and MPB develop at these locations. Remaining oil has been found at branching points of channels in Pubei Oilfield, Songliao Basin, Northeast China...|$|E
40|$|Widden Brook in the Hunter Valley, Australia, {{was first}} settled by Europeans in 1831 and had widened {{substantially}} by the 1870 s due to frequent floods during a flood-dominated regime impacting on highly disturbed banks whose riparian trees had been either ringbarked or cleared, and whose understorey had been grazed. Catastrophic floods in 1950 (many), two in August 1952 {{and one in}} February 1955 effected {{the final phase of}} channel widening at the onset of a second flood-dominated regime {{more than half a century}} after the initial widening. Contraction has been active since 1963 by a combination of five biogeomorphic processes. Firstly, rapid channel widening, migration and cutoffs totally reworked the pre-European floodplain and were followed by active floodplain formation. Initial bar formation was replaced by sand splay and overbank deposition which constructed a new floodplain and narrower channel. Secondly, overwidened channel segments that were produced by the catastrophic 1955 flood have contracted since 1963 by the formation of up to four bank-attached, discontinuous benches below the floodplain. Each bench has a bar nucleus of pebbly coarse sand overlain by stratified fine-medium sand and mud. Colonisation by River Sheoaks (Casuarina cunninghamiana subsp. cunninghamiana) or grasses (Cynodon dactylon, Paspalum distichum, Pennisetum clandestinum) is important in converting bars to benches. Thirdly, narrower segments which developed since 1963 have contracted by small-scale accretion on both banks. These deposits are steeply dipping, interbedded sand and mud trapped by stoloniferous and rhizomatous grasses (C. dactylon, P. distichum, P. clandestinum) which also rapidly stabilise the deposits. Fourthly, rare laterally migrating, small radius bends have contracted by recent point bar formation greatly exceeding cutbank recession rates. Point bar formation is controlled by secondary currents producing inclined stratified coarse sands without the influence of vegetation. Lastly, rare, overwidened, non-migrating, large radius bends have greatly contracted by the infilling of dissecting chutes across the <b>convex</b> <b>bank.</b> Establishment of stoloniferous and rhizomatous clonal grasses (Phragmites australis, C. dactylon, P. distichum, P. clandestinum) is important in inducing sedimentation of the chutes. Contraction has produced a much narrower channel than the design width between river training fences which were installed progressively between the 1960 s and 1990 s. The recent flood history of Widden Brook has not included any catastrophic floods of a size similar to February 1955. Our work demonstrates that both trees and grasses can be associated with narrower channel widths and that the causal link between width and vegetation type is more complex than usually acknowledged...|$|E
40|$|Pizzuto, James E. O'Neal, Michael A. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) {{data can}} be used to {{accurately}} model three- dimensional surfaces for quantifying fluvial erosion and deposition. Terrestrial LiDAR is typically used for monitoring banks, but can be used for monitoring planar forms such as point bars. Point bars are topographic features that form on the <b>convex</b> <b>bank</b> of a meander. While point bars are considered to be formed by depositional processes, they display features such as chute channels and scour holes that suggest that erosion, due to high flow events, may significantly influence point bar evolution. Through the use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), we observed how a point bar on the White Clay Creek near Newark, Delaware, responded to a flood event with a return period of 6. 1 years, and to multiple small events over a 1 year period with return periods between 1. 00 and 1. 25 years. Scans of the point bar were completed on April 11, 2014, May 8, 2014, and April 16, 2015. Scans were referenced to a common coordinate system, scan data representing vegetation points were removed, and three 0. 1 m x 0. 1 m gridded Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were created from the remaining data. DEMs of Difference (DoDs) were calculated by subtracting the cell values in subsequent DEMs and by thresholding out positional and surface roughness errors. The 6. 1 year flood that occurred between the April 11, 2014 scan and the May 8, 2014 scan resulted in 88. 53 m 3 of erosion and 39. 12 m 3 of deposition. The net volumetric change was - 49. 40 m 3 over an area of 631. 72 m 2. The smaller events that occurred between the May 8, 2014 scan and the April 16, 2015 scan resulted in 13. 33 m 3 of erosion and 53. 46 m 3 of deposition. The net volumetric change was x i 40. 13 m 3 over an area of 620. 74 m 2. Our results suggest that 1) sediment deposited on point bars is eroded frequently by flood events; and 2) TLS can provide useful estimates of erosion and deposition. Although our results are for a short period, longer datasets {{can be used to}} calculate sediment residence times for point bar deposits. Additionally, we can {{gain a better understanding of}} how point bar deposits are preserved in the geologic record. This information is useful for creating accurate sediment budgets, remediating contamination issues, and interpreting geologic history. University of Delaware, Department of GeologyM. S...|$|E
