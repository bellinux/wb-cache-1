Re-cently, there has been growing interest in identifying pattern-based designs for the domain of system security termed Security Patterns. Currently, those patterns lack comprehensive struc-ture that conveys essential information inherent to security engineering. This paper describes research into investigating an appropriate template for Security Patterns that is tailored {{to meet the needs}} of secure system development. In order to maximize comprehensibility, we make use of well-known notations such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to represent structural and behavioral aspects of design. Furthermore, we investigate how verification can be enabled by adding formal constraints to the patterns. ∗ Please <b>contact</b> <b>B.</b> Cheng for all correspondences. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{demonstrate}} that {{information can be}} transmitted and processed with pure spin currents in silicon. Fe/ Al 2 O 3 tunnel barrier contacts are used to produce significant electron spin polarization in the silicon, generating a spin current which flows outside of the charge current path. The spin orientation of this pure spin current is controlled {{in one of three}} ways: (a) by switching the magnetization of the Fe <b>contact,</b> (<b>b)</b> by changing the polarity of the bias on the Fe/Al 2 O 3 “injector” contact, which enables the generation of either majority or minority spin populations in the Si, providing a way to electrically manipulate the injected spin orientation without changing the magnetization of the contact itself, and (c) by inducing spin precession through application of a small perpendicular magnetic field. Spin polarization by electrical extraction is as effective as that achieved by the more common electrical spin injection. The output characteristics of a planar silicon three terminal device are very similar to those of nonvolatile giant magnetoresistance metal spin-valve structures.

Simulations using a frictionless <b>contact</b> <b>b</b> etween the billet and die wall showed that the model underestimates the response at high entry angles.

30|$|Finally, {{we aim to}} examine, for {{the first}} time, coupled asymmetries and non-reciprocities along the {{nomination}} and behavioral layers. In traditional networks built from subjective reports of cognitive salience, a common phenomenon is asymmetry. This refers to the situation where <b>contact</b> <b>B</b> is cognitively salient for person A, but not the reverse : A is not mentioned by B as a cognitive salient contact. Work in social network analysis shows that this situation is fairly common in human social networks, even for ties defined by friendship and intimacy [19]. Here we examine if asymmetries in nominations are connected to non-reciprocities in the two-way flow of communication in the behavioral layer. Recent work also shows that non-reciprocity {{is more common in}} human social interactions that would be expected from traditional social and anthropological theory pointing to the “norm” of reciprocity [20]. We hypothesize that these two phenomena are empirically linked: nodes connected by asymmetric nomination edges should be connected by behavioral edges characterized by non-reciprocity. We also connect the phenomenon of cognitive asymmetry with that of behavioral tie decay [21], and hypothesize that asymmetric cognitive ties should exhibit steeper rates of decay in the behavioral communication layer.|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis, a {{bacterial}} disease caused {{by members of}} the genus Brucella, is an important zoonosis and a significant cause of reproductive losses in animals. Brucellosis is usually caused by Brucella abortus in cattle, B. melitensis or B. ovis in small ruminants, B. suis in pigs and B. canis in dogs. Abortions, placentitis, epididymitis and orchitis are the most common consequences, although other syndromes are also reported. The main impact is economic; deaths are rare except in the fetus and neonate. Some Brucella species are also maintained in wildlife populations. Wildlife reservoirs including feral pigs, bison, elk and European hares complicate eradication efforts for B. abortus and B. suis. Marine mammal isolates of Brucella have recently been recognized in many species of pinnipeds and cetaceans, and there are concerns that these organisms might have a detrimental impact on some species. Most species of Brucella can infect animals other than their preferred hosts, when they come in close <b>contact.</b> <b>B.</b> abortus, B. melitensis, B. suis, B. canis and marine mammal Brucella species are human pathogens.

40|$|Abstract. Thermoelectric (TE) {{devices are}} an {{interested}} family of energy harvesters which could convert the thermal energy into electricity. However, the temperature drops at interface between thermoelectric materials and heat source, heat sink and electrodes reduce efficiency of thermoelectric devices. As a solution, thermal interface materials (TIM) which have high thermal conductance and low thermal interface resistance with adjacent materials {{are added to}} the device. In this paper, the organic material is considered as the base material for a TE energy harvester device. Also, carbon nanotube (CNT) is applied as TIM, because of its high one dimentional electrical and thermal conductance. A finite element analysis is carried out in order to investigate the role of thermal contact resistance on heat transfer at TE device. To do this, a thermoelectric leg is simulated with two structure consist of (a) TE material and electrodes in direct <b>contact</b> (<b>b)</b> TE material and electrodes with CNT interface and the results are compared. It is shown that CNT layer reduces heat dissipation at the interface and so the temperature difference at the both sides of polymer is increased, which finally results the enhancement of device output voltage...|$|E

Influence on normal strain (and thus stress) distribution at critical cross-section is investigated. Laboratory testing of single-angle or double-angle members – to – gusset plates bolted connections were taken as basis for numerical analysis. FE models were created using 1 D and 2 D elements. Angles and gusset plates were modelled with shell elements. Two methods of modelling of friction grip bolting were considered: bolt-regarding approach with 1 D element systems modelling bolts and two variants of bolt-disregarding approach with special constraints over some part of member and gusset plate surfaces in contact: a) constraints over whole area of <b>contact,</b> <b>b)</b> constraints over the area around each bolt shank (“partially tied”). Modelling of friction grip bolted connections using simplified bolt modelling may be effective, {{especially in the case}} of analysis concerning elastic range only.

It is less time-consuming and provides results of similar accuracy in comparison to analysis utilizing simplified bolt modelling...|$|E

Phenomenally, the movement of A appears to cause the movement of B: either mechanically, in launching, or psychologically, in triggering. Perceived kinetics of these events have been explored in four experiments. We measured P 50, the point of subjective equality between experimental stimulus and standard stimulus, of the perceived velocity of B. We found that P 50 in control condition, obtained on adding a pause before the motion of B (P 50 = - 0. 005 deg s- 1), is different from P 50 of experimental conditions: in launching (i) the P 50 is 0. 56 deg s- 1; in triggering (ii) the P 50 is 0. 42 deg s- 1. Moreover, in launching para- digm, P 50 is also affected by kinetic variations of the objects {{before and after the}} collision, related to the impression of `force' of the impact. In the decreased-force condition (iii) a small effect is found: P 50 is 0. 34 deg s- 1; in the increased-force condition (iv) the P 50 is 0. 96 deg s- 1.

In the supernatants of crowded rabbit lymphoid cell cultures prepared in serum free medium, the factor {{was found to}} be associated entirely with the alpha-macroglobulin (alpha M) fraction (alpha 1 + alpha 2). This alpha M was most probably actively secreted by the lymphocytes because: (i) sequential supernatants obtained in serum free medium of crowded cultures contained equal amounts of alpha M as well as equal PBA activity; (ii) the alpha M became labelled when the cells were grown in medium containing a radioactive amino acid. Macrophages were not required for the production of PBA. PBA was not produced when either crowded B or T cells were cultured alone but only when they were cultured together. Purified T cells were not triggered by any plant lectin to produce PBA. By use of anti-alpha 2 M allotype antibodies and B and T cells from different rabbits, the PBA was shown to have the allotype of the T-cell donor. The PBA was associated with rabbit alpha 2 M but not alpha 1 M. We concluded that upon close <b>contact,</b> <b>B</b> cells stimulate T cells to produce a PBA associated with alpha 2 M...|$|E

40|$|B cells {{signaling}} {{in response}} to antigen is proportional to antigen affinity, {{a process known as}} affinity discrimination. Recent research suggests that B cells can acquire antigen in membrane-bound form on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), with signaling being initiated within a few seconds of B cell/APC contact. During the earliest stages of B cell/APC <b>contact,</b> <b>B</b> cell receptors (BCRs) on protrusions of the B cell surface bind to antigen on the APC surface and form micro-clusters of 10 - 100 BCR/Antigen complexes. In this study, we use computational modeling to show that B cell affinity discrimination at the level of BCR-antigen micro-clusters requires a threshold antigen binding time, {{in a manner similar to}} kinetic proofreading. We find that if BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding antigen, there is a loss in serial engagement due to the increase in bond lifetime as koff decreases. This results in decreasing signaling strength as affinity increases. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR before the latter becomes signaling-capable favors high affinity BCR-antigen bonds, as these long-lived bonds can better fulfill the threshold time requirement than low-affinity bonds. A threshold antigen binding time of ~ 10 seconds results in monotonically increasing signaling with affinity, replicating the affinity discrimination pattern observed in B cell activation experiments. This time matches well (within order of magnitude) with the experimentally observed time (~ 20 seconds) required for the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and lipid raft-mediated conformational changes that lead to association with Syk.
