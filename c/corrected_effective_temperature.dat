40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of 14 tests for the presence of convective overshooting in large convecting stellar cores for stars with masses of 4 - 17 solar masses which are members of detached close binary systems and of open clusters in the Galaxy. A large body of theoretical and observational data is scrutinized and subjected to averaging in order to minimize accidental and systematic errors. A conservative upper limit of d/HP less than 0. 4 is found from at least four tests, as well as a tighter upper limit of d/HP less than 0. 2 from one good test that is subject to only mild restrictions and is based on the maximum observed <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> of evolved blue supergiants. It is concluded that any current uncertainty about the distance scale for these stars is unimportant in conducting the present tests for convective core overshooting.

We use it to (re) derive the NIR spectral types, luminosities and physical parameters of the targets, and to test (BT-SETTL, DRIFT-PHOENIX) atmospheric models. We derive infrared spectral types L 0 +- 1, L 0 +- 1, M 9. 5 +- 0. 5, M 9. 5 +- 0. 5, M 9. 25 +- 0. 25, M 8 + 0. 5 - 0. 75, and M 8. 5 +- 0. 5 for AB Pic b, Cha J 110913 - 773444, USco CTIO 108 B, GSC 08047 - 00232 B, DH Tau B, CT Cha b, and HR 7329 B, respectively. BT-SETTL and DRIFT-PHOENIX models yield close Teff and log g estimates for each sources. The models seem to evidence a 600 - 300 + 600 K drop of the <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> at the M-L transition. Assuming the former temperatures are correct, we derive new mass estimates which confirm that DH Tau B, USco CTIO 108 B, AB Pic b, KPNO Tau 4, OTS 44, and Cha 1109 lay inside or at the boundary of the planetary mass range. We combine the empirical luminosities of the M 9. 5 -L 0 sources to the Teff to derive semi-empirical radii estimates that do not match "hot-start" evolutionary models predictions at 1 - 3 Myr. We use complementary data to demonstrate that atmospheric models are able to reproduce the combined optical and infrared spectral energy distribution, together with the near-infrared spectra of these sources simultaneously. But the models still fail to represent the dominant features in the optical. This issue casts doubts {{on the ability of}} these models to predict <b>correct</b> <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> from near-infrared spectra alone.

Considering the reformulation of the tunnelling mechanism by Banerjee and Majhi, the Hawking radiation spectrum is evaluated through the density matrix for the outgoing modes. The GUP <b>corrected</b> <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> and the corresponding GUP corrected effective metric in non-commutative geometry are determined using Hawking's periodicity arguments. Thus, we obtain further corrections to the non-strictly thermal black hole (BH) radiation spectrum which give new final distributions. Then, we show that the GUP and the non-commutative geometry modify the Bohr-like BH recently discussed in a series of papers in the literature. In particular, we find the intriguing result that the famous law of Bekenstein on the area quantization is affected neither by non-commutative geometry nor by the GUP. This is a clear indication of the universality of Bekenstein's result. In addition, we find that both the Bekentsein-Hawking entropy and the total BH entropy to third order approximation are still functions of the BH quantum level. Comment: 16 page...|$|E

The idea of <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> coming from the {{extensions}} of that theorem has been recently introduced to study glasses and {{has proved to be a}} key concept for out-of-equilibrium systems. Gene networks involve stochastic chemical kinetics and are far from equilibrium. This leads us to try to use the notion of <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> to study them. To develop this idea, we study a simple birth-death process and a general two-species interacting process using the language of <b>effective</b> <b>temperature.</b> Furthermore, a model of a nonregulatory gene is studied as an example. The <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> may serves as an alternative and somewhat more fundamental language to describe the intrinsic-extrinsic noise distinction that has already provided a tool for qualifying gene networks...|$|R

The system is coupled to two heat baths which are kept at different temperatures: one (’fast’) bath {{associated with an}} uncorrelated Gaussian noise and a second (’slow’) bath with an exponential memory kernel. Various definitions of <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> proposed in the literature are evaluated and compared. The range of validity of these definitions is discussed. It is shown in particular, that the <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> defined from the fluctuation-dissipation relation mirrors {{the temperature of the}} slow bath in parameter regions corresponding to a separation of time scales. On the contrary, quasi-static and thermodynamic definitions of an <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> are found to display the temperature of the fast bath in most parameter regions. 1...|$|R
