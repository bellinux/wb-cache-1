5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum and {{actinium}} {{are sometimes}} considered the remaining members of group 3. In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms, these elements {{do not possess}} any partially filled f-orbitals, thus continuing the scandium—yttrium—lanthanum—actinium trend, {{in which all the}} elements have relationship similar to that of elements of the calcium—strontium—barium—radium series, the elements' left neighbors in s-block. However, different behavior is observed in other d-block groups, especially in group 4, in which zirconium, hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking a <b>clear</b> <b>trend.</b> It has however been argued that this is irrelevant because the principle of increasing basicity down the table is more fundamental, and because the behavior of the group 3 elements is more similar to their s-block neighbors than their d-block neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E

25|$|The euro {{introduction}} in 2002, {{with its}} various exchange rates, distorted existing nominal price patterns {{while at the}} same time retaining real prices. A European wide study (el Sehity, Hoelzl and Kirchler, 2005) investigated consumer price digits before and after the euro introduction for price adjustments. The research showed a <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> towards psychological pricing after the transition. Further, Benford's Law as a benchmark for the investigation of price digits was successfully introduced into the context of pricing. The importance of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices was demonstrated and with it a <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of the euro introduction.|$|E

Hanja are still used to some extent, particularly in newspapers, weddings, place names and calligraphy (although it {{is nowhere near}} the extent of kanji use in day-to-day Japanese society). Hanja is also extensively used in situations where ambiguity must be avoided, such as academic papers, high-level corporate reports, government documents, and newspapers; {{this is due to}} the large number of homonyms that have resulted from extensive borrowing of Chinese words.|$|E

25|$|Orthalicus reses reses {{no longer}} {{occupies}} the Key West Botanical Forest and Garden. In contrast, many populations exist on Key Largo, well beyond Orthalicus reses reses historic range, {{as a result}} of relocations by shell collectors. The majority of relocations had occurred by the late 1990s. These were largely carried out by private hobbyists, who sought to thwart extinction. However, these actions were poorly documented, and were subsequently poorly monitored. One <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> is that Key Largo has accumulated more populations than the Lower Keys.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{from human}} remains shows that average {{age at death}} {{increased}} over the Archaic period, {{but there is no}} <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> for other measures of health. The size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45-50 m², but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality. From the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average.|$|E
25|$|Benford's {{law as a}} {{benchmark}} for the investigation of price digits has been successfully introduced into the context of pricing research. The importance of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices was first demonstrated in a Europe-wide study which investigated consumer price digits {{before and after the}} euro introduction for price adjustments. The euro introduction in 2002, with its various exchange rates, distorted existing nominal price patterns {{while at the same time}} retaining real prices. While the first digits of nominal prices distributed according to Benford's Law, the study showed a clear deviation from this benchmark for the second and third digits in nominal market prices with a <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of the euro introduction.|$|E

25|$|While Arctic {{temperatures}} {{have generally}} increased, {{there is some}} discussion concerning the temperatures over Greenland. First of all, Arctic temperatures are highly variable, {{making it difficult to}} discern <b>clear</b> <b>trends</b> at a local level.

Yet no significant differences are found (p =  0.227, df =  9) and there are no other <b>clear</b> <b>trends</b> (see Table  4). It should be noted that this analysis is calculated on the starting age of the interventions. The older age groups might therefore be included in these programs as well.|$|R

2500|$|A related claim, {{especially}} in the UK, is that the cannabidiol/THC ratio has decreased {{over the past few}} decades, resulting in a new and presumably more dangerous form of cannabis that never existed before (since CBD is thought to attenuate some of the negative side effects of THC). [...] While there is little to no reliable data before 2005 on such ratios in the UK, making comparisons to the past impossible, the US data going back to the 1970s shows little to no <b>clear</b> <b>trend,</b> and there have always been strains with extremely low ratios.

[...] In 1628, when Marie de' Medici commissioned from Rubens a Triumphal Entry of Henri IV into Paris, {{it was for a}} suite of grand decorations for her own palace, [...] the Luxembourg; Rubens did not recreate historic details of the 1594 Royal Entry, but overleapt them to render the allegory itself (illustration).|$|E

2500|$|Hesiod {{employed}} the conventional dialect of epic verse, which was Ionian. Comparisons with Homer, a native Ionian, can be unflattering. Hesiod's {{handling of the}} dactylic hexameter [...] was not as masterful or fluent as Homer's and one modern scholar refers to his [...] "hobnailed hexameters". His use of language and meter in Works and Days and Theogony distinguishes him also from {{the author of the}} Shield of Heracles. All three poets, for example, employed digamma inconsistently, sometimes allowing it to affect syllable length and meter, sometimes not. The ratio of observance/neglect of digamma varies between them. The extent of variation depends on how the evidence is collected and interpreted but there is a <b>clear</b> <b>trend,</b> revealed for example in the following set of statistics.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{listeners}} associate Klemperer {{with slow}} tempos, but recorded evidence now available on compact disc {{shows that in}} earlier years his tempi could be quite a bit faster; the late recordings give a misleading impression. For example, one of Klemperer's most noted performances was of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, Eroica. Eric Grunin's Eroica Project contains tempo data on 363 recordings of the work from 1924–2007, and includes 10 by Klemperer [...] some recorded in the studio, most from broadcasts of live concerts. The earliest Klemperer performance on tape was recorded in concert in Cologne in 1954 (when he was 69 years old); the last was in London with the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1970 (when he was 85). The passing years show a <b>clear</b> <b>trend</b> with respect to tempo: as Klemperer aged, he took slower tempi. In 1954, his first movement lasts 15:18 from beginning to end; in 1970 it lasts 18:41. In 1954 the main tempo of the first movement was about 135 beats per minute, in 1970 it had slowed to about 110 beats per minute. In 1954, the Eroica second movement, [...] "Funeral March", had a timing of 14:35; in 1970, it had slowed to 18:51. Similar slowings {{took place in the}} other movements. Around 1954, Herbert von Karajan flew especially to hear Klemperer conduct a performance of the Eroica, and later he said to him: [...] "I have come only to thank you, and say that I hope I shall live to conduct the Funeral March as well as you have done".|$|E

40|$|Improved {{understanding}} of carbon (C) accumulation after a boreal fire enables more accurate quantification of the C implications caused by potential fire regime shifts. We coupled {{results from a}} fire history study with biomass and soil sampling in a remote and little-studied region that represents a vast area of boreal taiga. We used an inventory approach based on predefined plot locations, thus avoiding problems potentially causing bias related to the standard chronosequence approach. The disadvantage of our inventory approach is that more plots are needed to expose trends. Because of this we could not expose <b>clear</b> <b>trends,</b> despite laborious sampling. We found some support for increasing C and nitrogen (N) stored in living trees and dead wood with increasing time since the previous fire or time since the previous stand-replacing fire. Surprisingly, we did not gain support for the well-established paradigm on successional patterns, beginning with angiosperms and leading, if fires are absent, to dominance of Picea. Despite the lack of <b>clear</b> <b>trends</b> in our data, we encourage fire historians and ecosystem scientists to join forces and use even larger data sets to study C accumulation since fire in the complex Eurasian boreal landscapes...|$|R

3000|$|Intuitively, {{one can use}} multi-variant {{time series}} {{forecasting}} to predict the popularity of a topic. Nevertheless, the evolution of topics in text has a low resolution yet high sensitivity property, which means that a topic’s popularity does not change much in days or months (i.e., low resolution), but {{for a number of}} consecutive years they may change dramatically and fade quickly (i.e., high sensitivity). As a result, the rising and falling of the topics do not have a long term spanning, which is typically required for traditional time-series forecasting. For example, our experiments in Table  1 show that, out of 54 topics discovered from the data, some emerging topics, such as “social network”, have a <b>clear</b> increasing <b>trend,</b> whereas traditional topics, such as [...] "decision trees" [...] or [...] "information retrieval", remain stable and do not have <b>clear</b> <b>trends.</b>|$|R
