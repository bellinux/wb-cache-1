5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than its share of votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E
5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E
25|$|A team <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> match by {{a certain}} number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with {{a certain number of}} batsmen still not dismissed. A team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed, so, for example, if the side scored the {{required}} number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets.|$|E

25|$|Win by {{technical}} fall: If a fall is not {{secured to}} end the match, a wrestler <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> match simply by points. If a wrestler can secure an advantage of 15 points over an opponent, then the wrestler can win the match by technical fall. A technical fall is very likely when one wrestler has great control over the other wrestler {{and is able to}} score near fall points repeatedly. If the 15-point advantage is gained while the offensive wrestler has his opponent in a pinning situation, the match would continue to allow the offensive wrestler to secure the fall. If the offensive wrestler is unable to secure a fall, the match ends once a near fall situation is no longer seen by the referee or when the wrestlers return to the neutral position.|$|E

500|$|Manning and the Colts {{introduced}} their now-signature no-huddle offense, {{and used}} it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks) the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a win over Buffalo, behind Manning's 421yards passing. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. However, the Colts lost the following week to New England, and continued their slide, losing their following two games. The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40–21 home loss to the 49ers. After Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in that game, coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous [...] "Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs. Are you kidding me. Playoffs? I'm just hoping we <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> game, another game" [...] press conference. Despite the 6–10 record, Manning finished the season with , , and 4 rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league. However, the defense allowed the most points and Jim Mora was fired after the season.|$|E
5000|$|Tony Benn {{attacked}} Labour Listens {{because he}} {{saw it as a}} means by which the Labour leadership would abandon traditional Labour values and argued instead that Britain needed policies based on conviction espoused by a radical and tolerant socialist party.

Arthur Scargill was also a critic of the publicity campaign surrounding Labour Listens, saying [...] "We do not need Saatchi and Saatchi and red roses.

500|$|Anderson {{opened his}} sophomore season against the Indiana Hoosiers, scoring 2 points and going 0-of-6 on three-pointers as his team fell, 71–84. However, he led his team with 20 points two games later, in a 14-point win over Chaminade. Anderson said, [...] "I feel like if I'm not scoring I can't get anybody else {{into the game}} either. But today I was hitting shots, so I could do other things, like {{penetrate}} and kick out to guys." [...] He finished {{the game with a}} career-high 9 assists as well. On December 14, 2002, against the Florida International Panthers, Anderson surpassed the 20-point mark for the second time. He was praised by Lappas, [...] "When Anthony plays well, we <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> game ugly. When he doesn't, we can't win at all." [...] Anderson topped his previous scoring record on January 2, 2003, when he posted 25 points vs. NC State and helped his team capture the victory. He also recorded a career-high 9 rebounds. This performance led to Anderson being named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week. The point guard matched his season-best on February 23, 2003, when he scored 25 points against Duquesne and shot 10-of-13 from the field. After completing his sophomore season, Anderson was averaging 11.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.3 steals, and 2.6 three-pointers. He was his team's leader in minutes and three-pointers and ranked second in points. Anderson recorded more than 100 assists for the second straight season, becoming the first to do so since 1999. He also made the eighth-most single-season threes in school history.|$|E

On appeal, the original results of both drivers were reinstated. The next five races saw four retirements for Coulthard, plus a fourth-place finish in San Marino.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the tapping mechanism, players in a group are expected to share the loot reward granted by a defeated enemy. [...] The first player in a group to loot a corpse generally is awarded its entire contents, and unless specific rules are set up in-game, {{no one else in}} the group gets any of the loot reward. [...] When rules are set up, players can [...] "roll" [...] for a random number between 1 and 100 for each item; highest roll wins the item. [...] Players can decide the level of value at which items are shared vs. the ones that are automatically given to the first player to loot the corpse. [...] Even when all loot is designated to be shared via random chance, only one player <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> given loot reward. [...] If players are not in a group, the first player (or group) to tap an enemy will be awarded the loot reward, and anyone who assists will not receive any reward.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{critics argue}} that a team <b>can</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> weak conference and be awarded an {{automatic}} berth over at-large teams that {{are perceived to be}} more deserving. [...] Most of this criticism has centered on the Big East after losing Miami, Virginia Tech, and Boston College to the ACC. [...] In 2004, No. 21 Pittsburgh won the Big East with a record of 8–3 and was awarded an automatic bid because they won their conference at the expense of several runner-up teams with much better rankings, such as No. 5 California, No. 7 Georgia, and No. 8 Virginia Tech, that were left out. In 2008, undefeated No. 9 Boise State and No. 11 TCU were left out of the BCS while No. 19 Virginia Tech, winner of the ACC was given a BCS bowl berth. [...] In 2010, Connecticut won the Big East with a record of 8–4 and was awarded an automatic bid to the Fiesta Bowl despite not being ranked in the top 25 of the BCS standings. [...] As a result, the Mountain West Conference campaigned to receive an automatic bid while there have been calls for the Big East to lose its AQ status. Another way to fix this problem would be to mandate that if a conference champion finishes with a low ranking (say below 12) that they forfeit their automatic bid, and get put into the pool of [...] "at large" [...] teams that the BCS can choose from. Thus, a higher ranked non-BCS team (or an extra team from other BCS conferences) could be selected by a bowl game. [...] Another solution to this problem that is being heavily considered when the current BCS agreement ends is {{to get rid of the}} AQ status and allow the bowl committees to select the participants they want provided that the school has a sufficiently high BCS ranking so that no BCS bowl will be forced to take a low-ranking AQ conference champion. [...] This will also allow a third team from the same conference to participate in a BCS bowl, something that is prohibited by the current rules.|$|E
