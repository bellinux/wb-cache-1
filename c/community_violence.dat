25|$|The {{first record}} of <b>community</b> <b>violence</b> against blacks in Omaha {{occurred}} in 1891, when an African American man called Joe Coe was lynched by a vigilante mob for allegedly raping a white girl. Another lynching occurred in 1919 when a white mob stormed the Douglas County Courthouse to take Willy Brown, an African American accused of raping a young white woman. While these incidents terrified {{the population of}} African Americans {{in the community and}} effectively segregated them {{from the rest of the}} city, the civil rights movement in Omaha did not gain large-scale momentum until the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Traumatic grief or {{complicated}} mourning are conditions {{where both}} trauma and grief coincide. There are conceptual links between trauma and bereavement since {{loss of a}} loved one is inherently traumatic. If a traumatic event was life-threatening, but did not result in death, then {{it is more likely that}} the survivor will experience post-traumatic stress symptoms. If a person dies, and the survivor was close to the person who died, then it is more likely that symptoms of grief will also develop. When the death is {{of a loved one}}, and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. This is likely in children exposed to <b>community</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
25|$|The General Assembly's vote caused {{joy in the}} Jewish {{community}} and discontent among the Arab <b>community.</b> <b>Violence</b> broke out between the sides, escalating into civil war. From January 1948, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention {{of a number of}} Arab Liberation Army regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria. Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni came from Egypt with several hundred men of the Army of the Holy War. Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, he organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem. The Yishuv tried to supply the city using convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but largely failed. By March, almost all Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.|$|E

40|$|The {{high level}} of crime in South Africa affects many adolescents. Experience of <b>community</b> {{interpersonal}} <b>violence</b> affects the social, emotional and cognitive functioning of adolescents and could {{have an impact on}} their personality development. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore possible differences in the expression of personality between adolescents exposed to <b>community</b> interpersonal <b>violence</b> and those not exposed to such violence. The sample comprised 183 grade 12 learners from a secondary school in a middle class community in Gauteng. Participants were divided into two groups: adolescents who reported exposure to <b>community</b> interpersonal <b>violence</b> (n = 93) and those who did not report exposure to such violence (n = 90). Both groups completed the 16 Personality Factor and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scales. Differences between the groups were explored using a one-way between groups multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and t-tests for independent groups. Results indicated statistically significant differences between the two groups on Factor G (rule consciousness), Factor I (emotional sensitivity) and Factor Q 4 (anxiety). Adolescents exposed to interpersonal violence reported higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than the control group. The group that experienced PTSD symptoms differed more in terms of personality functioning (Factor I and Q 4). Violence-exposed adolescents experienced more emotional volatility, difficulty to regulate emotions, anxiety and sensitivity to environmental stressors than those not exposed to such violence. Although causality cannot be assumed, it is possible that exposure to <b>community</b> interpersonal <b>violence,</b> which could result in PTSD symptoms, has implications for the personality development of adolescents. Interventions for adolescents exposed to interpersonal violence are recommended to prevent the development of PTSD symptoms. [URL]...|$|R
