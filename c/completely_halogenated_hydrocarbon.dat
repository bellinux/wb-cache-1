40|$|The indoor {{environment}} has frequently been ignored {{as a significant}} source of exposure to air pollutants. To date {{there are a number of}} documented examples of levels of indoor air pollutants greatly exceeding those levels which commonly occur in the outdoor environment. Among these instances are airborne buildup of polynuclear aromatics and cadmium from cigarette smoke, lead from burning candles, and vinyl chloride from use of aerosols containing this substance as a propellant.

The present paper endeavors to review those instances where <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the indoor air environment may build up to concentrations of potential public health concern.

40|$|The aim in {{this study}} was to find the {{precursor}} for low <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> contaminated in the tap water from the point of reaction chemistry. When a 100 ppb solution containing any of these organic compounds (ethanol, acetoaldehyde, acetone, dimedone, 5 -methylfurfural, acetophenone, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catecoal, pyrogallol, frorogurcinol and humic acid) was allowed to react with the 10 ppm chlorine water at 25 ℃ and pH= 7. 0, trichloromethane was undoubtedly formed from the acctone, dimedone, 5 -methylfurfural, resorcinol and humic aeid. When acetone or acetophenone was reactant, it seemed that the typc of the trichloromethane reaction at pH= 7 reprcsented seccesivefirst order kinetics. Next, three reaction experiments detcrmining whether CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br could be formed or not were conducted by using the test waters which was made from raw water removing humic acid by the pretreatmcnts. In the casc of the test water that was eluated through anion exchange resin (IRA- 402), CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br were not detected. But, in the other test waters, CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br were formed, the amounts of CHCl₃ and CHCl₂Br which were produced in both the test waters, One filtered with No. 6 filter paper and the other filtered with the same paper after precipitation treatment at pH= 1, were less than those of raw water, The normal concentration of acetone, 5 -methylfurfural, and acetophenone in raw water was extremely less than 100 ppb used in this experiment. So, it would not seem that these compounds are the precursor for low <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> in tap water.
