40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{adequacy}} of three widely used models-Lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma-for describing the distribution <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> This is a fundamental step in the development of outliers resistant (robust) methods for the statistical analysis of this kind of data, where the main objective is to determine measures of average and total resource consumption of groups of patients. Current practice uses several types of trimming rules, many of which are based on the Lognormal model, although theoretical and experimental bases are still insufficient. METHODS. The three models were adjusted using robust procedures based on M-estimators to approximately 5 million stays grouped by Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). The resulting 3, 279 samples were collected in five European countries during 3 years. RESULTS. Most Of the distributions observed could be fitted with one of these models. The descriptions provided by the Gamma and the Weibull models were similar, and the Gamma model could be omitted. The casemix description provided by the Lognormal-Weibull family was, for certain countries, significantly better than the one provided by the single Lognormal model. Often, for a given DRG and a given <b>country,</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> distributions could be described with the same model during several years. A given DRG, however, usually had to be described by means of different models for different countries. CONCLUSIONS. Practical and conceptual consequences of the results are discussed.

Statistical procedures for casemix description, including current rules of trimming, should be improved by means of more flexible families of models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It can {{be assumed}} that resettlers (ethnic German {{immigrants}} from the Former Soviet Union) show similar smoking patterns as persons in their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin {{at the time of}} migration. We analysed how the smoking prevalence among resettlers differs from that among the general population of Germany and whether the prevalence differs between groups with increasing duration <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Methods To estimate the smoking prevalence we used the scientific-use-file (n = 477, 239) of the German 2005 microcensus, an annual census representing 1 % of all German households. Participation in the microcensus is obligatory (unit-nonresponse resettlers and the comparison group (population of Germany without resettlers) by age, sex, educational level and duration <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> In total, 14, 373 (3 % of the total) persons were identified as resettlers. Results Female resettlers with short duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> had a significantly lower smoking prevalence than women in the comparison group. With increasing duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> their smoking prevalence appears to converge to that of the comparison group (e. g. : high educational level, age group 25 - 44 years: short duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> 15 %, long duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> 24 %, comparison group 28 %). In contrast, the smoking prevalence among male resettlers with short duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was significantly higher than that among men in the comparison group, but also with a trend towards converging (e. g. : high educational level, age group 25 - 44 years: short duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> 44 %, long duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> 35 %, comparison group 36 %). Except for female resettlers with short duration <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> the participants with low educational level had on average a higher smoking prevalence than those with a high educational level. Conclusions This is the first study estimating the smoking prevalence among resettlers by duration <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The results support the hypothesis that resettlers brought different smoking habits from their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin shortly after migration. The observed convergence of the smoking habits with increasing duration <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> is in line with the hypothesis of migration as 'health transition'. However, due to the cross-sectional design of the study, {{further research is needed to}} confirm these findings. </p...|$|R

Methods: Travellers on holiday charter flights from Cardiff-Wales Airport provided information on holiday preparation before departure and were surveyed 2 weeks after return for details of holiday lifestyle and travel illness. Results: Travellers' diarrhoea was reported by 25. 7 % of 1469 travellers; 24. 4 % had sunburn and 7. 6 % had respiratory infection. Attack rates for travellers' diarrhoea were highest in people aged 15 – 34 years (34. 1 %). Rates were higher the shorter the interval between holiday booking and departure (χ 2 for linear trend 13. 5, 1 df, P < 0. 001) and lower in travellers who sought advice from their general practitioner before departure (adjusted odds ratio 0. 6, 95 % confidence interval 0. 4 – 0. 9).

Accordingly, Jim Crockett, Jr. began buying out some of the other NWA member {{promotions}} or, in some cases, allowed them to quietly die and just absorbed their rosters. Because of his acquisition spree, and because he failed to consistently match the WWF's ambitious marketing, TV production values, and merchandising, Crockett was facing bankruptcy by 1988. TBS owner Ted Turner bought JCP and renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after the popular GCW TV show on TBS. With the backing of Turner’s money, it grew into a national promotion. With time, WCW became the main NWA territory with the JCP versions of the Tag-Team, United States, and Television Champions being recognized on a national scale. Up until this point only the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and NWA Junior Heavyweight Championship had had national recognition. WCW was still a member of the NWA, but with time felt that the NWA needed it more than it needed the backing of the NWA, especially since both WCW and the WWF toured the entire <b>country</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> within a confined territory.

This paper investigates factors that explain differences in resource use for appendectomy. We analysed 106 929 appendectomy patients treated in 939 hospitals in 10 European countries. In stage 1, we tested the performance of three models in explaining variation in the (log of) cost <b>of</b> the inpatient <b>stay</b> (seven <b>countries)</b> or length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> (three <b>countries).</b> The first model used only the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) to which patients were coded, the second model used a core set of general patient-level and appendectomy-specific variables, and the third model combined both sets of variables. In stage two, we investigated hospital-level variation. In classifying appendectomy patients, most DRG systems take account of complex diagnoses and comorbidities but use different numbers of DRGs (range: 2 to 8). The capacity of DRGs and patient-level variables to explain patient-level cost variation ranges from 34 % in Spain to over 60 % in England and France. All DRG systems can make better use of administrative data such as the patient's age, diagnoses and procedures, and all countries have outlying hospitals that could improve their management of resources for appendectomy...|$|R

Globally as well as locally, foreigners have been blamed for the spread of diseases such as HIV. As a result, they have suffered challenges in accessing public healthcare, particularly antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV. Studies have shown that despite these challenges - foreigners experienced better ART outcomes than nationals. There is a need to explore the ways in which cross border migrants use to access and to stay on treatment, given the wide-range of challenges that they face during their stay in Johannesburg. Semi-structured interviews with five nurses and ten cross-border migrants currently receiving ART, along with non-participant observations, were used to collect data from two public clinics in inner-city Johannesburg. Analysis suggests that the family network in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin remains critical, as cross border migrants are not disclosing their status in the city in which they live, but do so to their families in their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin.

40|$|Excerpt] As {{business}} {{continues to}} grow in China, employers there struggle to find locals who possess the needed knowledge, skills, and abilities to meet the talent demands of the market. Many multinational corporations fill requisitions with candidates from outside of their local region or even from outside China. Since expatriate assignments are extremely costly, employers actively seek cost-effective expatriate compensation options. The local-plus-pay approach in China is popular but remains a work-in-progress. In addition to lower-cost compensation and benefit plans, employers are searching for increased return on expatriate investment. In fact, 10 to 20 percent of all U. S. managers sent abroad returned early because of job dissatisfaction or difficulties in adjusting to a foreign <b>country.</b> <b>Of</b> those who <b>stayed</b> for the duration, nearly one-third performed below satisfaction. Most alarming, one-fourth of repatriated employees joined a competitor within one year of returning to their home country.

Little is known about length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> following childbirth in low- and middle-income countries or its determinants. We described length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after facility delivery in 92 countries. We then created a conceptual framework of the main drivers <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> and explored factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in 30 <b>countries</b> using multivariable linear regression. Finally, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine the factors associated with stays that were "too short" (< 24 h for vaginal deliveries and < 72 h for cesarean-section deliveries). Across countries, the mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> ranged from 1. 3 to 6. 6 d: 0. 5 to 6. 2 d for singleton vaginal deliveries and 2. 5 to 9. 3 d for cesarean-section deliveries. The percentage <b>of</b> women <b>staying</b> too short ranged from 0. 2 % to 83 % for vaginal deliveries and from 1 % to 75 % for cesarean-section deliveries. Our conceptual framework identified three broad categories of factors that influenced length of stay: need-related determinants that required an indicated extension <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> and health-system and woman/family dimensions that were drivers of inappropriately short or long stays. The factors identified as independently important in our regression analyses included cesarean-section delivery, birthweight, multiple birth, and infant survival status. Older women and women whose infants were delivered by doctors had extended lengths <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> as did poorer women. Reliance on factors captured in secondary data that were self-reported by women up to 5 y after a live birth was the main limitation. Length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after childbirth is very variable between <b>countries.</b> Substantial proportions <b>of</b> women <b>stay</b> too short to receive adequate postnatal care.

For the four studies of the thesis, routinely collected data was used. In study I the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register was used to describe the trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> women surgically treated for breast cancer and to investigate the effect of the increasing use of breast-conserving surgery on the decreasing trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> In study II the effect of stage of disease on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was investigated using the Southern Swedish Tumour Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. To study the possible adverse effect on prolonged sick leave of decreasing length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> data from the National Cancer Register, the Sick Leave Register and the National Hospital Discharge Register were combined (study III). In study IV the effect of social factors on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was investigated using the Swedish Social Medicine Database. In terms of determinant <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> the present results support the hypothesis that individual factors such as age, severity of cancer according to tumour size and social factors influence length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Differences in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> according to clinical practice style, such as different types of surgery, were found. There was a difference of about 30 per cent in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> between breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy. The results indicate a small effect of change in type of surgery on the mean-length-of-stay trend.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare costs data by diagnosis related group (DRG) between Belgium and Switzerland. Our hypotheses were that differences between countries can probably be explained by methodological differences in cost calculations, by differences in medical practices and by differences in cost structures within the two <b>countries.</b> Methods: Classifications <b>of</b> DRG used in the two countries differ (AP-DRGs version 1. 7 in Switzerland and APR-DRGs version 15. 0 in Belgium). The first step {{of this study was to}} transform Belgian summaries into Swiss AP-DRGs. Belgian and Swiss data were calculated with a clinical costing methodology (full costing). Belgian and Swiss costs were converted into US PPP (purchasing power parity) in order to neutralize differences in purchasing power between countries. Results: The results of this study showed higher costs in Switzerland despite standardization of cost data according to PPP. The difference is not explained by the case-mix index because this was similar for inliers between the two <b>countries.</b> The length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> (LOS) was also quite similar for inliers between the two countries. The case-mix index was, however, higher for high outliers in Belgium, as reflected in a higher LOS for these patients. Higher costs in Switzerland are thus probably explained mainly by the higher number of agency staff by service in this <b>country</b> or because <b>of</b> differences in medical practices. Conclusions: It is possible to make international comparisons but only if there is standardization of the case-mix between countries and only if comparable accountancy methodologies are used. Harmonization of DRGs groups, nomenclature and accountancy is thus required. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
