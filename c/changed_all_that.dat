5|$|Sejanus's {{position}} {{was not quite}} that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request. While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius, the presence of Livia seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD29 <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{withdrawal}} of Tiberius from Rome's political scene, the presence of Livia seems to have checked Sejanus' overt power for a time. According to Tacitus, her death in AD 29 <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> Sejanus {{began a series of}} purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Among those who perished were Gaius Asinius Gallus, a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina's faction. Agrippina and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus were arrested and exiled in AD 30, and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances. Only Caligula, the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus, by moving to Capri with Tiberius in AD 31.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E

25|$|Surrey Lions {{recorded}} {{their second}} win from two matches in Twenty20 Cup cricket this season, ironic given their {{position at the}} very bottom of the 45-over National League. Ali Brown made 64 and David Thornely 67 not out as Middlesex Crusaders conceded too many runs at the fine batting track at Lord's, Surrey making 200 for 3. Owais Shah notched up his second score in the 70s in two days, taking 78 from 44 balls, and things looked good despite Shah leaving at 148 for 2. But Tim Murtagh <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> In four overs, he took six for 24, {{and with the help of}} David Thornely (three for 22) he ensured that Middlesex had seven batsmen out in single figures. They were bowled out for 177, with three balls remaining in the innings.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the early}} 1910s, {{there was no}} system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions, most likely because they weren't {{considered}} a serious threat as ships had managed to survive even direct crashes. In 1907, SS Kronprinz Wilhelm, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but {{was still able to}} complete her voyage. The April 1912 sinking of the Titanic however <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs. For the remainder of the ice season of that year, the United States Navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow. In November 1913, the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea met in London to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs. Within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the International Ice Patrol (IIP). The goal of the IIP was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents, ice-flow, ocean temperature, and salinity levels. They published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement.|$|E
500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler's {{relationship}} and their wedding in the episode [...] "The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding" [...] with saving Friends. Prior to the episode, the show had [...] "appeared {{to be in}} serious danger of out-staying its welcome." [...] Although admitting that the overall episode [...] "is not one of Friends best", Bianco explained that [...] "The wedding <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> and in remarkable fashion." [...] While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest Friends couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be." [...] Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica's best boyfriend, awarding him an 'A' grade. Gerstenberger penned, [...] "I {{would not be able to}} face myself every day if I did not rank Chandler the best of Monica’s boyfriends from Friends. The two ended up getting married, which just goes to show that some one night stands are meant to last." [...] Monica and Ross' relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters [...] "provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find a best friend in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship."

DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

Although this {{was intended as}} a one-shot tale, the three future teens returned as guest stars in late 1959, and over the next three years, the Legion appeared periodically in Superboy, Supergirl (who also joined the Legion), and even Superman stories.

2500|$|The Basil D'Oliveira affair <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> D'Oliveira was a mixed-race South African (partly black - [...] "coloured" [...] {{under the}} Apartheid classification).

He scored 158, and was expected {{to make it to}} the team to tour South Africa in winter. When initially he was not selected, there was great controversy in England, with the English Test selectors being accused of pandering to the racist regime in South Africa. Then, when a vacancy became available through another player dropping out, D'Oliveira was selected in his place. But South African Prime Minister John Vorster opposed his selection, saying that it was not a team of the Marylebone Cricket Club, but of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. England did not tour.|$|E

2500|$|H.L. Mencken {{considered}} Halsted {{the greatest}} physician {{of the whole}} Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken’s praise of his achievements when he reviewed Dr. MacCallum's 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. “His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, {{he was the first}} to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted <b>changed</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. Dr. William Mayo, one of the cofounders of the Mayo Clinic, once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision. Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of Ambroise Paré: ‘God cured him; I assisted.’ Above all, he was a superb teacher, though he never formally taught. The young men who went out from his operating room were magnificently trained, and are among the great ornaments of American surgery today.” ...|$|E
