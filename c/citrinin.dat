Some species produce toxic secondary metabolites, collectively termed mycotoxins including aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, <b>citrinin,</b> and patulin. These toxic properties {{may be used for}} the benefit of humans when the toxicity is directed against other organisms; for example, penicillin adversely affects the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Clostridium species), certain spirochetes and certain fungi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{safety of}} red yeast rice {{products}} {{has not been}} established, and some commercial supplements {{have been found to}} contain high levels of the toxin <b>citrinin.</b> As commercial products will have highly variable amounts of monacolins, and rarely declare this content on the label, defining risk is difficult. Ingredient suppliers have also been suspected of [...] "spiking" [...] red yeast rice preparations with purified lovastatin. As evidence, one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin K - which would occur if the drug lovastatin was added - rather than the expected composition of many monacolin compounds. Statin drugs are known to cause muscle and liver damage. [...] Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney damage and possibly kidney failure (renal failure). This is why they are prescription drugs rather than over-the-counter, and with recommendations that the patients' physicians schedule liver function tests on a regular basis. There are many case reports in the literature of muscle myopathy and liver damage resulting from red yeast rice usage. In 2009 Becker et al. reported on a U.S. trial that enrolled 62 patients with known statin-associated myalgias. Half got a RYR product (3600mg/day, 13mg monacolins, 6mg monacolin k) for 24 weeks; and half were administered a placebo. In the treated group, LDL-cholesterol declined 21%. Two patients dropped out because of myalgia, 1 for diarrhea, and 1 for dizziness. In the placebo group, one dropped out for myalgia. Creatine phosphokinase increased slightly in the treated group (from 122 to 128 IU/L) versus decreasing with placebo (117 to 101 IU/L), but the shifts were not statistically significant. For those having completed the trial, subjective muscle pain scores were similar for the two groups. [...] "The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR {{is similar to that of}} statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions." ...|$|E
50|$|As stated above, <b>citrinin</b> {{decomposes}} {{at temperatures}} higher than 175 °C, providing {{that it is}} under dry conditions. When water is present, the decomposition temperature is around 100 °C. Several decomposition products of <b>citrinin</b> are known, including phenol A, <b>citrinin</b> H1, <b>citrinin</b> H2 and dicitrinin A. The structures of the decomposition products {{are shown in figure}} 1, depicted on the left. <b>Citrinin</b> H1 is produced out of two <b>citrinin</b> molecules and its toxicity is increased compared to the original toxicity of <b>citrinin.</b> <b>Citrinin</b> H2, a formylated derivative of phenol A, is less toxic than <b>citrinin.</b> Phenol A seems to be produced mainly under acidic conditions. Dicitrinin A is a dimer of <b>citrinin</b> molecules which is mainly formed during decomposition in a neutral environment, when a high concentration of <b>citrinin</b> is present.|$|E
50|$|Another way to {{be exposed}} to <b>citrinin</b> is through {{inhalation}} and skin contact. However, the extent of possible health hazards caused by inhaled <b>citrinin</b> or through dermal exposure of <b>citrinin</b> is largely unclear. Researchers found that <b>citrinin</b> is also used in indoor materials. When analyzing 79 bulk samples they found that <b>citrinin</b> was present in three of them, with a concentration range between 20 and 35000 ng/g. Also other mycotoxins were present in several samples.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that the kidney is the main target organ of <b>citrinin.</b> It shows change in {{histopathology}} and mild morbidity of the rat's kidney. <b>Citrinin</b> causes a disruption of the renal function in rats, which shows that there is an accumulation of the <b>citrinin</b> in kidney tissue. It is also shown that <b>citrinin</b> is transported into renal proximal tubular cells. An organic anion transporter is required for this transportation process. Recent studies show that the mitochondria respiratory system is another target of <b>citrinin.</b> <b>Citrinin</b> can interfere with the electron transport system, Ca2+ fluxes and membrane permeability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citrinin</b> is a polyketide mycotoxin, {{which is}} a {{secondary}} metabolite of some fungi species. Its IUPAC name is (3R,4S)-4,6-dihydro-8-hydroxy-3,4,5-trimethyl-6-oxo-3H-2-benzopyran-7-carboxylic acid and the molecular formula is C13H14O5. <b>Citrinin</b> has a molecular weight of 250.25 g/mol. It forms disordered yellow crystals which melt at 175 °C. <b>Citrinin</b> is a planar molecule which contains conjugated bonds. As {{a result of these}} conjugated bonds <b>citrinin</b> is autofluorescent. <b>Citrinin</b> crystals can hardly be dissolved in cold water, however in polar organic solvents and aqueous sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium acetate dissolving is possible.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people have}} a high {{consumption}} of grain products and as <b>citrinin</b> is found in grain products, {{this can lead to}} high consumption of <b>citrinin.</b> There is a concern about the concentration of <b>citrinin</b> that causes nephrotoxicity. Based on the report of the European Food Safety Authority, the critical <b>citrinin</b> concentration from children (up to 3-9 years old) is 53 μg/kg of grains and grain-based products while 19 to 100 μg/kg is for adults. Unfortunately, there is no firm conclusion for the exact <b>citrinin</b> concentration that can cause nephrotoxicity for long periods of consumption.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citrinin</b> {{was one of}} {{the many}} mycotoxins which were {{discovered}} by H. Raistrick and A.C. Hetherington in the 1930s. In 1941 H. Raistrick and G. Smith identified <b>citrinin</b> to have a broad antibacterial activity. After this discovery the interest in <b>citrinin</b> rose. However, in 1946 A.M. Ambrose and F. DeEds demonstrated that <b>citrinin</b> was toxic in mammalians. Because of the toxicity, the interest in <b>citrinin</b> decreased, but there still was a lot of research. In 1948 the chemical structure was solved by W.B. Whalley and coworkers. <b>Citrinin</b> is a natural compound and it was first isolated from Penicillium citrinum, but it is also produced by other Penicillium species, the Monascus species and the Aspergillus species, which are all fungi. During the 1950s W.B. Whalley and A.J. Birch and others identified <b>citrinin</b> as a polyketide and investigated its biosynthesis using radioisotopes. During the 1980s and 1990s J. Staunton, U. Sankawa and others also investigated its biosynthesis using stable isotopes and NMR. During the mid-2000s the gene cluster for <b>citrinin</b> was discovered by T. Nihira and coworkers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citrinin</b> is biosynthesized by fungi {{species of}} Penicillium, Monascus and Aspergillus. For the {{production}} of <b>citrinin,</b> a minimal set of genes is needed. These genes are conserved in most species which produce <b>citrinin.</b> They are citS, mrl1, mrl2, mrl4, mrl6, and mrl7. CitS produces a <b>citrinin</b> synthase (CitS). The product of the mrl1 gene is a serine hydrolase (CitA), but its function is not known yet. Mrl2 encodes a non heme Fe(II) dependent oxygenase (CitB) which is involved in ring expansion. A NAD(P)+ dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (CitD) is encoded by mrl4 and another dehydrogenase (CitE) is encoded by mrl6. The mrl7 gene encodes for a NAD(P)+ dependent oxidoreductase (CitC).|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} {{information on}} occurrence of <b>citrinin</b> in food suggests that relatively high <b>citrinin</b> concentrations {{can be found}} in stored grains and grain-based products. Because of this and the fact that people in general have a high consumption of cereal-based foods, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (the CONTAM Panel) considered that grains might be the major contributor of dietary exposure to <b>citrinin.</b> The CONTAM Panel concluded that not enough data were available in the literature to carry out a dietary exposure assessment.|$|E
50|$|In {{mammalian}} {{cells in}} vitro, <b>citrinin</b> did not induce DNA single-strand breaks, oxidative DNA damage or sister chromatids exchanges but induced micronuclei, aneuploidy and chromosomal aberrations. In vivo it induced chromosome abnormalities and hypodiploidy {{in the bone}} marrow of mice. This indicates that <b>citrinin</b> is mutagenic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citrinin</b> is a {{mycotoxin}} {{which is}} often found in food.

50|$|<b>Citrinin</b> is a toxin {{that was}} first {{isolated}} from Penicillium citrinum, {{but has been}} identified in over a dozen species of Penicillium and several species of Aspergillus. Some of these species are used to produce human foodstuffs such as cheese (Penicillium camemberti), sake, miso, and soy sauce (Aspergillus oryzae). <b>Citrinin</b> is associated with yellowed rice disease in Japan and acts as a nephrotoxin in all animal species tested. Although it is associated with many human foods (wheat, rice, corn, barley, oats, rye, and food colored with Monascus pigment) its full significance for human health is unknown. <b>Citrinin</b> can also act synergistically with Ochratoxin A to depress RNA synthesis in murine kidneys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citrinin</b> often occurs {{together}} with other mycotoxins like ochratoxin A or aflatoxin B1, because they are produced by the same fungi species. The combination which is observed most often is <b>citrinin</b> with ochratoxin A and {{this is also the}} most studied combination. The effects of co-occurrence of these mycotoxins are either additive or synergistic. The nephrotoxic effects of ochratoxin A and <b>citrinin,</b> for example, are increased synergistic when exposure to both takes place. Next to that, the co-exposure of these compounds is expected {{to be involved in the}} pathogenese of a human kidney disease, called Balkan Endemic Nephropathy. The interaction of both substances might also influence apoptosis and necrosis in hepatocytes.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} of <b>citrinin</b> {{biosynthesis}} in fungi is the binding of <b>citrinin</b> synthase to the starting compound, a thiol ester. After that the serine hydrolase, encoded by mrl1, forms a ketoaldehyde at which CitB can work. CitB oxidizes the C-atom of a methyl group bound to the aromatic ring and produces an alcohol. The oxidoreductase encoded by mrl7 converts this alcohol into a bisaldehyde. Then CitD converts it into a carboxylic acid, via a thiohemiacetal intermediate which rises {{as a result of}} the transfer of hydride from NADPH. The last step is the reduction of a carbon atom by CitE, after which <b>citrinin</b> is released. During this pathway also several side product are released.|$|E

(2015) {{investigated}} the levels of <b>citrinin</b> (CTN) and its human metabolite dihydrocitrinione (HO-CTN) in urine samples of 50 healthy adults (27 females and 23 males). <b>Citrinin</b> and its major metabolite could positively be detected in respectively 82% and 84% of all urine samples. The levels measured for CTN ranged from 0.02 (limit of detection, LOD) to 0.08 ng/mL and for HO-CTN from 0.05 (LOD) to 0.51 ng/mL. The average urine level was 0.03 ng/mL for CTN and 0.06 ng/mL for HO-CTN.
