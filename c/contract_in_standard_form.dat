40|$|A fuzzy {{reasoning}} model is constructed and {{its application to}} contract decision making in Hong Kong is illustrated. According to professional experience, six inputs are identified as essential factors determining contract choice. They are {{the scale of the}} project, the nature of the works to be carried out, the characteristics of the client, the time constraint, the source of materials for construction and the characteristics of the building design. These factors determine whether the contract to be chosen should be {{in the form of a}} simple quotation, a lump sum contract on drawings and specifications, a schedule of rates, a management contract, a lump sum <b>contract</b> <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> without quantities or one with quantities. Ten decision rules are constructed based on expert opinions. Two practical cases are investigated and presented to illustrate how the method works...|$|E

2500|$|The {{court found}} that a {{requirement}} of good faith may well be implied <b>in</b> all commercial <b>contracts,</b> particularly <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> <b>contracts.</b> However, it also considered that the <b>contract</b> <b>in</b> this case did not fall {{into any of the}} traditional categories of contracts where such terms are often implied. The court held that in these circumstances, it is necessary to consider whether the requirement of good faith is both reasonable and necessary in determining whether it should be implied into the <b>contract.</b> <b>In</b> this case, the court said that the term was reasonable and necessary, since otherwise Burger King would be able to deny approval for new stores [...] "capriciously, or with the sole intent of engineering a default of the Development Agreement".|$|R
40|$|This is the {{underlying}} idea of {{of the research}} on the coorperation agreement in management between Sofyan Hotel and Saka Hotel with the problems as follows: how about the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in the cooperaton agreement in management between Sofyan Hotel and Saka Hotel, and how about the settlemment of the legal dispute in the cooperation agreement in management between Sofyan Hotel and Saka Hotel. The research applied the descriptive method with judicial empirical approach. This results showed that in the implementation of the cooperation agreement in the management of Sofyan Hotel and Saka Hotel Medan between Sofyan Hotel and Saka Hotel was made <b>in</b> underhanded <b>contract</b> and <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> <b>form.</b> <b>In</b> this case, one of the parties was weak and not in the position to bargaining. As to cooperation agreement, Sofyan Hotel is more profitable it is the one that makes the contract which is for its own sake. Meanwhile, when one of the parties defaults, a negotiation will be made for a good solution. However, in case a negotiation is not effective, a legal remedy is made by bringing the dispute to the central Basyarnas (National Sharia Arbitration Agency) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{contracts}} are entered into {{on a daily}} basis. <b>In</b> general, a <b>contract</b> is a multipage document laid down in professional language. To examine this document a person has {{to have at least}} basic legal skills and/or practical experience of reading/execution of the agreements. When a consumer commits himself to an agreement, the risk of misunderstanding of contractual content appears. As a consequence, this may lead to imbalance between legal rights and obligations of the contractual parties. A drafting party may present the <b>contract</b> <b>in</b> a <b>standard</b> <b>form,</b> force a weaker party to sign the boilerplate or impose unfair terms causing harm and putting a consumer into disadvantageous position. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to make an analysis of the mainstream legal instruments in the area of consumers’ protection against unfair terms <b>in</b> business-to-consumer <b>contracts,</b> to show the reaction of legislators and researchers on application of abusive clauses, to support the study with an assessment of relevant case law. Furthermore, the thesis aims to recognize the consequences of unfair terms imposition. The research is mainly focused on the analysis of the Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC on unfair terms <b>in</b> consumer <b>contracts</b> and other European legal instruments which have been recently proposed. Comparative analysis of unfair <b>contract</b> terms regulation <b>in</b> various legal systems also takes place in the paper. The value of this study consists in a deep analysis of different legal and scholarly sources concerning the issue of consumers’ protection <b>in</b> <b>contracts</b> with a dominant business party, and identification of main conclusions on the problems set forth as objectives of the research...|$|R
40|$|The {{prohibition}} on unfair <b>contract</b> terms <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> consumer <b>contracts</b> {{has the potential}} to significantly impact on the terms of contracts for the sale of land. The definition of ‘consumer contract’ includes contracts for the sale or grant of an interest in land to an individual wholly or predominantly for personal or domestic use. Therefore, a contract for the purchase of a residence for personal occupation by the buyer, as opposed to a purchase for investment purposes, will be a consumer contract potentially attracting the application of the unfair terms provisions. Significant consumer protection mechanisms already exist in most state jurisdictions requiring disclosure of relevant matters to the buyer and providing remedies for the provision of misleading conduct. Minimal evidence of unfair terms <b>in</b> land <b>contract</b> was presented to the Productivity Commission Inquiry into the Australian Consumer Policy Framework raising the question as to whether there is an identified problem of unfair terms <b>in</b> real estate <b>contracts</b> and if so, whether the same economic and ethical rationales justify regulatory intervention. This article examines what effect if any the introduction of the unfair contract provisions will have on the enforcement of residential land contracts and the viability of previously accepted conditions if challenged as being “unfair terms”. The article concludes that despite the existence of several potentially unfair terms <b>in</b> some land <b>contracts,</b> the intervention of the rules of equity to overcome perceived hardship or unfairness to buyers from strict enforcement of terms means the unfair terms provisions are only likely to operate on terms untouched by those principles. In the authors’ view the scope for operation of the unfair terms provisions will be limited to terms untouched by the principles of equity and consumer protection legislation making it unlikely that there will be any significant realignment of the contractual obligations and rights of buyers and sellers of land...|$|R
