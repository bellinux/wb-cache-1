40|$|Explosive driven rapid {{fracture}} in a structural {{body will be}} preceded by a compression process, and the compression effects on mechanical properties of the materials are clearly important to understand shock-induced failure such as spall or fragmentation phenomena. In this study, incident shock waves in plate specimens of aluminum A 2017 -T 4 and 304 stainless steel are generated by plane detonation waves in the high explosive PETN initiated using wire-row explosion techniques, and the compressed specimens are successfully recovered without severe damages due to the reflected expansion waves with use of momentum trap method. A hydro code, Autodyn- 2 D is applied to determine test conditions: thicknesses of explosives, attenuators, specimens and momentum traps and to evaluate experimental results, simulating time-histories of stress waves in the layers of the test assembly. Microhardness distributions in cross-sections, tensile strength, fracture ductility and yield stress are measured for the recovered specimens, using miniature tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> machined from them. They are {{compared with those of}} virgin specimens, showing significant increase of hardness, tensile and yield strength and remarkable reduction of elongation and ductility for shocked specimens. The results are taken into consideration for evaluation of experimental fragmentation energy in cylinder explosion tests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} three- and four-point bending <b>tests</b> and diametral <b>compression</b> (DC) <b>tests,</b> {{used to measure the}} mechanical strength of green pressed compacts. The study has been conducted on pressed ceramic <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> formed at different pressing conditions. It was found that Weibull statistics largely explained the differences in the results of the three-point and four-point bending tests. However, Weibull statistics could not explain the much lower mechanical strength obtained with the diametral <b>compression</b> <b>tests.</b> The study establishes a correlation between the bending and DC tests; however, this correlation depends on moisture content, which {{is directly related to the}} plasticity of the piece. This finding confirms that the types of mechanical tests studied do not have the same sensitivity to the factors that lead to fracture. The differences in mechanical strength between the bending and DC tests were explained using a suitable fracture criterion (based on maximum strain) and plastic deformation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Tissue-engineered {{scaffolds}} should mimic, {{as closely}} as possible, {{the one of the}} tissues to be replaced. Hence, mechanical tests are of paramount importance. However, as there are various biomaterials, with distinct mechanical properties, performing a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> is complicated. The objective of this thesis was to study the reliability and limitations of static conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> device. Accuracy and reproducibility of the <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were considered. The results showed that the compressive properties are dependent on many factors (sample size, microstructure, etc.). Biomaterial’s properties, such as viscoelasticity and brittleness, complicated the <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> and hampered the reliability. Fixed uniaxial compressive platen led to uneven load distribution on sample cross-section area. Careful sample preparation, surface finish or self-aligning platen could improve the reliability. The testing device showed good reproducibility, and accuracy for compressive strength. However, compressive modulus underestimated the results by > 34 %. The strain was measured from the platen displacement that may have caused error in strain measurements. With an optical extensometer, strain could be measured precisely from the center part of the sample. In conclusion, the accuracy and reproducibility of conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> are questionable. The <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> should be performed with caution...|$|R

40|$|Many new {{automotive}} vehicle designs incorporate an Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) {{system on}} the gasoline internal combustion engine to manipulate volumetric efficiency and control engine speed. These engines have the possibility of developing various mechanical problems {{at some point in}} the vehicle’s lifespan. <b>Compression</b> <b>testing</b> is a common procedure used to diagnose certain types of engine mechanical problems. <b>Compression</b> <b>testing</b> procedures have traditionally been performed with a fully open throttle. However, ETC systems may not allow the throttle to open fully, if at all, during conventional engine <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> procedures. Technicians in the repair industry, students in vocational programs, as well as educators and trainers need to be aware of the effects of the ETC system on engine <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> procedures and make accommodations for these effects to reliably diagnose engine mechanical problems in these vehicles. A sample of twenty-two vehicles equipped with an ETC system were gathered for <b>testing.</b> <b>Compression</b> <b>testing</b> procedures were performed on these vehicles to determine the throttle opening and cylinder pressures. The procedure was performed on each vehicle in three variations: (1) a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test,</b> (2) Electronic Throttle Body (ETB) unplugged, and (3) ETB blocked open. The results of these testing procedures were analyzed to determine to what extent the throttle was opened by the ETC system during a traditional <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> In addition, the variation in cylinder pressure among the tests was analyzed to determine if a statistically significant result existed. The results of the testing showed a wide variation in throttle openings among tested vehicles as well as a weak correlation between throttle opening and cylinder pressure.
