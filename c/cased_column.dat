40|$|In {{the control}} of batch and {{continuous}} distillation columns, {{one of the most}} challenging problem is the difficulty in measuring compositions. This problem can be handled by estimating the compositions from readily available on-line temperature measurements using a state observer. The aim {{of this study is to}} design a state observer that estimates the product composition in a multicomponent batch distillation column (MBDC) from the temperature measurements and to test this observer using a batch column simulation. To iii achieve this, first a model for MBDC is prepared and compared with the data from literature where a <b>case</b> <b>column</b> is utilized. After checking the validity of the simulation package, it is used as a fictitious process for the performance evaluations. In the second phase of the study, an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed by utilizing a simplified model of MBDC and it is implemented for performance investigation on the <b>case</b> <b>column</b> with 8 trays separating the mixture of cyclo...|$|R

It has to be noted that long walls and cores can be treated as column segments. Beams can be also modeled in similar way but using special stiffness matrix.

40|$|Introduction It {{is common}} belief that dislocations in homeopolar {{crystals}} move by nucleation and spreading of pairs of kinks.

Unfortunately, High Resolution Electron Microscopy (HREM) up till recently {{was not able to}} contribute much to this project. This is because the adequate geometry of HREM of dislocations is with dislocation line parallel to the electron beam (end on orientation). In this orientation kinks cause just a certain blurring of the image of the dislocation core. In principle, kinks are expected to show up in an image of the dislocation if the beam is perpendicular to the kink and, therefore, to the glide plane of the dislocation (plane view orientation).
