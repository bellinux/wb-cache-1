40|$|Feeding {{dairy cattle}} with safe {{compound}} feed helps farmers to ensure food safety. However, several ingredients {{often used in}} compound feed production can be contaminated with aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), which may result into milk contaminated with aflatoxin M 1. Given the number of ingredients and their amounts used {{in the production of}} compound feed, it is very costly to check every batch of ingredients for AFB 1 contamination. Which is the reason, why a risk-based approach is taken in the latest years. This study aimed to estimate the probability of AFB 1 contamination of <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> dairy cattle, and to limit this contamination, by optimisation of the compound feed formulation, using a modelling approach. The modelling approach comprised integrating a linear optimisation programming model to a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model was applied to the case of producing <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> dairy cattle in the Netherlands, using national monitoring data on AFB 1 contamination in feed materials collected in the period 2000 - 2010.

40|$|BackgroundIn the {{nutrition}} literature, {{there are several}} reports {{on the use of}} artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches <b>for</b> predicting <b>feed</b> composition and nutritive value, while the use of support vector machines (SVM) method as a new alternative approach to MLR and ANN models is still not fully investigated. MethodsThe MLR, ANN, and SVM models were developed to predict metabolizable energy (ME) content of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> pigs based on the German energy evaluation system from analyzed contents of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), and starch. A total of 290 datasets from standardized digestibility studies with <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> was provided from several institutions and published papers, and ME was calculated thereon. Accuracy and precision of developed models were evaluated, given their produced prediction values. ResultsThe results revealed that the developed ANN [R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 95; root mean square error (RMSE) [*]=[*] 0. 19 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter] and SVM (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 95; RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 21 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter) models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> than those produced by conventional MLR (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 89; RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 27 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter). ConclusionThe developed ANN and SVM models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> than those produced by conventional MLR; however, there were not obvious differences between performance of ANN and SVM models. Thus, SVM model may also be considered as a promising tool for modeling the relationship between chemical composition and ME of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> pigs. To provide the readers and nutritionist with the easy and rapid tool, an Excel® calculator, namely, SVM_ME_pig, was created to predict the metabolizable energy values in <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> pigs using developed support vector machine model...|$|R

40|$|A {{qualitative}} spreadsheet {{model has}} been developed for ranking feed ingredients {{on the basis of}} the potential risk of exceeding existing guidance or maximum levels in the EU for a certain contaminant, and the potential consequence of the presence of this contaminant on the health of animals and/or humans. The approach was based on the general concept of risk, being frequency times consequences of presence of the contaminant. Contamination of compound feeds due to presence of the contaminant in feed ingredients was estimated, per animal category, by: annual volumes of feed ingredients used for feed production, stratified per country of origin; the portion of each ingredient in compound feed formulations used for various animal categories; and the potential contamination of an ingredient per country of origin. The consequences of the contamination were accounted for by two consequence factors, both estimated per animal category: one for the potential impact of the contaminant on the health of the target animal, and one for the impact on human health, related to the possible formation of residues in animal derived food products. The use of the model was demonstrated by its application to the presence of dioxins and dl-PCBs in <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> farm animals produced in the Netherlands in 2013 and 2014.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate possible application of electronic nose in PA P detection and recognition in feed. For this purpose 6 reference feedstuffs (CRA-W / UE STRAT F E E D Project) were used. The basis of the test samples was a <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> bovine fortified with processed animal proteins (PAP) consisting of meat and bone meal (MBM) and/or fish meal at different concentrations. Each feed sample was tested in glass vials and the odour profile was determined by the ten MOS (metal oxide semi-conductor) sensors of the electronic nose. Ten different descriptors, representing each ten sensors of electronic nose, were used to characterise the odour of each sample. In the present study, electronic nose was able to discriminate the blank sample from all other samples containing PA P (M B M, fish meal or both). Samples containing either 0. 5 % of MBM or 5 % of fish meal were identified, while samples containing a high fish meal content (5 %) associated with a low MBM content (0. 5 %) were not discriminated from samples containing solely fish meal at that same high level (5 %). This latter indicates that probably the high fish meal level, in samples containing both MBM and fish meal, tended to mask MBM odour. It was also evident that two odour descriptors were enough to explain 72. 12 % of total variability in odour pattern. In view of these results, it could be suggested that electronic nose and olfactometry techniques can provide an interesting approach for screening raw materials in feed industry, even though further studies using a wider set of samples are needed...|$|E

It also describes essential nutrients contained in feed and their function in organism, common types of engines used in <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> production. The goal of the diploma thesis' project is to evaluate an effect of various disintegrate of components in hammer and cylindric grinding machine. Another goal of diploma thesis' project is to approve or disapprove four hypotheses. H 01 "All components used in <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> production can be ground by observed types of grinding machines". H 02 "Economic demands of grinding is equal for all observed grinding machines". H 03 "Uniformity of ground particles {{is the same for}} all observed grinding machines". H 04 Quality of grinding does not affect nutritional value of <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> observed grinding machines and observed animals. It was chosen 5 grinding machines for the purpose of research which are commonly used in agricultural companies and feed manufacturers. Data was collected from operators of grinding machines or feed manufacturer's experts. The thesis discuss some abroad researches for comparison of results. The results discover that most effective are cylindric grinding machines, but they are inappropriate <b>for</b> some <b>feed</b> components. Good results have also hammer grinding machines with upper load. All observed grinding machines except roller produced material with low uniformity. Hypotheses H 01, H 02 and H 03 were disapproved by the research. Hypothesis H 04 was neither approved nor disapproved...|$|R

The thesis is divided into two parts. The first assesses the impact of the addition of chromium on semen qua-lity of breeding boars. The second part examines the influence of the addition of chro-mium on glucose and insulin levels in the blood of breeding boars. The experiment was conducted in Velké Meziříčí at the insemination center boars. The experiment consisted of 28 Duroc boars breed for 14 weeks. These boars were divided into 4 groups according to age balanced. In the control (n = 7) group (K), was chromium receiving 205 ug/kg/day. In the 1 st group (n = 7) animals (CR 1) was dose chromium even increased by 60. 6 ug/kg <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> the second group (n = 7) boars (Cr 2) of 121. 2 ug/kg and 3. group (n = 7) boars (Cr 3) was added chromi-um in an amount of 181. 8 ug/kg compound feed. The addition of chromium to the semen quality of breeding boars too had a signifi-cant impact. During the first months of feeding chromium occurred in the control group to a decrease in ejaculate volume of 29 ml. In the group S 3 during the experiment is bound to increase sperm concentration, but in the fourth taking under review decreased significantly compared to previous months. The difference between the third and fourth taking was 131. 5 thousand/mm 3. This difference is statistically insignificant, and could be caused by external influences or errors in nutrition. Sperm motility during certain months was below 70 %. This ejaculate should not be used for insemination. In {{the second part of the}} experiment, the addition of the chromium significantly reduced glukose levels and insulin activity. The obtained results can not recommend feeding chromium breeding boars...|$|E
40|$|Summary Pork is {{composed}} of 46 - 49 % of monounsaturated fatty acids, 40 % saturated fatty acids and 8 - 12 % of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The composition of fatty acids affects {{the strength of the}} tissues, their shelf life and quality (mainly taste). The development of fat tissues is characterized by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of fat cells. The quality of the adipose tissue associated with fatty acids. Monitored was 72 animals (36 of these pigs and 36 gilts). Pigs were divided into 2 experimental groups with 4 % addition of oil (rapeseed, soybean) and one control group, which was without the addition of oil. The animals were fed ad libitum complete feed mixtures, and for the whole period of fattening. In the control and experimental groups were used to <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> before fattening (P 1) and fattening (P 2). The pigs, which were in the experimental groups, was added to the feed mixture P 2 oil (rapeseed or soybean), and 6 weeks before slaughter. In each group was assessed in 6 animals. Sampling was conducted from the backfat samples were homogenized and subjected to chemical analysis for the determination of fatty acids and oxidative stability. From the measurement results, it was found that rapeseed oil contained a fatty acids SFA, MUFA, n- 3 PUFAs and higher ratios of S/P, M/P. Compared to the soybean oil contained more PUFA, n- 6 PUFA, n- 6 /n- 3 and M/P. In gilts was higher proportion of SFA in the fat of soybean oil and pigs to have more SFA from the oil of rapeseed. Oxidative stability of backfat increased tendences. Pigs had a higher oxidative stability of the fat in rapeseed oil compared to soybean, and gilts had higher values of oxidative stability of the fat in soybean oil. The measured values in the control group were lower in the oxidative stability of 0 compared to oils (rapeseed, soybean), but in the oxidative stability of 3 and 5 days were the highest...|$|E
40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis, processed {{form of the}} project was to evaluate the effect of the different system for creating recipes <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> poultry performance, feed efficiency and economy of production of animal products for specific breeders. The work is based on a detailed review of the literature processed, directly related to the study of topics such as fundamentals to determine the methodological approach and meet specified targets and confirm or refute hypotheses. A follow-up evaluation of inputs and their own project. It is based on a detailed analysis of three-year results from three farms in the Czech Republic, which supplies feed mixtures, according to their wishes, both conventional and addressable - tailored, enterprise PRIMAGRA, a. s. Criteria under consideration were in different years: efficiency index fattening broiler chickens, achieved weight, feed conversion, deaths, the price of feed mixture. In the final part of the study summarizes gained knowledge, which can be summed up as follows: performance of individual buildings surveyed farms had fluctuating character. Slaughter weight had a positive development in only one of these three companies, by the remaining two happened its total reduction. For enterprises A and B using conventional feed were among the batches for all investigated criteria measured different values. In contrast, in the company C utilizing feed addressable were examined by criteria, the results of individual batches more balanced. Percentage mortality in the period in agricultural enterprises decreased. Furthermore, the hypotheses examined claims made to that effect. H 1 hypothesis was confirmed. It can say that for farmers the use of direct mixture effective in the long run and brings him more stable and more profitable than the use of conventional feed mixture. H 2 hypothesis was not confirmed or denied. The reason for this ambiguous conclusion was that there are many other factors that determine whether use of the nutrient mixtures poorer farmers will or will not bring the same effect as a mixture richer in nutrients. H 3 hypothesis was not confirmed, because in a situation where they are available cheap synthetic amino acids not necessary to the formulas represented many components, as {{in the early days of}} development of the feed industry...|$|E
40|$|Considering the new norms in feed quality {{checking}} (ANSVSA Order 51 / 2005 on {{the performance}} of the analytical methods and data interpretation), which are aligned to the European norms, the market <b>for</b> <b>feeds</b> implemented a checking system similar to the one for the food industry. These requirements stipulate that the laboratories <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> control must have validated methods for each sample assay. We therefore proposed to validate two chromatographic methods (HPLC and GC) for vitamin E and linolenic acid from the polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> layers supplemented with 250 ppm vitamin E. The determined parameters were in agreement with SR EN ISO / CEI 17025 : 2005 as follows: exactness, reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, detection limit, quantification limit. We used for validation only certified reference materials and blanks, of analytical purity. We determined the incertitude for each validated method. We worked on two types of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> layers enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (I); with addition of flax seeds and with enriched linolenic acid (II). While the calculation of incertitude (10, 62 ± 0, 44 μg/g and 15, 409 ± 0, 6 μg/g for linolenic acid and 400 ± 24 μg/g for vitamin E) shows that the methods range within admissible limits. The validated methods are proper for the determination of vitamin E and linolenic acid from feeds enriched in plant fat with a significant supplement of α-tocopherol...|$|R
40|$|The study {{quantified}} {{the effects}} of Camelina seeds and buckthorn meal on broiler carcass production and quality. Camelina seeds and buckthorn meal were incorporated in the <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> finishing broilers as natural source of vitamins (beta- carotene, vitamins C, B 1, B 2, E, F, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and iron). The experiment was conducted on 600 Hybro PN broilers during the age period 7 – 42 days. The broilers were assigned to 3 groups, a control group © and two experimental groups (E 1 and E 2), each with 200 broilers (3 groups  3 replicates  100 broilers). Three (phase-feeding) <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> formulations were used. The control diet consisted mainly of corn, full fat soybean, soybean meal and corn gluten. Camelina seeds (10 %) replaced full fat soybean in the experimental groups, while additionally, in E 2 the classical premix with synthetic vitamins and minerals was replaced by buckthorn meal. The partial {{results show that the}} use of Camelina seeds reduced significantly (P< 0. 05) the final live weight, but the liveability percentage was not influenced by the type of dietary <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> throughout the experimental period. Carcass fat decreased by 61. 44 % and 30. 72 % in the experimental groups compared to the control group. Total proteins increased in average by 3 - 10 % concomitantly with the increase of the water content, fat decreased in average by 1. 5 - 4 %, the energy value also decreased proportionally with the fat in the experimental groups compared to the control group. Water retention capacity increased by 1 % in E 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to test the effects of type of binder on growth, nutritional physiology, total apparent digestibility, and some elements of the energetic balance of early O. maya juveniles. Two experiments were performed. One was aimed at evaluating the effect of type of binder on growth, nutritional physiology, and energetic balance and the other at knowing the effect of the binder on total apparent digestibility of O. maya. Binder type affected growth and survival of early O. maya juveniles. Octopuses fed alginate-bound crab meat lost weight and died, revealing that this type of binder limits nutrient absorption from the diet. In contrast, when gelatin was used as binder, energetic balance was similar to that obtained in animals fed natural crab, indicating that octopuses can digest gelatin. Apparently, gelatin promotes absorption of nutrients similar to that observed when octopuses were fed pieces of fresh crab. Salivary glands produce enzymes that are used to predigest the food. Results of the present study indicate that octopuses require higher enzyme activity to digest fresh crab than when animals are fed gelatin-bound crab paste, and that intracellular digestion in the digestive gland is similar in animals fed either type of diet. The present study reports, for the first time, differences among binders used for cephalopods' diet. Although no <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> formulations are available for cephalopods, it is a necessary step in the search <b>for</b> an adequate <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> this novel species in aquaculture.
