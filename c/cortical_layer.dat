5|$|The {{layers of}} the adrenal gland differ by function, with each layer having {{distinct}} enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each <b>cortical</b> <b>layer</b> further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E

40|$|Reelin is an {{important}} protein that is indispensable for cortical lamination. In the absence of Reelin, <b>cortical</b> <b>layers</b> fail to form due to inappropriate neuron migration and positioning. The inversion of <b>cortical</b> <b>layers</b> is attributed to failure of neurons to migrate past earlier-generated neurons although how Reelin-insufficiency causes this is unclear. The issue is complicated by recent studies showing that very little Reelin is required for <b>cortical</b> <b>layering.</b> To test how variation {{in the number of}} Reelin-producing cells is linked to cortical lamination, we have employed Reelin 1 / 14 Reelin 2 / 2 chimeras in which the number of Reelin-expressing neurons is adjusted. We found that the Reeler phenotype was rescued in chimeras with a large contribution of Reelin 1 / 1 neurons; conversely in chimeras with a weak contribution by Reelin 1 / 1 neurons, the mutant phenotype remained. However, increasing the number of Reelin 1 / 1 neurons beyond an unknown threshold resulted in partial rescue, with the formation of a correctly layered secondary cortex lying on top of an inverted mutant cortex. Therefore, the development of <b>cortical</b> <b>layers</b> in the correct order requires a minimal level of Reelin protein to be present although paradoxically, this is insufficient to prevent the simultaneous formation of inverted <b>cortical</b> <b>layers</b> in the same hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenotype}} of excitatory {{cerebral cortex}} neurons is specified at the progenitor level, orchestrated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we {{provide evidence for}} a subcortical contribution to cortical progenitor regulation by thalamic axons via ephrin A 5 -EphA 4 interactions. Ephrin A 5 is expressed by thalamic axons and represents a high-affinity ligand for EphA 4 receptors detected in cortical precursors. Recombinant ephrin A 5 -Fc protein, as well as ephrin A ligand-expressing, thalamic axons affect the output of cortical progenitor division in vitro. Ephrin A 5 -deficient mice show an altered division mode of radial glial cells (RGCs) accompanied by increased numbers of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) and an elevated neuronal production for the deep <b>cortical</b> <b>layers</b> at E 13. 5. In turn, at E 16. 5 the pool of IPCs is diminished, accompanied by reduced rates of generated neurons destined for the upper <b>cortical</b> <b>layers.</b> This correlates with extended infragranular layers {{at the expense of}} superficial <b>cortical</b> <b>layers</b> in adult ephrin A 5 -deficient and EphA 4 -deficient mice.
