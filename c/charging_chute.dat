2500|$|As {{originally}} designed, the ship's main armament {{consisted of}} five BL 4.7 inch /45 naval guns, which were augmented by a 3-inch gun for anti-aircraft defence. When Stuart entered RAN service in 1933, the ship's armament consisted of five BL 4.7 inch /45 naval guns, a QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun, two QF 2-pounder naval guns (known as pom-poms), five [...]303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), six 21-inch torpedo tubes (in two triple mountings), two depth <b>charge</b> <b>chutes,</b> and four depth charge throwers.

5000|$|They {{were smaller}} by 200 tons than the Ukuru’s and engines that {{propelled}} them were also smaller, at 2500 SHP vs 4200 for the Ukurus.

40|$|A {{flow test}} was {{performed}} in Scrap Recovery of HB-Line to document the flow available for hydrogen dilution in the dissolvers when the <b>charge</b> <b>chute</b> covers are removed. Air flow through the dissolver <b>charge</b> <b>chutes,</b> with the covers off, was measured. A conservative estimate of experimental uncertainty was subtracted from the results. After subtraction, the test showed that there is 20 cubic feet per minute (cfm) air flow through the dissolvers during dissolution with a glovebox exhaust fan operating, even with the scrubber not operating. This test also showed there is 6. 6 cfm air flow through the dissolvers, after subtraction of experimental uncertainty if the scrubber and the glovebox exhaust fans are not operating. Three H-Canyon exhaust fans provide sufficient motive force to give this 6. 6 cfm flow. Material charged to the dissolver {{will be limited to}} chemical hydrogen generation rates that will be {{greater than or equal to}} 25 percent of the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) during normal operations. The H-Canyon fans will maintain hydrogen below LFL if electrical power is lost. No modifications are needed in HB-Line Scrap Recovery to ensure hydrogen is maintained less that LFL if the scrubber and glovebox exhaust fans are not operating...|$|R
