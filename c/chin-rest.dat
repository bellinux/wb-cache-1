5000|$|Melkus is {{not much}} remembered today (2008) because his style {{included}} many anachronistic elements: the use of modern wire and wire-covered strings rather than gut, ubiquitous modern a1=440 pitch, a <b>chin-rest</b> (not even invented until the 1820s), and continuous, rather distracting, vibrato. In these ways, he departed from those better-known colleagues in Vienna with whom he began, the Harnoncourts. Oddly, he never adapted to methods that have been shown by scholars as more appropriate historically, even more recently. His older recordings are generally dismissed and have not been reissued on CD. It is a pity because, despite his less [...] "authentic" [...] sound, the recordings of the 1965-1971 period reveal in his playing what is lacking in most players today: an instantly recognizable personal sound and style, and most significantly, an enthusiasm for embellishing music in ways that more contemporary period players seldom attempt, but their 18th-century forebears did without question; in that sense, he is more [...] "historical" [...] than they—and to some listeners, more exciting.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{calibration}} of eye-tracking systems based on eye-features detection is proposed. Many eye-tracking systems are {{claimed to be}} robust to head movements in some degree, but such robustness is rarely fully quantified. Moving <b>chin-rest</b> and synthetic images have been proposed to investigate head movements. However, both methods have several limitations. The reported calibration method exploits {{for the first time}} ocular imaging eye models (OIEMs) in order to simulate the eye(s), thus allowing to easily investigate the effects due to head movements. Moreover, it can be useful for the development and comparison of eye-tracking hardware, software and whole systems. Differently from human subjects, OIEMs are standardized and time-invariant thus, comparisons can be performed at different times and places, leading OIEMs to be a potential gold standard test for eye-tracking systems. Preliminary verification performed on a basic eye tracking system corroborate the applicability of described method...|$|E
40|$|Natural gaze {{behavior}} is often studied under conditions that restrain head movements. Here, we report how {{the availability of}} head movement can influence gaze behavior on wall-sized images of natural outdoor scenes (field-of- view: ~ 90 °). Participants performed half of the experiment with complete head mobility and the remaining trials with their heads restrained in a <b>chin-rest.</b> They were required to either rate the images for attractiveness (i. e., free-viewing) or to count the visible animals (i. e., visual search). On average, more fixations {{were found on the}} trials that allowed for head movements (unrestrained: 4. 21 fixations/sec; restrained: 3. 75 fixations/sec), which were also shorter in their mean duration (unrestrained: 221 ms; restrained: 252 ms). In addition, unrestrained gaze contained a larger proportion of small amplitude saccades (i. e., less than 5 °), than head-restrained gaze. Finally, our participants demonstrated a general preference in fixating regions that were close to the central eye-in-h ead orientation. Altogether, these findings suggest that the availability of head movements allowed our participants to re-orient to regions of interest and sample these regions more frequently. This sampling benefit applied to both visual search and free viewing tasks. The current findings emphasize the importance of allowing head mobility when studying natural gaze behavior...|$|E
50|$|Early violins and viols were {{typically}} held against the left chest, below the shoulder. By the 18th century, the typical position {{was a little}} higher, {{on top of the}} shoulder, with the chin occasionally making contact with the violin. <b>Chin-rests</b> and shoulder-rests are not used - the chin rest which is universally used on a modern violin was not invented until the early 19th century, though Abbe Fils used some kind of device for a similar purpose. Shoulder rests were absent, being a 20th-century invention.|$|R
40|$|A {{large portion}} of current and {{previous}} research on locomotor and vehicle navigation tends to assume that people choose a goal or destination in the visual world and then generally look where they are going. There exists, however, considerable anecdotal evidence and observational data suggesting that humans also will tend to go where they are looking. Considering {{the amount of time}} a pedestrian or driver spends looking away from his precise heading point, this tendency has received relatively little experimental attention. The goal of the present research is to determine how gaze eccentricity affects drivers' abilities to steer a straight course. A high-performance virtual reality theater was used to simulate the motion of a car through a textured environment with the participant controlling direction of travel via a forced-feedback steering wheel. Participants (n= 12) were asked to fixate a Landolt-C figure in one of 7 positions (0, +/- 15, 30, or 45 degrees from center) and drive down the center of a perfectly straight road. The Landolt-C was located just above the horizon in a fixed position on the viewing screen. Throughout each trial, the orientation of the figure varied randomly between 4 possible positions (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) and, in order to ensure fixation, subjects were required to respond to particular orientations. Lateral position of the driver was recorded for each of the different gaze eccentricities. Significant deviations from straight ahead were found for side of presentation when compared to fixation at 0 degrees (p< 0. 01). That is, when participants fixated to the left, for example, they systematically steered in the same direction. These results are compared to another study in which subjects' performance was measured while their head movements were restricted using a head-strap and <b>chin-rest.</b> The similar pattern of results in both conditions will be discussed in terms of the influence of retinal flow on the control of locomotion...|$|E
