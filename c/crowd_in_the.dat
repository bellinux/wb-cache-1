The King, Queen, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen), and Princess Margaret {{appeared}} on the balcony, with the palace's blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mall. The damaged Palace was carefully restored after the War by John Mowlem & Co. It was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Although {{geographical}} {{names have been}} formally changed in Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country. At times, Turkish politicians have also used the native names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when addressing a <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used the native name Norşin. Also that year, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.|$|E
5|$|An 87th-minute penalty {{scored by}} Yemi Odubade saw York lose 1–0 away to Oxford United. Dyer signed for the club, having been unattached {{after his release}} by Chesterfield {{at the end of}} 2007–08. Adam Boyes signed a {{long-term}} professional contract ahead of York's Conference League Cup third round tie against Mansfield, which was won with a 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory. This was preceded by Greaves' headed goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time, earning the team a 1–1 draw, which was followed by a goalless period of extra time. The attendance of 609 was the lowest <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club history—breaking the previous record of 763 set in the 2007–08 Conference League Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Kop {{is a large}} single-tiered stand.

The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, {{with the people who}} occupy the stand referred to as kopites.

5|$|The events {{started on}} 30 August 1942 after the Japanese recaptured four POWs {{escaped from the}} Selarang Barracks camps, and {{required}} that the other prisoners sign a pledge not to escape. After they refused, {{they were forced to}} <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas around the barracks square for nearly five days with little water and no sanitation. The executions of the recaptured POWs failed to break the men. The commanders, however, finally capitulated on 5 September when their men started to fall ill and die from dysentery. Upon signing the pledge, the men were allowed to return to the barracks buildings.|$|E
5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful {{speech to the}} <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces.

Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, {{but was unable to}} restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park {{for the first}} time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> festival's history (107,000). Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N' Roses and Helloween. The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; {{the following}} year's festival was cancelled as a result. The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England. Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards. Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's Brave New World.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of government expenditure on private domestic investment in Indonesia. Based on the previous studies, there is no clear justification whether government expenditure is <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> or <b>crowding</b> out <b>the</b> private investment. Using quarterly time series data during period 1985 to 2012, the empirical results show that government expenditure (total) is crowding out private domestic investment in both short term and long term. Specifically, government expenditure for public service is crowding out <b>the</b> private investment <b>in</b> both short term and long term. Unlike public services, the economic expenditure is <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private investment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long term. Moreover, health expenditure is crowding out <b>the</b> private investment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short term while education expenditure is <b>crowding</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short term and <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long term...|$|R
5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|In the Sixth Round {{they faced}} Third Division South club Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road, as 8,000 Vale fans {{made up a}} 31,000 <b>crowd.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{days leading up to}} the game thieves had stolen 1,200 matchday tickets and police were {{vigilant}} to catch out anyone who tried to enter the stadium with these stolen tickets. The only goal of the game came from Leake – who struck the ball into the net after controlling the ball from a Hayward knock-down from an Askey corner – put Vale into the semi-finals, with the team 'delightedly mobbed' by supporters after the finish. Ray King made a name for himself in the dying moments of the game after making a save from a George Poulton shot.|$|E
5|$|Several lesser known {{moments in}} the rivalry {{occurred}} during the 1930s. Pitcher Red Ruffing was traded in 1930 from the Red Sox to the Yankees. Ruffing, who had limited success with the Red Sox, {{would go on to}} a Hall of Fame career with the Yankees winning 6 World Series with them. On August 12, 1934, then the largest <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Fenway Park, 46,766, witnessed Babe Ruth's final game at Fenway Park in a Yankees uniform in a game Boston would lose. A year later, the crowd record would be broken again when the two teams met again on September 22, 1935. Record crowds would also show up at Yankee Stadium. On May 30, 1938, before 83,533 spectators, Yankees outfielder Jake Powell and Red Sox player-manager Joe Cronin fought on the field and beneath the stands. Both players were fined and suspended for 10 games. The Yankees and Red Sox would finish first and second in the League respectively that year as well as the following. The Yankees went on to sweep the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series a year later.|$|E

5|$|William Penn {{stayed in}} Wells shortly {{before leaving for}} America (1682), {{spending}} a night at The Crown Inn. Here he was briefly arrested for addressing a large <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market place, but released on {{the intervention of the}} Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting only one day, over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the <b>crowd.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E
