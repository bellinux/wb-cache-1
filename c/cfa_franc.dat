There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon has had {{a decade}} of strong {{economic}} performance, with GDP growing {{at an average of}} 4% per year. During the 2004–2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3billion. Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States (of which it is the dominant economy), the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Its currency is the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> (in French: franc CFA , or colloquially franc) is {{the name}} of two {{currencies}} used in parts of West and Central African countries which are guaranteed by the French treasury.

25|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{countries}} and territories using the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> has changed as some countries began introducing their own separate currencies. A couple of nations in West Africa have also chosen to adopt the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> since its introduction, {{despite the fact that}} they were never French colonies.|$|E
25|$|CFA francs {{are used}} in {{fourteen}} countries: twelve formerly French-ruled nations in West and Central Africa, Guinea-Bissau (a former Portuguese colony), and Equatorial Guinea (a former Spanish colony). These fourteen countries have a combined population of 147.5million people (as of 2013), and a combined GDP of US$166.6billion (as of 2012). The ISO currency codes are XAF for the Central African <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> and XOF for the West African <b>CFA</b> <b>franc.</b>|$|E

Mineral resources alone attracted 21 billion <b>CFA</b> <b>francs,</b> with manganese exploited by the Compagnie minière de l'Ogooué (COMILOG) and potassium by the Compagnie des potasses du Congo (CPC). Of the remaining 17 billion <b>CFA</b> <b>francs,</b> 3 billion (18%) were invested in the primary sector, 2.7 billion (15%) in industry, 6.3 billion (37%) in the tertiary sector, and 5 billion (30%) in non-economic programmes like education, health, urbanisation and housing. Despite Youlou's liberal policies, only 5.5 billion (32%) of this 17 billion came from private capital; international aid (notably from France) supplied 7 billion (41%) and the Congolese government 4.5 billion (27%).|$|R

A branch office opened in Comoros in 1953. While the banknotes were changed to reflect the new status of Comoros, the coins were not changed and bore only the name Madagascar. On 26 December 1945, the Madagascar-Comores <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> was established and its value was fixed at 1.7 French francs. Old Madagascar coins and banknotes continued to circulate as this new currency. On 17 October 1948, the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> was revalued to 2 French francs.|$|E
50|$|Cotton had {{a growing}} role in Upper VOlta's exports, which reached 3.68 billion <b>CFA</b> <b>francs</b> in 1965. Two-thirds of their value derived from livestock. Despite being fairly mineral poor, the country {{exported}} 687 million <b>CFA</b> <b>francs</b> of unrefined gold between 1961 and 1963. It is notable that Upper Volta {{was the only}} country in Africa whose main export partners were other African states. Its main export partner was Côte d'Ivoire, although Ghana took the role in 1963 with 40.5% of Upper Volta's exports, before being relegated to second place in 1965 with 17.6%. France, the third most important export partner of Upper Volta, was the source of 52% of the 9.169 billion <b>CFA</b> <b>francs</b> worth of imported products in 1965. In 1965 the balance of trade was very negative, with a deficit of 5.489 billion <b>CFA</b> <b>francs.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{value of}} the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> has been widely criticized as being too high, which many economists believe favours the urban elite of the African countries, who can buy {{imported}} manufactured goods cheaply {{at the expense of}} farmers who cannot easily export agricultural products. The devaluation of 1994 was an attempt to reduce these imbalances.|$|E
25|$|Pre-independence Equatorial Guinea {{exported}} cocoa, {{coffee and}} timber mostly to its colonial ruler, Spain, {{but also to}} Germany and the UK. On 1 January 1985, the country became the first non- African member of the franc zone, adopting the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> as its currency.

Payments to chiefs and subsidies for private schools were cancelled.

25|$|The CFP franc {{was created}} in December 1945, {{together}} with the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc,</b> used in Africa. The reason {{for the creation of}} these francs was the weakness of the French franc immediately after the Second World War. When France ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement in December 1945, the French franc was devalued in order to set a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. New currencies were created in the French colonies to spare them the strong devaluation of December 1945. René Pleven, the French minister of finance, was quoted saying: “In a show of her generosity and selflessness, metropolitan France, wishing not to impose on her far-away daughters the consequences of her own poverty, is setting different exchange rates for their currency.” The <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> and the other colonial currencies were set at a fixed exchange rate with the French franc. However, the CFP franc was set at a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar, which {{played a major role in}} the economy of the French Pacific territories on account of World War II. That situation ended in September 1949 when the CFP franc was given a fixed exchange rate with the French franc.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} of {{economic}} downturn and political instability, in 1997, Guinea-Bissau entered the <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> monetary system, bringing about some internal monetary stability. The civil war {{that took place in}} 1998 and 1999, and a military coup in September 2003 again disrupted economic activity, leaving a substantial part of the economic and social infrastructure in ruins and intensifying the already widespread poverty. Following the parliamentary elections in March 2004 and presidential elections in July 2005, the country is trying to recover from the long period of instability, despite a still-fragile political situation.|$|E
25|$|Although Central African CFA francs and West African CFA francs {{have always}} been at parity and have {{therefore}} always had the same monetary value against other currencies, they are in principle separate currencies. They could theoretically have different values from any moment {{if one of the}} two CFA monetary authorities, or France, decided it. Therefore, West African CFA coins and banknotes are theoretically not accepted in countries using Central African CFA francs, and vice versa. However, in practice, the permanent parity of the two <b>CFA</b> <b>franc</b> currencies is widely assumed.|$|E
