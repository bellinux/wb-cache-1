5|$|Konrad Kujau {{was born}} in 1938 in Löbau, near Dresden, in what would become East Germany. His parents, a {{shoemaker}} and his wife, had both joined the Nazi Party in 1933. The boy grew up believing in the Nazi ideals and idolising Hitler; Germany's defeat and Hitler's suicide in 1945 did not temper his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. He {{held a series of}} menial jobs until 1957, when a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the theft of a microphone from the Löbau Youth Club. He fled to Stuttgart, West Germany, and soon drifted into temporary work and petty crime. After running a dance bar during the early 1960s with his girlfriend, Edith Lieblang—whom he later married—Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself. He told people that his real name was Peter Fischer, changed his date of birth by two years, and altered the story of his time in East Germany. By 1963 the bar had begun to suffer financial difficulties, and Kujau started his career as a <b>counterfeiter,</b> forging 27 Deutsche Marks' (DM) worth of luncheon vouchers; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although it provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a routine check at Kujau's lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity and he was sent to Stuttgart's Stammheim Prison.|$|E

25|$|In {{agreement}} {{with a call}} from three vacant churches of Oxford, Paynesville and Elizabeth, Alabama, Loughridge preached six months; soon afterward, Loughridge was appointed by the Presbyterian board for foreign missions to visit the Creek Indians, west of Arkansas, {{to find out whether}} or not {{they would be willing to}} allow a preaching and mission school on their lands. Loughridge set out on horse-back, November 2, 1841, from Eutaw, and rode about six hundred miles. On December 6 he met the chiefs of the Creek (Muskogee) Nation, and brought the matter before them. Loughridge had to wait about three weeks for the council to meet to consider his proposal; While there he took time visiting several parts of the nation; there was not a missionary in the whole nation, nor was there an institution of learning in all the land, except a little government school which pretended to be taught by a man who was afterwards proved to be a <b>counterfeiter.</b> When the council met they told Loughridge that they did not want preaching, because it broke up their old customs, their busks, ball-plays and dances; but they did want him to come and establish a school. He informed them that he was a preacher, and unless they allowed him to preach to the people he would not come help them. After long conference, they finally decided that if he would establish a school they would allow him to preach at the school-house, but nowhere else; after significant uncertainty Loughridge agreed to these terms; and mounting his horse he returned to Alabama to prepare for the move to Indian Territory. After some delay in getting ready, he returned by steamer, and arrived, with his young wife, in the nation, at the Verdigris landing, February 5, 1843.|$|E

The king referred to the so-called [...] "Gun Powder Conspiracy" [...] uncovered in 1536, which aimed at murdering him by a blasting charge hidden under his chair in the church. This resulted in various death sentences and expatriations, including Mint Master Anders Hansson who was accused of being a <b>counterfeiter.</b>|$|E

He sold the story to Warner Bros. for US$80,000 and received another US$15,000 to write the screenplay. After working in television for over a decade, Rosenberg chose it to make it his directorial debut in cinema. He took the idea to Jalem Productions, owned by Jack Lemmon. Since Pearce had no experience writing screenplays, his draft was reworked by Frank Pierson. Conrad Hall was hired as the cinematographer, while Paul Newman's brother, Arthur, was hired as the unit production manager. Newman's biographer Marie Edelman Borden states that the [...] "tough, honest" [...] script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially Hombre, Newman's earlier film of 1967. [...] Director Stuart Rosenberg altered the original ending in the script, adding [...] "an upbeat ending that would reprise the protagonist's (and Paul Newman's) trademark smile." ...|$|E
500|$|A Dutch {{opinion poll}} {{conducted}} in October 1947 placed Han van Meegeren’s popularity {{second in the}} nation, behind only the Prime Minister's and slightly ahead of Prince Berhard, the husband of Princess Juliana. The Dutch people viewed Van Meegeren as a cunning trickster who had successfully fooled the Dutch art experts and, more importantly, Hermann Göring himself. In fact, according to a contemporary account, Göring was informed that his [...] "Vermeer" [...] was actually a forgery and [...] " [...] looked {{as if for the}} first time he had discovered there was evil in the world". Lopez indicates that Han van Meegeren's defense during his trial in Amsterdam was a masterpiece of trickery, forging his own personality into a true Dutchman eager to trick his critics and also the Dutch people by pretending that he sold Christ and the Adulteress, a fake Vermeer, to Göring because he wanted to teach the Nazi a lesson. Van Meegeren remains one of the most ingenious art counterfeiters of the 20th century. After his trial, however, he declared, [...] "My triumph as a <b>counterfeiter</b> was my defeat as [...] creative artist." ...|$|E
500|$|At the time, {{it was a}} rare {{achievement}} for an R song to chart within the top echelons of the pop chart. The Penguins were the first West Coast R group to dent the pop top ten. In May 1955, Dootsie Williams was presented with a gold record to celebrate the record selling one million copies (it was reported that nearly 200,000 copies of [...] "Earth Angel" [...] were sold in Southern California alone). With the popularity of the song [...] "The Flying Saucer", the single saw revived sales in summer 1956. When the Penguins switched to Mercury Records, the label reissued [...] "Earth Angel" [...] in September 1956 with string accompaniment. The following July, Billboard reported that the single was again breaking out in certain markets, remarking, [...] "This wax breaks out every summer." [...] It made another appearance at #101 in late December 1959. Indeed, Billboard confirmed the single's enduring popularity in 1960: [...] "The original version of 'Earth Angel,' for example, is still known to be a heavy traffic item in many areas." [...] By 1963, Williams had told Billboard the single had passed the 2,000,000 mark, and it was reported to be the top-selling single of Dootone Records (at this period renamed Dooto). The same year, it was reported that thousands of bogus copies of [...] "Earth Angel" [...] were attempted to be sold by an unidentified <b>counterfeiter.</b>|$|E

500|$|At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present {{inflated}} their expenses; in {{the opinion}} of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. [...] Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. [...] The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, a <b>counterfeiter,</b> was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. [...] He called it one of [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] and amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the Treason Act 1790, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. [...] It was followed by the Treason Act 1814, introduced by Samuel Romilly, a legal reformer. [...] Influenced by his friend, Jeremy Bentham, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the severity of England's laws was responsible for an increase in crime. [...] When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as [...] "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and in 1814 proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. [...] However, when it was pointed out {{that this would be a}} less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decollated, [...] "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma." [...] This is what happened to Jeremiah Brandreth, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the Pentrich rising and one of three men executed in 1817 at Derby Gaol. [...] As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the Prince Regent were beheaded with an axe. [...] The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. [...] As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. [...] A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the Cato Street Conspiracy were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. [...] Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls. [...] The plot was the last [...] crime for which the sentence was applied.|$|E
