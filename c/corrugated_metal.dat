The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through {{the roof of the}} emergency room. A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, but no one was injured in either incident.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} phase, the A Station, began in March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out by}} John Mowlem & Co, and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E
25|$|The next {{buildings}} were all {{built in the}} 1940s. These include the other two sheds. The wooden shed is about ten by fifteen feet, with a gable roof of medium pitch, sheathed in <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal.</b> Its exterior walls are covered in shiplap wood siding. Its single entrance is off centered on the southern side, and has two small windows. Next to this wooden shed is a small <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> shed. Its walls and roof are of <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal,</b> with the roof being shed-style sloping towards the ditch.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to analyze {{the performance of the}} Laminar Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger. The test samples were divided two groups, one is the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet with heat pipe, and the other is the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet only. By dipping these two group samples into hot water and to see the thermal image by Infrared thermal imager. The results shown the temperature risen of the sheet with heat pipe was faster than that of the sheet without heat pipe. In addition, the bigger of the temperature difference between hot water temperature and ambient temperature, the quicker of the temperature risen for the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet, and the temperature of the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet were homogenous as well. For example, when the water temperature is 30 ℃, ambient temperature is 20 ℃, the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet with heat pipe rise rapidly to 26 ℃ within 1 minute, while the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet without heat pipe rise to 22 ℃ only, this temperature difference would be more obvious with the increasing of the hot water temperature. When the hot water temperature is up to 40 ℃, the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet with heat pipe rise rapidly to 31 ℃ within 1 minute, while the <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet without het pipe is still rise up to 22 ℃ only. When the hot water temperature is up to 50 ℃, The <b>metal</b> <b>corrugated</b> sheet with heat pipe rise rapidly to 33 ℃ within 1 minute, while the sheet without heat pipe still keep at 22 ℃, the results shown the heat pipe affect the temperature rising speed is obvious, and it also implying heat pipe is a very important parameter for the heat transfer rate of the Laminar Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger...|$|R

50|$|The ANT-20 was {{designed}} by Andrei Tupolev, using all-metal airframe technology devised by German engineer Hugo Junkers during the World War I years, as the largest-ever aircraft to use Junkers' original all-metal aircraft design techniques from 1918, being constructed between 4 July 1933 and 3 April 1934. It {{was one of two}} aircraft of its kind built by the Soviets. The aircraft was named after Maksim Gorki and dedicated to the 40th anniversary of his literary and public activities. The ANT-20 was the largest known aircraft to have used the Junkers aviation firm's late-World War I-devised design philosophy of <b>corrugated</b> sheet <b>metal</b> for many of the airframe's key components, especially the <b>corrugated</b> sheet <b>metal</b> skinning of the airframe.|$|R
50|$|While {{the overall}} design was faithful, the {{construction}} process incorporated {{both traditional and}} modern building techniques. <b>Corrugated</b> sheet <b>metal</b> {{was used for the}} roofing of most buildings, while concrete was extensively used as a building material (the original palace was built using only teak.|$|R

25|$|The Junkers G 31 was an {{advanced}} tri-motor airliner produced in small numbers in Germany in the 1920s. Like other Junkers types, {{it was an}} all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane.

However, in the mid-1920s all-metal construction and an aerodynamically 'clean' configuration were remarkable.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a twin engine conventional geared mid-winged monoplane. Its primary feature was its <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> construction, {{a new technique}} and different from the tube-and-fabric airplanes of the time.

Another major temple is the Wat Namkeo. The wihan in the town are typically multi-tired roofed buildings typical of northern Laos, but most houses have <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> roofs and wooden beams, reflecting a lack of wealth in the area.

25|$|East of the station, {{the center}} tracks also {{continue}} disused along Houston, but rise to an upper level and stub-end near Avenue A at bumper blocks. Near the end, these tail tracks begin to separate {{to create a}} provision for a center track which only extends about 10 or 15 feet and stops at the bulkhead {{at the end of}} the tunnel. It was planned that these tracks would continue under the East River to the South Fourth Street Line, part of a never-built system expansion. These tracks east of the station were previously used for train storage but became an oft-frequented spot for the homeless due to its location near local missions and soup kitchens. The area was cleared out in 1990, and <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> walls with bumper blocks were installed just past the east end of the platforms to seal the tunnels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, zydeco {{evolved from the}} music of the Creoles in {{southwest}} and south central Louisiana. At an earlier period, Creole and Cajun music were more similar, but after World War II, this regional French music evolved into a distinct expression of the Creoles, Louisianians whose shared languages and culture transcend race. Along with the accordion, the second main instrument in a zydeco group is a <b>corrugated</b> <b>metal</b> washboard, called a Zydeco Rubboard or frottoir. They made the music contemporary by adding electrical instruments (guitar and bass), keyboards, drumkit and even sometimes horns. The Creole Zydeco music of Grammy winning artists Queen Ida Guillory, Clifton Chenier, Rockin' Sidney Simien, Buckwheat Zydeco and Terrance Simien remain some of the most internationally recognized zydeco music. John Delafose, Andrus Espree (aka Beau Jocque), Boozoo Chavis, Rosie Ledet, Chubby Carrier, Canray Fontenot, Amédé Ardoin, Rockin' Dopsie, Geno Delafose, Nathan Williams, Keith Frank, Chris Ardoin, Cedric Watson and Jeffery Broussard are also other well known zydeco musicians.|$|E
