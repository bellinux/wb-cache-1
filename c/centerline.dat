40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} robust and {{accurate}} method for the computation of <b>centerlines</b> inside branching tubular objects starting from a piecewise linear representation of their boundary. The algorithm is based on solving the Eikonal equation on the Voronoi diagram embedded into the object, with wavefront speed inversely proportional to Voronoi ball radius values. As a result, provably accurate <b>centerlines</b> and maximal inscribed ball radius values along them are provided. In the same framework, a method for local surface characterization is also developed, allowing robust computation of the distance of surface points to <b>centerlines</b> and disclosing the relationship of surface points with <b>centerlines.</b> A new surface-based quantity is finally proposed, the normalized tangency deviation, which provides a scale-invariant criterion for surface characterization.

40|$|International audienceIn this {{communication}} {{we propose}} {{a new and}} automatic strategy for the multi-scale <b>centerlines</b> detection of vessels. So we wish to obtain a good representation of the vessels, {{that is to say}} a precise characterization of their <b>centerlines</b> and their diameters. The adopted solution requires the generation of an image scale-space in which the various levels of details allow to treat arteries of any diameter. The method proposed here is implemented using the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) formalism and those of differential geometry. The differential geometry permits, by the computation of a new measure of valley, to characterize locally the <b>centerlines</b> of vessels as the image surface bottom-lines of valleys. The informations given by the <b>centerlines</b> and the valley scale-spaces are used to obtain the two-dimensional multi-scale <b>centerlines</b> of the coronary arteries. In that purpose we construct a multi-scale adjacency graph which permits to keep the K strongest (according to the valley measure) detections. Then the obtained detection is coded as an attributed graph. So the medical practitioner can act and choose the most interesting arteries for the future three-dimensional reconstruction.

Next, a simple yet efficient multiscale method, {{based on the information}} of the Hessian matrix, for the enhancement of the vascular structure is introduced. Hysteresis thresholding using different image quantiles, is used to threshold the arteries. This stage is followed by a thinning procedure to extract the <b>centerlines.</b> The resulting skeleton image is then pruned using morphological and pattern recognition techniques to remove non-vessel like structures. Finally, edge-based stereo correspondence is solved using a parallel evolutionary optimization method based on f symbiosis.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Glacier {{inventories}} {{are used}} for many applications in glaciology, however, their manual compilation is time-consuming. Here, we present two new algorithms for the automatic compilation of glacier inventories. The first approach is based on hydrological modeling tools and separates glacier complexes into individual glaciers, requiring a digital elevation model (DEM) and glacier complex outlines as input. Its application to > 60, 000 kmÂ² of ice in Alaska (~ 98 % success rate) and southern Arctic Canada (~ 97 % success rate) indicates the method is robust if DEMs and glacier complex outlines of good quality are available. The second algorithm relies on glacier outlines and a DEM and derives <b>centerlines</b> in a three-step 'cost grid [...] least cost route' procedure. First, termini and heads are determined for every glacier. Second, <b>centerlines</b> are derived by determining the least cost route on a previously determined cost grid. Third, the <b>centerlines</b> are split into branches, followed by the attribution of a branch order. Application to > 21, 000 Alaska glaciers shows that ~ 5. 5 % of the glacier heads and ~ 3. 5 % of the termini require manual correction. With corrected heads and termini, ~ 1. 5 % of the actual derived <b>centerlines</b> need edits. Comparison with alternative approaches reveals that the <b>centerlines</b> vary significantly depending on the algorithm used...|$|R

5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the <b>centerline</b> of the handle and the <b>centerline</b> of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the <b>centerline</b> aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the <b>centerline</b> I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the <b>centerline</b> I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of vessel tree {{structures}} segmentation with implicit deformable models, we propose to exploit convolution surfaces to introduce a novel variational formulation, robust to bifurcations, tangential vessels and aneurysms. Vessels are represented by an implicit function resulting from the convolution of the <b>centerlines</b> of the vessels, modeled as a second implicit function, with localized kernels of continuously-varying scales. The advantages of this coupled representation are twofold. First, it allows for a joint determination of the vessels <b>centerlines</b> and radii, with a single model relevant for segmentation and visualization tasks. Second, {{it allows us to}} define a new shape constraint on the implicit function representing the <b>centerlines,</b> to enforce the tubular shape of the segmented objects.
