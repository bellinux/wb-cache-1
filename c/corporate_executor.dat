5000|$|More {{than six}} years passed between Jessie Ball duPont's death and her estate being settled. The fund was granted tax-exempt status in April, 1973, but {{the first meeting of}} the {{trustees}} was not until January, 1977. Those four individuals were: Edward Ball, Jessie's brother; William Mills, Jessie's charitable advisor; Rev. [...] "Sandy" [...] Juhan, the Episcopal Bishop's son; and Irvin Golden from Florida National Bank, the <b>corporate</b> <b>executor.</b> Hazel Williams, Jessie's personal secretary, was invited because of her knowledge of the way Jessie determined who received gifts and the amount of the gift. That first year, Miss Williams suggested 113 grants for a total of $4.2 million, which the trustees approved. One of the will's provisions specified that the clerical trustee would be appointed by the acting bishop from the Episcopal Diocese of Florida. Another rule required trustees to retire from the board at age 70.|$|E
