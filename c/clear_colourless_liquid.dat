40|$|The {{perfluorinated}} liquid used (FC- 72, 3 M ™ Fluorinert ™ Electronic <b>Liquid)</b> is a <b>clear,</b> <b>colourless,</b> fully-fluorinated <b>liquid,</b> mostly {{composed of}} perfluorohexane (C 6 F 14) with a boiling point TC = 56 C (at 1 atm); {{heat of vaporization}} Hvap = 88 kJ/kg; liquid density ρ = 1680 kg/m 3 (at 25 C) and dynamic viscosity μ = 0. 64 mPa. s (at 25 C). The spheres used were polished grinding balls (FRITSCH GmbH) of various materials: stainless steel (s = 7. 7 g/cm 3, d = 5 – 30 mm); agate (SiO 2), (s = 2. 6 g/cm 3, d = 20 and 30 mm); tungsten carbide (s = 14. 9 g/cm 3, d = 5, 10 and 20 mm). Each sphere diameter was determined precisely with a digital calliper micrometre (± 0. 01 mm) and exact weight measured on a microbalance (± 0. 001 g). Moving sphere experiment The vessel in which the falling sphere experiments were conducted was a cylindrical tank with height of 2. 0 m and inner diameter of 80 mm. The cylinder was made of clear Acrylic with a wall thickness of 5 mm.

40|$|Ethylbenzene is a <b>clear,</b> <b>colourless,</b> {{volatile}} <b>liquid,</b> flammable and combustible at {{room temperature}} and standard atmospheric pressure. Its odour {{has been described as}} pungent, aromatic, and gasoline-like. Ethylbenzene is primarily used as a precursor in the production of styrene and cellulose acetate, but is found in a large number of industrial, commercial, and consumer products. Ethylbenzene is a naturally occurring component of crude oil. Ethylbenzene is also formed during combustion of organic materials. Ethylbenzene may be released to the atmosphere during various manufacturing processes that use this substance as well as its storage, handling, transportation, and disposal. The major sector in Alberta that releases ethylbenzene to the air is the oil and gas sector, with the top contributors including oil sands operations, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, and gas plants. It is emitted to air in virtually all combustion processes, including all point and mobile combustion sources that utilize fossil fuels. In indoor environments, major sources of ethylbenzene are consumer products and cigarette smoke. Ethylbenzene is therefore ubiquitous in outdoor and indoor urban and rural air. Ethylbenzene is measured in Alberta by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of a canister-captured sample with a detection limit of 0. 009 µg m- 3. From 1993 to 2003, the Edmonton East air quality monitoring station (at 17 St. and 105 Ave.) recorded 24 -hour average ethylbenzene concentrations ranging from 0. 08 µg m- 3 to 21. 82 µg m- 3, with an average of 0. 97 µg m- 3...|$|R

50|$|Styrene is {{separated}} from ethyl benzene in a very tall continuously packed distillation tower. This separation is difficult because of the close boiling points of ethylbenzene and styrene; 136 degrees C and 145 degrees C respectively. This column is the tallest distillation column in Australia. The ethylbenzene {{coming out of the}} column is recycled to the Alkylation plant. To prevent the self polymerization of the styrene at the temperatures in the column an inhibitor is added to the mixture of ethylbenzene and styrene before it enters the column. There are two other distillation columns in this plant. All three operate under vacuum. Pure styrene is transferred to the tank farm. Styrene is a <b>clear</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> with a sickly sweet odour.|$|E
40|$|Methanol is a <b>clear,</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> with a {{smell and}} taste similar to ethanol.

In this case report, we describe a 37 -year-old chronic alcohol abuser with methanol poisoning, who developed haematuria and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding after haemodialysis. The upper GI endoscopic findings showed only low grade oesophageal ulceration. Haematuria and upper GI bleeding in our patient might also have cause by the effect of heparinisation during haemodialysis...|$|E
40|$|Bioethanol is a <b>clear,</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> that is {{biodegradable}} {{and can be}} used as fuel additive. In {{this work}} the effect of catalyst concentration on bio-ethanol production was studied in order to obtain optimal yield. The ethanol was produced from manihot esculenta (cassava) tubers using yeast-catalyzed fermentation process followed by distillation. The reaction conditions were maintained at a constant fermentation time of 5 days while varying the amount of yeast catalyst added. The results obtained show that the pre-treatment yield of bioethanol ranged from 6 - 12. 5 %. Maximum bioethanol yield of 12. 5 % occurred at 2. 1 g of catalyst being used. Furthermore, modelling the production process gives a second-order equation of the form:Y =- 2. 392 X 2 + 9. 975 X + 0. 95, where Y is the predicted yield of ethanol and X, the mass of yeast catalyst added...|$|E
