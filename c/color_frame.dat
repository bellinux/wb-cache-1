50|$|The {{exact nature}} of the <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> {{sequence}} depends on the video standard being used. In {{the case of the}} three main composite video standards, PAL video has an 8-field (4 frame) <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> sequence, and NTSC and SECAM both have 4-field (2 frame) <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> sequences.|$|E
50|$|Graphics {{capability}} {{was provided}} by two frame buffer modules, the monochrome and <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> buffer. The monochrome frame buffer supports 1-bit color and a resolution of 1024 × 864 pixels, while the <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> buffer supports 8-bit color and the same resolution as the monochrome frame buffer. Both frame buffers use the Brooktree Bt478 RAMDAC with three 256-entry, 8-bit color maps. The hardware cursor is generated by DC503 PCC (Programmable Cursor Chip), which can provide a 16 × 16 pixel, 2-bit color cursor. The <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> buffer has an 8-bit write mask, used to select which pixel(s) are to be updated. None of the framebuffers use all the memory provided by the frame buffer module, the <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> buffer's VRAM is organized as 2048 × 1024 pixels and the monochrome frame buffer, 1024 × 1024, but only the leftmost pixels are displayed in the <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> buffer and the topmost pixels in the monochrome frame buffer. Unused areas of the VRAM {{may be used to}} store graphical structures such as fonts. The frame buffers are not parity-protected, unlike the rest of the system memory. A DB15 male connector is used for video. The connector uses RS343A/RS170 compatible signals.|$|E

50|$|To {{help prevent}} these problems, SMPTE time code {{contains}} a <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> bit, {{which can be}} used to indicate that the video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> sequence. If the <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> bit was set in both types of material, the editing system could then always ensure that <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences, and hence the <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> sequences.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Usually, {{optical flow}} {{computation}} {{is based on}} grayscale images and the brightness conservation assumption. Recently, some authors have investigated in transferring gradient-based grayscale optical flow methods to color images. These color optical flow methods are restricted to brightness and color conservation over time. In this paper, a correlation-based color optical flow method is presented that allows for brightness and color changes within an image sequence. Further on, the correlation results are used for a probabilistic evaluation that combines the velocity information gained from single <b>color</b> <b>frames</b> to a joint velocity estimate including all <b>color</b> <b>frames.</b> The resulting <b>color</b> optical flow is compared to other representative multi-frame color methods and standard singleframe grayscale methods. ...|$|R

5000|$|Color framing {{has become}} largely {{an issue of}} {{historical}} interest, first with the advent in the 1980s of digital composite video timebase correctors and frame stores, which could regenerate the <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> sequence of a composite signal at any phase, and later with analog component video editing and modern digital video systems, in which subcarrier phase is no longer relevant.|$|E
5000|$|Bit 11, the <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> bit, {{is set to}} 1 if {{the time}} code is {{synchronized}} to a color video signal. The frame number modulo 2 (for NTSC and SECAM) or modulo 4 (for PAL) should be preserved across cuts {{in order to avoid}} phase jumps in the chrominance subcarrier.|$|R
5000|$|Selecting a {{consistent}} field dominance in vision switching and linear editing systems will maintain <b>color</b> <b>framing</b> synchronization.

50|$|Preserving {{the color}} framing {{sequence}} of video across edits and between channels in video effects {{was an important}} issue in early analog composite videotape editing systems, as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in subcarrier phase, and mixing two signals of different field dominance would result in color artifacts {{on the part of}} the signal that was not in sync with the output <b>color</b> <b>frame</b> sequence.|$|E

Activities can also switch between different pane layouts.|$|E
