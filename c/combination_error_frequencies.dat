To explore the basis of this phenomenon, we followed a mass (uncloned) culture of one normal strain at 13 stages of its replicative lifespan. We found a progressive tenfold decline in <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> that was inversely correlated with passage level (r = -. 93, p less than. 001). This could not be ascribed to the slow rates of replication associated with fibroblast senescence because slowing of growth by serum deprivation did not change <b>error</b> <b>frequency.</b> Additionally, terminal mass cultures maintained for 16 wk at saturation density to minimize cell selection did not change <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> over this time. <b>Error</b> <b>frequencies</b> in 12 individual clones purified from the parental culture did not decline on repeated passage, either remaining constant or, in two clones, rising abruptly three- to five-fold after initial assays. <b>Error</b> <b>frequencies</b> of clones showed a weak inverse correlation with growth vigor but not with the maximum doubling number.

According to {{the stage of the}} medication use cycle in which they occur, medication errors can be broadly divided into four levels – prescription or prescribing, transcription, dispensing  and administration errors. Prescription errors that constitute the bulk of medication errors are common in government as well as private setting. Materials and methods Our study was aimed to analyse the prescription errors in general practice. The prescriptions were photographed after the consent of the patient and returned back to them. Almost all the prescriptions contained brand names which were then converted into their respective generic names and analysed for errors. Results A total of 1015 prescriptions were analysed during a 15 month period. Out of these, 415 (40. 88 %) prescriptions had errors.   A few prescriptions had more than one type of prescribing error. The total number of errors thus amounted to 577. Most of the errors were related to prescription of CNS drugs followed by chemotherapeutic drugs. Our study reveals that <b>combination</b> <b>errors</b> are the commonest followed by indication, dosing and kinetic types of prescription errors. Discussion Medication errors are common in general practice and in hospitals and can result in harm to patients.

40|$|The {{poliovirus}} RNA polymerase <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> {{was measured}} in vivo at eight sites in the poliovirus genome. The frequency at which specific G residues in poliovirion RNA changed to another base during one round of viral RNA replication was determined. Poliovirion RNA uniformly labeled with 32 Pi was hybridized to a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide that was complementary to a sequence in the viral genome that contained a single internal G residue. The nonhybridized viral RNA was digested with RNase T 1, and the protected RNA oligonucleotide was purified by gel electrophoresis. The base substitution frequency at the internal G residue was measured by finding the fraction of this RNA oligonucleotide that was resistant to RNase T 1 digestion. A mean value of 2. 0 x 10 (- 3) +/- 1. 2 x 10 (- 3) was obtained at two sites. A modification of the above procedure involved the use of 5 '-end-labeled RNA oligonucleotides. The mean value of the <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> determined at eight sites in the viral genome by using this technique was 4. 1 x 10 (- 3) +/- 0. 6 x 10 (- 3).

Although somewhat difficult to attain, our main {{goal should be to}} prevent all possible errors. A good insight on error-prone steps in the laboratory process is essential to achieving a structured system for error reduction. Methods: Here, the process of laboratory medicine is divided into phases, and for each phase, an <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> is presented. While <b>error</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the laboratory (pre-analytical to post-analytical) have been reported elsewhere, we also include them in the present paper. In order to investigate <b>error</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the pre-pre- and post-post-analytical phases, clinicians were asked to carefully answer questions concerning their ordering strategies for laboratory investigation and their interpretation of results. Results: In the present study, the overall error rate in laboratory medicine was found to be 20. 0 %. The error percentages in the pre-pre- and post-post-analytical phase were about 12. 0 % and 5. 0 %, respectively. This indicates that, also on the clinical side, error reduction is desirable, especially in the requesting of laboratory investigation. Error reduction can be achieved through process redesigning by, for example, applying the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points approach. The error budget that clinicians might spend, based upon critical differences, is 26. 9 %. For the same test set and production circumstances, the overall biological variation is 7. 9 %. Clinicians thus take the error rates into account in their practical, daily use, and the ultimate achievable in laboratory medicine is biological variation. Conclusions: Several currently available software applications can aid error reduction in clinical chemistry. Both laboratory consultants and the use of information and communication technology are essential tools in optimizing the efficiency of laboratory medicine. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

A total of 104 rats {{were involved in the}} present study and divided randomly into 4 groups: sham-operation group, model group, Jing-well Points group, and medication group. The VD model was established according to the modified 4 -vessel occlusion (4 -VO) method. VD rats in the Jing-well Points group were treated by EA at the related Jing-well Points (HT 9, PC 9, KI 1 and LU 11) while those in the medication group were treated with nimotop. The step-down avoidance test was performed before and after treatment in all rats. Latency and <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> indexed memory function were recorded. Nitric oxide (NO) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in both cerebral tissue and serum were detected after the treatment course. ResultsA total of 42 rats were included in the final analysis. Compared with the model group, the latency in the Jing-well Points group was significantly prolonged (P< 0. 01) and the <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> was significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) after therapy; the decrease in NO levels in both brain tissue and serum was significant (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01, respectively); and the increase in SOD activity was also significant (P< 0. 01).

The enhancement of <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> could be duplicated by the pretreatment of the enzyme, but not the template, with Be 2 +. Glycerol gradient centrifugation dissociated the Be 2 +-DNA polymerase complex and restored the initial <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> of the polymerase. Thus, the weak binding of a metal cation to a DNA polymerase could alter the accuracy with which that polymerase copied DNA. Beryllium is a known carcinogen. The potential use of this system as a screening technique to detect chemical mutagens and carcinogens is considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUncharged tRNA {{is known}} to bind to the {{ribosome}} in a codon-specific fashion. In this way, cognate uncharged tRNA competes with non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA. If uncharged tRNA can be aminoacylated while on the ribosome, this will damp errors due to aminoacyl-tRNA imbalance. Kinetic analysis shows that this scheme reduces errors at ‘hungry’ codons considerably more effectively than J. Ninio's accuracy tuner model; for example, a 10 -fold decrease in cognate aminoacyl-tRNA elicits only a 10 % increase in the <b>error</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|R
