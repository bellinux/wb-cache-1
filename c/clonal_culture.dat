Using new <b>clonal</b> <b>culture</b> assays combined with adoptive transfer, we found that MDP fractions isolated by previous strategies are dominated by precursors of macrophages and monocytes, include some multipotent precursors of other hematopoietic lineages, but contain few precursors of resident cDCs and pDCs and no detectable common precursors restricted to these DC types and macrophages.

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of zooxanthellae in marine invertebrate symbioses {{is not well}} understood owing mainly to their lack of reliable morphological differences. Nevertheless, previous work using protein and DNA electrophoreses has {{set the stage for}} advancing our taxonomic understanding of cnidarian zooxanthellae. Here we present the use of allozymes as genetic markers for distinguishing algal isolates from tridacnid hosts. Zooxanthellae from seven Tridacna and Hippopus species were isolated and maintained in axenic <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> over many generations. Of 16 enzyme systems, α- and β-esterase (EST), esterase-F (EST-F), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were found suitable polymorphic markers of genetic differences among <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures.</b> Of 39 <b>clonal</b> isolates, 97 % were found to be genetically distinguishable. This high extent of genetic variation in zooxanthellae within and between clam species was unexpected, and is difficult to explain based solely on the general notion of asexual reproduction in symbiotic zooxanthellae. Our results are also consistent with the occurrence of sexual reproduction in clam zooxanthellae. The close genetic similarity of the symbionts of Tridacna gigas, the largest and fastest-growing clam species, and the difficulty of initiating their <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> in the given nutrient medium, compared with the symbionts of other clam species, are further indicative of possibly distinct algal symbionts in T. gigas.

40|$|For {{clinical}} {{applications of}} cells and tissue engineering products {{it is of}} importance to characterize {{the quality of the}} used cells in detail. Progenitor cells from the periosteum are already routinely applied in the clinics for the regeneration of the maxillary bone. Periosteal cells have, in addition to their potential to differentiate into bone, the ability to develop into cartilage and fat. However, the question arises whether all cells isolated from periosteal biopsies are able to differentiate into all three tissue types, or whether there are subpopulations. For an efficient and approved application in bone or cartilage regeneration the clarification of this question is of interest. Therefore, 83 different <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> of freshly isolated human periosteal cells derived from mastoid periosteum biopsies of 4 donors were generated and growth rates calculated. Differentiation capacities of 51 <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> towards the osteogenic, the chondrogenic, and the adipogenic lineage were investigated. Histological and immunochemical stainings showed that 100 % of the <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> differentiated towards the osteogenic lineage, while 94. 1 % demonstrated chondrogenesis, and 52. 9 % could be stimulated to adipogenesis. For osteogenesis real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of BGLAP and RUNX 2 and for adipogenesis of FABP 4 and PPARG confirmed the results. Overall, 49 % of the cells exhibited a tripotent potential, 45. 1 % showed a bipotent potential (without adipogenic differentiation), 3. 9 % bipotent (without chondrogenic differentiation), and 2 % possessed a unipotent osteogenic potential. In FACS analyses, no differences in the marker profile of undifferentiated <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> with bi- and tripotent differentiation capacity were found. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed 52 differentially expressed genes for clonal subpopulations with or without chondrogenic differentiation capacity, among them DCN, NEDD 9, TGFBR 3, and TSLP.

40|$|Volvox {{is a very}} {{interesting}} oogamous organism that exhibits various types of sexuality and/or sexual spheroids depending upon species or strains. However, molecular bases of such sexual reproduction characteristics have not been studied in this genus. In the model species V. carteri, an ortholog of the minus mating type-determining or minus dominance gene (MID) of isogamous Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is male-specific and determines the sperm formation. Male and female genders are genetically determined (heterothallism) in V. carteri, whereas in several other species of Volvox both male and female gametes (sperm and eggs) are formed within the same <b>clonal</b> <b>culture</b> (homothallism). To resolve the molecular basis of the evolution of Volvox species with monoecious spheroids, we here describe a MID ortholog in the homothallic species V. africanus that produces both monoecious and male spheroids within a single <b>clonal</b> <b>culture.</b> Comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in MID genes between V. africanus and heterothallic volvocacean species suggests that the MID gene of V. africanus evolved under the same degree of functional constraint as those of the heterothallic species. Based on semi quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses using the asexual, male and monoecious spheroids isolated from a sexually induced V. africanus culture, the MID mRNA level was significantly upregulated in the male spheroids, but suppressed in the monoecious spheroids. These results suggest that the monoecious spheroid-specific down regulation of gene expression of the MID homolog correlates with the formation of both eggs and sperm in the same spheroid in V. africanus...|$|E

Conversely, differences in baseline TGF-β mRNA levels among clones were either not present or less than onefold. The clonal phenotypic expression of α 1 (I) procollagen mRNA remained stable after eight additional cell passages. TGF-β stimulation of itself (autoinduction) was highly variable among clones (range of increases 30 % to 150 %), and up-regulation of procollagen mRNA levels after TGF-β stimulation was detected in only 15 (540 / 0) of 28 <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> (range of increases 30 % to 353 %).

The relation between chronological age and fibroblast growth characteristics was assessed in nonagenarian subjects of the Leiden 85 + Study. A high remaining replicative capacity impressively showed that even in the very elderly a crucial number of cells with high mitotic capacity are left to give rise to fibroblast strains with the capacity for more than 100 population doublings.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{vertebrate}} development {{many types}} of precursor cells divide {{a limited number of}} times before they stop dividing and terminally differentiate. It is unclear what causes the cells to stop dividing when they do. We have been studying this problem in the oligodendrocyte cell lineage, which is responsible for myelination in the vertebrate central nervous system. Here we show {{for the first time that}} in <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> of oligodendrocyte precursor cells purified from embryonic day 18 (E 18) rat optic nerves the first oligodendrocytes develop within 3 – 4 days, equivalent to the time they first differentiate in the nerve, and that this timely differentiation depends on the presence of thyroid hormone. These findings suggest that a cell-intrinsic, thyroid-hormone-regulated timer determines when the first oligodendrocytes develop. Whereas the first oligodendrocytes develop asynchronously within clones, the vast majority develop after the first week in culture and do so more synchronously within clones. We show that β 1 thyroid hormone receptors in the precursor cells increase in <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> in the absence of thyroid hormone in parallel with the increasing sensitivity of the cells to the cell-cycle-arresting activity of thyroid hormone; moreover, the increase in β 1 receptors, like the timer itself, is accelerated at 33 °C compared to 37 °C, suggesting that the increase in receptors may be part of the intrinsic timer. Finally, we show that the precursor cells do not divide indefinitely when stimulated to divide extensively in the absence of thyroid hormone but, instead, eventually stop dividing and either die or differentiate...|$|R
40|$|The growth, toxicity, and {{associated}} bacterial flora of 10 <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> of the toxic benthic dinoflagellates Ostreopsis lenticularis and Gambierdiscus toxicus {{isolated from the}} coastal waters of southwest Puerto Rico have been examined. <b>Clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> of O. lenticularis grew more rapidly and at broader temperature ranges than those of G. toxicus. All five Ostreopsis clones were toxic, while {{only one of the}} five Gambierdiscus clones was poisonous. The degree of toxicity among poisonous clones was highly variable. The number of associated bacterial genera and their frequency of occurrence were quite variable among clones of both dinoflagellate genera. Bacterial isolates represented six genera (Nocardia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Flavobacterium, and Moraxella) in addition to coryneform bacteria. Extracts of dinoflagellate-associated bacteria grown in pure culture were not toxic. Gambierdiscus clones were characterized by the frequent presence of Pseudomonas spp. (four of five clones) and the absence of coryneforms. In O. lenticularis, only one of five clones showed the presence of Pseudomonas spp., and Moraxella sp. was absent altogether. Detailed analyses of toxicity {{and associated}} microflora in a selected Ostreopsis clone, repeatedly cultivated (four times) over a period of 160 days, showed that peak cell toxicities developed in the late static and early negative culture growth phases. Peak Ostreopsis cell toxicities in the stationary phase of culture growth were correlated with significant increases in the percent total bacteria directly associated with these cells. Changes in the quantity of bacteria directly associated with microalgal cell surfaces and extracellular matrices during culture growth may be related to variability and degree of toxicity in these laboratory-cultured benthic dinoflagellates...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} mammalian {{neural crest}} cells using a monoclonal antibody {{to the low}} affinity NGF receptor, and established conditions for the serial propagation of these cells in <b>clonal</b> <b>culture</b> to assess their developmental potential. This analysis indicates that, first, single mammalian neural crest cells are multipotent, able to generate at least neurons and Schwann cells like their avian counterparts. Second, multipotent neural crest cells generate multipotent progeny, indicating that {{they are capable of}} self-renewal and therefore are stem cells. Third, multipotent neural crest cells also generate some clonal progeny that form only neurons or glia, suggesting the production of committed neuroblasts and glioblasts. Manipulation of the substrate alters the fate of the multipotent cells. These findings have implications for models of neural crest development in vivo, and establish a system for studying the generation of cellular diversity by a multipotent stem cell in vitro...|$|E
40|$|SummaryT and innate {{lymphoid cells}} (ILCs) share {{some aspects of}} their {{developmental}} programs. However, although Notch signaling is strictly required for T cell development, it is dispensable for fetal ILC development. Constitutive activation of Notch signaling, at the common lymphoid progenitor stage, drives T cell development and abrogates ILC development by preventing Id 2 expression. By combining single-cell transcriptomics and <b>clonal</b> <b>culture</b> strategies, we characterize two heterogeneous α 4 β 7 -expressing lymphoid progenitor compartments. αLP 1 (Flt 3 +) still retains T cell potential and comprises the global ILC progenitor, while αLP 2 (Flt 3 −) consists of ILC precursors that are primed toward the different ILC lineages. Only a subset of αLP 2 precursors is sensitive to Notch signaling required for their proliferation. Our study identifies, in a refined manner, the diversity of transitional stages of ILC development, their transcriptional signatures, and their differential dependence on Notch signaling...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{presence}} of pluripotent neural crest stem cells in the adult mammalian hair follicle. Numerous neural crest cells reside in the outer root sheath from the bulge to the matrix {{at the base of}} the follicle. Bulge explants from adult mouse whisker follicles yield migratory neural crest cells, which in <b>clonal</b> <b>culture</b> form colonies consisting of over a thousand cells. Clones contain neurons, smooth muscle cells, rare Schwann cells and melanocytes, demonstrating pluripotency of the clone-forming cell. Targeted differentiation into Schwann cells and chondrocytes was achieved with neuregulin- 1 and bone morphogenetic protein- 2, respectively. Serial cloning in vitro demonstrated self-renewal capability. Together, the data show that the adult mouse whisker follicle contains pluripotent neural crest stem cells, termed epidermal neural crest cells (eNCSC). eNCSC are promising candidates for diverse cell therapy paradigms because of their high degree of inherent plasticity and due to their easy accessibility in the skin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> {{of algae}} {{identified}} as Hormidium, Ulothrix or Stichococcus species show variation in characters {{commonly used in}} distinguishing between the genera. Both chloroplast size and shape, {{and the amount of}} fragmentation vary with the cultural conditions and appear to depend on the nutrient supply. Pyrenoids were generally clearer in culture than under natural conditions. Culture made the detection of two pyrenoids per cell possible in one clone and the development of clearly visible pyrenoids appears to depend on nutrition. The character of absence of pyrenoids for separating the genus Stichococcus from Hormidium is therefore considered of doubtful value. Reproduction by motile cells could not be obtained although the methods suggested by Klebs and others were used. <b>Clonal</b> <b>cultures</b> of Horidium, Ulothrix, and Stichococcus show variation in the characters commonly used in the identification of the species. Cell measurements atter by as much as +/- 20 % when the algae are grown in a different culture solution. The formation of a silky film is a useful character only if considered in conjunction with the culture solution. Constriction of the filaments and wall thickness also vary when the algae are grown in different culture solutions. The lack of precision which marks the boundaries of the genera Hormidium, Ulothrix and Stichococcus is emphasized for by suitable culture algae can be pushed over the boundaries. Clones of algae identified as Uronema species retained the special characters of the genus under all conditions under which they were studied. Reproduction by motile cells occured readily and the terminal cells were always acuminate. The validity of the genus is supported. <p...|$|R
30|$|Commonly applied {{assumptions}} consider microbial {{populations in}} bioreactors as uniform, thus leveling individual properties of subpopulations to averages. However, {{it is increasingly}} accepted that <b>clonal</b> microbial <b>cultures</b> comprise individuals that are not identical, differing in terms of DNA content and cell physiology (Brehm-Stecher and Johnson [2004]; Delvigne and Goffin [2013]). Heterogeneity of <b>clonal</b> microbial <b>cultures</b> may result from several distinct sources, either from internal biological origins, such as mutations, cell cycle decisions and age distribution, or from ‘external’ technical factors (Avery [2006]; Müller et al. [2010]). Notably, external factors interact with biological properties, yielding the superimposition of both impacts in the population. Here, we {{shed light on the}} impact of two key players in the origin of population heterogeneity, the growth rate and the cell cycle.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{occurrence}} of chromosome instability in human T lymphocytes irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays and cultured for several generations before analysis. The delayed effects of gamma-radiation have been evaluated by conventional and molecular (chromosome painting) cytogenetics in preparations obtained from long-term bulk <b>cultures</b> or <b>clonal</b> <b>cultures.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} cell progeny of gamma irradiated human T lymphocytes can be characterized by a higher rate of chromosome damage, but this effect depends on the individual donor response to ionizing radiation. Evidence has been collected about a differential involvement of chromosomes 7, 9 and 19 in the induced chromosome rearrangements, and this effect is equally visible as an immediate or delayed response of human T lymphocytes to ionizing radiation...|$|R
