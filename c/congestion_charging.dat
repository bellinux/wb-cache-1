5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the <b>Congestion</b> <b>Charging</b> scheme.|$|E
40|$|There are {{constraints}} on pricing congestible facilities. First, if heterogeneous users are observationally indistinguishable, then <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> must be anonymous.

We show that if heterogeneous users behave identically when using the congestible facility and if the time variation of <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> is unconstrained, then marginal cost pricing is feasible with anonymous <b>congestion</b> <b>charges.</b> If, however, the time variation of <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> is constrained, optimal pricing with anonymous <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> entails Ramsey pricing. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates public {{acceptance}} towards <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in Australia {{by taking}} Brisbane {{as a case}} study. Public acceptance to <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> has often been investigated in the literature. However, few were {{in the context of}} an Australian city. This paper fills the gap. A face-to-face survey was conducted to solicit public opinions on the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge,</b> should a <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> scheme be implemented in the Brisbane City area. The survey data were analysed to pinpoint important factors relevant to people's attitudes towards <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> and to measure their relationships. Main findings from our analysis are: (1) the residentsâ€™ attitudes towards <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> differ by genders and by user groups of transport modes; (2) for each of the three groups (i. e., the auto users, the transit riders, and the whole participants), a positive and stable correlation was found between a participant's attitude towards <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> and the effectiveness of <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> on reducing traffic congestion. A negative and stable correlation was also found for all three groups between a participant's attitude towards <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> and <b>congestion</b> <b>charge's</b> negative impact on the attractiveness of working in the city; (3) the auto users tended to be more sceptical about the service capacity of existing transit systems in coping with extra passengers induced by the implementation of congestion charge; and (4) for people with high income, introducing the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> may have no impact on their travelling to the city...|$|R

25|$|TfL can {{and does}} suspend the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> {{either in a}} small local area to cope with {{incidents}} and if directed {{to do so by}} a police officer. The <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> was suspended on 7 and 8 July 2005 in response to the terrorist attacks on London Transport.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{places in the}} UK with {{congestion}} charges; London has the peak-time London <b>congestion</b> <b>charge,</b> Durham has a similar charge on a much smaller scale and in 2002 a <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> was implemented on the Dartford Crossing.|$|R
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{was part of}} a bid to the Government's Transport Innovation Fund for a Â£2.7billion package of transport funding and the introduction of a road <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> system. A key aspect of the proposed Manchester Congestion Charge was the setting up of the system, which will be paid for (Â£318million) with part of the Â£2.7 billion fund from the TIF, Â£1.151 billion of which {{would have been in the}} form of a loan; the revenue from the charging scheme would have been used to repay the loan over a 30-year period.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Dartford Crossing {{construction}} {{debt was}} paid off, {{which should have}} resulted in the scrapping of the toll fee to cross. However, the government decided to continue to charge most crossing users to keep congestion levels down. Ironically, since the upgrading of the crossing doubled capacity in terms of road lanes, but did not add extra toll booths, it is the toll booths themselves that are responsible for lengthy queues at peak times, and removal of the booths would almost certainly reduce congestion. As with <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> schemes, all proceeds must be used for transport purposes. In one year this money amounted to Â£60 million.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} day 190,000 {{vehicles}} moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday. A report from the Bow Group stated that historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour, and that {{the early days of}} <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> had little impact on that critical time, the main effect occurring after 11am. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15â€“20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in Gothenburg on the first of January 2013, there has been a debate whether or not the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> would harm the retail business. This concerns, in particular the retail stores located in the charging zone. The general aim {{of this study was to}} investigate attitudes and consumer behavior related to the recently introduced <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in Gothenburg and to illustrate the possible impact the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> may have had on retail business performance. In order to do this we conducted a questionnaire survey of visitors to BÃ¤ckebol shopping center (n= 335). The questionnaire consisted of 24 questions and the response rate was 76 %. In addition, we performed two extensive interviews with key representatives for the local retail business in order to add context and background to the questionnaire findings. Â In the questionnaire, consumer behavior was investigated by questions on time of visit, destination, and means of transport. In the analyses we assessed associations between changes in consumer behavior, acceptance and demographic factors. The results of this study showed a low level of acceptance of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in the study population. Furthermore, we found a high proportion of subjects reporting a behavioral change related to the introduction of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge.</b> This was associated to but not explained by a low level of acceptance. It was also related to residency outside the inner parts of Gothenburg. Â  In this way our results support the theory of an association between behavioral change, degree of acceptance as well as demographic factors. However, in a comparison of certain aspects of behavioral change to a previous study conducted prior to the introduction of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> we found no difference. It is likely that behavioral changes related to the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> have taken place but they may have been exaggerated in the questionnaire responses. The interviews implied that the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> has had an effect on business performance in Gothenburg but in this investigation we have not been able to find firm proof of this. We can conclude that there appears to be a low acceptance of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in particular in suburban areas of Gothenburg and this is most likely associated with a consumer behavioral change. Â For further research it would be interesting to obtain information on business performance and customer frequencies before and after the introduction of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge.</b> In addition it would be of interest to investigate in greater detail the association between acceptance and behavioral change and if retail stores that handle bulky goods are more likely to be affected by a <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> than other businesses...|$|R

25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the <b>Congestion</b> <b>Charging</b> scheme.|$|E

Having held a five-week public consultation with residents in the autumn of 2008, Johnson decided to remove the 2007 Western Extension from the <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> zone beginning on January 4, 2011, to increase the basic charge to , and also to introduce an automated payment system called <b>Congestion</b> <b>Charging</b> Auto Pay (CC Auto Pay), which will charge vehicles {{based on the number of}} charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month, and the drivers of these vehicles will pay a reduced [...] daily charge.|$|E

40|$|The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for the Satorn/Rajpruek {{route in}} Bangkok is {{characterized}} by four inbound lanes and four outbound lanes separated by a traffic island. The lanes adjacent to the traffic island are designated as the BRT lane where no vehicles, except the BRT buses, are allowed access. The BMA anticipated that the project will {{reduce the number of}} vehicles along the Satorn/Rajpruek route which is the major reason used to justify the project. Granted that the BRT project can reduce the number of vehicles along the route it also causes traffic misallocations by causing too few vehicles in the BRT lane and too many vehicles in the remaining lanes which result in welfare losses. It is proposed that all vehicles are allowed access to the BRT lane if their drivers are willing to pay a â€˜second best' <b>congestion</b> <b>charge.</b> The drivers that are not willing to pay the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> still have free access to the remaining lanes. It is shown that the second best <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> can reduce welfare losses from the traffic misallocations when compared to the original BRT project. The second best <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> offers an option for vehicle users to be better off by accessing the BRT lane.

Regardless of the scheme's impact, in a retrospective analysis Transport for London (TfL) estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing highway capacity. In 2006, the last year before the zone was expanded, TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year, while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year.|$|E
500|$|Norway {{pioneered the}} {{implementation}} of electronic urban tolling in the main corridors of Norway's three major cities: Bergen (1986), Oslo (1990), and Trondheim (1991). In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road, so that the effect {{is similar to a}} congestion charge. Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure, the urban toll ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect, as traffic decreased by around 5%. The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects, as charges vary by time of day. The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities, and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001. In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> in cities. The measure is intended to [...] cut greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, and relief traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tonsberg.|$|E
