The assessment framework is based on analysis and consideration of morphometric characteristics of <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> and is demonstrated in this paper using eight example intermittently open <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> from New South Wales, Australia. The framework presented extends to a rudimentary classification of the eight example <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> relative to the other 70 or so intermittently open <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> in NSW, which can be used to provide an indication of the relative importance of these lagoons with respect to future management, such as remediation or conservation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> form along gently sloping coasts where {{barrier islands}} or reefs can develop off-shore, and the sea-level is rising {{relative}} to the land along the shore (either because of an intrinsic rise in sea-level, or subsidence of the land along the coast). <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> do not form along steep or rocky coasts, or if the range of tides is more than 4 m. Due to the gentle slope of the coast, <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are shallow. They are sensitive to changes in sea level due to global warming. A relative drop in sea level may leave a lagoon largely dry, while a rise in sea level may let the sea breach or destroy barrier islands, and leave reefs too deep under water to protect the <b>lagoon.</b> <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are young and dynamic, and may be short-lived in geological terms. <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are common, occurring along nearly 15 percent of the world's shorelines. In the United States, lagoons are found along more than 75 percent of the eastern and Gulf coasts.|$|R
40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> {{are very}} {{heterogeneous}} systems covering {{a wide range}} of physiographical and hydrological characteristics. The hypothesis of the present investigation was that physiographical and hydrological characteristics of <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> affect their physico-chemical properties and their buffering capacity against nutrient enrichment. We compared data collected during a complete annual cycle in six <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> which were representative of the different lagoon types proposed by Kjerfve (1986) and were subjected to different anthropogenic pressures. The greater exchange of water with the sea in the leaky lagoon of Ria Formosa (type 3) reduced the seasonal differences in the physico-chemical variables and increased the buffer capacity against nutrient enrichment when compared to the restricted (type 2) and chocked (type 1) lagoon types. The lagoon types also showed important differences regarding nutrient limitation, with types 1 and 2 being P-limited and type 3 being N-limited. Our approach can be applied to other <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> representative of transitional water types in order to provide a general framework for the rational management and policy strategies of <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The lake lies on a {{sandy plain}} in the Horowhenua, [...] {{southwest}} of central Levin and [...] from Hokio Beach on the Tasman Sea. It covers , but is shallow, less than [...] deep. The lake {{was once a}} sandy <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoon</b> {{at the mouth of}} the Ohau River, and the forested terraces on its landward side were once sea cliffs. Over time, sand dunes built up, the river changed its course, and the sea retreated, until about 9000 years ago the lagoon was dammed and became a dune lake. The bottom of the lake now consists of 15 m of accumulated silt and mud over the original sand, and preserves layers of volcanic ash from eruptions 8,000 and 5,900 years ago. Fossil pollen suggests it was surrounded by continuous forest even after human settlement of the plains. Lake Papaitonga is fed by groundwater and various small streams and springs, and drained by the Waiwiri Stream. Because it is bordered by forest, the lake is oligotrophic, with low levels of phosphorus and nitrogen. The lake was relatively deep and stable until the 1940s, but with the increase in horticulture nearby and the digging of irrigation bores it is becoming increasingly shallow.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are {{characterized}} by highly variable physico-chemical and hydro-morphologic conditions, typically resulting in a mosaic of different habitats. Due to the high variability of environmental parameters in the lagoons (e. g. salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature), the species living in such environments adapt to the variability (Cognetti, 1992) and become tolerant of changes (Cognetti and Maltagliati, 2000). Lagoons show a relative paucity of species with respect, e. g., to the marine environment (Fredj et al., 1992). <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are naturally organic rich systems, being structurally eutrophic habitat islands in the coastal landscape. Given this specificity, it would seem prudent to develop specific methods for <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> before implementing the WFD in transitional waters.

The application of indices based on benthic macrofauna, extensively used in coastal areas, may fail in discerning between natural and anthropogenic pressures over naturally stressed <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons.</b> Sediment {{can play an important}} regulatory role over the overlying water composition through the storage capacity for organic matter and pollutants, regeneration of nutrients or its buffering capacity. Descriptive classical measurements like sedimentary organic matter, Chlorophyll Œ± and nutrient content are commonly included in monitoring efforts.
