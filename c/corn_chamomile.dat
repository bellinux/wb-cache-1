50|$|Anthemis arvensis, {{also known}} as <b>corn</b> <b>{{chamomile}},</b> mayweed, scentless chamomile, or field chamomile is a species of the genus Anthemis and in the Asteraceae family. In addition, this plant is used like an ornamental plant.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} borne in paniculate flower heads (capitula). The white ray florets are {{furnished}} with a ligule, while the disc florets are yellow. The hollow receptacle is swollen and lacks scales. This property distinguishes German chamomile from <b>corn</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Anthemis arvensis), {{which has a}} receptacle with scales. The flowers bloom in early to midsummer, and have a strong, aromatic smell.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the ameliorative effect of German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) on the hepato-nephrotoxicity induced by Dimpylate in male Wistar rats. Rats were divided into 4 groups: Control group, received <b>corn</b> oil alone; <b>Chamomile</b> group, orally given water extract of Chamomile (300 mg/kg b. wt. /day for 30 days); Dimpylate group, orally given 15 mg/kg b. wt. /day for 30 days of Dimpylate; and Dimpylate and chamomile group, orally given Dimpylate (15 mg/kg b. wt. /day) with Chamomile extract (300 mg/kg b. wt. /day) for 30 days. Oxidative stress and antioxidant status were estimated in the liver and kidney of all groups. In the liver and kidney of the Dimpylate-intoxicated rats, there was an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and a significant decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TCA), glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GSH-R) and Glutathione–S-transferase (GST). In addition, significant increases in serum liver function marker enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) were recorded in Dimpylate intoxicated rats as compared to control group. Moreover, significant increase in serum total lipid, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels was observed in Dimpylate group as compared to control group. Serum total protein was decreased significantly in Dimpylate intoxicated rats as compared to the control group. Renal products; ure...|$|R
40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: marsh woundwort, common couch-grass and common poppy, while, creeping thistle, creeping buttercup, perennial sow-thistle, mugwort, <b>corn</b> <b>chamomile,</b> loose silky-bent and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period.
