40|$|The {{misalignment}} between {{corporate bond}} and {{credit default swap}} (CDS) spreads (i. e., CDSbond basis) during the 2007 - 09 financial crisis is often attributed to <b>corporate</b> bond <b>dealers</b> shedding off their inventory, right when liquidity was scarce. This paper documents evidence against this widespread perception. In the months following Lehman's collapse, dealers, including proprietary trading desks in investment banks, provided liquidity {{in response to the}} large selling by clients. Corporate bond inventory of dealers rose sharply as a result. Although providing liquidity, limits to arbitrage, possibly in the form of limited capital, obstructed the convergence of the basis. We further show that the unwinding of precrisis 'basis trades' by hedge funds is the main driver of the large negative basis. Price drops following Lehman's collapse were concentrated among bonds with available CDS contracts and high activity in basis trades. Overall, our results indicate that hedge funds that serve as alternative liquidity providers at times, not dealers, caused the disruption in the credit market...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} {{popularity of the}} market for repurchase agreements, the behavior of interest rates on “repo ” transactions is not well understood. An analysis of new data for 1992 - 95 reveals that repo rates on recently issued Treasury notes rise and fall in a regular pattern as the Treasury auction cycle progresses. In the past several years, the market for repurchase agreements—the “repo market”—has grown rapidly, achieving a daily trading volume in excess of $ 500 bil-lion. Securities <b>dealers,</b> <b>corporate</b> underwriters, money managers, and others routinely use the market as a tem-porary funding mechanism.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{determinants}} of the realized bid-ask spread in the U. S. corporate, municipal and government bond markets for the years 1995 to 1997, based on newly available transactions data. Overall, we find that liquidity is an important determinant of the realized bid-ask spread in all three markets. Specifically, in all markets, the realized bid-ask spread decreases in the trading volume. Additionally, risk factors are important in the corporate and municipal markets. In these markets, the bid-ask spread increases in the remaining-time-to maturity of a bond. The corporate bond spread also increases in credit risk {{and the age of}} a bond. The municipal bond spread increases in the after-tax bond yield. Controlling for others factors, the municipal bond spread is higher than the government bond spread by about 9 cents per $ 100 par value, but the corporate bond spread is not. Consistent with improved pricing transparency, the bid-ask spread in the corporate and municipal bond markets is lower in 1997 by about 7 to 11 cents per $ 100 par value, relative to the earlier years. Finally, the ten largest <b>corporate</b> bond <b>dealers</b> earn 15 cents per $ 100 par value higher than the remaining dealers, after controlling for differences in the characteristics of bonds traded by each group. We find no such differences for the government and municipal bond dealers. Bonds; Liquidity (Economics); Government securities; Corporate bonds; Municipal bonds...|$|R
40|$|With policy rates {{near the}} zero bound, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has {{introduced}} a series of unconventional monetary easing measures since late 2009 in response to lingering deflation and a weakening economy. These measures culminated in a new Asset Purchase Program under the Comprehensive Monetary Easing (CME) which differs from typical quantitative easing in other central banks by including purchases of risky asset {{in an effort to}} reduce term and risk premia. This note assesses the impact of monetary easing measures on financial markets using an event study approach. It finds that the BoJ''s monetary easing measures has had a statistically significant impact on lowering bond yields and improving equity prices, but no notable impact on inflation expectations.

40|$|AVCEM is an {{electric}} and gasoline vehicle energy-use and lifetime-cost model. AVCEM designs {{a motor vehicle}} to meet range and performance requirements specified by the modeler, and then calculates the initial retail cost and total private and social lifetime cost of the designed vehicle. It {{can be used to}} investigate the relationship between the lifetime cost – the total cost of vehicle ownership and operation {{over the life of the}} vehicle – and important parameters in the design and use of the vehicle. There are three major parts to AVCEM and the AVCEM documentation: * the model of vehicle cost and weight * the model of vehicle energy use * periodic ownership and operating costs. The model of vehicle cost and weight consists of a model of manufacturing cost and weight, and a model of all of the other costs – division costs, <b>corporate</b> costs, and <b>dealer</b> costs – that compose the total retail cost. The manufacturing cost is the materials and labor cost of making the vehicle. In our analysis, material and labor cost is estimated for all of the nearly 40 subsystems that make up a complete vehicle. We also perform detailed analyses of the manufacturing cost of the key unique components of electric vehicles: batteries, fuel cells, fuel-storage systems, and electric drivetrains. The model of vehicle energy use is a second-by-second simulation of all of the forces acting on a vehicle over a specified drive cycle. The purpose of this model is to accurately determine the amount of energy required to move a vehicle of particular characteristics over a specified drivecycle, with the ultimate objective of calculating the size of the battery or fuel-cell system necessary to satisfy the user-specified range and performance requirements. (The cost of the battery or fuel-cell system is directly related to its size; hence the importance of an accurate energy-use and performance analysis within a lifetime cost analysis.) The energy-use simulation is the standard textbook application of the physics of work, with a variety of empirical approximations, to the movement of motor vehicles. Periodic ownership and operating costs, such as insurance, maintenance and repair, and energy, are in toto about the same magnitude as the amortized initial cost, and hence an important component of the total lifetime cost of ownership and use. Because of this, and because these costs can vary with the vehicle technology, it is helpful to estimate them accurately. We develop detailed estimates of the most important of these costs, which are maintenance and repair and insurance. Note that in the AVCEM documentation, periodic ownership and operating costs include external costs, such as the cost of air pollution, and financial parameters, such as interest rates. The AVCEM documentation also contains an appendix that details some aspects of our modeling of battery and drivetrain parameters...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the possible implications of international cross-listings for {{the wealth of}} shareholders, for stock liquidity and volatility, and for the distribution of trading volumes across both the domestic and foreign stock markets where the shares are traded. For the purpose of clarity, these three issues are analysed in three empirical chapters in the thesis. The first empirical issue examined in this thesis is the effects of international crosslistings on shareholders’ wealth. This is discussed in chapter 2. The chapter compares the gains in shareholders’ wealth that result from cross-listing in the American, British, and European stock exchanges and then evaluates their determinants by applying various theories on the wealth effects of cross-listing. Moreover, it evaluates how the wealth effect of crosslisting has changed over time reflecting {{the implications of the}} significant developments in capital markets that have taken place in recent years. In particular, the effects of the introduction of the Euro in Europe and the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US are analysed. The findings suggest that, on average, cross-listing of stocks enhances shareholders’ wealth but the gains are dependent on the destination market. In addition, the regulatory and economic changes in the listing environment not only alter the wealth effects of cross-listings, but also affect the sources of value creation. Overall, this chapter provides in-depth insights into the motivations for, and the benefits of, cross-listings across different host markets in changing market conditions. The second empirical issue examined is the impact of cross-listing and multimarket trading on stock liquidity and volatility (chapter 3). Cross-listing leads to additional mandatory disclosure in order to comply with the requirements of the host market. Such requirements are expected to reduce information asymmetry among various market participants (<b>corporate</b> managers, stock <b>dealers,</b> and investors). An enhanced information environment, in turn, should increase stock liquidity and reduce stock return volatility. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the stock liquidity and volatility improves after crosslisting on a foreign stock exchange. Moreover, this study distinguishes between cross-listing and cross-trading. The distinction is important because cross-trading, unlike cross-listing, does not require the disclosing of additional information. Although such a distinction means there is a variation in the information environment of cross-listed and cross-traded stocks, the results do not reveal any significant difference in the liquidity and volatility of the stocks that are cross-listed and cross-traded. This evidence suggests that the improvement in the liquidity and volatility of cross-listed/traded stocks comes primarily from the intensified competition among traders rather than from mandatory disclosure requirements. iii The final empirical issue investigated in this thesis (chapter 4) is the identification of the determinants of the distribution of equity trading volume from both stock exchange and firm specific perspectives. From a stock exchange perspective, exchange level analysis focuses on the stock exchange characteristics that determine the ability of a stock exchange to attract trading of foreign stocks. While from a firm perspective, firm level analysis focuses on firm specific characteristics that affect the distribution of foreign trading. The results show that a stock exchange’s ability to attract trading volumes of foreign equity is positively associated with a stock exchange’s organizational efficiency, market liquidity, and also the quality of investor protection and insider trading regulations. Analysis also reveals the superior ability of American stock exchanges to attract trading of European stocks. Moreover, there is strong evidence suggesting that regulated stock exchanges are more successful in attracting trading of foreign stocks than non-regulated markets, such as OTC and alternative markets and trading platforms. From a firm perspective, the proportion of trading on a foreign exchange is higher for smaller and riskier companies, and for companies that exhibit lower correlation of returns with market index returns in the host market. Also this proportion is higher when foreign trading takes place in the same currency as trading in the firm’s home market and increases with the duration of a listing. Finally, the study provides separate evidence on the expected levels of trading activity on various stock exchanges for a stock with particular characteristics. Overall, the findings of this thesis suggest that international cross-listing is beneficial for both firms and their shareholders but the findings also suggest that there are significant variations in the implications of cross-listings for different firms and from listing in different destination foreign markets. Finally, these implications are not static and respond to changes and reforms in listing and trading conditions...|$|R
