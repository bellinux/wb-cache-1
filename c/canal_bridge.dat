5|$|On 5June 1944, {{the company}} made final {{preparations}} for the mission. Each man was issued their personal weapons and ammunition as well as up to nine hand grenades and four Bren gun magazines. Each platoon also had a 2-inch mortar and a radio. Just before the men boarded the gliders, codewords were issued. 'Ham' indicated the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> was captured and 'Jam' the river bridge. Capture and destruction of the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> would be signalled using the codeword 'Jack'; 'Lard' would be used if a similar fate befell the river bridge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{unit of the}} 6th Airborne Division to land in Normandy, was Howard's coup-de-main force. The coup-de-main force {{landed in}} five gliders, over a five minute period (00:15–00:20); three landing near the Caen <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> and the {{remaining}} two near the Orne River bridge. Once on the ground, the troops emerged and assaulted the German positions. At the Caen <b>canal</b> <b>bridge,</b> troops assaulted German trench positions, attacked sentries, and threw grenades into a concrete bunker believed to hold the triggering equipment for the bridge demolition charges. At the Orne River bridge, a machine-gun nest was suppressed with mortar fire but no other defenders were found, and the two platoons captured the bridge before radioing Howard and informing him of their success. Both bridges had been secured within fifteen minutes, {{at the cost of}} {{only a small number of}} casualties. It was also discovered that the bridges had not been rigged with explosives as believed.|$|E
5|$|From {{his newly}} {{established}} command post, {{in the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition, the explosives had not been attached. Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the code words 'Ham' and 'Jam' then brought Fox's platoon across the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge,</b> positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E

5|$|Just before dawn, Howard summoned his platoon {{commanders to}} a meeting. With their senior {{officers}} dead or wounded, numbers One, Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals. Howard's second in command, Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing. Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons {{had a full}} complement of officers and NCOs. The landings at Sword began at 07:00, preceded by a heavy naval bombardment. At the bridges, daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot. The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75mm anti-tank gun on the east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville, the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area. At 09:00, two German gunboats approached the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> from Ouistreham. The lead boat fired its 20mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT, hitting the wheelhouse of the leading boat, which crashed into the canal bank. The second boat retreated to Ouistreham. A lone German aircraft bombed the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> at 10:00, dropping one bomb. The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division {{landed in}} Normandy {{to secure the}} left flank of the British landing zone. The division's {{objectives}} were to capture intact the Caen <b>canal</b> <b>bridge,</b> the Orne river bridge, destroy the Merville gun battery– which {{was in a position}} to engage troops landing at the nearby Sword– and the bridges crossing the River Dives, the latter to prevent German reinforcements approaching the landings from the east.|$|E
5|$|SSH9E was {{extended}} southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947, as the ferry traveled east to {{a branch of}} PSH21 at Lofall created in 1949. The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and {{was extended}} across the floating Hood <b>Canal</b> <b>Bridge</b> in 1959 to PSH21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12, 1961. SR104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and {{was signed into law}} in 1970. The Hood <b>Canal</b> <b>Bridge,</b> officially named after William A. Bugge, sank during the February 13, 1979 windstorm and was replaced by a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re-opened on October 23, 1982. The east span of the bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010, closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re-opening the South PointLofall ferry. The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes.|$|E

25|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of canals, the ironworks quickly became popular for manufacturing <b>canal</b> <b>bridges,</b> {{mainly in the}} local vicinity. <b>Canal</b> <b>bridges</b> made by the ironworks include the Engine Arm Aqueduct (1825), two roving bridges at Smethwick Junction (1828), Galton Bridge (1829), and Braunston Towpath Bridges (1830). By {{the end of the}} canal construction era, Horseley Ironworks had {{emerged as one of the}} most prolific manufacturers of <b>canal</b> <b>bridges</b> in the West Midlands region, especially in Birmingham. This was a result of their signature bridge design which had become popular amongst canal constructors. The design has been replicated more recently, for example in Birmingham during the regeneration of Gas Street Basin where Worcester Bar is linked to Gas Street.|$|R
5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite {{opposition from the}} local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the Boathouse) was built with stabling for horses that pulled the barges. The original <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, when it was replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence. A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Defences were {{in place}} at both bridges. On {{the west bank of}} the Caen <b>Canal</b> <b>bridge</b> there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an {{anti-tank}} gun. To their north were another three machine-guns and a concrete pillbox. An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E
5|$|The closest large German unit to the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> was the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment {{based at}} Cairon. General Feuchtinger {{ordered them to}} {{recapture}} the bridges, and then attack the parachute landing zones further west. At 02:00, the 2nd Battalion headed for the bridges from the west, supported by the 1st Panzerjager Company {{and part of the}} 989th Heavy Artillery Battalion coming from the north. As the first Panzer IVs from the north reached the junction leading to the bridge, the leading vehicle was hit by a round from 'D' Company's only serviceable PIAT anti-tank weapon. The vehicle exploded, setting off its stowed ammunition, and the other tanks withdrew.|$|E

5|$|With {{the bridge}} having been {{captured}} {{other elements of}} the brigade established a bridgehead for the advancing 11th Armoured and on 19 April they arrived in Lüneburg, where they began to prepare for the crossing of the Elbe. The assault began at 2:00am on 29 April with No. 6 Commando leading the way across in Buffalo landing vehicles. Under fire the entire way, they landed downstream from the objective—Lauenburg—and launched an assault against the defenders who were perched on a cliff overlooking the narrow landing beach. After reaching the top of the cliff, they broke through the defences and established themselves {{to the north of the}} town, while the rest of the brigade came up. Throughout the remainder of the day, the town was cleared and patrols sent out; a patrol from No. 6 Commando captured the Elbe–Trave <b>Canal</b> <b>bridge,</b> arriving just as the demolition party was preparing it for detonation.|$|E
5|$|At 22:56 on 5June, 1944, the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers {{took off}} from RAF Tarrant Rushton. Horsa number one, {{the first of the}} three headed for the Caen Canal, carried Howard with Lieutenant Den Brotheridge's platoon, number two bore Lieutenant David Wood's platoon, and number three carried Lieutenant Smith's platoon. Priday with Lieutenant Hooper's platoon made for the river bridge aboard number four. Horsa number five {{carrying}} Lieutenant Fox's platoon was followed by number six bearing Tod Sweeney's platoon. Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers. Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork at the controls, the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals. The number two glider broke in half and came to halt {{at the edge of a}} large pond. One of the men fell into the water and drowned, becoming the first casualty of the operation. Brotheridge and Smith's platoons headed for the bridge, while Wood's platoon moved towards the trenches on its north east side.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} 1964 state highway renumbering, SR104 was formed {{out of four}} highways, {{themselves}} created in 1937: Secondary State Highway9E (SSH9E) from Discovery Bay to Port Gamble, Primary State Highway21 (PSH21) from Port Gamble to Kingston, SSH1W within Edmonds, and SSH2B from Edmonds to Lake Forest Park. PSH21 was originally part of State Road21, added to the state highway system in 1915 to connect the Port GambleShine ferry to the Kingston ferry landing. The EdmondsKingston ferry {{at the end of}} State Road21 has been in operation under various companies since 1923 and was served by the 14-car City of Edmonds. SSH9E extended from Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow initially and was moved south and extended to the South Point ferry landing in the late 1940s. The bridge replaced the South PointLofall ferry when it opened in 1961, but the ferry was re-used during the construction of the second Hood <b>Canal</b> <b>Bridge</b> after the first bridge sank in 1979 and before the new bridge opened in 1982. The EdmondsKingston ferry was added to the state ferry system in 1951 before it was incorporated into SR104 in 1994.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the state {{government}} conducted a feasibility study for a second floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved {{the construction of a}} second floating bridge, using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the floating bridge would be connected to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later Interstate 5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship <b>Canal</b> <b>Bridge,</b> as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway at Montlake. The east end would be connected to a north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area, which later became Interstate 405. Two alignments for the floating bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by {{the state government}} and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the <b>canal</b> <b>bridge</b> has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E
