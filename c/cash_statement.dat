The IASC strongly recommends the direct method but allows either method.

40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have {{recently}} proposed to mandate {{the use of}} direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> {{as part of their}} project to harmonise accounting standards. Despite the magnitude of the proposed change to cash flow reporting, to date, the IASB and FASB have provided no empirical evidence under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to support their assertion that direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> provide financial statement users with useful information. Given the growing evidence that adopting IFRS significantly changes the quality of financial reporting information, the usefulness of direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> may have also changed. This thesis, therefore, examines the usefulness of reporting direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> under IFRS in Australia. Australia is specifically examined because {{it was one of the}} few countries where all firms were mandated to report direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements,</b> and which prohibited the early adoption of IFRS. The findings of this research show that, relative to Australian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (AGAAP), direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> are more value relevant after the adoption of IFRS. Moreover, the results demonstrate that direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> provide financial analysts with useful information for their cash flow forecasts, and this information is more useful under IFRS compared to AGAAP. Finally, this thesis provides evidence that, while financial analysts use information from direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> when issuing stock recommendations, buy-and-hold investors are better off identifying mispriced stocks by using analysts’ cash flow forecasts in discounted cash flow valuation models. In sum, these results provide strong support for the current IASB/FASB proposal to mandate the use of direct <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> and are consistent with IFRS improving the information set of investors...|$|R

40|$|The Cash-flow {{statement}} {{provide an}} important ingredient of decision-making {{due to the}} company’s financial stability and viability.

5000|$|In the United States in 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) defined {{rules that}} made it {{mandatory}} under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) to report sources and uses of funds, but the definition of [...] "funds" [...] was not clear.

40|$|<b>Cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> {{have gained}} {{popularity}} worldwide {{and are now}} mandatory also under German GAAP for listed companies. Based on International Accounting Standard No. 7 we review their analytical value from both a shareholders and a creditors point of view. Cash flow patterns do vary from earnings patterns. Income earned is not identical with cash received. Enron and some other spectacular insolvency cases are just examples of this. In {{the first part of}} this working paper we present the concept of the <b>cash</b> flow <b>statement</b> and discuss <b>cash</b> flow patterns of firms, cash flow ratios and their usefulness, but also the limitations the analyst should be aware of. In the second part we analyse the relevance of <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> for banking institutions. Banks also have to present them in their annual accounts, but interestingly both investment and credit analysts make little use of them. We explore the peculiarities of the business model of banking, its impact on cash flow as well as the information needed for analysing the strategic liquidity of a bank. Based on our findings, we do not recommend investment and credit analysts to change their opinion on the usefulness of <b>cash</b> flow <b>statements</b> for banks.

50|$|In {{financial}} accounting, a <b>cash</b> flow <b>statement,</b> {{also known}} as <b>statement</b> of <b>cash</b> flows, is a financial statement that shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing and financing activities.

The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to provide a model that predicts company’s financial distress {{on the basis of the}} operational, investment and financing components of its <b>cash</b> flow <b>statement.</b> To prevent bankruptcy and its negative consequences that among them are abuse of creditors, investors, management and employees’ right, the prediction of financial distress and its probable consequence such as bankruptcy is essential.
