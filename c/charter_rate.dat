This article aims at identifying {{the extent of}} such chartering practices, the characteristics of vessels chartered and if an impact on liner profitability can be found. To do so, an initial dataset collected in 2009 on 510 liner operators and 5, 005 vessels is used. Results from random effect Probit models point out first that <b>chartering</b> <b>rates</b> are not different between small and large operators. Furthermore, findings suggest that chartering of small and young vessels is more common and that <b>chartering</b> <b>rates</b> have increased for companies subject to higher fleet growth from 2007 to 2009. An analysis using a fixed effect Logit model on intra-fleet management of 17 selected liner companies further stresses that larger companies have chartered more small vessels during the last 2 years, a result that may be explain {{by the need to}} allocate the financing to new larger vessels.

40|$|This {{research}} {{outlines the}} problems that are faced by the shipowners in the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry. It indicates that charter planning plays {{a fundamental role in}} maintaining the financial viability of shipping companies. Retrospective data from specific dry bulk shipping markets was analysed in order to identify the most beneficial mix of time and voyage charters, if any. This analysis formed the basis for the development of forecasting models which were designed to improve the strategic decision taking policies in shipping companies trading in the dry bulk markets. The dry bulk shipping markets were investigated to identify the major factors that have created financial difficulties within shipping companies. This showed that the inter-relationship between the shipowner's chartering policy, purchasing policy and world economic climate was the major influence. The analysis of specific charter markets, grain and coal (United States to Europe or Japan) showed that in terms of revenue generation a combination of time and voyage charters was, in general, superior to remaining in one charter mode. A series of forecast models were used to forecast twelve months of voyage <b>charter</b> <b>rates,</b> these were then compared with known twelve month time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> to derive a charter type decision. They were also compared with the known voyage <b>charter</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis of the forecasted voyage <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> indicated that there was a severe limitation in the current forecasting techniques used. It was shown that in the short term a forecast could be identified, but in the long term the forecasted rates, and to a certain extent, the long term trends were not sufficiently reliable to be used as decision tools. Suggestions are included for further development of other forecast techniques and data manipulation to improve the decision making methods of the shipping company.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} three {{current issues}} in maritime economics by {{the application of}} semi-parametric estimations within a generalized additive model framework. First, this thesis shows that there are vessel and contract specific differences in time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> for dry bulk vessels. The literature on microeconomic factors of time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> could show {{the emergence of a}} two-tier tanker market during the post-OPA 90 period. However, previous results do not allow for any safe conclusions about the existence of a two-tier dry bulk market. This thesis extends the results of previous research by showing that {{a good part of the}} variation in physical time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> is due to microeconomic factors. It empirically proves the existence of a two-tier dry-bulk market. Controlling for a variety of contract specific effects as well as vessel specific factors the presented model quantifies quality induced differences in physical dry bulk <b>charter</b> <b>rates.</b> Second, the literature on the formation of ship prices focuses exclusively on rather homogeneous shipping segments, such as tankers and dry bulk carriers. Due to the comparatively low number of sales and the complexity of the ships, vessel valuation in highly specialised and small sectors, such as chemical tankers, is a much more challenging task. The empirical results of this thesis confirm the findings in recent literature that ship valuation is a non-linear function of size, age and market conditions, whilst other parameters that are particular to the chemicals market also play a significant role. The third topic addresses the recent increase in operational expenses of merchant vessels (opex). The available literature cannot explain the development nor provides information on vessel individual level. This thesis considers a quantitative model of opex that is particularly successful in explaining the variation in opex across vessels of different type, size, age and specification. The results confirm that differences in opex are due to the behaviour of a vessel's operator and to regulatory requirements. Furthermore, it shows that there are significant differences in opex due to earnings and employment status of a vessel. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Panamax bulk {{carriers}} form the largest homogeneous shiptype-group {{in the world}} fleet. The H. Clarkson database contained in 1994, 834 of these ships, in a dead-weight range of 50. 000 - 76. 000 tons. The dimensions of panamax vessels are restricted by {{the dimensions of the}} locks of the Panama Canal, especially the beam. Shipowners and shipyards have put a lot of effort into maximising the deadweight of the vessels within these restrictions. The question is: Does the market honour this effort with higher <b>charter</b> <b>rates?</b> In other words: Is there a relation between the design characteristics and the charter market performance?

The weekly <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> of luxury yachts around the world ranges from tens of thousands to over a million dollars/euros. Expenses of approximately 20-30%, such as food, fuel, and berthing are charged as an extra, called the advance provisioning allowance. The luxury yacht charter industry functions effectively because private yacht owners mitigate their running costs with charter income as well as keeping their yachts and crew in top running order. Conversely, private charterers charter yachts (rather than owning them) because it is generally considered to be less expensive, and less hassle, than owning a yacht and it also provides them with extra choice related to yacht type, location and crew.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} the first to the {{knowledge}} of the authors to apply copula models to reconstructing joint distribution of time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> for dry bulk ship.

The evidence suggests dry bulk time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> weekly returns exhibit symmetric distribution. As an auxiliary output stands for the result of copula fit accounting for time dynamics and not. For the purpose of conservative analysis (i. e. risk-management) approach disregarding time-dynamics should be preferred as yielding the least number of value-at-risk breaches. From the risk budgeting perspective non-conservative approach (accounting for time dynamics) might be preferred as reflecting the rapidly changing value-at-risk...|$|R
40|$|Present global {{economic}} crisis {{had a strong}} impact on the maritime market. A drastic decline of freight <b>rates</b> and time <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> was almost immediately visi-ble in the tramp shipping segment. Irrespectively {{of the fact that}} global crisis cau-sed fuel prices to drop as well, many shipping companies found themselves in a very unenviable position, struggling to cover their costs. The authors have analysed the breakeven point for the dry bulk Handymax ship given in the time charter as well as a breakeven point for the same size ship engaged in grain transport from the US Gulf towards Japan. The results demon-strate that in time of crisis the breakeven point in time chartering is achieved by 15 years old Handymax ship that has never changed the owner. In other circumstan-ces the operating results would be different, probably ending up in a loss. Freight rates in the analysed voyage charter, although significantly lower than before the crisis, still permitted the owner to operate with profit. Recent recovery, both in the freight rates {{as well as in the}} time <b>charter</b> <b>rates,</b> gives hope for the shipping indu-stry as a whole.

The analysis, employing Principal Component Regression (PCR) approach, indicates that the time <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> has the most significantly positive impact. While increases in other four factors, namely shipbuilding cost, price cost margin, shipbuilding capacity utilization and credit rate, have descending order of positive influences.
