50|$|Many {{people in}} India {{who want to}} stash black money keep it as cash in US$ which will fetch {{appreciation}} in its value also as the INR gets devalued against US currency. GoI should tighten the rules to prevent acquiring/holding of the foreign currency (FC) cash in huge quantities by tracking cash transactions in US$ and limiting FC availability in small value through reputed banks / authorised firms by <b>cashless</b> <b>transaction</b> only. Smuggling of US$ into the country by NRIs, foreign tourists shall be curbed at entry ports. NRIs / foreign tourists shall conduct cashless transactions for acquiring INR currency, etc. All Indians who are going abroad should use international credit / debit cards instead of carrying US$ in cash with them.

5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{described}} as a highly controversial and at times a [...] "sinister" [...] or [...] "creepy" [...] move and as a concept connected to negative interest rates, banking transaction tax and a global taxation regime, since such a move would be both potentially useful and potentially socially dangerous, with widespread implications for society. It has potential to be very helpful for central governments and economies, in the context of global negative inflation and quantative easing, and central control of the money supply. However a loss of cash also transfers complete control of transactions, interest, and individual use of money, and information about these, to the nation state and third party providers, since the individual cannot avoid their money being held in an external system capable of regulation and control. Many countries have regulated, restricted, or banned private digital currencies such as Bitcoin. While supposedly helpful to the global economy and in fighting against crime and terrorism, many concerns have been raised over [...] "dangerous" [...] unintended consequences. It would mean that negative interest rates can be fully enforced, and money could be controlled in great detail. For example, some kinds of money might be set to [...] "expire" [...] and be worthless if not spent in specific ways or by specific times, or to devalue gradually. It also makes individual savings, and information about individual incomes and transactions, accessible to any party able to access the records - either legitimately (police and tax related) or not (hackers and persons with access to the relevant data), and in this way, it facilitates population surveillance. It also means that groups, individuals and causes could be deprived of cash by the simple expedient of preventing their access to <b>cashless</b> <b>transaction</b> media.|$|E
30|$|Switching from a cash based {{economy to}} a cashless economy would require {{a concerted effort to}} develop a network of {{critical}} mass that deals with cashless transactions. Network effects are in place when an addition of one more individual to an existing network of individuals increases the value of all the members in the current network. This makes it costlier for the existing members to switch from the current network. With each additional <b>cashless</b> <b>transaction,</b> the value to all the members currently using cash increases. In simple words, users find it more attractive to switch to cashless transactions if more users are using them (Shy and Tarakka 2002). Therefore, it is important that policy initiatives are in place to develop a critical mass of this network of non-cash users.|$|E

30|$|A <b>cashless</b> <b>transaction</b> {{refers to}} an {{economic}} setting whereby goods and services are transacted without cash (Paul and Friday 2012), either through electronic transfer or cheque payment. The effect of cashless payment on an economy can be analysed by the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI). The concept was first introduced by Roger in 1962 where he explained how innovation is diffused to members of a social system over time (Rogers, 1995). According to DOI, {{the adoption of a}} new idea or innovations is caused by interaction between individuals through interpersonal networks. In this context, diffusion is the spread of cashless payment where consumers seek improved and convenient transaction, while businesses seek new profit opportunities. The diffusion of cashless payment will result in the adoption of cashless transactions within the society or community, subject to the types of innovation adopters 2 and innovation-decision process. 3 Since the consequences of diffusion in cashless payment depend on how quickly the society is willing to adopt cashless payment through different stages of innovation processes, the consequences of the adoption of cashless payment differs in different society.|$|E

40|$|Mobile banking was {{the biggest}} {{strategic}} move made by the RBI where first regulatory guidelines were issued to the banks in 2008 to transfer funds from one bank to another through mobile as the platform. It sprouted in the economy with SMS based service which has today led into <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions</b> through technological advancement and education. These services are currently offered by 97 banks in India irrespective of mobile service provider. Licensed banks with core banking solutions are permitted to offer mobile banking services to their customers post permission obtained from department of payments and settlement systems. RBI is framing policies to take concrete steps to make economy more strong and cashless. E-commerce & technological advancements have paved way for the optimum utilization of mobile banking services. The value and volume of the transactions through mobile banking have increased rapidly during the month December, 2016 when compared to previous months due to Demonetization. Most of the banks are introducing customized apps for their customers to ease <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions</b> through mobile banking.

30|$|Interestingly, {{we found}} that as more {{payments}} are directly credited to the account, cashless payments increase significantly.

30|$|The Government in {{our model}} has two {{important}} roles.

40|$|This study {{examined}} policy approaches to payment systems efficiency in the SEACEN countries. Two major findings were as follows. First, cash remained a dominant payment method in {{a majority of}} SEACEN countries. A declining trend, however, was found in three countries ¨C Korea, Singapore and Taiwan - where existing empirical data suggested a shift towards the use of more efficiency-enhancing <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions</b> such as debit cards, credit cards and electronic credit transfers. Using pooled data from four countries for the period 1995 - 2002, results indicated the following: use of <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions</b> increased with the rise in per capita income; use of cash transactions was negatively co-related {{with the use of}} cheque and debit card transactions; an increase in ATM terminals was negatively co-related with the use of <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions,</b> suggesting a rise in cash withdrawals; and an increase in crime rates is positively correlated with {{an increase in the number}} of cheque and credit card transactions. Second, total investment cost in payment and settlement systems amounted to approximately USD 28 million for the period 2000 - 2004. These investments were largely for the development and enhancement of real-time gross settlement systems. Survey data suggests that a majority of payment systems did not fully recover cost. Subsidies amounted to approximately USD 3. 7 million in 2003. Unit cost recovery ratios also suggest that transaction fees did not fully recover unit cost in a majority of the payment systems. This can be explained by three reasons: periodical price schedule reviews were lacking; payment revenues relied largely on transaction fees; and the structure of transaction fees are largely flat. Using pooled data for 21 large-value payment systems for the period 2001 - 2003, results indicated that the average unit cost demonstrated an L-shaped curve where the predicted unit costs can fall from USD 3 to USD 0. 40 in the shift from small-scale to large-scale operations. This suggests relatively strong scale economies and payment systems efficiency. While there are arguments in favor of subsidization, as payment systems are viewed as a public good, there are also arguments in favor of cost-based pricing to prevent price distortions and payment market failure. Therefore, the key challenge for the central bank is to strike a balance between the risk-cost tradeoff objectives it pursues. The role of the central bank in promoting payment systems efficiency is two-fold. The first role focuses on market guidance. This involves encouraging the public to shift from the use of cash to more efficiency-enhancing <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions.</b> This may be achieved through the co-operation of payment associations, banking associations, or the banking industry in general as retail payment services are largely owned and operated by the private sector. The second role focuses on a four-step process to improve the efficiency of central bank payment services in the following areas: collection of cost and revenue data; forecasting of demand; formulation of pricing strategy; and review of price schedule. ...|$|R

30|$|Mobile Money Transfers: Money {{transfers}} {{around the}} globe has become cashless in the Information Age. The concept of a cashless society is based on electronic transaction (e-transaction).

In a society where many individuals {{do not like to}} carry currency in their wallet, people are thinking seriously about electronic payment (e-payment) through electronic money (e-money) with the help of electronic cards (e-cards) and electronic banking (e-banking).

The ratio of currency in circulation to GDP has increased in most countries, independently of the continuing spread of <b>cashless</b> <b>transactions.</b> Currency is part of the monetary base.

Taking account of the increase in cash holdings can lead to a different view of the monetary policy stance over longer periods of time. Holding the size of the overall balance sheet constant is equivalent to a gradual exit when currency holdings continue to increase...|$|R
