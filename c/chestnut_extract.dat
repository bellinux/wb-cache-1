5000|$|Chestnut wood is {{a useful}} source of natural tannin and was used for tanning leather before the {{introduction}} of synthetic tannins. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 6.8% tannin and the wood 13.4%. The bark imparts a dark colour to the tannin, and has a higher sugar content, which increases the percentage of soluble non-tans, or impurities, in the extract; {{so it was not}} employed in this use. Chestnut tannin is obtained by hot-water extraction of chipped wood. It is an ellagic tannin and its main constituents are identified by castalagin (14.2%) and vescalagin (16.2%).It has a naturally low pH value, relatively low salts content, and high acids content. This determines its astringency and its capability to fix raw hides. These properties make <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> especially suitable for the tanning of heavy hides and to produce leather soles for high-quality shoes in particular. It is possible to obtain a leather with high yield in weight, which is compact, firm, flexible, and waterproof. Chestnut-tanned leathers are elastic, lightfast, resistant to traction and abrasion, and have warm colour.Chestnut tannin is one of the pyrogallol class of tannins (also known as hydrolysable tannin). As it tends to give a brownish tone to the leather, it is most often used in combination with quebracho, mimosa, tara, myrabolans, and valonia. [...] The wood seems to reach its highest tannin content after the trees reach 30 years old. The southern European chestnut wood usually contains at least 10 to 13% more tannin than chestnut trees in northern climates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Low venous tone (LVT) {{occurs when}} the veins in the lower limbs can no longer {{sufficiently}} pump enough blood back to the heart. Symptoms may include dull aching and cramping, itching or tingling in the calves, swelling redness or any colour changes as well as thickening of the skin in the lower limbs (Comerota, 2009). The most common indication of LVT is dilated veins known as varicose veins(Glovicski et al., 2011). LVT is a disorder found more commonly in females. Conventional treatment for LVT includes vein ligation or stripping, elastic compression, valve reconstruction and sclerotherapy venous bypass(Van den Bos et al., 2009). Amongst other treatment, exercise has also proven to be effective as it increases circulation, by increasing blood returning to the heart (Behrens and Michlovitz, 2006). A variety of herbal supplements have been proven {{to be safe and}} effective in the treatment of LVT. A combination complementary medication of red leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> and vitamin B 6 has been formulated as an over-thecounter product in South Africa, to treat LVT without any anticipated adverse effects (Venavine-Nativa, 2014). Red vine leaf extract has also been proven to be useful in the treatment of LVT. Previous studies on the red vine leaf extract have shown that it is an effective and safe source of treatment (Kaluset al., 2004). Studies done on horse <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> have stated that the extract increases venous tone and decreases capillary permeability, and butcher’s broom extract has been proven to be effective in the treatment of LVT (Lim and Davies, 2009).

40|$|Chestnuts {{are very}} {{perishable}} fruits, whose quality may be compromised during postharvest handling. Damage {{can be caused}} both by insects and fungi. Water curing, a commonly used postharvest method, is based on soaking fruits in water typically for about one week. Factors that affect effectiveness of water curing have only been explained partially. A decrease in pH, likely imputable to a light fermentation caused by lactic acid bacteria, may inhibit the growth of moulds. In this study a Lactobacillus pentosus strain was selected {{for its ability to}} inhibit fungi, and used as a starter culture during water curing. As second goal, a reduction of the environmental impact of the process was evaluated by using water that had been re-cycled from a previous curing treatment. Experiments were performed on pilot as well as on farm scale. In all trials, microbial dynamics were evaluated by means of a polyphasic approach including conventional and molecular-based analyses. According to results, the employment of an adjunct culture appears as a very promising opportunity. Even if no reduction in the duration of the process was achieved, waters exhibited a minor microbial complexity and fruits did not lose the natural lustre after the process. The second part of the project focused on the development of novel foods chestnut-based in order to seasonally adjust the offer and use the surplus of undersized production, providing, at the same time, a response to the growing demand for healthy and environmentally friendly products. Broken dried chestnuts were employed to prepare purees to be fermented with six different strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei. The fermented purees were characterized by a technological and sensorial point of view, while the employed strains were tested for their probiotic potential. Conventional in vitro tests have indicated the six lactobacilli strains as promising probiotic candidates; moreover, being the strains able to grow and to survive in chestnut puree at a population level higher than 8 Log CFU mL- 1 along 40 days of storage at 4 °C, the bases for the production of a new food, lactose-free and with reduced fat content, have been laid. Subsequently, the effect of indigestible chestnut fiber and of <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> on the viability of selected lactic acid bacteria strains was evaluated. Twelve strains were selected, on the basis of tolerance to low pH values and bile salts, and submitted to exposition to simulated gastric or bile juice in presence of <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> with or without immobilization in chestnut fiber. The presence of <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> proved to play a significant role on the gastric tolerance improvement of lactobacilli. The recorded protective effect could not be simply related to the starch or reducing sugars content. RP-HPLC demonstrated that in the chestnut flour, there are one or more hydrophobic peptides or oligopeptides, which specifically offer a marked resistance to simulated gastric juice, albeit present at low concentration. These beneficial effects proved to be dependent by the cultivar used to produce the flour. Moreover, were evaluated the suitability of <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> as carrier for spray drying of two probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and to develop a probiotic food chestnut based. The optimal settings for the spray-drying processes were defined and the loads of undamaged cells in the dried powders were quantified. Spray-dried cultures were incorporated into an anhydrous basis for chestnut mousse developed ad hoc. In this form, viable cells remained stable over 108 CFU g- 1 during a 3 months long storage at 15 °C. Sensorial analysis did not highlighted significant differences (p < 0. 05) in preference between probiotic-supplemented and control mousses. Results suggest that chestnut mousse, a food product naturally rich in antioxidant compounds, may represent an excellent carrier for probiotics delivering. Finally, chestnut flour was even evaluated for the production of bakery goods gluten-free. Microbial dynamics in the chestnut-based sourdoughs were evaluated by PCR-DGGE. The impact of fermentation on volatile organic compounds formation during sourdoughs maturation was evaluated by means of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Members of the Lactobacillus plantarum group and Pediococcus pentosaceous dominated the sourdough ecosystems. Nevertheless, RAPD-PCR allowed recording a relevant genotypic biodiversity among strains coming from gluten-free flour combinations. A total of 59 volatile compounds were identified, mainly alcohols, esters, acids, aldehydes and ketones. Principal component analysis of samples at the beginning {{and at the end of}} ripening offered a good separation of the samples and highlighted the effect of fermentation on the sensorial profile...|$|E
40|$|Due to metastatic {{potential}} and drug resistance, cancer stem cells (CSCs) {{have become a}} critical target {{for the development of}} chemotherapeutic agents. Recent studies showed that CSCs highly express NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) -mediated antioxidant enzymes and thereby retain relatively low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since anticancer agents usually utilize ROS as an arsenal for killing cancer cells, we hypothesized that inhibition of Nrf 2 activity could increase the sensitivity of CSCs to anticancer drugs, and thus enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. We found that MCF- 7 -derived CSCs with a CD 44 high/CD 24 low phenotype formed mammospheres and highly expressed Nrf 2 compared to the adherent parental MCF- 7 cells. In a separate experiment, we screened 89 different edible plant extracts for inhibitory activity against the Nrf 2 signaling pathway by using an antioxidant response element (ARE) -luciferase assay system.

The prevalence of LVT is higher in females than in males; 40 % of females experience symptoms of LVT whereas 17 % of males may experience symptoms (Meissner et al., 2007). Approximately 50 % of {{women between the ages of}} 40 and 50 and 75 % of women between the ages of 60 and 70 experience some symptoms of LVT during their lifetime (Beebe-Dimmer, 2005). Females are more prone to LVT as certain hormones, such as progesterone, relax venous walls. Hormonal changes such as pregnancy and menopause also increase the risk of having LVT. Venous ulceration and varicose veins; decrease quality of life, cause chronic pain, loss of working days and may ultimately lead to early retirement (Gloviczki et al., 2011). There is a wide variety of treatments available in treating LVT however certain drugs such as anti-inflammatories and antibiotics have side effects, and interventional procedures are costly (Eberhardt and Rafelto, 2005). A combination of red vine leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> and vitamin B 6 has been created to treat LVT without any anticipated adverse effects (Venavine-Nativa, 2014), therefore the question arises whether this combination work effectively.

There is some evidence that various escin molecules, such as saponins and sapogenins, show beneficial effects when administered at the right concentration, exhibiting an ethanol absorption inhibitory effect and hypoglycemic activity in the oral glucose tolerance test in vivo. Horse <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> has a higher antioxidant activity than vitamin E, showing one of the highest "active-oxygen" scavenging abilities compared to other natural products. β-Escin from AH extracts was also tested to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of its dietary intake on azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci. The main adverse effects of escins in humans are due to their hemolytic activity. Research efforts in this field are devoted to improving the selectivity for aberrant red corpuscles, promoting the β-escin fraction as a useful candidate agent for exploring new potential antileukemic drugs. Fresh or naturally desiccated seeds are usually treated by long leaching with water or wooden ashes to remove harshness and bitterness. These treatments cause a variation in the molecular structures of escin fractions, reducing the toxicity but maintaining their nutraceutical potential and anti-obesity effects. Alternatively, the slow roasting of nuts makes the escins harmless and the seeds edible.

In accordance with the above mentioned trends, the proportions of SolN in total CP contents also decreased (P < 0. 05) from 43. 7 to 15. 7 % in control silage and silage prepared with 15 g of chestnut extract/kg of ensiling material, respectively. Increasing the amounts of <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> in silages also decreased the amounts of ammonia-N in silages. The addition of chestnut tannin extract did not influence pH values of silages. The highest amounts of added chestnut tannin extract (15 and 30 g/kg of fresh grass) significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased lactic acid content (from 101 to 81 g/kg DM in control silage and silages with 15 and 30 g of chestnut extract/kg of fresh grass, respectively). On the contrary, the amounts of acetic, propionic and butyric acid did not change significantly. Obtained results suggest that tannins can be successfully used as silage additives, with favorable effects on protein solubility and true protein contents...|$|E
40|$|Ruminants {{increasingly}} attract {{public concern}} {{due to their}} methane release and contribution to the greenhouse effect. One strategy to reduce the release of methane is to modify microbial fermentation in the rumen {{by the use of}} feed additives such as monensin and tannin extracts. However, other characteristics of fermentation including the synthesis of microbial protein may also be affected. The aim of the present studies was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of monensin and tannin extracts on ruminal fermentation and methane production. The ionophore monensin is known to increase feed efficiency in ruminants. Although the use of silages is common practice in cattle feeding, the effects of monensin on the fermentation of silages in the rumen and microbial protein synthesis are lacking. Monensin has often been described to have indirect effects on methane production resulting from its effects on feed intake, protozoa and Gram-positive bacteria. It has rarely been studied whether monensin can reduce methane production without adverse effects on other criteria of rumen fermentation. The first objective therefore was to investigate the effects of different dosages of monensin on methane production and microbial protein synthesis when supplemented to different silages in two in vitro systems (Study 1). In Experiment 1 of Study 1, 15 g of oven-dried grass silage alone or combined with a concentrate was incubated in a rumen simulation (Rusitec) over a period of 13 d {{to examine the effects of}} monensin supplementation (2 or 4 mg/d, n = 4) on the production of total gas, methane, volatile fatty acids (VFA), degradation of nutrients and microbial protein synthesis. In Experiment 2 of Study 1, different dosages of monensin (0. 5, 1, 2, 6 and 10 µg) were supplemented to syringes containing 120 mg of grass silage alone, grass silage combined with concentrates, or maize silage alone. After 24 h of incubation the effects of monensin on total gas, methane and VFA production were determined. In Experiment 1 monensin inclusion to grass silage and grass silage combined with concentrate resulted in a decreased total gas, methane and acetate production, while propionate production was increased. Along with a decreased degradation of crude protein, ammonia concentration in the system was reduced. While microbial protein originating from solid associated microbes decreased with monensin inclusion, microbial protein from liquid associated microbes was increased, resulting in an increase in total microbial protein synthesis. In Experiment 2, different dosages of monensin reduced methane production in grass silage (17 %), grass silage combined with concentrate (10 %) and maize silage (13 %) without adverse effects on total gas production. Based on these two in vitro experiments it was concluded that monensin is able to reduce methane production without a major decrease in total gas and VFA production and degradation of organic matter. Although microbial fractions were differently affected, the total microbial protein synthesis was increased upon monensin supplementation. Tannins are secondary plant compounds that are known to complex with feed and microbial proteins. Several products from this heterogeneous group have shown potential to affect rumen fermentation in vivo and, even more, in vitro, but are often accompanied by negative effects on digestibility, feed intake and microbial protein synthesis. In Study 2 of the present work, ten tannin extracts (chestnut, mimosa, myrabolan, quebracho, sumach, tara, valonea, oak, cocoa and grape seed) and four monomers of rapeseed tannin (pelargonidin, catechin, cyanidin and sinapinic acid) were screened in grass silage based diets in successive runs using the Hohenheim Gas Test. The objective was to determine the optimal dosage of each tannin extract to cause a maximal methane reduction without negative effects on total gas production. Whereas the supplementation of pelargonidin and cyanidin to grass silage did not reduce methane production; catechin and sinapinic acid reduced methane production without affecting total gas production. Except tara extract, all tannin extracts reduced methane production by 8 to 28 % without adverse effects on total gas production. Based on these results, chestnut, grape seed, myrabolan, sumach and valonea extract were investigated in a second step in a Rusitec to determine their effects on degradation of nutrients, VFA and ammonia production, and particularly on microbial protein synthesis. All tannin extracts were supplemented at similar dosages of 1. 5 g to 15 g of grass silage. The supplementation of chestnut resulted in the greatest decrease in methane production (63 %), followed by valonea (35 %), grape seed (23 %), sumach (18 %), and myrabolan (7 %; not significantly different from the control). While <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> reduced acetate production by 19 %, supplementation with grape seed or myrabolan extract increased acetate production; however, degradation of fibre fractions was reduced in all tannin treatments. Degradation of dry and organic matter was reduced by all tannin extracts, but there were no differences between tannin treatments. Crude protein degradation and ammonia production were also reduced by tannin extract supplementation. Microbial protein synthesis and its efficiency were not affected by tannin supplementation, which indicates that a reduction in methane production due to tannin extract supplementation is possible without negatively affecting microbial protein synthesis. Chestnut and valonea extract had the greatest potential in reducing methane production without negative effects on rumen fermentation of grass silage and microbial protein synthesis. Therefore, these tannin extracts were investigated for their long-term effects in sheep (Study 3). In Experiment 1 of Study 3, sheep receiving the control, chestnut or valonea treatment (each n = 4) were fed 842 g/d of hay (fresh weight). The animals on the control treatment also received 464 g/d of concentrate, and animals on the tannin treatments received the same amount of concentrate but were also fed 20 g of the respective tannin extract. Following initiation of tannin feeding, methane release from sheep was measured in 23. 5 h intervals in respiration chambers on day 1, 8, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 148, and 190. In three balances periods faeces and urine were collected for 6 and 3 days, respectively. Effects on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen and energy metabolism were evaluated, with microbial protein synthesis estimated from the urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Based on the results of Experiment 1, a second experiment was conducted four month after the start of Experiment 1. Experiment 2 had the same study design and data collected, but the dosage of tannin extracts was doubled compared to Experiment 1 (0. 9 vs. 1. 7 g tannin extract/kg body weight) and the duration was shorter (85 days). Hay and concentrates used in both experiments were also evaluated using the Hohenheim Gas for their effects on total gas and methane production. In both experiments, methane release was not significantly reduced by tannin extract supplementation when analysed over the whole experimental period. In Experiment 1 the supplementation of <b>chestnut</b> <b>extract</b> on day 190 resulted in a reduced methane release. In both experiments, on day 1 a numeric reduction in methane release for the tannin treatments was observed, with a greater reduction recorded for the higher dosage used in Experiment 2. This trend disappeared by day 57. In the third balance period of Experiment 1, digestibility of dry and organic matter was reduced by tannin supplementation. The digestibility of crude protein was reduced in both experiments, whereas the digestibility of fibre fractions was not influenced. In both experiments a long-lasting shift in nitrogen excretion from urine to faeces was observed, which occurred to a greater extent in Experiment 2. The urinary excretion of purine derivatives was not significantly affected by tannin supplementation, indicating that the microbial protein synthesis was not altered in either experiment. The in vitro methane production was reduced for concentrates containing tannin extracts, but it was not significantly affected when concentrates were incubated with hay. It is concluded that monensin added to different silages caused a decrease in methane production without affecting total gas production but with an increased microbial protein synthesis. Nine of the ten considered tannin extracts and two tannin monomers decreased methane production without affecting total gas production. The Rusitec study confirmed the great potential of chestnut and valonea extract to reduce methane production without negative effects on microbial protein synthesis. However, neither chestnut nor valonea extract reduced the methane release in sheep when fed over a longer period of time. It is assumed, that rumen microbes adapted to the tannin dosages in terms of methane release but not nitrogen metabolism, as there were long-lasting effects on nitrogen excretion. The shift in nitrogen excretion can have a positive effect on the environment due to the reduced potential of ammonia emission from the urine. Both in vitro systems used in the present studies showed effects of tannin extracts that were considerably different from those observed in sheep. The monomers investigated in the present study are the basic units of condensed tannins, whereas the tannin extracts selected in vitro only contain hydrolysable tannins. It is possible that monomers of chestnut and valonea extract may reduce methane production, whereas higher dosages of these tannin extracts cause negative effects on feed intake, digestibility and microbial protein synthesis. Further investigations should focus systematically on the transfer of in vitro studies to estimate in vivo responses. Therefore, a parallel implementation of different in vitro and respiration studies would be of great value. Wiederkäuer stehen vermehrt im Fokus der Öffentlichkeit, was primär auf ihren Methanausstoß und dem damit verbundenen Beitrag zur Emission von klimarelevanten Gasen zurückzuführen ist. Eine mögliche Strategie, die mikrobielle Fermentation im Pansen mit Blick auf einen verringerten Methanausstoß zu beeinflussen, stellt der Einsatz von Futterzusatzstoffen wie Monensin und Tanninextrakten dar. Darüber hinaus können auch andere Fermentationsparameter neben der mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese beeinflusst werden. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studien war es, die Effekte von Monensin und Tanninextrakten auf die Pansenfermentation umfassend zu bewerten. Das Ionophor Monensin ist bekannt dafür, dass es die Futterverwertung von Wiederkäuern verbessern kann. Obwohl der Einsatz von Silagen in der Wiederkäuerfütterung weit verbreitet ist, sind die Effekte von Monensin auf die Pansenfermentation von Silagen und mikrobielle Proteinsynthese unbekannt. Für Monensin wurden indirekte Effekte auf die Methanproduktion berichtet, was im Wesentlichen durch Effekte auf Futteraufnahme, Protozoen und Gram-positive Bakterien erklärt wird. Darüber hinaus gibt es kaum Untersuchungen dazu, ob Monensin in der Lage ist, die Methanproduktion zu verringern ohne negative Effekte auf andere Fermentationsparameter zu haben. Ein Ziel dieser Arbeit war es daher, die Wirkung unterschiedlicher Monensinzulagen zu verschiedenen Silagen auf die Methanproduktion und mikrobielle Proteinsynthese in zwei in vitro Systemen zu untersuchen (Studie 1). In Experiment 1 von Studie 1 wurden 15 g Grassilage (ofengetrocknet) allein oder kombiniert mit Kraftfutter in einer Pansensimulation (Rusitec) über einen Zeitraum von 13 Tagen inkubiert um die Effekte von Monensinzulagen (2 bzw. 4 mg/d, n = 4) auf die Gesamtgas- und Methanproduktion, die Produktion kurzkettiger Fettsäuren (VFA), den Abbau der Nährstoffe sowie die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese zu untersuchen. In Experiment 2 von Studie 1 wurden verschiedene Monensinzulagen (0, 5, 1, 2, 6 und 10 µg) zu Glaskolben mit 120 mg von Grassilage, Grassilage und Kraftfutter oder Maissilage zugesetzt. Nach einer 24 -stündigen Inkubation wurden die Effekte von Monensin auf die Gesamtgas- und Methanproduktion sowie auf die Produktion von VFA bestimmt. In Experiment 1 führte die Monensinzulage zu Grassilage und Grassilage kombiniert mit Kraftfutter zu einer reduzierten Gesamtgas-, Methan- und Azetatproduktion, während die Propionatproduktion gesteigert wurde. Einhergehend mit einem reduzierten Rohproteinabbau wurde auch die Ammoniakkonzentration reduziert. Während die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese von Mikroben der festen Phase durch die Monensinzulage reduziert wurde, wurde die von Mikroben aus der flüssigen Phase gesteigert, was letztendlich zu einer gesteigerten Syntheseleistung mikrobiellen Proteins führte. In Experiment 2 wurden verschiedene Monensinzulagen herausgearbeitet, welche die Methanproduktion basierend auf Grassilage (17 %) oder kombiniert mit Kraftfutter (10 %) sowie für Maissilage (13 %) reduzierten, ohne nachteilige Effekte auf die Gesamtgasproduktion gehabt zu haben. Basierend auf diesen beiden in vitro Experimenten konnte geschlussfolgert werden, dass Monensin in der Lage ist die Methanproduktion zu verringern, ohne gleichzeitig die Gesamtgasproduktion, die Produktion von VFA und den Abbau organischer Substanz zu reduzieren. Obwohl die Mikrobenfraktionen unterschiedlich beeinflusst wurden, war die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese durch die Monensinzulage erhöht. Tannine, sekundäre Pflanzeninhaltsstoffe, sind bekannt dafür, dass sie Komplexe mit Futter- und Mikrobenprotein eingehen. Verschiedene Vertreter dieser heterogenen Gruppe bewiesen bereits ein großes Potenzial die Pansenfermentation in vivo und wesentlich öfter in vitro zu beeinflussen, oftmals einhergehend mit negativen Effekten auf Verdaulichkeit, Futteraufnahme und mikrobielle Proteinsynthese. In Studie 2 der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden zehn Tanninextrakte (Kastanien-, Mimosa-, Myrabolan-, Quebracho-, Sumach-, Tara-, Valonea-, Eichen-, Kakao- und Traubenkernextrakt) und vier Monomere des Rapstannins (Pelargonidin, Catechin, Cyanidin und Sinapinsäure) unter Verwendung des Hohenheimer Futterwerttests auf Basis einer Grassilage in aufeinanderfolgenden Durchgängen untersucht. Das Ziel war es, die optimale Dosierung eines jeden Tanninextraktes zu finden, in der die Methanproduktion maximal reduziert wird, ohne jedoch die Gesamtgasproduktion zu beeinflussen. Während die Zulagen von Pelargonidin und Cyanidin zu 120 mg Grassilage die Methanproduktion nicht verringerten, reduzierten Catechin und Sinapinsäure die Methanproduktion ohne die Gesamtgasproduktion zu beeinflussen. Abgesehen von Taraextrakt, reduzierten alle Tanninextrakte die Methanproduktion von 8 bis 28 % ohne Auswirkungen auf die Gesamtgasproduktion. Aufbauend auf diesen Ergebnissen wurden Kastanien-, Traubenkern-, Myrabolan-, Sumach- und Valoneaextrakt in einem zweiten Schritt im Rusitec hinsichtlich ihrer Effekte auf den Abbau der Nährstoffe und die Produktion von VFA und Ammonium und insbesondere auf die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese untersucht. In diesem Ansatz wurden alle Tanninextrakte in gleichen Dosierungen von 1, 5 g zu 15 g Grassilage zugesetzt. Die Zulage von Kastanienextrakt führte zur größten Reduktion in der Methanproduktion (63 %), gefolgt von Valonea- (35 %), Traubenkern- (23 %), Sumach- (18 %), und Myrabolanextrakt (7 %, nicht signifikant verschieden von der Kontrolle). Während Kastanienextrakt die Azetatproduktion um 19 % verringerte, führte die Zulage von Traubenkern- und Myrabolanextrakt zu einer erhöhten Azetatproduktion; indessen war der Abbau der Faserfraktionen in allen Tanninbehandlungen reduziert. Der Abbau der Trockenmasse und der organischen Substanz war in allen Tanninbehandlungen reduziert, jedoch ohne Unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen Tanninbehandlungen. Auch der Rohproteinabbau und die Ammoniumproduktion waren durch die Tanninzulage reduziert. Die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese und die Effizienz der mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese wurden durch die Tanninzulage nicht beeinflusst. Damit wurde deutlich, dass eine Reduktion der Methanproduktion durch den Einsatz von Tanninen möglich ist, ohne die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese zu beeinflussen. Kastanien- und Valoneaextrakt zeigten das größte Potenzial die Methanproduktion zu reduzieren ohne negative Effekte auf die Pansenfermentation von Grassilage und die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese zu haben. Daher wurden diese Tanninextrakte hinsichtlich ihrer Langzeiteffekte an Schafen untersucht (Studie 3). In Experiment 1 von Studie 3 erhielten die Schafe der Kontroll-, Kastanien- und Valoneabehandlung (jeweils n = 4) jeweils 842 g/d Heu. Die Tiere der Kontrollbehandlung erhielten zudem 464 g/d Kraftfutter. Die Tiere der Tanninbehandlungen erhielten die gleiche Menge an Kraftfutter, jedoch zusätzlich 20 g des jeweiligen Tanninextraktes. Nach dem Beginn der Tanninfütterung wurde der Methanausstoß der Schafe über einen Zeitraum von 23, 5 Stunden an den Tagen 1, 8, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 148 und 190 in Respirationskammer gemessen. In drei Bilanzperioden wurden zudem Kot und Harn über 6 bzw. 3 Tage gesammelt, um etwaige Effekte auf die Verdaulichkeit der Nährstoffe, den Stickstoff- und Energiestoffwechsel sowie auf die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese - geschätzt durch die Ausscheidung von Purinderivaten im Harn - zu untersuchen. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen von Experiment 1 wurde vier Monate nach dessen Beginn ein zweites Experiment initiiert. In Experiment 2 wurden das gleiche Versuchsdesign zugrunde gelegt und die gleichen Messungen durchgeführt, mit dem Unterschied, dass die Tanninzulage nahezu verdoppelt wurde (0, 9 vs. 1, 7 g Tanninextrakt/kg Lebendmasse) und der Versuchszeitraum (85 Tage) verkürzt wurde. Zusätzlich wurden das Heu und die Kraftfutter der drei Behandlungen aus beiden Experimenten im Hohenheimer Futterwerttest hinsichtlich ihrer Effekte auf die Gesamtgas- und Methanproduktion untersucht. In beiden Experimenten wurde der Methanausstoß - über den gesamten Versuchszeitraum ausgewertet - nicht signifikant durch die Tanninzulage reduziert. In Experiment 1 führte die Zulage von Kastanienextrakt am Tag 190 zu einem reduzierten Methanausstoß. In beiden Experimenten war von Tag 1 an eine numerische Verringerung des Methanausstoßes zu beobachten, zu einem größeren Ausmaß in Experiment 2. Dieser Trend verschwand jedoch am Tag 57. In der dritten Bilanz von Experiment 1 war die Verdaulichkeit der Trockenmasse und der organischen Substanz durch die Tanninzulage verringert. Die Rohproteinverdaulichkeit war in beiden Experimenten reduziert, während die Verdaulichkeit der Faserfraktionen unbeeinflusst blieb. In beiden Experimenten konnte zudem eine langanhaltende Verschiebung in der Stickstoffausscheidung vom Harn zum Kot beobachtet werden, im größeren Umfang in Experiment 2. Die Ausscheidung an Purinderivaten über den Harn war hingegen nicht durch die Tanninzulagen beeinflusst, was indiziert, dass auch die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese unbeeinflusst war. Die Methanproduktion in vitro war für alle Kraftfutter mit Tanninextrakten reduziert, jedoch war die Methanproduktion nicht beeinflusst wenn die Kraftfutter mit dem Heu kombiniert wurden. Abschließend konnte geschlussfolgert werden, dass Monensin zugelegt zu verschiedenen Silagen, in der Lage ist die in vitro Methanproduktion zu verringern, ohne negative Auswirkungen auf die Gesamtgasproduktion und die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese zu haben. Neun der zehn untersuchten Tanninextrakte und zwei Tanninmonomere waren ebenfalls in der Lage die Methanproduktion zu reduzieren, ohne die Gesamtgasproduktion zu hemmen. Die Rusitec-Studie bestätigte das große Methanreduktionspotenzial von Kastanien- und Valoneaextrakt bei einer unveränderten mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese. Allerdings war weder Kastanien- noch Valoneaextrakt in der Lage den Methanausstoß von Schafen über einen längeren Zeitraum zu reduzieren. Es wird vermutet, dass die Pansenmikroben sich mit Blick auf den Methanausstoß an die Tanninextrakte angepasst haben, jedoch nicht in Bezug auf den Stickstoffmetabolismus unter Berücksichtigung der langanhaltenden Verschiebung in der Stickstoffausscheidung. Es ist denkbar, dass bedingt durch diese Verschiebung, eine geringere Ammoniakfreisetzung aus dem Harn einen positiven Effekt auf die Umwelt haben kann. Die beiden in vitro Systeme, die in dieser Studie zur Anwendung kamen, zeigten Tannineffekte, die massiv von denen abwichen, die nicht oder nur teilweise an Schafen beobachtet werden konnten. Die untersuchten Monomere stellen die Grundbausteine kondensierter Tannine dar, während die Tanninextrakte, die in vitro herausgearbeitet wurden, zu den hydrolisierbaren Tanninen zählen. Es ist möglich, dass Monomere des Kastanien- und Valoneaextraktes die Methanproduktion reduzieren können, da bei höheren Dosierungen dieser Extrakte mit negativen Auswirkungen auf die Futteraufnahme, Verdaulichkeit und mikrobielle Proteinsynthese zu rechnen ist. Weitere Untersuchungen sollten darauf abzielen die Übertragbarkeit von in vitro Untersuchungen auf in vivo Verhältnisse systematisch zu überprüfen.

Ninety-six multiparous Sarda ewes in their mid-lactation phase were allotted to two homogeneous groups (control group, C group; group fed concentrate supplemented with <b>chestnut</b> tannin <b>extract,</b> CHE group), each of 48 animals, for a feeding trial. Animals of both groups grazed 8. h per day on the same pasture based on a mixture of Lolium multiflorum, Avena sativa and Trifolium repens (1 : 1 : 1). The two diets differed only in their concentrate supplement. The control group received 450. g/head per day of a concentrate feed without <b>chestnut</b> tannin <b>extract,</b> whereas the CHE group received 500. g/head per day of a concentrate feed formulated with the same ingredients of the control concentrate plus 80. 0. g/kg DM of <b>chestnut</b> tannin <b>extract.</b> The amounts of concentrate offered to the animals of both groups were calculated {{in order to obtain}} isoproteic and isoenergetic dietary treatments considering the expected DM intake of animals.

Moreover, no differences in casein fraction profile between milks from both groups were found while the casein index was greater (P = 0. 034) in milk from ewes fed CHE than milk from ewes fed C. As regard fatty acid composition, milk from CHE group had a greater concentration of omega- 3 fatty acids if compared to milk from C group (alpha-linolenic acid: 2. 18 vs 2. 57. g/ 100. g of total lipids in C and CHE group, respectively), whereas the percentage of CLA and of C 18 : 1 trans 11 in milk fat from CHE group was smaller (CLA: 2. 20 vs 1. 85. g/ 100. g of total lipids, in C and CHE group, respectively with P = 0. 001; C 18 : 1 trans 11 : 3. 89 vs 3. 57. g/ 100. g of total lipids in C and CHE group, respectively with P = 0. 001).

Phenol-formaldehyde-chestnut tannin (PFT) phenolic foams were initially made from copolymerized PFT resins of different molar ratio. The PFT foams so prepared were tested for thermal conductivity, these being slightly worse than that of pure PF foams; and for mechanical and water absorption, these two properties being better than those of pure PF foams. Indeed, PF resins represent an important part of synthetic resins. They are used in different fields of application such as in phenolic foams or for the preparation of particleboard. So it is important to work on the possibility of going green with these resins...|$|R
