5|$|Valuable {{clues about}} Han {{architecture}} {{can be found}} in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites. The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways. Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting <b>crossbeams</b> and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main hall of the Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main hall of the Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket sets are connected by crescent shaped <b>crossbeams,</b> which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the roof frame from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E

Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the <b>crossbeams,</b> the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>crossbeam</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{supporting}} parts of large gantry CNC machines. The deformation of the <b>crossbeam</b> under loads at work has great impact on integrated machining errors of machines. However, the <b>crossbeam</b> assembly’s structure and the corresponding loads are so complex that it’s difficult to get them through experiences and analytic methods. In this paper, the FE statics analysis method is used to simulate and analysis of the <b>crossbeam</b> under six main working conditions, obtaining deformation and stress distribution of the <b>crossbeam</b> under each conditions. The results show that when the slippery saddle is at the middle of the <b>crossbeam</b> and the ram extends to 100 % length (the distance between the end of ram and the bottom of slippery saddle is 1. 29 m), the total deformation of the <b>crossbeam</b> assembly is 6. 4914 × 10 - 5 m, the maximum deformation is up to 3. 4872 × 10 - 5 m, and the maximum stress is 1. 1882 × 10 7 Pa appearing at the hole of the drive shaft.

[...] To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28inches (60–70cm), increasing to around 48inches (1.25metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by <b>crossbeams</b> and braces throughout the length of the hull.|$|E

500|$|Amundsen {{consulted}} Nansen, {{who insisted}} that Fram was the only vessel fit for such an undertaking.

There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used <b>crossbeams</b> to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in {{a wider range of}} water depths.

The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a loom, these reciprocating beams were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks to work the yelds. [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large drive wheel to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam. Out of skew is a dialect expression meaning in incorrect position. Whether a foot-driven treadle could power a mighty crossbeam is a moot point, and may be a joke in itself, but the explanation of the above phrase and its humour is tightly connected with the mechanism of the weaving machinery described below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{orthotropic}} {{steel bridge}} deck (OSD), principle tensile stresses {{near the end}} of joint of <b>crossbeam</b> web and longitudinal rib and at the edge of <b>crossbeam</b> cutout are dependent on the shape of <b>crossbeam</b> cutout to a great extent. They are results of many factors, among which bending-shearing effect and in-plane supporting effect are in-plane factors, unsymmetrical loading effect and relative longitudinal deformation effect are out-of-plane factors. Comparison study on stresses at some fatigue sensitive regions of orthotropic steel deck with six types of <b>crossbeam</b> web cutout indicates that the top height of cutouts determines the distance between the end of joint and the neutral axis, which affects the bending effect seriously, and the area of cutouts determines the shearing effect. When OSD system is affected by bending-shearing effect, increasing the top height decreases the principle tensile stresses {{near the end of}} joint but increases the stresses at the edge of cutout, and increasing the area increases the principle tensile stresses both near the end and at the edge of cutout. When the top height of cutouts increases, the contact area between <b>crossbeam</b> web drops, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by in-plane supporting effect increases. When the side width of cutouts increases, the constraint effect of the <b>crossbeam</b> web to longitudinal rib decreases, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by out-of-plane effects decreases. Generally, OSD system with stiff cutouts behaves well when affected by in-plane effects, and OSD system with flexible cutouts behaves well when affected by out-of-plane effects...|$|R
