They were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design, with six treatments, six repetitions and two birds per parcel. The treatments were denominated as follows: A - deboning immediately <b>after</b> <b>chilling,</b> B - deboning 1 h <b>after</b> <b>chilling,</b> C - deboning 2 h <b>after</b> <b>chilling,</b> D - deboning 3 h <b>after</b> <b>chilling,</b> E - deboning 4 h <b>after</b> <b>chilling,</b> and F - deboning 24 hours <b>after</b> <b>chilling.</b> Lowest pH values (p< 0. 05) were seen when deboning was performed 24 h <b>after</b> carcass <b>chilling</b> (pH= 6. 00) in comparison to deboning at 0 h (6. 69) and 1 h (6. 42) <b>after</b> <b>chilling.</b> R values were inversely proportional to pH values, i. e., R values were lower (p< 0. 05) in treatments A (1. 05) and B (1. 07) when compared to treatment F (1. 44). No differences were seen in cooking loss during thermal treatment (broiling) of the muscle P. major. Higher shear forces (p< 0. 05) were seen in broiled muscles from carcasses with shorter storage times (A - 11. 78 kgf and B - 10. 75 kgf) before deboning, when compared to treatments E (6. 11 kgf) and F (5. 64 kgf). Higher L* values were observed in the treatment in which carcass deboning was performed 24 hours <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> (49. 26) in comparison to deboning immediately <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> (44. 68). Therefore, it was concluded that an interval of at least 4 hours is needed between chilling and deboning to obtain broiled breast fillets with tender texture.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare two {{chilling}} methods, combined (aerosol) and water chilling, {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in chilling of different weight categories of broiler chickens. At the same time microbial associations of different weight categories of broiler chickens were evaluated. Samples were collected in an approved establishment and poultry carcasses were divided according to weight and chilling methods into five categories. The first four categories were chilled using combined chilling method and fifth category was chilled with water. The temperature of the breast muscle before and <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> and microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle <b>after</b> combined <b>chilling</b> method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and <b>after</b> cutting were <b>chilled</b> up to a temperature below 4 °C. In poultry carcasses chilled by water, the average temperature of the breast muscle after 20 minutes in the water bath was even higher (19. 6 °C) compared to combine chilling. Thus chilled poultry carcasses were frozen up to - 18 °C in a core of muscles. Comparing the microbiological contamination in different weight categories and chilling techniques, we found that the lowest total viable count (TVC) before and <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> was in the lowest category and the difference before chilling was significantly lower comparing with all other categories. Conversely TVC <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> by water was decreased.

40|$|The {{causes of}} {{differences}} in Campylobacter and Escherichia coli concentrations on broiler chicken carcasses <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> between slaughterhouses are not fully identified. Therefore, {{it is a challenge}} for slaughterhouses to comply with Process Hygiene Criteria for broiler meat. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify which processing steps contribute to increases or decreases in Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations within and between two slaughterhouses. Identifying the processing steps with variable performance could explain the differences in bacterial concentrations <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> between slaughterhouses. Thermotolerant Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations on carcasses during broiler processing were measured during the summer period in 21 trials after bleeding, scalding, defeathering, evisceration and chilling. In two slaughterhouses with comparable Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations in the incoming batches (after bleeding), the mean log 10 concentrations are found to be significantly different <b>after</b> <b>chilling.</b> Campylobacter concentrations decreased by 1. 40 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 1 and by 1. 86 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 2, whereas E. coli decreased by 2. 19 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 1 and by 2. 84 log 10 in Slaughterhouse 2. Higher concentrations of Campylobacter and E. coli on carcasses <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> were observed in Slaughterhouse 1 in which an increase in concentrations was observed after evisceration. The effect of processing on Campylobacter and E. coli concentrations in Slaughterhouse 1 did not differ between batches. In Slaughterhouse 2, the effect of processing on the concentrations of both bacteria varied over batches. Changes in E. coli concentration levels during processing were similar to Campylobacter except for defeathering. E. coli concentration significantly decreased after defeathering in both slaughterhouses, whereas Campylobacter increased in Slaughterhouse 2 and in Slaughterhouse 1 no significant changes were observed. The patterns of increases and decreases in bacterial concentrations during processing are specific for each slaughterhouse. Inhomogeneous patterns potentially explain the differences in concentrations <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> between slaughterhouses. Critical processing steps should be validated in each slaughterhouse by longitudinal studies and potentially based on E. coli. E. coli has a potential to be used as an indicator of processing hygiene, because the impact of most of the studied processing steps was similar as for Campylobacter. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study, carried out in a beef {{processing}} plant, was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a new prototype for steam pasteurization treatment in controlling microbiological hazards. Samples were taken by swabbing randomly selected sites before and after pasteurization and again <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> to obtain total aerobic counts (TAC), total coliform counts (TCC), and generic Escherichia coli counts (ECC) on Petrifilm plates and to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 using standard enrichment techniques. Escherichia coli and L. monocytogenes strains were tested for various factors associated with their virulence by using colony hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for each isolate that was potentially pathogenic to humans by using the disk-diffusion method. Mean values for TAC, TCC, and ECC were 2. 18, 0. 16, and 0. 06 log 10 CFU/cm 2, respectively, before pasteurization; 1. 17, 0. 03, and 0. 01 log 10 CFU/cm 2 after pasteurization; and 0. 89, 0. 02, and 0. 01 log 10 CFU/cm 2 <b>after</b> <b>chilling.</b> Prevalence of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and E. coli O 157 :H 7 on carcasses was 0. 8 %, 0. 0 %, and 0. 0 %, respectively, before pasteurization; 2. 6 %, 0. 0 %, and 0. 0 % after pasteurization; and 3. 1 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 0 % <b>after</b> <b>chilling.</b> The prevalence of E. coli containing ≥ 1 virulence gene was 14. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{chilling}} on the intercellular distribution of mRNAs for enzymes of assimilatory sulfate reduction, {{the activity of}} adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR), {{and the level of}} glutathione was analysed in leaves and roots of maize (Zea mays L). At 25 °C the mRNAs for APR, ATP sulfurylase, and sulfite reductase accumulated in bundle-sheath only, whereas the mRNA for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase was also detected in mesophyll cells. Glutathione was predominantly detected in mesophyll cells; however, oxidized glutathione was equally distributed between the two cell types. Chilling at 12 °C induced oxidative stress which resulted in increased concentrations of oxidized glutathione in both cell types and a prominent increase of APR mRNA and activity in bundle-sheath cells. <b>After</b> <b>chilling,</b> mRNAs for APR and sulfite reductase, as well as low APR activity, were detected in mesophyll cells.

40|$|Apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) shoots were decapitated {{before or}} <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> and then forced to budburst to {{determine}} the influence of distal inhibition (paradormancy) on the chilling response of lateral buds. Shoots were chilled and forced with {{the presence or absence of}} an inhibitory distal disbudded shoot piece. Endogenous cytokinins were determined from distal and proximal segments of shoots segmented before and <b>after</b> <b>chilling</b> and/or forcing. The isolation of lateral buds from distal inhibition by decapitation before chilling resulted in a dramatic increase in growth rate. This increase is greater than that observed in terminal buds during the normal development of acrotony on intact shoots. Distal shoot tissues appear to inhibit the chilling response of lateral buds. On intact shoots cytokinin increased more in the distal shoot tissues, but in decapitated shoots cytokinin increased more in the proximal shoot tissues. Increased cytokinin in the proximal stem segment following decapitation is possibly associated with an increased lateral bud growth rate. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

So lycopene diminished sperm lipid peroxidation during refrigeration and cryopreservation, prolonging the survival of rabbit sperm after liquid storage, but it had a limited effect on sperm cryosurvival. © 2012 Elsevier B.

The alternative pathway became engaged to close to 45 % full capacity during this postchilling respiratory burst. However, it only accounted for up to 50 % of this increased respiratory O 2 uptake. By 24 hours <b>after</b> <b>chilling,</b> when the seedlings were fully recovered from visible symptoms of chilling injury, the flux through the alternative pathway was back to the level (about 10 %) found before chilling. Blocking chilling-induced ethylene production with aminoethoxyvinylglycine {{had no effect on}} this increased utilization of the alternative pathway...|$|R
