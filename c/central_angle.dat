25|$|Two {{types of}} single-arch dams are in use, namely the constant-angle and the constant-radius dam. The constant-radius type employs the same face radius at all {{elevations}} of the dam, {{which means that}} as the channel grows narrower towards {{the bottom of the}} dam the <b>central</b> <b>angle</b> subtended by the face of the dam becomes smaller. Jones Falls Dam, in Canada, is a constant radius dam. In a constant-angle dam, also known as a variable radius dam, this subtended angle is kept a constant and the variation in distance between the abutments at various levels are taken care of by varying the radii. Constant-radius dams are much less common than constant-angle dams. Parker Dam on the Colorado River is a constant-angle arch dam.|$|E

500|$|During the Roman period, {{the theory}} of {{building}} a curved dam (arch dam) {{was known as a}} means to withstand the water pressure and hold the masonry joints. However, in the background of masonry arch dams which dominated dam building scenario in the 19th century and with introduction of concrete technology for building dams, the structural design of arch dams underwent a dramatic change in its economic evolution to minimize use of construction material and inter alia, the cost of construction. Basically, an arch dam is a structure that curves upstream and the water pressure is transferred either directly to the valley sides or indirectly through concrete abutments. Theoretically, the ideal constant angle arch in a [...] "V"-shaped valley for such an arch dam has a <b>central</b> <b>angle</b> of 133° of curvature. This theory {{led to the development of}} the [...] "constant-angle" [...] (or variable radius) arch dam, which was also thinner in design. The theory was first initiated in North America for several dams, and in Alaska in particular, in 1913 with the building of the Salmon Creek Dam, which was completed in 1914. In this regard, Bartlett Lee Thane, the mining engineer, who made a lasting impact in the mining industry – in the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company – [...] was instrumental in introducing this design of thin arch dam with help from his former football team mates. Lars Jorgensen evolved the specific first design of the constant arch dam. However, AEL gives design credit to their then Chief Engineer Harry L. Wallenberg for the Salmon Creek Dam. The idea for building such a dam had been thought about 30 years earlier to economize on the use of construction material for building the dam. However, it was only in 1913 that the concept was transformed on ground by the pioneer mining engineer Thane.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{family of}} Euclidean triangles having some fixed {{perimeter}} and area {{can be identified}} with a subset of points on a nonsingular cubic plane curve, i. e., an elliptic curve; furthermore, if the perimeter and {{the square of the}} area are rational, then those triangles with rational side lengths correspond to rational points on the curve. We first recall this connection, and then we develop hyperbolic analogs. In the hyperbolic setting, the analogous plane curve is a quartic with two singularities at infinity, so the genus is still 1. We can add points geometrically by realizing the quartic as the intersection of two quadric surfaces. This allows us to construct nontrivial examples of rational hyperbolic triangles having the same inradius and perimeter as a given rational right hyperbolic triangle. 1. Euclidean Triangles and Cubic Curves Consider a Euclidean triangle ∆. The angle bisectors are concurrent in a point called the incenter. Furthermore, the distances from the sides of ∆ to the incenter are all equal, so this determines an inscribed circle, called the incircle. We define the inradius r to be the radius of the incircle. The inradii joining the incenter to the three intersection points of the incircle with ∆ determine three <b>central</b> <b>angles</b> α, β, γ, and three partial side lengths a, b, c, as in Figure 1 below. Figure 1. Euclidean Triangle with Angle Bisectors, Incircle, and Inradii The angle bisectors also bisect the <b>central</b> <b>angles,</b> so a = r tan(α/ 2) b = r tan(β/ 2) c = r tan(γ/ 2). 1 a...|$|R
