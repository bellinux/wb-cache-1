5|$|Millepora alcicornis, or sea ginger, is {{a species}} of colonial fire coral with a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton.</b> It is found on shallow water coral reefs in the {{tropical}} west Atlantic Ocean. It shows {{a variety of different}} morphologies depending on its location. It feeds on plankton and derives part of its energy requirements from microalgae found within its tissues. It is an important member of the reef building community and subject to the same threats as other corals. It can cause painful stings to unwary divers.|$|E
5|$|Embedded in the <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> are {{numerous}} microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E
60|$|The hardly less startling {{hypothesis}} that the Echinoderms are coalesced worms, on the other hand, appears {{to be open to}} serious objection. As a matter of anatomy, {{it does not seem to}} me to correspond with fact; for there is no worm with a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton,</b> nor any which has a band-like ventral nerve, superficial to which lies an ambulacral vessel. And, as a question of development, the formation of the radiate Echinoderm within its vermiform larva seems to me to be analogous to the formation of a radiate Medusa upon a Hydrozoic stock. But a Medusa is surely not the result of the coalescence of as many organisms as it presents morphological segments.|$|E

6000|$|Inasmuch as {{the growth}} of the reef depends upon that of {{successive}} generations of coral polypes, and as each generation takes a certain time to grow to its full size, and can only separate its <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> from the water in which it lives at a certain rate, {{it is clear that the}} reefs are records not only of changes in physical geography, but of the lapse of time. It is by no means easy, however, to estimate the exact value of reef chronology, and the attempts which have been made to determine the rate at which a reef grows vertically have yielded anything but precise results. A cautious writer, Mr. Dana,[125] whose extensive study of corals and coral reefs makes him an eminently competent judge, states his conclusion in the following terms:-- ...|$|E

50|$|Minute {{pelagic species}} in the phyla Foraminifera and Radiolaria also produce ornate <b>{{calcareous}}</b> <b>skeletons.</b> Many benthic mollusks have planktonic larvae called veligers that have calcareous shells, and these larvae are particularly vulnerable to changes in water chemistry; their shells are so thin that small changes in pH can have a large impact {{on their ability to}} survive. Some holoplankton (organisms that are planktonic for their full lives) have <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeletons</b> as well, and are even more susceptible to unfavorable shell deposition conditions, since they spend their entire lives in the water column.|$|R

50|$|Millepora tenera is {{a species}} of fire coral in the family Milleporidae. It is native to the Red Sea and the western Indo-Pacific region and is a zooxanthellate species with a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton.</b> It was first {{described}} in 1949 by the Dutch zoologist Hilbrand Boschma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strawberry}} anemone grows {{no larger}} than 2.5 centimeters. The anemone is always bright red with transparent to white tentacles that are bulbous at the tips. The strawberry anemone resembles sea anemones in that they lack a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton,</b> but are closer related to stony corals in that they lack basilar muscles.|$|E
50|$|Millepora dichotoma, the net fire coral, is {{a species}} of hydrozoan, {{consisting}} of a colony of polyps with a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton.</b> Part of the metabolism of the fire coral relies on zooxanthellae included in their anatomy. They are found from the Red Sea to Samoa and South Africa. They form fan-shaped colonies up to 60 cm across, but clumps may be several metres across. Coloured mustard to olive-yellow, the fans form in a single plane.|$|E

50|$|Antipathes dichotoma is {{a species}} of colonial coral in the order Antipatharia, the black corals, so named because their <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeletons</b> are black.

However, it was later found by Vacelet that sclerosponges occur in different classes of Porifera. That means that sclerosponges are not a closely related (taxonomic) group of sponges. Like bats and birds that independently developed the ability to fly, different sponges developed the ability to build a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> independently and during different times in Earth history. Fossil sclerosponges are already known from the Cambrian period.|$|E

50|$|The golden {{zoanthid}} is {{a colonial}} coral that grows in small irregular groups and linear rows that wind {{over the surface}} of its host sponge. It does not have a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> but the polyps are connected by a membranous basal connection. The polyps look like small sea anemones and are orange or bright yellow and about 0.6 cm in diameter. They have a slender column and up to twenty six long, thin, pale yellow tentacles. As much as half the surface of the sponge may be covered by the coral, which may consist of up to 200 polyps.|$|E

50|$|Increasing ocean {{acidification}} due to rises in carbon dioxide levels exacerbates the bleaching effects of thermal stress. Acidification affects the corals' {{ability to create}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeletons,</b> essential to their survival. A recent study from the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that with the combination of acidification and temperature rises, the levels of CO2 could become too high for coral to survive {{in as little as}} 50 years.|$|R
5000|$|Baerida is {{an order}} in the {{subclass}} of Calcaronea.They are Leuconoid Calcaronea with the skeleton either composed exclusively of microdiactines, or in which microdiactines constitute exclusively or predominantly a specific sector of the skeleton, such as choanoskeleton or atrial skeleton. Large or giant spicules are frequently present in the cortical skeleton, from which they can partially or fully invade the choanoderm. In sponges with a reinforced cortex, the inhalant pores can be restricted to a sieve-like ostia-bearing region. Dagger-shaped small tetractines (pugioles) are frequently the sole skeleton of the exhalant aquiferous system.

50|$|Some {{colonies of}} Porites astreoides are female {{while others are}} hermaphroditic. Sexual {{reproduction}} occurs with male gametes being released into the sea {{around the time of}} the new moon. The sperm gets drawn into other polyps where fertilization takes place. The larvae are initially brooded but are liberated into the sea at about the time of the full moon. The planula larvae then drift with the currents for some time before settling onto the seabed and metamorphosing into new polyps. Each of these grows into a new colony by secreting a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> and budding. This is initially extratentacular budding, taking place at the side of the polyp, but at a later stage in the development of the colony, the budding is intratentacular, taking place within the ring of tentacles.|$|E

40|$|Palaeozoic stromatoporoids are calcified sponges common between Middle Ordovician and Late Devonian {{times in}} reefs and related facies. Taxonomic work is well known, but {{controversial}} because {{of conflict between}} classification schemes based on the <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> versus spicules (which are almost completely lacking in Palaeozoic stromatoporoids); however, lower-level taxonomy (at genus-level) of the <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> is considered reliable to be applied in palaeobiological study. Knowledge of stromatoporoid ecology is poorly developed, such that comprehensive information is available {{for only a few}} case studies, in some Silurian and Devonian examples. Thus an overall understanding of stromatoporoid responses to environmental conditions has not yet been achieved, although stromatoporoids were likely able to deal with fine-grained sediment where they mostly occur. Many stromatoporoid genera have only certain growth forms, so future focus on the use of low-level taxonomy in ecological studies, by comprehensive sampling in high-resolution studies, may establish the relationships between stromatoporoids and their environments. Intergrown organisms and growth banding in stromatoporoids are aspects that have great potential in such work. Mineralogy of stromatoporoids remains poorly understood. Regardless of their apparent state of preservation (ranging from apparently well-preserved to complete loss of <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> features) all stromatoporoids are in fact substantially recrystallized. They underwent a peculiar diagenesis, whereby the <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton</b> and gallery cements of all stromatoporoids are overprinted by irregular elongated calcite crystals arranged normal to the growth laminations, most clearly visible in cross-polarized light. Stromatoporoids co-occur with mollusc shells that are always either fully recrystallized or dissolved (present as internal and external moulds); this difference means that while molluscs are likely under-represented in the fossil record, stromatoproids are not, providing confidence for palaeoecological work on their assemblages. Stromatoporoids lack characters which would readily classify them as being originally aragonite or low-Mg calcite; they may have been high-Mg calcite but the evidence is circumstantial. Their peculiar diagenetic fabric also has implications for the debate about the relationship between stromatoporoids and the concept of aragonite/calcite seas, which requires more work...|$|E
40|$|Stylasteridae is a hydroid family {{including}} 29 worldwide-distributed genera, all {{provided with}} a <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton.</b> They are abundant in shallow and deep waters and represent {{an important component of}} marine communities. In the present paper, we studied the evolution of ten morphological characters, currently used in stylasterid taxonomy, using a phyloge- netic approach. Our results indicate that stylasterid morphology is highly plastic and that many events of independent evolution and reversion have occurred. Our analysis also allows sketching a possible identikit of the stylasterid ancestor. It had <b>calcareous</b> <b>skeleton,</b> reticulate-granular coenosteal texture, polyps randomly arranged, gastrostyle, and dactylo- pore spines, while lacking a gastropore lip and dactylostyles. If the ancestor had single or double/multiple chambered gastropore tube is uncertain. These data suggest that the ancestor was similar to the extant genera Cyclohelia and Stellapora.

Similarities and differences observed in the micro- and nanostructures of the skeletons reflect those of the soluble organic matrices. Sulphur is mainly associated with sulphated acidic sugars. The role of sulphated sugars on the biomineralization processes is still underestimated.

Representative carbonate facies in a Series 3 (510 – 501 Ma) Cambrian to Tremadocian succession from western Newfound-land, Canada, and Ordovician successions from the Ibex area, Utah, USA, show that, on average, Cambrian and Tremadocian carbonates contain much less skeletal material than do post-Tremadocian sediments. Petrographic point counts of skeletal abundance within facies and proportional facies abundance in measured sections suggest that later Cambrian successions contain on average, 5 % skeletal material by volume, whereas the skeletal content of post-Tremadocian Ordovician sections is closer to, 15 %.
