5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair {{took the}} photographs of her body paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 Swimsuit Issue. No body painting pictures have been chosen as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E

5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E

5|$|Despite the low precipitation, Patagonia is cloudy, {{with the}} mean cloud cover ranging from 50% in eastern parts of Neuquén Province and {{northeast}} Río Negro Province to 70% in Tierra del Fuego Province; {{the region has}} one of the highest percentages of cloud <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> Argentina. In general, mountainous areas are the cloudiest, and coastal areas are cloudier than inland areas. Northern areas are sunnier (50% possible sunshine) than the southern parts of the region such as western Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego Provinces (less than 40% possible sunshine). The southernmost islands receive some of the lowest average annual sunshine hours in the world.|$|E

5|$|During her tour to Europe, Eva Perón was {{featured}} in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's caption–"Eva Perón: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow"–was {{a reference to the}} name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its <b>cover.</b> (<b>In</b> 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E

The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift {{back and forth between}} the two points in time.|$|E
5|$|In the Demi's Birthday Suit August 1992 {{issue of}} Vanity Fair, Moore was {{shown on the}} <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> the body {{painting}} photo by Joanne Gair. The painting is a memorable example of modern body painting artwork. It made Gair an immediate pop culture star as the most prominent body paint artist, which prompted consideration for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign. The 1992 cover, which required a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists, was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot, and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses.|$|E

Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related to a decline in forest <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae <b>cover.</b> <b>In</b> heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E

5|$|Snow science {{addresses}} how snow forms, its distribution, {{and processes}} affecting how snowpacks change over time.

The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow <b>cover.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.|$|E

Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity.
