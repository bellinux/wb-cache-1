It is important in generation, maturation migration, and accumulation of hydrocarbon, but the effects of overpressure on rock frame have not been investigated. In this study, experiments were carried out to study the effects of overpressure on rock frame structures using five core samples from the Junggar basin, Northwest China. The deformations and velocities for the samples were measured at different effective pressures related to non-equilibrium compaction and fluid expansion overpressure mechanisms. The results show that the effect of overpressure on rock frames gradually increases when the effective pressure drops down to a certain value (called critical pressure). Moreover, non-equilibrium <b>compaction</b> <b>mechanism</b> has more effects on rock frames than fluid expansion mechanism under the same effective pressure. Furthermore to study rock frame structural changes, we use Kuster and Toksoz's expressions to simulate the effective aspect ratios of inclusions alpha (penny shapes) for different effective pressures. The results show that the alpha decreases dramatically when the effective pressure decreases from the critical pressure. Changes of alpha can be interpreted as responses to the rock frame changes when grains conform one another by rotating and self-adjusting. However, different mechanisms of overpressure have different effects on rock frames. The rock frame can be affected. more easily by overpressure in shallow regions generated by non-equilibrium <b>compaction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Once this kind of rock frames are preserved after overpressure releases to a normal hydrostatic pressure, they can be identified by their specific rock frame characters.

40|$|AbstractThe histone-like {{nucleoid}} structuring protein (H-NS) is a nucleoid-associated protein, {{which is}} involved in both gene regulation and DNA compaction. H-NS can bind to DNA in two different ways: in trans, by binding to two separate DNA duplexes, or in cis, by binding to different sites on the same duplex. Based on scanning force microscopy imaging and optical trap-driven unzipping assays, it has recently been suggested that DNA compaction may result from the antagonistic effects of H-NS binding to DNA in trans and cis configurations. To get more insight into the <b>compaction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> we constructed a coarse-grained model description of the compaction of bacterial DNA by H-NS. These simulations highlight the fact that DNA compaction indeed results from the subtle equilibrium between several competing factors, which include the deformation dynamics of the plasmid and the several binding modes of protein dimers to DNA, i. e., dangling configurations, cis- and trans-binding. In particular, the degree of compaction is extremely sensitive to the difference in binding energies of the cis and trans configurations. Our simulations {{also point out that}} the conformations of the DNA-protein complexes are significantly different in bulk and in planar conditions, suggesting that conformations observed on mica surfaces may differ significantly from those that prevail in living cells...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{strength of}} learning classifier systems (LCSs) {{lies in the}} combination of genetic optimization techniques with gradient-based approximation techniques. The chosen approximation technique develops locally optimal approximations, such as accurate classification estimates, Q-value predictions, or linear function approximations. The genetic optimization technique is designed to distribute these local approximations efficiently over the problem space. Together, the two components develop a distributed, locally optimized problem solution {{in the form of}} a population of expert rules, often called classifiers. In function approximation problems, the XCSF classifier system develops a problem solution in the form of overlapping, piecewise linear approximations. This paper shows that XCSF performance on function approximation problems additively benefits from: 1) improved representations; 2) improved genetic operators; and 3) improved approximation techniques. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel closest classifier matching mechanism for the efficient compaction of XCS's final problem solution. The resulting <b>compaction</b> <b>mechanism</b> can boil the population size down by 90 % on average, while decreasing prediction accuracy only marginally.

In addition, however, 2 D-SAXS measurements revealed local variations in the effective direction in which compaction occurred, with significant radial components observed near the die walls.
