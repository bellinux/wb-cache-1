A useful method is presented for measuring the coefficient of friction between granular material and vibratory conveyor. Experiments were performed in order to verify the point mass theory.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effects of the removal of pesticide residues and microorganisms from yuja (Citrus junos Sieb ex Tanaka) using a surface-washing system, under the following washing conditions: 0. 11, 0. 42, and 0. 73 m/s spray rotation speeds; 0. 6, 0. 9, and 1. 2 MPa water pressure and 0. 046, 0. 092, and 0. 138 m/s conveying speeds. Tap-water treatment was used as the control. The washing efficiency when using squid ink was highly correlated with the <b>conveying</b> <b>speed</b> and the spray rotation speed. In addition, the highest washing efficiency was achieved when the water pressure was 0. 9 MPa. The microorganisms were reduced to 0. 40 log CFU/g for the tap-water treatment, and all the treatments, except those at the <b>conveying</b> <b>speed</b> of 0. 138 m/s and the spray rotation speed of 0. 11 rpm (6. 07 log CFU/g), produced higher removal efficiencies compared with the tap-water treatment. Reductions of 2. 20 and 2. 05 log CFU/g were achieved at the spray rotation speeds of 0. 42 and 0. 73, respectively. The largest reductions were observed when the <b>conveying</b> <b>speed</b> was 0. 046 m/s. Higher pesticide residue removal efficiency values were obtained at slower conveying speeds and higher spray rotation speeds. Higher than 50 % removal efficiency was achieved when the spray rotation speed was 0. 046 m/s for spirodichlofen, deltamethrin, benomyl, thiophanate-methyl, and acequinocyl. Especially, the removal efficiency for benomyl and thiophanate-methyl was more than 90 %. It can thus be concluded that the pesticide residues in yuja can be effectively reduced by washing the latter with a less-than- 0. 092 -m/s <b>conveying</b> <b>speed</b> and a higher-than- 0. 42 -m/s spray rotation speed.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the most important}} problems in ceramic industrial processes is the atomized slip conveying. Currently conveyor belts pick up the material from the bottom of spray dryer and they rise up it to stocking silos. By conveyor belts, the atomized slip crosses the working environment, so fine particles spread out causing dust pollution and generating dangers for workers' health (silicosis). The paper describes an innovative atomized slip pneumatic conveying to solve this problem. The software simulator "TPSimWin" is able to foresee thermo-hygrometric and fluid-dynamical parameters that give the characteristics request by the specific working process. The attention of this paper will be focused on fluid­-dynamical characteristics of the pneumatic conveying: both solid maximum <b>conveying</b> <b>speed</b> and speed gradient (i. e. the variation of solid's speed, in m/s, for unit length of pipe), need to be limited to guarantee wholeness of product. So the TPSimWin Software gives the necessary solid dynamic information to design correctly the pneumatic conveying plant. The outputs it gives are diagrams that show, step by step along the pipeline, the behaviour of air speed, solid speed, solid speed gradient and air pressure. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce an innovative solution for the transport of atomized slip, taking in consideration the critical problem of material degradation and showing a solution to solve it.

Their superior strength and stiffness to mass ratio made them the number one material for achieving high performance. Especially continuous fibre reinforced plastics allow {{for the construction of}} structures which are custom tailored to their mechanical loads by adjusting the paths of the fibres to the loading direction. The two main constituents of CFRP are carbon fibres and matrix. Two possibilities for matrix material exist: thermosetting and thermoplastic matrix. While thermosetting matrix may yield better properties with respect to thermal loads, thermoplasticity opens a wide range of applications due to weldability, shapabilty, and compatibility to e. g. injection moulded thermoplastic materials. Thin (0. 18 mm) thermoplastic continuous fibre CFRP tapes with a width of 100 mm were examined using air-coupled ultrasound. Transducers were arranged in reflection as well as transmission setup. By slanted incidence of the ultrasound on the tape surface, guided waves were excited in the material in fibre direction and perpendicular to the fibre direction. Artificial defects – fibre cuts, matrix cuts, circular holes, low velocity impacts from tool drop, and sharp bends – were produced. Experiments on a stationary tape showed good detectability of all artificial defects by guided waves. Also the effects of variation in material properties, fibre volume content and fibre matrix adhesion being the most relevant, on guided wave propagation were examined, to allow for quality assessment. Guided wave measurements were supported by destructive analysis.

40|$|Slug-flow {{pneumatic}} conveying is a full-bore mode of flow within the dense-phase flow regime where bulk materials are transported {{in the form}} of slugs at <b>conveying</b> <b>speeds</b> below saltation velocity. The mechanism of slug-flow {{pneumatic conveying}} consists of the particles being picked up from the stationary bed in front of a moving slug while the same amount of material is deposited behind the slug. Stress field modeling of the material slug {{is the first step in}} developing a prediction model for the pressure drop along a pneumatic conveying line. However, a reliable prediction strongly relies on an accurate assessment of several factors, including the particle properties, pipeline dimensions, and operating conditions. So far, the particle diameter has always been one of the crucial parameters, which is not desirable in regards to the limitations it imposes on the choice of bulk materials. This article focuses on one parameter, the stress transmission coefficient kw, which relates the lateral wall stress within a slug of material to the axial stress. To date, this parameter could not be measured directly in an aerated material bed and had to be estimated. Inaccuracies within the prediction were therefore unavoidable. A newly designed test chamber now enables the measurement of the lateral and axial stresses within a slug, which leads directly to this stress transmission coefficient. This article outlines the design of the test apparatus and reports on the experimental results. For the two materials tested, an exponential correlation between the pressure on top of the slug (frontal stress) and the stress transmission coefficient was obtained. Calculating the wall friction coefficient leads to a constant value above a certain material-specific air velocity...|$|R

Series creator Gene Roddenberry wanted the ship's design to <b>convey</b> <b>speed,</b> power, a [...] "shirt sleeve" [...] working environment, and readiness for a multiyear mission. Roddenberry insisted the ship not have fins or rockets; Jeffries also avoided repeating fictional designs from Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, along with the real-world space exploration work done by Boeing, Douglas Aircraft Company, Lockheed Corporation, NACA, NASA, and Northrop. With Roddenberry's speed requirement, Jeffries decided the ship needed to be instantly recognizable from a distance, and that <b>speed</b> could be <b>conveyed</b> by the ship starting small {{in the background and}} growing as it accelerates toward the camera. Jeffries imagined the ship's engines were so powerful they would be dangerous to be near, hence the pair of external warp nacelles. Jeffries initially designed the habitable portion of the ship as a sphere, but it conflicted with the need to suggest the ship's speed. Although Jeffries wanted to avoid the cliche of a [...] "flying saucer", the saucer-shaped upper portion of the hull eventually became part of the final design. Jeffries kept the exterior as plain as possible, both to allow light to play across the model and to suggest that the ship's vital equipment was on the interior, where it could be more readily maintained and repaired. Looking at an early balsa and birchwood model of the Enterprise, Roddenberry thought the vessel would look better upsidedown, and a TV Guide cover once depicted it as such; ultimately, however, the show used Jeffries' arrangement. The saucer module, engineering hull, and twin warp nacelle design influenced producers' designs of Starfleet vessels throughout the franchise's spin-offs and films.|$|R
