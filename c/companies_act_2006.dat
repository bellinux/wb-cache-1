25|$|Companies House is the United Kingdom’s {{registrar}} {{of companies}} {{and is an}} executive agency and trading fund of Her Majesty's Government. It falls under the remit of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and {{is also a member}} of the Public Data Group. All forms of companies (as permitted by the United Kingdom Companies Act) are incorporated and registered with Companies House and file specific details as required by the current <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006.</b> All registered limited companies, including subsidiary, small and inactive companies, must file annual financial statements in addition to annual company returns, which are all public records.

25|$|The United Kingdom {{company law}} regulates {{corporations}} formed under the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006.</b> Also {{governed by the}} Insolvency Act 1986, the UK Corporate Governance Code, European Union Directives and court cases, the company is the primary legal vehicle to organise and run business. Tracing their modern history to the late Industrial Revolution, public companies now employ more people and generate more of wealth in the United Kingdom economy than {{any other form of}} organisation. The United Kingdom was the first country to draft modern corporation statutes, where through a simple registration procedure any investors could incorporate, limit liability to their commercial creditors in the event of business insolvency, and where management was delegated to a centralised board of directors. An influential model within Europe, the Commonwealth and as an international standard setter, UK law has always given people broad freedom to design the internal company rules, so long as the mandatory minimum rights of investors under its legislation are complied with.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the profit be directly made from the fiduciary position, merely {{in a way that}} causes a conflict between the fiduciary's personal interests and his duties. If a trustee was informed by the trust's stockbroker that only one parcel of highly sought-after stocks remained and chose to purchase it for himself rather than for the trust, he would be taking advantage of the trust and causing a conflict of interest. On the second issue, Boardman confirmed a defence of authorisation; if the fiduciary has informed the beneficiaries that he is and will be acting on his own behalf, and received permission to do so, the property would not have been held on constructive trust. The third issue is who does the fiduciary owe duties to. In Boardman the case was concerning a trust, and it was held that the duties were towards the beneficiaries. Section 170 of the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> provides that in situations concerning companies, the duties of the directors and other fiduciaries are to that company.|$|E

25|$|Companies {{limited by}} shares also acquire finance through ‘equity’ (a synonym for the share capital). Shares differ from debt in that {{shareholders}} rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders’ residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) {{they are capable}} of diversifying their portfolio. Taxation of profits on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to extra dividends, but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise. For anyone to become a member of a company under the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so. However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is more a matter of standard practice than law. It is legally possible to {{become a member of the}} company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members’ register. It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share, but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with preferential dividend rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency – it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company’s constitution.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} {{that it will be}} rarely the case that charities can be removed from the register and it will be even rarer for both the governing instrument ofa charity and its property to be removed. The research methods employed included a review of literature, case law and experience drawn from working as a lawyer at the Charity Commission from 1988 - 1993 and subsequently in private practice to the present day. In Chapter 6 documentary analysis was undertaken when examining the issue of removal from the register in the context of Charity Commission inquiries through an examination of inquiry reports over a two-year period between 2003 - 2004. The research methods used have been followed with a view to securing an upto- date objective analysis ofthe law {{as it relates to the}} removal of charities from the register and then an analysis of the Charity Commission's approach to the removal of charities from the register.

5000|$|Because of {{the sheer}} volume of {{companies}} involved, the transition to a new legislative framework was accomplished over a two-year transition period. To protect the offshore business, the British Virgin Islands abolished both income tax and stamp duty on all transactions except those relating to land in the Territory. Then the government enacted the BVI Business <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> (No 16 of 2004). The slightly cumbersome name was designed to slightly reflect the name of the earlier statute and cash-in on the [...] "IBC brand" [...] which had grown under the former legislation. From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 the two Acts ran in parallel, and it was possible to incorporate a company under either form of legislation. from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2006, one could no longer incorporate a company under the International Business <b>Companies</b> <b>Act,</b> and all new incorporations had to be conducted under the BVI Business <b>Companies</b> <b>Act.</b> During <b>2006</b> detailed transitional provisions were enacted to allow companies formed under the old legislation to adapt to the new legislation without having to significantly amend their constitutional documents.|$|R
2500|$|Directors {{appointed}} to the board form the central authority in UK companies. In carrying out their functions, directors (whether formally appointed, de facto, or [...] "shadow directors") owe a series of duties to the company. There are presently seven key duties codified under the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> sections 171 to 177, which reflect the common law and equitable principles. These may not be limited, waived or contracted out of, but companies may buy insurance to cover directors for costs {{in the event of}} breach. The remedies for breaches of duty were not codified, but follow common law and equity, and include compensation for losses, restitution of illegitimate gains and specific performance or injunctions.|$|E
2500|$|While it has {{not been}} the norm, {{employee}} participation rights in corporate governance have existed in many specific sectors, particularly universities, and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first [...] "codetermination" [...] laws in the world. However, as many of those Acts were updated, the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> today still has no general requirement for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 28 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation. At board level, UK company law in principle allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but voluntary measures have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees' financial risk. Crucially, the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> section 168 defines [...] "members" [...] as those with the ability to vote out the board. Under section 112 a [...] "member" [...] is anybody who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. A company could write its constitution to make [...] "employees" [...] members with voting rights under any terms it chose.|$|E
2500|$|In {{practice}} {{very few}} derivative claims were successfully brought, given {{the complexity and}} narrowness in the exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle. This was witnessed {{by the fact that}} successful cases on directors' duties before the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> seldom involved minority shareholders, rather than a new board, or a liquidator in the shoes of an insolvent company, suing former directors. The new requirements to bring a [...] "derivative claim" [...] are now codified in the <b>Companies</b> <b>Act</b> <b>2006</b> sections 261-264. Section 260 stipulates that such actions are concerned with suing directors for breach of a duty owed to the company. Under section 261 a shareholder must, first, show the court there is a good prima facie case to be made. This preliminary legal question is followed by the substantive questions in section 263. The court must refuse permission for the claim if the alleged breach has already been validly authorised or ratified by disinterested shareholders, or if it appears that allowing litigation would undermine the company's success by the criteria laid out in section 172. If none of these [...] "negative" [...] criteria are fulfilled, the court then weighs up seven [...] "positive" [...] criteria. Again it asks whether, under the guidelines in section 172, allowing the action to continue would promote the company's success. It also asks whether the claimant is acting in good faith, whether the claimant could start an action in her own name, whether authorisation or ratification has happened or is likely to, and pays particular regard to the views of the independent and disinterested shareholders. This represented a shift from, and a replacement of, the complex pre-2006 position, by giving courts more discretion to allow meritorious claims. Still, the first cases showed the courts remaining conservative. In other respects the law remains the same. According to Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2), minority shareholders will be indemnified for the costs of a derivative claim by the company, even if it ultimately fails.|$|E

It admits that {{there is a lack of}} instruments likely to allow stakeholders to react when faced with the non-compliance of the duty that falls upon directors, to have regard to their interests. It considers that the enlightened shareholder value is at the crossroads, between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, and concludes that any solutions to the enforcement problem of corporate social responsibility involve necessarily instruments of corporate governance.

São referidas as alterações recentemente ocorridas no Direito português das sociedades, particularmente no que diz respeito ao regime de deveres fundamentais dos gestores. É analisada a nova disciplina dos deveres de lealdade e o conceito de interesse social à luz das teorias da maximização do lucro e do (novo) “interesse social iluminado”, ambas desenvolvidas no círculo jurídico anglo-americano. Trata-se o problema da (alegada) incoercibilidade do dever de prosseguir, nestes termos, o interesse social, mais especificamente da ausência de mecanismos que permitam aos stakeholders exigir o seu cumprimento.
