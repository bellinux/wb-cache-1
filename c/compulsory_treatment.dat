25|$|The Mao Zedong {{government}} is generally credited with eradicating both consumption {{and production of}} opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform. Ten million addicts were forced into <b>compulsory</b> <b>treatment,</b> dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region. The remnant opium trade primarily served Southeast Asia, but spread to American soldiers during the Vietnam War, with 20 percent of soldiers regarding themselves as addicted during {{the peak of the}} epidemic in 1971. In 2003, China was estimated to have four million regular drug users and one million registered drug addicts.|$|E
25|$|Both {{voluntary}} and compulsory {{drug treatment programs}} are provided in China, although the <b>compulsory</b> <b>treatment</b> is more common. Most addicts who attend these centers do so involuntarily upon orders from the Government. Voluntary treatment is provided at centers operated by Public Health Bureaus, but these programs are more expensive and many people cannot afford to attend them. Addicts, who return to drug use after having received treatment, and who cannot be cured by other means, may be sentenced to rehabilitation at {{any one of the}} special centers for re-education through labor. These centers are run under conditions similar to prisons, including isolation from the outside world, restricted patient movement and a paramilitary routine.|$|E

500|$|According to Fedor Kondratev, {{an expert}} of the Serbsky Center and {{supporter}} of Snezhnevsky {{and his colleagues}} who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s, those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes. It was they who began to be searched for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for <b>compulsory</b> <b>treatment</b> to a special psychiatric hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization {{as a result of}} the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the [...] "exclusively scientific" [...] concept of Marxism–Leninism. This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization. In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave [...] "in a different way than others do" [...] not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience. It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] of his dissent. Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer <b>compulsory</b> <b>treatment</b> [...] "for it" [...] in special psychiatric hospitals. What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their [...] "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks. Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>Compulsory</b> {{community}} <b>treatment</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce preventable deaths from physical disorders-these causes being up to 10 times more common than suicide in psychiatric patients. We investigated whether this was mediated by better access to specialized medical procedures. Method: All patients on <b>compulsory</b> community <b>treatment</b> for over 11 years were compared with matched control subjects using linked administrative health data from Western Australia (state population of about 2. 24 million). Outcomes were access to revascularization and other specialized procedures at 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year follow-up. Logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, prior health service use, diagnosis, and length of psychiatric history. Results: There were 2757 patients and 2687 control subjects (total n = 5444). Sixty-five per cent were males (n = 3522), and the average age was 36 years (SD 13. 2). Most had schizophrenia or other nonaffective psychoses (74 %), followed by affective disorders (26 %). At 2 -year follow-up, 2 % (n = 53) of patients and 2. 6 % (n = 69) of control subjects had undergone a specialized intervention. <b>Compulsory</b> community <b>treatment</b> did not result in greater access to specialized procedures at all 3 time points even after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions: Greater access to specialized procedures does not explain the reduced mortality from preventable physical illness that had been reported in patients on community treatment orders. There must be other explanations for this finding, such as mental health staff facilitating access to chronic disease management in primary care. This warrants further research...|$|R
