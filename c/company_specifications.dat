A {{very basic}} {{version of the}} globally obsolete Suzuki Alto CA71 (Maruti 800 in India and Nepal), with a 796 cc engine, manufactured by Pak Suzuki Motors under the chassis code SB308. The car has long been retired in all other countries and Pakistan {{is the only country}} where it remains in production to date. It was discontinued in the European and Japanese markets in 1988. The Mehran was sold as bi-fuel petrol/CNG since 2006 to early 2012. (The option of CNG was dropped from the entire Suzuki line-up due to government ban on CNG kits and cylinders.). It received minor facelifts in 1998 and again in 2004. However, the car still lacks basic safety features such as rear window demister, airbags, abs and even rear seat belts. The Mehran received a basic EFi Engine in July 2012 to comply with government regulation adopting the outdated Euro-II emissions standard. It was the same old F8B engine with single point fuel injection. The fuel ignition system was also upgraded to CDI, reducing the cost and downtime associated with the replacement of breaker points as routine maintenance. As per user reviews, the upgraded engine provided improved power delivery, throttle response, acceleration and fuel economy, though <b>company</b> <b>specifications</b> were never changed to reflect this. Users who installed aftermarket CNG kits also availed increased CNG fuel economy due to the CDI distributor. (The same engine upgrade was also implemented on the Suzuki Ravi and Suzuki Bolan who share the same engine. This made Pakistan the last car producing country to shift entirely from carburetted engines to EFi). Mehran is currently available in VX or VXR equipment levels. It had again received a mild facelift with an asymmetric grille at the same time with the introduction of the EFi engine. It has [...] CNG has been reintroduced for Mehran in September 2015, although the availability of CNG in Pakistan remains limited due to severe shortages.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the costs and turn around times {{experienced}} with outsourcing starch analysis in finished feed products, the company decided {{to invest in a}} NIR instrument to carry out such analyses in house. The particular instrument purchased by the company comes with a build in calibration for specific finished feed products and the main objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether the instrumentation and build in calibration gives reliable analyses of a finished poultry feed. The results obtained showed that : - The NIR results obtained have a positive bias compared to the theoretical (formulation specified value) and also to the value obtained by enzymatic starch analysis. - Despite the positive bias, the starch values were well within the allowable limits - Repeatability measurements on the data generated by two different analysts showed that while the percentage relative standard deviations obtained (< 1. 0 percent) were well within the <b>company</b> <b>specifications</b> of percentage RSD < 5. 0 percent, the inter sample repeatability showed small, but significant variation. - The results for intermediate precision showed that there is no statistically significant difference between the results obtained by two different analysts, nor was there any difference in the results of the same samples analysed at different time periods. - Reproducibility could not be evaluated {{due to the lack of}} another instrument within the company that were similarly set up as the instrument used for the investigation. This investigation has shown that, given the restrictions enforced by the build incalibration of the NIR instrument, the use of NIR for the analyses of the finished feed product is valid, but will require that careful attention be paid to data collection procedures...|$|E

40|$|Whether {{large or}} small, {{companies}} can take certain {{steps to ensure}} reliable shot peening specifications for the gears they process. Learn how in this first of a two-part article. I By Mark Lawerenz, lmants Ekis S hot peening is widely recognized as proven, cost-effective process to enhance the fatigue characteristics of metal parts and eliminate the problems of stress-corrosion cracking. Forming and texturizing are added benefits. Though shot peening is widely used today, the means of specifying process parameters and controlling documents for process control are not widely understood. Many design and materials engineers continue {{to ask questions about}} shot size, intensity and blueprint specification to assure a high quality and repeatable shot peening process. Many existing internal <b>company</b> <b>specifications</b> are adequate, but many are not because they have not been updated to coincide with the improvements in shot peening technology over the past years. Companies considering creation of an in-house specification for gears or interested in revising an existing specification should consult a knowledgeable shot peening authority. Forsmallercompanies and those that lessfrequently specify theshot peening process, good specifications that {{can be used as a}} refer-ence are readily available. Two of these are Military Standard MILS- 131 65 - 8 and AMS 2430. Shot peening is an effective tool for combating fatigue and stress-corrosion cracking, as well as assisting in forming and shape correction. By definition, shot peening is the bombardment of the surface of a material by small spherical media (the shot) to produce a thin layer of high magnitude residual (or self) compressive stress. This residual or self stress is introduced into a material prior to any actual applications of loads to a component. The magnitude and depth of these compressive stresses are predictable. As shown in Figure 1, 5 the maximum compressive stress usually occurs at some distance below the peened surface, which is represented by the top horizontal line...|$|E
