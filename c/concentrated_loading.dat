The results showed that sandstone plate instability presented four phases: small deformation elastic stage, brittle fracture arching stage, rock-arch bearing stage, and rock-arch instability stage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Damage {{initiation}} {{is modeled}} in singly oriented ply (SOP) Fiber Metal Laminate (FML) under <b>concentrated</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. The {{finite element method}} (FEM) is used based on the first order shear deformation theory for modeling damage initiation in SOP FML. The failure indices of the fiber prepreg and the metal laminate were calculated using the Tasi–Hill failure criterion and the Miser yield criterion respectively. To verify the model, failure analysis was conducted under uniaxial loading and cylindrical bending, then under <b>concentrated</b> <b>loading.</b> Results show that the model is good. An indentation test was then conducted to compare the damage initiation load with the calculated failure index. The test was conducted under two side clamped conditions in order to study the fiber orientation effect. The indentation curve was fitted using the Hertz equation, and the damage initiation load {{was defined as the}} point of divergence of the fitted curve from the real indentation curve. The damage initiation loads were obtained for various fiber orientations and were compared with the calculated failure index. The experiment results closely matched the calculated failure index. It follows that the present method accurately captures damage initiation of SOP FML...|$|E

40|$|The plane-strain {{problem of}} a moving crack at the {{interface}} of two dissimilar magnetoelectroelastic (MEE) materials is investigated. Assuming that the crack moves at a constant speed in the subsonic regime, a fracture analysis of a finite crack under <b>concentrated</b> <b>loading</b> imposed onto the crack face is first carried out. By applying magnetoelectric (ME) permeable boundary conditions at the crack face, a combined Dirichlet-Riemann problem is formulated and solved analytically. The expressions for the fracture parameters, including the relative length of the contact zone and field intensity factors (FIFs), are obtained in the analytical form. A crack of a semi-infinite length with a contact zone under <b>concentrated</b> <b>loading</b> is further presented as a specific case examined with the obtained solution.
