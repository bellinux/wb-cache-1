In this paper polymeric dyes are classified as crosslinking polymeric dyes, disperse polymeric dyes, “fiber-reactive ” polymeric dyes and acidic polymeric dyes.

Crosslinking polymeric dyes showed excellent fixation (reaching 99 %); disperse polymeric dyes showed excellent light fastness (8 grade); “fiber-reactive” polymeric dyes could form a chemical covalent bond with fiber, exhibited excellent washing fastness; acidic polymeric dyes showed the same fastness properties as the corresponding monomeric dyes, furthermore thermal stability was enhanced.

40|$|In this paper, a facile {{approach}} of dyeing polyamide (PA) fabric by using C. I. Reactive Blue 19 dye and simultaneously modifying it with titanium dioxide precursor under hydrothermal condition is developed. The anthraquinone-based Reactive Blue 19 dye, {{which is more}} resistant to biodegradation owing to its fused aromatic structure compared to azo based one, is utilized as a model compound in this research to demonstrate the photodegradation effect of TiO 2 on reactive dyes. It is shown that a layer of TiO 2 nanoparticles is homogeneously coated on fiber surfaces and their particle sizes are smaller than those remaining in the residual dyeing liquors. The crystallinity and optical property of the resultant PA fabrics are changed due to this hydrothermal-dyeing process. In comparison with the solely dyed PA fabrics, the PA fabrics dyed and simultaneously modified with anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles exhibit better <b>color</b> <b>fastnesses</b> against artificial light (Xenon) while maintain similar grades of <b>color</b> <b>fastnesses</b> against washing with soap, wet scrubbing, dry cleaning as well as dry/wet rubbing. While changes in the tensile strength, elongation and water absorbency of the resultant PA fabrics were not found, the addition of tetrabutyl titanate in the dyeing liquor is proved to facilitate the reaction of reactive dye with PA fabric and the resultant PA fabric shade. More interestingly, it is noticed that the residual dyeing liquor can be photodegradated after 50 mins of either UV or visible light irradiations, and the dyeing wastewater can thus be released eco-friendly to the environment...|$|R

Both crystal modifications are more thermodynamically stable than the α crystal phase. The γ crystal modification is characterized by a criss-cross lattice where each quinacridone molecule hydrogen-bonds to four neighbors via single H-bonds.

The aim {{of this research is}} to determine colors obtained from sage with different mordants and these <b>colors</b> <b>fastness</b> values such as light, friction, wet and dry water drop fastness, and to form a color catalogue. Firstly, 15 dyeings were done with several mordants at a rate of 3 % according to wool weight and one dyeing was done without mordant. As a result of these dyeing processes, it was determined that copper sulfate and potassium-bicromate mordants gave the best colors. Therefore, 14 dyeings were done by mixing copper sulfate (Cs) mordant with the other mordants at the equal ratio. The same process was applied with potassium-bicromate (Pbc) mordant. Totally 44 dyings were done with the colors obtained from these dyeings and a color catalogue was formed. Obtained colors which are used mostly in carpets were green, dried rose, brown and their tones. The light fastness values of the colors obtained from sage were generally between 1 and 6, friction fastness values were generally between 1 - 2 and 4 - 5. The water drop wet fastness values were generally between 3 and 5, and the water drop dry fastness values were generally between 4 - 5 and 5.
