40|$|Emerging {{high speed}} {{networks}} will carry traffic for {{services such as}} video-on-demand and video teleconferencing [...] that require resource reservation along the path on which the traffic is sent. High bandwidth-delay product of these networks prevents <b>circuit</b> <b>rerouting,</b> i. e. once a circuit is routed on a certain path, the bandwidth taken by this circuit remains unavailable for the duration (holding time) of this circuit. As a result, such networks will need effective routing and admission control strategies. Recently developed online routing and admission control strategies have logarithmic competitive ratios {{with respect to the}} admission ratio (the fraction of admitted circuits). Such guarantees on performance are rather weak in the most interesting case where the rejection ratio of the optimum algorithm is very small or even 0. Unfortunately, these guarantees can not be improved {{in the context of the}} considered models, making it impossible to use these models to identify algorithms th [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A general {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of the interconnections of analog circuits respecting high-level constraints on performances is described in this work. In our approach, sensitivities of performances to parasitics are computed, and a set of bounding constraints for parasitics is determined. Sensitivities are then used to generate the weights for a new cost function-driven analog area router. After the routing is completed, the actual values of critical parasitics are used to check if the user-defined constraints on circuit performances are met. If the requirements have not been satisfied, the bounding constraints generated on the parasitics are used to increase the weights associated to the parasitics which violated the constraints, and the <b>circuit</b> <b>rerouted.</b> Results are reported validating the effectiveness of this approach for layout-design automation of analog circuits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{considers}} rerouting and minimization of incurred disruption due to rerouting in a wide-area all-optical wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) {{network with}} random circuit arrivals and departures. One limitation {{of such a}} network is the wavelength continuity constraint imposed by the all-optical cross-connect switches which do not allow a circuit {{to be placed on}} a nonwavelength-continuous route. Wavelength rerouting is proposed to rearrange certain existing circuits to create a wavelength-continuous route in order to accommodate a new circuit. To reduce the disruption period, move-to-vacant wavelength-retuning (MTV-WR) is used as the basic operation of circuit migration, in which a circuit is moved to a vacant wave-length on the same path, and parallel MTV-WR rerouting is used to <b>reroute</b> multiple <b>circuits.</b> An optimal algorithm is developed to minimize the weighted number of <b>rerouted</b> <b>circuits</b> with parallel MTV-WR rerouting. In our test network, wavelength rerouting can effectively alleviate the wavelength continuity constraint by reducing call blocking probability an average of 30 % while reducing the number of <b>rerouted</b> <b>circuits</b> and the disruption period. 1...|$|R
50|$|Fast {{automatic}} restoration (FASTAR) is {{an automated}} fast response system developed and deployed by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1992 for the centralized restoration of its digital transport network. FASTAR automatically <b>reroutes</b> <b>circuits</b> over a spare protection capacity when a fiber-optic cable failure is detected, hence increasing service availability {{and reducing the}} impact of the outages in the network. Similar in operation is real-time restoration (RTR), developed and deployed by MCI and used in the MCI network to minimize the effects of a fiber cut.|$|R

By rewiring the electronics of a digital camera, glitched images are produced {{in a manner}} that parallels chemically processing unexposed film or photographic paper to produce photographic images without exposure to light. The DCP Series of Digital Images are direct visualizations of data generated by a digital camera as it takes a picture. Electronic processes associated with the normal operations of the camera, which are usually taken for granted, are revealed through an act of intervention. The camera is turned inside足out through complexes of short足circuits, selected by the artist, transforming the camera from a picture taking device to a data capturing device that renders raw data (electronic signals) as images. In essence, these images are snap足shots of electronic signals dancing through the camera's <b>circuits,</b> manually <b>rerouted,</b> written directly to the on足board memory device. Rather than seeing images of the world through a lens, we catch a glimpse of what the camera sees when it is forced to peer inside its own mind...|$|R
40|$|Rerouting for a {{circuit-switched}} wavelength-division-multiplexed {{all-optical network}} is considered in this paper. Due to the wavelength continuity constraint, a new connection may be blocked even if bandwidth is available between {{the origin and}} the destination. Rerouting can make the available bandwidth wavelength-continuous by changing the routes of certain existing connections to accommodate the new connection. To avoid disruptions of existing connections, Move-To-Vacant Wavelength-Retuning (MTV_WR) is proposed as the basic operation of circuit migration, in which a circuit is moved to a vacant wavelength on the same path, and the Parallel MTV_WR rerouting scheme is considered to <b>reroute</b> multiple <b>circuits</b> on disjoint sets of links. We design the optimal algorithm which minimizes the weighted number of <b>rerouted</b> <b>circuits</b> with the Parallel MTV_WR rerouting scheme. Numerical results using simulation show that rerouting can effectively reduce the blocking probability due to the wavelength continuity constraint while minimizing the incurred disruptions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{designed}} topologies for DC-AC inversion {{with both}} voltage buck and boost capabilities are mainly focused on two-level circuitries with extensions to three-level possibilities left nearly unexplored. Contributing {{to this area}} of research, this paper presents {{the design of a}} number of viable buck-boost three-level inverters that can also support bidirectional power conversion. The proposed front-end circuitry is developed from the Cuk-derived buck-boost two-level inverter, and by using the ldquoalternative phase opposition dispositionrdquo modulation scheme, the buck-boost three-level inverters can perform distinct five-level line voltage and three-level phase voltage switching by simply controlling the active switches located in the designed voltage boost section of the circuits. As a cost saving option, one active switch can further be removed from the voltage boost section of the <b>circuits</b> by simply <b>rerouting</b> the gating commands of the remaining switches without influencing the AC output voltage amplitude. To verify the validity of the proposed inverters, MATLAB/PLECS simulations were performed before a laboratory prototype was implemented for experimental testing. ...|$|R
