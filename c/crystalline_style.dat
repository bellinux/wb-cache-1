50|$|A gastric shield is {{an organ}} in the {{digestive}} tract of bivalves, tusk shells, and some gastropods against which a <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> typically rotates, in an action resembling that of a mortar and pestle.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 85 - 87) Over 1, 000 bivalve mollusks, representing eighteen genera and twenty-two species, {{were collected}} in four years from twenty geographical sites from Santa Barbara, California to San Diego, California, and their <b>crystalline</b> <b>styles</b> were examined for bacteria. The giant spirochete, cristispira, was widely distributed among bivalves from all types of habitats, open and protected sandy beaches, rocky shores and estuaries, regardless of the season. In any one habitat, certain species never harbored Cristispira. The occurrence of Cristispira was neither correlated with the taxonomy of the bivalves, nor with the types of <b>crystalline</b> <b>styles.</b> The incidence of Cristispira was greater in small than in large specimens of Tivela Stultorum. Most bivalves were maintained successfully in sea water tanks and continued to possess <b>crystalline</b> <b>styles,</b> but certain bivalve species lost Cristispira during captivity. Small Spirochetes were often present in <b>crystalline</b> <b>styles,</b> while rod-shaped bacteria were rarely seen...|$|R
40|$|Thirty adult Angelwing clams, Pholas orientalis, (89. 78 ± 6. 60 g wet weight; 118. 13 ± 2. 92 mm {{standard}} length) were acclimated in {{the laboratory}} for 7 d, randomly segregated into 3 groups which were exposed to different photoperiod regimes (24 h light, 12 h light - 12 h dark, 24 h dark). After 7 d, the clams were sacrificed and their <b>crystalline</b> <b>styles</b> excised and the digestive enzymes α-amylase, CMcellulase, agarase, laminarinase and protease were assayed. All the digestive enzymes, amylase, cellulase, agarase, laminarinase and protease exhibited significantly the highest activities when the clams were exposed to 24 h darkness for 7 d and those exposed to continuous artificial light or to equal light and dark hours exhibited lower activities but {{were not significantly different}} from each other...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{sequence}} analysis of 16 S rRNA genes {{was used to}} determine the phylogenetic relationship of the genus Cristispira to other spirochetes. Since Cristispira organisms cannot presently be grown in vitro, 16 S rRNA genes were amplified directly from bacterial DNA isolated from Cristispira cell-laden <b>crystalline</b> <b>styles</b> of the oyster Crassostrea virginica. The amplified products were then cloned into Escherichia coli plasmids. Sequence comparisons of the gene coding for 16 S rRNA (rDNA) insert of one clone, designated CP 1, indicated that it was spirochetal. The sequence of the 16 S rDNA insert of another clone was mycoplasmal. The CP 1 sequence possessed most of the individual base signatures that are unique to 16 S rRNA (or rDNA) sequences of known spirochetes. CP 1 branched deeply among other spirochetal genera within the family Spirochaetaceae, and accordingly, it represents a separate genus within this family. A fluorescently labeled DNA probe designed from the CP 1 sequence was used for in situ hybridization experiments to verify that the sequence obtained was derived from the observed Cristispira cells...|$|R
50|$|A style, {{sometimes}} referred to as a <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> (though there are no other biological kinds), is a rod made of glycoprotein located in the midgut of most bivalves and some gastropods which aids in extracellular digestion. It consists of a protein matrix coated with digestive enzymes secreted by the style sac in the animal's stomach. When feeding, its projecting end is scraped against the stomach wall and abraded, thus releasing the enzymes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crystalline</b> <b>styles</b> (digestive organs) of bivalve mollusks {{provide the}} habitat for highly motile bacteria. Styles from freshly-collected oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were studied by {{electron}} microscopy; Cristispira spirochetes were abundant in these organs. Detailed study reveals these spirochetes {{to be among}} the most complex prokaryotic cells known. More than 600 periplasmic flagella and an adhering outer lipoprotein membrane (e. g., a 270 degrees sillon) form the ultrastructural basis for the "crista," first described by light microscopy. Unique rosette structures corresponding to the "chambers" or "ovoid inclusions" of light microscopy were detected at the periphery of all protoplasmic cylinders. Polar organelles and linearly aligned flagellar insertions are conspicuous. In size and complexity, Cristispira more resembles Pillotina, Diplocalyx, Clevelandina and Hollandina (large spirochetes symbiotic in termites) than it does Treponema. Cristispira pectinis (Gross, 1910), the type species; Spirillum ostrea (Noguchi, 1921); and another, less frequent bacterial symbiont are the predominant inhabitants of the dense style matrix.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of the present work was to study {{the effect of the}} harmful alga Alexandrium minutum on the daily rhythm of the oyster Crassostrea gigas. Many metabolic and physiological functions are rhythmic in living animals. Their cycles are modeled in accordance with environmental cycles such as the day/night cycle, which are fundamental to increase the fitness of an organism in its environment. A disruption of rhythmic activities is known to possibly impact the health of an animal. This study focused in C. gigas, on a gene known to be involved in circadian rhythmicity, cryptochrome gene (CgCry), on putative clock-controlled genes involved in metabolic and physiological functions, on the length cycle of the style, a structure involved in digestion, and on the rhythmicity of valve activity involved in behavior. The results indicate that daily activity is synchronized at the gene level by light:dark cycles in C. gigas. A daily rhythm of valve activity and a difference in <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> length between scotophase and photophase were also demonstrated. Additionally, A. minutum exposure was shown to alter cyclic activities: in exposed oysters, gene transcription remained at a constant low level throughout a daily cycle, valve opening duration remained maximal and <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> length variation disappeared. The results show that a realistic bloom of A. minutum clearly can disrupt numerous and diverse molecular, physiological and behavioral functions via a loss of rhythmicity...|$|E
40|$|An {{infectious}} pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) {{belonging to}} the Sp serotype, isolated from scallops Pecten maximus, was propagated and suspended in sterile water and cell culture medium with different salinities and incubated at temperatures ranging from - 80 to 40 degrees C. Virus stability was examined by measuring virus titers under different storage conditions. Virus titers were also measured after repeated freezing and thawing, and in incubated sterile filtered scallop hepatopancreas, haemolymph and <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> samples, and salmon Salmo salar kidney homogenate. The virus was stable under most storage conditions. Temperatures ranging from - 80 to + 20 degrees C, as well as salinities from 0 to 40 parts per thousand, {{did not seem to}} influence the stability of the virus. A reduction was observed above 20 degrees C. Each freezing and thawing procedure resulted in a reduction of the virus titer. This reduction was larger at - 80 than at - 20 degrees C. The IPNV persisted for a long period in sterile filtered scallop haemolymph, dissolved <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> and hepatopancreas. In kidney homogenate from IPNV-infected salmon the virus titers were reduced at least 10 -fold during the first day of incubation at all temperatures tested. When virus was propagated in cell culture and subsequently mixed with non-infected salmon kidney homogenate, the virus proved more persistent.

The tubules of Venerupis are synchronized and exhibit a monophasic cycle completed within a twelve-hour period, facilitating feeding at the next cycle of the tide. The digestive process of Chlamys requires twenty-four hours and to accommodate feeding at each twelve-hour tidal cycle the tubules within the diverticula exhibit two different digestive phases simultaneously so that a diaphasic cycle is apparent.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{digestive}} physiology of molluscs {{is essential for}} understanding their ecological niches, {{as well as for}} their conser-vation and aquaculture.

The lengths of the CS, shell lengths, shell widths and shell heights of the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis, collected from seven sampling sites in southern coastal waters of Peninsular Malaysia, were measured. The lengths of CS {{in relation to}} shell length, shell width and shell height were 72 - 73 %, 211 - 218 % and 154 - 157 %, respectively. The correlation analysis indicated that the length of CS is positively and significantly (P< 0. 001) correlated to the shell length (R= 0. 81), shell width (R= 0. 82) and shell height (R= 0. 64). The percentages of the CS length to the shell parameters could be potentially used to identify the different mussel species since different mussel species have a specific CS length to the shell length.

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of heavy metal bioavailabilities and contamination {{in the marine}} environment by the Mussel Watch Program has been proposed {{in order to maintain}} the coastal environment at a sustainable level. This study focused on the heavy metal concentrations in different parts of P. viridis collected from Kuala Perlis (Perlis), Kg.

40|$|Separation of the {{proteins}} comprising the <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> of the mussel Choromytilus meridionalis (Krauss) by anion exchange chromatography {{shows that there}} are three fractions displaying α-amylase activity in both warm- and cold-acclimated mussels. These fractions correspond with one or more proteins which remain unbound to the resin (Peak I), a bound fraction which is eluted at 100 – 150 mM NaCl (Peak II) and a further fraction which is eluted at 200 – 250 mM NaCl (Peak III) but which may represent contamination carried over from Peak II. Cold-acclimation to 8 °C results in the appearance of a fourth α-amylase fraction (Peak IV) which is eluted from the column between 300 – 400 mM NaCl. Thermal acclimation also results in changes in the activities of Fractions I–IV such that a specific activity of 0. 47 mg glucose liberated per A 280 unit of protein per 8 min incubation at 8 °C in Fraction IV is increased nearly 10 -fold to a specific rate of 4. 10 in protein Fraction I following acclimation to 22 °C.

40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{histology}} {{of the stomach}} and digestive diverticula and the physio-logy of digestion in the Nuculidae have been investigated. The stomach is relatively large and possesses a well-developed style sac, although a rod-like <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> is absent. Sorting areas {{are present in the}} dorsal region of the stomach but the ciliary currents are relatively weak and have little effect on the ingested material. The digestive diverticula consist of three regions, the physiological relations of which have not been fully elucidated. The three regions are: (a) a much-branched system of non-ciliated main ducts, the epithelium of which shows a well-developed brush-border; (J) short, unbranched ciliated secondary ducts; (c) irregularly branched blindly ending tubules. The epithelium of the tubules is divided into two regions, one composed of large cells containing numerous conspicuous granules and the other of less frequent and smaller darkly staining cells. Each darkly staining cell bears a single flagellum. Separate mucous glands cannot be demonstrated in any part of the stomach or digestive diverticula. The epithelium of the style sac secretes an amylase and a lipase. Extracts of the digestive diverticula contain an amylase, a lipase, and a protease. Unlike the majority of lamellibranchs, fluid and solid particles do not appear to enter the digestive diverticula from the stomach and in no part of the gut or of the diverti-cula is there ever any evidence of intracellular digestion. It is suggested that in the Nuculidae digestion is exclusively extra-cellular and confined to the stomach. The soluble products are absorbed by the epithelium of the stomach and first part of the intestine. The diverticula {{of the rest of the}} Lamellibranchia are compared with those of the Nuculidae.

These two prominent schools have developed very different poetic styles. Chang Chi is a major poet of the time who associates with both groups, yet he manages to retain his own uniqueness. Chang's poetic works include many yueh-fu titles with realistic themes, which display his profound thoughts and his elegant, <b>crystalline</b> <b>style.</b> He is particularly good at expressing intimate human concerns. By employing a simple yet refined poetic language, he has made clear and objective sketches of the hardships of common people's lives in the early ninth century. He has also left lucid and beautiful poems written in the "recent style," in which natural phenomena are strongly correlated with human feelings. My approach to Chang Chi's poetry is both historical and thematic. In studying the topoi of Chang's poetry, I first investigate the source and history of each theme and then compare Chang's works with his predecessors'. Chapter 1 provides a biographical study of Chang Chi's life, using available biographical and literary sources. In addition, I discuss the editions of Chang Chi's poetry collection. Chapter 2 deals with some of Chang Chi's major thematic concerns as reflected mainly in his yueh-fu poetry, such as social injustice brought on by incessant wars and repressive taxation.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{nature of}} the <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> in the lamellibranchs has interested observers from quite early times. Nelson (1918) gives an excellent summary of the opinions held on the subject up {{to the time of}} the publication of his paper and concludes that the style is â€œ¿a structure of colloid nature resembling mucin. â€• The view that the constitution of the material of the styje resembles that of mucin seems to have originatedwith Barrois (1889), who showed in the case of Cardium that it behaved like a globulin in respect of its solubility and chemical reactions, but also had the property of yieldinga reducing substance on hydrolysiswith diluteacid. In the absence of carbohydrate substances capable of yieldinga sugar on hydrolysis he concluded that this indicated the presence of mucin or chondrin. This conclusionis quoted in some of the early papers in which the constitution of the style of other lamellibranchs is discussed (e. g., List, 1902, in the case of Mytilus, and Yonge, 1926, in that of Ostrea), but without presentation of any further evidence. More re cently reference to mucin is omitted and the substance of the style is regarded as â€œ¿aprotein of a globulin natureâ€ • (Yonge, 1931 and 1932). Previously to undertaking the present work I had myself completely confirmed Barrois ' observations {{in the case of a}} number of species, but his conclusion did not seem justified in the absence of more complete knowledge of the {{nature of the}} reducing substancesresultingfrom the hydrolysis of the style material. Any glucoprotein would, for instance, react in the manner indicated and no case is made out for mucin or chondrin in particular. A good deal of confusion existed as to the respective meanings of these two terms untilthe matter was clarifiedby the work of Levene and his co-workers (1922).

40|$|Histological and ultrastructural studies {{describing}} {{early life}} history stages of freshwater unionid bivalves and studies evaluating impacts of chemical contaminants on early growth are lacking. This study examined larval and juvenile shell ultrastructure of Lampsilis ventricosa using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (with observations of Pleurobema cordatum), described morphology of internal organs of laboratory-reared L. ventricosa and evaluated effects of cadmium on juvenile survival, growth and development. Postmetamorphic (juvenile) shell was added to peripheral edges of the larval shell. Initial juvenile shell growth was rapid and coincided with shell deposition into larval shell pores. Glochidia metamorphosed while encapsulated on gills of fish hosts. Presumptive digestive organs, gills, mantle, foot, and nervous system were present prior to excystment. Digestive glands were filled with lipid bodies. At release the stomach had differentiated into an anterior gastric portion and a posterior style sac. Subsequent developments in the alimentary tract consisted of intestinal elongation, further elaboration of ciliary sorting areas and ciliary linings, and ventral shift in alignment of the style sac. After 2 weeks, digestive glands were devoid of lipid bodies. Diverticulation of digestive glands began at 3 weeks. Gill filaments were added posteriorly, by papillary outgrowths, beginning at approximately 3 weeks. Ciliature of frontal gill surfaces consisted of distinct lateral, frontal and laterofrontal ciliary tracts. At juvenile excystment, the foot is ciliated ventrally and covered with microvilli dorsally. By 8 weeks, the byssus complex was formed. Acute toxicities (48 -h) of cadmium to laboratory-reared larval and juvenile L. ventricosa were evaluated. Young juvenile stages were more sensitive than older juvenile or larval stages. Growth and histopathological effects of cadmium on juvenile L. ventricosa were evaluated using a 7 -d static renewal test. Morphometric analyses of the shell revealed significant reductions in growth of anterior juvenile shell. Histopathological alterations appeared more severe for mantle, ganglia and digestive gland tissues as compared to foot and muscle tissue. Exposures to 30 - 100 [mu]g Cd/L resulted in dissolution of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> in several juveniles.

A cristispira was found in various numbers in Ostrea virginiana, Venus mercenaria, and Modiola modiolus, but none in Ensis americana, Mya arenaria, Mactra solidissima, Pecten irradians, Mytilus edulis, Fulgur canaliculatus, or Nassa obsoleta. Of 298 oysters, only 128 showed the crystalline styles, in which cristispiras were present in 99. Active cristispiras were found in 59 styles only and degenerated forms in the remaining 40. In 110 clams (Venus mercenaria) 70 styles were found, and only 8 of these contained cristispiras; 5 yielded active and the other 3 degenerated cristispiras. In 97 modiolas there were 73 styles, only 4 of which contained cristispiras. The physical properties of the crystalline styles of these shellfish varied considerably. The styles of the oysters were moderately soft, and when exposed to the air or mixed with sea water they underwent liquefaction, forming a clear, viscid material. The styles from clams and modiolas were opaque and were more firm, not easily crushed even in a mortar. The styles of the scallops were the most solid of all the styles examined. It happened that the softer the styles, the more frequent was the occurrence of the cristispira; in fact, no cristispira was detected in styles other than those of oysters, clams, and modiolas, of which oysters had the softest styles and {{the largest percentage of}} cristispira invasion. The following observations were made regarding the structure of the cristispira found in oysters. The body is a long, flexible cylinder, with blunt extremities, towards which the diameter gradually diminishes. In motion the body rapidly stretches and contracts, forming in the contracted state several serpentine undulations. A membranous appendage (Gross' crista) winds about the body throughout its entire length. The inner margin is in connection with the body, the outer margin is free and is distinctly heavier. The latter is undulatory; that is, the width of the membrane, or crista, is narrower at some points than at others. The membrane is composed of numerous fine fibrils running in a roughly parallel or slightly oblique course, showing interwoven narrow meshes; at the outer margin there is a dense smooth ridge. The contour of the body is highly refractive, as if possessing a cell membrane. The interior structure, as revealed by dark-field illumination, is an almost homogeneous, less refractive substance, but there are present minute highly refractive granules more or less symmetrically arranged. There is no definite cross-bar or chambered structure. On the other hand, when vital staining with brilliant cresyl blue is applied, there appear numerous paired masses of lavender hue at fairly regular intervals, suggesting the cross-bar aspect of a stained specimen. In a few specimens there was seen a dim outline of cross-bar effect. Neutral red, Bismarck brown, and crystal violet all bring out deeply stained granules and reticular structure but no definite cross-bars. The crista is a fibrillar structure, connected with the body at its inner edge. The outer margin is a thickened bundle of fibrils running an undulating course along {{the entire length of the}} crista. The crista is elastic and when detached from degenerated organisms assumes a rather regularly wound spiral, consisting of longitudinal bundles of fibrils (Figs. 36 to 38). A fragment of two or three waves may be encountered in a preparation containing many degenerated organisms (Fig. 39). The composition of the crista can best be studied in degenerated remains of the organism. During the life of Cristispira it is stretched or relaxed according to the contraction or extension of the body. The elasticity of the crista appears to furnish the organism with a propelling and rotating power upon its extension after being drawn tightly to the body by some contractile apparatus (myoneme) present somewhere within the cell body. The crista serves as a rudder and propeller for the swimming organism. It is interesting to compare here the elastic and regularly waved flagella of certain bacteria and spirochetes; it is possible that the crista of Cristispira is a highly modified form of flagella. The nature of the substance which stains dark blue with Giemsa's stain is not known, but it does not give a chromatin reaction. By Heidenhain's iron-hematoxylin method it takes a dark grayish tint, similar to the cell wall or crista, which are also dark gray. This substance was regarded by Gross and Zuelzer as volutin, which is of nutritive origin. It is probable that there are also embedded within it minute chromidial elements. Multiplication is by transverse fission. Cristispira balbianii is parasitic and does not survive more than a few days in ordinary sea water emulsion, even at its optimum temperature. In its natural habitat, or the <b>crystalline</b> <b>style,</b> it is usually pure, but is sometimes found in association with a tiny spiral organism (Spirillum ostreæ). The cristispiras in the styles seem to diminish rapidly when oysters are collected from their beds and transferred elsewhere; oysters kept in tanks or cars for several days do not contain the cristispiras, and in opened oysters the styles disappear promptly at room temperature. All efforts to cultivate this organism have failed...|$|E
40|$|Solen cylindraceus is an infaunal filter-feeding bivalve inhabiting the {{intertidal}} mud {{banks of}} many southern African estuaries. It is particularly {{abundant in the}} Kariega estuary (33 ° 41 'S; 26 ° 42 'E) where it reaches densities of 4 OOm⁻² (l 92 g shell-free dry wt. m⁻²). The Kariega is a permanently open, marine dominated estuary about 18 km in length, and S. cylindraceus is most abundant in its middle and upper reaches. Some physical characteristics of the estuary (temperature, salinity, sediment and water turbidity) are described, and the possible role of these factors in determining the density and distribution of S. cylindraceus within the Kariega estuary, is discussed. The structure of the alimentary system, gills and labial palps of S. cylintfraceus is described, all of which showed no major variation from the "typical" eulamellibranchiate form. Solen cylintfraceus {{was found to be}} a euryhaline osmoconformer with a salinity tolerance range of 15 - 65 %. When animals were removed from their burrows, osmotic equilibration of the haemolymph was rapid (1 - 2 hours). By contrast, in animals left undisturbed in their burrows, osmotic equilibration was retarded (72 - 204 hours). It is suggested that the observed decrease in the rate of change of haemolymph osmolarity for animals in their burrows is linked to the stability of the interstitial salinity. A temperature tolerance range of 5 - 44 °C was determined for S. cylintfraceus (in situ), in which prolonged exposure to 5 °C and 40 - 45 °C (12 - 36 hours respectively) resulted in a decreased burrowing ability, coma and death. Animal burrowing responses were not affected by temperatures in the range 15 - 35 °C. Field experiments were carried out over several tidal cycles, in which the measurement of <b>crystalline</b> <b>style</b> volume was used as a means of assessing extracellular digestive activity. No major variation in style volume was recorded and it appeared that S. cylindraceus did not exhibit any cyclical pattern of style dissolution and regeneration. It is suggested that S. cylindraceus feeds continuously from the water column during high tide and possibly within its burrow, at or below the water table, during low tide. At a suspensoid concentration of 5 Omg l⁻¹, S. cylindraceus was found to filter water almost continuously (90 - 95 % of the time). Time spent filtering dropped to 68 % at 100 mg l⁻¹ and 32 % at 500 mg l⁻¹. Filtration rates for summer collected animals (25 °C) were 22. 86 ± 4. 36 ml min. ⁻¹, some 3 ml min. ⁻¹ greater than that recorded for winter (16 °C) collected animals. Filtration rate may be expressed as a function of shell length by the equations: y= 0. 247 x¹̇⁰⁶⁶ (winter) and y= 0. 758 x⁰̇⁸²⁶ (summer). Solen cylindraceus was capable of acclimating its filtration rate to both high and low temperatures under laboratory conditions. Filtration rate exhibited a thermal optimum in the range 15 - 35 °C, declining at higher and lower temperatures. Q₁₀ values of filtration decreased rapidly from greater than 4 to less than 2, when the thermal optimum was reached. Maximum rates generally occurred at approximately 5 °C above the temperature to which the animal had been acclimated. Optimal filtration rates (19 - 23 ml min. ⁻¹) were recorded in the salinity range 15 - 45 %. When subjected to abrupt changes in salinity, filtration rates were immediately depressed. The extent and duration of these decreased filtration rates were dependent upon the magnitude and direction of salinity change, and were always less in animals exposed to hyper- than hyposaline conditions. Animals exposed to increased temperature and simultaneous elevated or unchanged salinity, showed a slight increase in filtration rate followed by rapid acclimation. A decrease in both temperature and salinity resulted in an initial decrease in filtration rate and a longer acclimation period. The ability of S. cylindraceus to acclimate fully within a wide temperature and salinity range, and to filter maximally in hypersaline conditions may, in part, explain its unusually high abundance in the Kariega estuary, despite it being close to the southernmost limit of the animal's geographical distribution. No significant difference in flItration rate was recorded at suspensoid concentrations of 5 - 100 mg]" 1 However, at 250 and 500 mg l⁻¹ filtration rates decreased significantly, and coincided with increased levels of pseudofaecal production. Solen cylindraceus retained particles down to 2. 5 - 3. 0 µm with great efficiency (ca. 60 - 90 % efficiency). Below this particle size, retention efficiency decreased rapidly and a net production of particles was recorded below 1. 51 µm. Particle retention was independent of temperature (15 and 25 °C) and salinity (15 and 35 %). Use was made of stable carbon isotope analyses (¹³C/¹²C ratios) in an attempt to determine the important food sources of S. cylindraceus within the Kariega estuary. The results obtained demonstrated an enrichment in Þ¹³ values for S. cylindraceus from the upper (- 27. 9 %) to the middle (- 25 %c) and lower (- 21. 6 %o) reaches of the estuary, with no seasonal variation apparent. The bivalve was substantially more depleted in ¹³C relative to the dominant aquatic macrophytes Zostera capensis (- 9. 1 to - 15. 6 %o) and Spartina maritima (- 12. 5 %o). The use of Þ¹³ alone, however, to unequivocally "pin point" specific food sources of a filter feeder in a predominantly detritus based food web, is limited. It is suggested that in the Kariega estuary, riparian litter and other terrestrially derived vegetation contribute to the carbon pool. A possible contribution of ¹³C depleted food sources via chemoautotrophic and/or anaerobic pathways, to the diet of S. cylindraceus, is suggested. ...|$|E
