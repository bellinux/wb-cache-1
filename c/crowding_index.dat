40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} orbital apex crowding volume measurements calculated with multidetector-computed tomography to detect dysthyroid optic neuropathy. METHODS: Ninety-three patients with Graves' orbitopathy were studied prospectively. All of the patients underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmic examination and computed tomography scanning. Volumetric measurements were calculated from axial and coronal contiguous sections using a dedicated workstation. Orbital fat and muscle volume were estimated {{on the basis of}} their attenuation values (in Hounsfield units) using measurements from the anterior orbital rim to the optic foramen. Two indexes of orbital muscle crowding were calculated: i) the volumetric <b>crowding</b> <b>index,</b> which is the ratio between soft tissue (mainly extraocular muscles) and orbital fat volume and is based on axial scans of the entire orbit; and ii) the volumetric orbital apex <b>crowding</b> <b>index,</b> which is the ratio between the extraocular muscles and orbital fat volume and is based on coronal scans of the orbital apex. Two groups of orbits (with and without dysthyroid optic neuropathy) were compared. RESULTS: One hundred and two orbits of 61 patients with Graves' orbitopathy met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Forty-one orbits were diagnosed with Graves' orbitopathy, and 61 orbits did not have optic neuropathy. The two groups of orbits differed significantly with regard to both of the volumetric indexes (p< 0. 001). Although both indexes had good discrimination ability, the volumetric orbital apex <b>crowding</b> <b>index</b> yielded the best results with 92 % sensitivity, 86 % specificity, 81 %/ 94 % positive/negative predictive value and 88 % accuracy at a cutoff of 4. 14.

40|$|The {{association}} between lobe connections {{and the degree}} of lobe crowding and radial growth was studied in thalli of the foliose lichen Xanthoparmelia conspersa. In 35 thalli, 15 % of the lobes were not physically connected to either of their neighbours before the lobes merged into the centre of the thallus. Twenty-five percent of the lobes were connected in pairs and 29 % in groups of three. Approximately 5 % of the lobes were interconnected in larger groups of six or more. The mean number of lobes per group in a thallus was positively correlated with thallus diameter and with the degree of lobe growth variation but was unrelated to annual radial growth rate (RGR). The degree of crowding of the lobes in a thallus was defined as a 'crowding index', viz., the product of lobe density and mean lobe width. <b>Crowding</b> <b>index</b> increased rapidly with size in smaller thalli but changed less with size in larger thalli. <b>Crowding</b> <b>index</b> was positively correlated with RGR but was unrelated to lobe growth variation. Lobes removed from large thalli and glued in various configurations to simulate different degrees of crowding did not demonstrate an {{association between}} lobe crowding and RGR over one year. These results suggest that the pattern of lobe connectivity of a thallus is associated with lobe growth variation in X. conspersa.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the complex {{interaction}} between attention, fixation, and one species of change blindness. The two main interpretations of the target phenomenon are the ‘blindness’ interpretation and the ‘inaccessibility’ interpretation. These correspond to the sparse view (Dennett 1991; Tye, 2007) and the rich view (Dretske 2007; Block, 2007 a, 2007 b) of visual consciousness respectively. Here I focus on the debate between Fred Dretske and Michael Tye. Section 1 describes the target phenomenon and the dialectics it entails. Section 2 explains how attention and fixation weigh in these debates, and argues that Dretske’s hyper-rich view fails precisely because he overlooks certain effects of attention and fixation. Section 3 explains why Tye’s view is also unsatisfying, mainly because he misconceives the degree of access. Section 4 then puts forward the positive model covariance, which has it that the degree of cognitive access tracks the degree of phenomenology, and contrasts it with Block’s view on the Sperling iconic memory paradigm. The paper ends with a discussion of levels of seeing, which involve <b>crowding,</b> <b>indexing,</b> and other visual phenomena.

40|$|Abstract—Providing {{evidence}} for the refutation of a property is an essential, if not the most important, feature of model checking. This paper considers algorithms for counterexample generation for probabilistic CTL formulas in discrete-time Markov chains. Finding the strongest evidence (i. e., the most probable path) violating a (bounded) until-formula is shown to be reducible to a single-source (hop-constrained) shortest path problem. Counterexamples of smallest size that deviate most from the required probability bound {{can be obtained by}} applying (small amendments to) k-shortest (hop-constrained) paths algorithms. These results can be extended to Markov chains with rewards, to LTL model checking, and are useful for Markov decision processes. Experimental results show that, typically, the size of a counterexample is excessive. To obtain much more compact representations, we present a simple algorithm to generate (minimal) regular expressions that can act as counterexamples. The feasibility of our approach is illustrated by means of two communication protocols: leader election in an anonymous ring network and the <b>Crowds</b> protocol. <b>Index</b> Terms—Diagnostic feedback, Markov chain, model checking, regular expression, shortest path.

Underlying the success of crowdsourc-ing is a common theme — the microtask.

There are mainly two aspects of limitations in the existing clustering ensemble approaches.

Secondly, they generally focus on the instance level or cluster level in the ensemble system and fail to integrate multi-granularity cues into a uni-fied model.

40|$|Abstract—Occlusion {{and lack}} of {{visibility}} in crowded and cluttered scenes {{make it difficult to}} track individual people correctly and consistently, particularly in a single view. We present a multiview approach to solve this problem. In our approach, we neither detect nor track objects from any single camera or camera pair; rather, evidence is gathered from all of the cameras into a synergistic framework and detection and tracking results are propagated back to each view. Unlike other multiview approaches that require fully calibrated views, our approach is purely image-based and uses only 2 D constructs. To this end, we develop a planar homographic occupancy constraint that fuses foreground likelihood information from multiple views to resolve occlusions and localize people on a reference scene plane. For greater robustness, this process is extended to multiple planes parallel to the reference plane in the framework of plane to plane homologies. Our fusion methodology also models scene clutter using the Schmieder and Weathersby clutter measure, which acts as a confidence prior, to assign higher fusion weight to views with lesser clutter. Detection and tracking are performed simultaneously by graph cuts segmentation of tracks in the space-time occupancy likelihood data.

The ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity were analyzed and the predictive ability of ED occupancy rate in terms of the 1 -hour later and 2 -hour later diversion status was examined. ResultsA total of 8, 728 data points together with their corresponding ambulance diversion status were analyzed. The ED occupancy rate was found to be moderate associated with ambulance diversion status (area under curve, AUC = 0. 84, p = 0. 004). When the sensitivity was fixed at 91 %, the specificity was 60 % and the corresponding ED occupancy rate was 1. 25. ED occupancy rate was also associated with 1 -hour and 2 -hour later diversion status having AUCs of 0. 83 and 0. 82, respectively. ConclusionThis study suggests that ED occupancy rate, a simple index that can be easily implanted into any hospital information system, has the potential to become an universal ED <b>crowding</b> <b>index</b> and offers the opportunity for international comparison...|$|E
40|$|Background: Informal {{employment}} {{is common in}} developing countries, including Egypt. This type of employment may have significant consequences on mental health. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of common mental disorders and substance abuse among temporary hired hospital cleaners. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 242 adult temporary cleaners and 209 permanent cleaners working in 4 governmental hospitals in Zagazig City, Sharqia Governorate, Egypt. All participants were invited to complete a structured questionnaire through a semi-structured interview which included the self-reporting questionnaire 20 items (SRQ- 20) and the work stress scale. Assessment of drug use included urine-based screening tests for common substances abused. Results: The prevalence of job stress, common mental disorders and substance abuse, particularly tramadol and cannabis (Bango), was significantly higher in the studied temporary cleaners compared to permanent cleaners. Risk factors associated with increased susceptibility of the temporary cleaners to common mental disorders were family history of substance abuse, high <b>crowding</b> <b>index,</b> history of physical illness, low educational level, and smoking; while being unmarried, male sex, family history of mental disorder, age ≥ 40 years, smoking, and length of service ≥ 8 years, were associated with substance abuse among the same group. Conclusion: Temporary hired hospital cleaners suffered from impaired mental health more than permanent cleaners. Therefore, expanding the coverage of current laws and {{occupational safety and health}} standards to cover workers in the informal sector especially in developing countries is recommended. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{prevalence}} of asthma {{is high in}} urban areas of many Latin-American countries where societies show high levels of inequality and different levels of development. This study aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between asthma symptoms prevalence in adolescents living in Latin American urban centers and socioeconomic and environmental determinants measured at the ecological level. Asthma prevalence symptoms were obtained from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) phase III. A hierarchical conceptual framework was defined and the explanatory variables were organized in three levels: distal, intermediate, proximal. Linear regression models weighed by sample size were undertaken between asthma prevalence and the selected variables. Asthma prevalence was positively associated with Gini index, water supply and homicide rate, and inversely associated with the Human Development <b>Index,</b> <b>crowding</b> and adequate sanitation. This study provides evidence of the potential influence of poverty and social inequalities on current wheezing in adolescents in a complex social context like Latin America...|$|R
40|$|An entomological {{study of}} triatomine species {{was carried out}} to assess their {{prevalence}} in 10 localities {{of the state of}} Michoacán, Mexico. Entomological indices were calculated to estimate the risk for vector-borne transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi to the human population in this area. Four triatomine species (Triatoma barberi, Triatoma dimidiata, Meccus pallidipennis and Meccus longipennis) were collected from the study area. This is the first report of M. longipennis and T. dimidiata in Michoacán. M. pallidipennis was significantly (p < 0. 05) more abundant {{than any of the other}} species collected in the study area. Infection indices were greater than 50 % for each of the four collected triatomine species. Significantly more triatomines were collected from intradomiciliary areas than from peridomiciliary or sylvatic areas. Infestation, <b>crowding</b> and density <b>indices</b> were low, whereas colonisation indices were high in five localities. The current vectorial conditions in the study area require continuous entomological and serological surveillance to diminish the risk of T. cruzi transmission to human populations...|$|R
40|$|Asthma is an {{important}} public health problem in urban Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the role of socioeconomic and environmental factors as potential determinants of asthma symptoms prevalence in children from Latin American (LA) urban centers. We selected 31 LA urban centers with complete data, and an ecological analysis was performed. According to our theoretical framework, the explanatory variables were classified in three levels: distal, intermediate, and proximate. The association between variables in the three levels and prevalence of asthma symptoms was examined by bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis weighed by sample size. In a second stage, we fitted several linear regression models introducing sequentially the variables according to the predefined hierarchy. In the final hierarchical model Gini <b>Index,</b> <b>crowding,</b> sanitation, variation in infant mortality rates and homicide rates, explained great part {{of the variance in}} asthma prevalence between centers (R(2) = 75. 0 %). We found a strong association between socioeconomic and environmental variables and prevalence of asthma symptoms in LA urban children, and according to our hierarchical framework and the results found we suggest that social inequalities (measured by the Gini Index) is a central determinant to explain high prevalence of asthma in LA...|$|R
