5|$|The National Museum of African Art is the Smithsonian Institution's African art museum, {{located on}} the National Mall of the United States capital. Its {{collections}} include 9,000 works of traditional and <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> from both Sub-Saharan and Arab North Africa, 300,000 photographs, and 50,000 library volumes. It was the first institution dedicated to African art in the United States, and remains the largest collection. The Washington Post called the museum a mainstay in the international art world and the main venue for <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Okay Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display of a popular artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E
500|$|... 1:54 is {{an annual}} <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> fair held in London during the October Frieze Week since 2013. It was {{organized}} {{to improve the}} representation of <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in worldwide exhibitions, and is the foremost art fair dedicated to <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in the primary art market. By 2016, the show had become {{three times the size}} of the original exhibition with 130 artists represented. A spin-off, pop-up show, 1:54 NY, has been held annually in New York City during the May Frieze New York since 2015. Critics have described 1:54 as a highlight of the Frieze event, and wrote that the show's publicity for <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> outweighs the issues of lumping disparate geographic traditions together. The fair's representation from African galleries has improved as the international market for African art expands.|$|E

500|$|... 1:54 is a <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> fair held {{annually}} in London, beginning in 2013. As of 2015, 1:54 {{is the only}} art fair dedicated to <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in the primary art market. Its name refers to the 54 countries that compose the African continent, expressed as a ratio ("one continent: 54 countries"). Moroccan curator Touria El Glaoui, daughter of the artist Hassan El Glaoui, organized the fair to improve the representation of <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in worldwide art exhibitions. Representation of non-Western countries in the contemporary art world has lagged behind that of other countries. Representation of African countries, in particular, improved alongside the continent's economic growth. El Glaoui said that the continent {{did not have a}} single art scene, and that there was great diversity between African nations. Accordingly, as in the fair's title, 1:54 tries to preserve rather than homogenize the differences between each country's histories and cultures. In starting the fair, its founder was supported and advised by the British Council, the Francophonie, and partners ArtReview, Beaux Art magazine, and Art.sy. For each edition, the 1:54 organizers ask themselves [...] "what is necessary, what can be achieved, how [...] do something different". The fair's organizers choose exhibitors based on proposal submissions and the firms' reputation and plans. Travel visa issues have also affected whether invitees ultimately attend.|$|E
500|$|The next year, 2007, Nzewi {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia, {{and began a}} {{doctorate}} degree in art history at Emory University. [...] During his doctoral years, he curated at Atlanta's High Museum (2009) and received Robert Sterling Clark and Smithsonian fellowships. He wrote his dissertation on the Dak'Art biennial's influence on <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art,</b> and graduated in May 2013. The following August, Nzewi became the Dartmouth College Hood Museum of Art's first curator of African art, where he mounted shows on Eric Van Hove and Ekpe textiles. After four years, Nzewi left Dartmouth to became the Cleveland Museum of Art's curator of African art.|$|E
500|$|The National Museum of African Art was {{the first}} {{institution}} dedicated to African art in the United States, followed by the New York-based Center for African Art (now The African Center) in 1984. The National Museum's collection is larger. As of 2008, it consisted of 9,000 objects and 300,000 photographs. The objects range from 15th-century sculptures and masks to multi-media contemporary art, and the photographs include major contributions from photojournalists Eliot Elisofon and Constance Stuart Larrabee. Elisofon covered major 20th century events for Life, and Larrabee covered World War II and South African life. As of 2004, the museum had 400 contemporary artworks. The museum collects items for both their traditional uses and aesthetic values, and receives an average of 67 gifts annually. The breadth of its collections and special exhibitions made the museum [...] "a solid force in the international art world" [...] and the main venue for <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in the United States, according to The Washington Post.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} and curator Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi described Ogboh's work as capturing [...] "the maddening hyper-visuality of Lagos". Ogboh was among Nzewi's most anticipated artists at the 2014 <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> festival [...] In 2013, Ogboh reported reception of his Lagos Soundscapes as mixed: annoying some and intriguing others. Quiet European cities {{have considered the}} work [...] "noisy and obtrusive", in one case destroying a speaker and calling the police on the installation. The artist appreciated the installation's effect on Nigerians abroad, and how being in earshot of the soundscape confused them in their foreign environment. Art historian Carol Magee noted how even {{in the business of}} the Lagos Soundscapes, she felt a stillness in which her attention was focused and the patterns unchanging despite the cacophony of the scene. Malawian visual artist Massa Lemu described Ogboh's work as embodying Afropolitanism, in which African cities were representative of a busy, globalized world and its multiple cultures centralized in one place. Lemu thought of Ogboh's soundscapes as [...] "auditory landscapes" [...] that recreate a sense of the Lagos environment. He additionally compared Ogboh's practice with that of sound artists James Webb (South Africa) and Magdi Mostafa (Egypt), though these two tend to manipulate their recordings where Ogboh instead recontextualizes the original. For this reason, Lemu considered Ogboh's work to be closer in lineage to John Cage's recontextualized found sounds than the practice of El Anatsui or Romuald Hazoume recycling found objects as commentary on economic conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Locke's {{work was}} highly varied. [...] Marianne Lambert, an Atlanta curator and art patron, said, [...] "His expressiveness ran {{the gamut from}} frenzied {{drawings}} to the spare, clean lines of his sculptures." [...] According to Carl Hazlewood of Newark, associate editor at NKA, a Journal of <b>Contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Art,</b> [...] "Donald's art grew out of sophisticated European traditions acquired during his studies in Guyana and Great Britain, but it also was infused with the myths and poetic aspects of his Guyana homeland and its folklore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chagas {{represented}} Angola at the country's first Venice Biennale national pavilion in 2013. His exhibition {{placed on}} the floor giveaway, poster-sized photographs of discarded objects positioned in relation to weathered architecture in the Angolan capital, Luanda. These poster stacks were in [...] "stark juxtaposition" [...] with the opulent, Catholic decorations of the host, Palazzo Cini, which had been closed for the previous two decades. The New York Times called the pavilion a [...] "breakout star" [...] of the Biennale, and it won the biennial's top prize, the Golden Lion for best national pavilion. The jury praised his showing of the [...] "irreconcilability and complexity of site". Frieze wrote that the pavilion showed a [...] "relational attitude to space, ... responsive to context and not overly concerned with diplomacy and reifying otherness", as other African nation pavilions had been. Artsy Giles Peppiatt named the series as a highlight and recommended purchase at the 2014 [...] <b>contemporary</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> fair.|$|E
