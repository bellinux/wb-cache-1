The opening of day schools of carpentry, plumbing and <b>calcimining</b> {{for the children of}} the capitalist is already producing results. Strange though it may seem, one of the most brilliant of our boiler fitters of to-day was brought up haphazard in this very quarter of the town and educated only by a French governess and a university tutor. But at the time practically nothing had been done. The place was infested with consumers, and there were still, so it was said, servants living in some of the older houses. A butler had been caught one night in a thick shrubbery beside one of the gloomy streets.|$|E
60|$|Somewhere at a {{junction}} our train {{had been}} divided and our car, left {{the last of}} what remained, had bumped and threatened to beat itself to pieces during its remaining run of fifteen miles. This, with our long retard at Santa Elena, and our opportune defense from the depraved descendants of the reforming German colonists by the Guardias Civiles, had given us a day of so much excitement that we were anxious to have it end tranquilly at midnight in the hotel which we had chosen from, our Baedeker. I would not have any reader of mine choose it again from my experience of it, though it was helplessly rather wilfully bad; certainly the fault was not the hotel's that it seemed {{as far from the}} station as Cordova was from Madrid. It might, under the circumstances, have, been a merit in it to be undergoing a thorough overhauling of the furnishing and decoration of the rooms on the patio which had formed our ideal for a quiet night. A conventionally napkined waiter welcomed us from the stony street, and sent us up to our rooms with the young interpreter who met us at the station, but was obscure as to their location. When we refused them because they were over that loud-echoing alley, the interpreter made himself still more our friend and called mandatorially down the speaking-tube that we wished interiores and would take nothing else, though he must have known that no such rooms were to be had. He even abetted us in visiting the rooms on the patio and satisfying ourselves that they were all dismantled; when the waiter brought up the hot soup which was the only hot thing in the house beside our tempers, he joined with that poor fellow in reconciling us to the inevitable. They declared that the people whom we heard uninterruptedly clattering and chattering by in the street below, and the occasional tempest of wheels and bells and hoofs that clashed up to us would be the very last to pass through there that night, and they gave such good and sufficient reasons for their opinion that we yielded as we needs must. Of course, they were wrong; and perhaps they even knew that they were wrong; but I think we were the only people in that neighborhood who got any sleep that night or the next. We slept the sleep of exhaustion, but I believe those Cordovese preferred waking outdoors to trying to sleep within. It was apparently their custom to walk and talk the night away in the streets, not our street alone, but all the other streets of Cordova; the laughing which I heard may have expressed the popular despair of getting any sleep. The next day we experimented in listening from rooms offered us over another street, and then we remained measurably contented to bear the ills we had. This was after an exhaustive search for a better hotel had partly appeased us; but there remained in the Paseo del Gran Capitan one house unvisited which has ever since grown upon my belief as embracing every comfort and advantage lacking to our hotel. I suppose I am the stronger in this belief because when we came to it we had been so disappointed with the others that we had not the courage to go inside. Smell for smell, the interior of that hotel may have harbored a worse one than the odor of henhouse which pervaded ours, I hope from the materials for <b>calcimining</b> the rooms on the patio.|$|E
40|$|THP- 1 {{cells are}} human {{monocyte}} like cell line that is blocked at certain {{steps of the}} differentiation process and its differentiation into macrophages can be induced by addition of PMA. PMA activates Protein Kinase C (PKC) that mimics the physiological activator diacylglycerol (DAG) thus differentiation into macrophage occurs. These cells mimic the alveolar macrophages. So, is a good model to study tuberculosis. According to W. H. O. around 1. 3 million people die of this disease every year. Mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative organism of this disease enters into the body through the airway passages. The alveolar macrophages phagocyte the bacteria. Once inside they escape degradation by preventing the phagosomes-lysosome fusion. Thus, they survive inside the phagosomes by inhibiting autophagy. To curtail this bacterial load, various host defence mechanisms like apoptosis, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy play a very important role. Autophagy in the cells is induced by ATP, vitamin D, cytokines. ATP is known to increase the intracellular calcium level that facilitates autophagy. <b>Calcimining,</b> an important calcium ionosphere increases the intracellular calcium level thus facilitates autophagy. Since autophagy {{plays an important role}} in curtailing bacterial load so we attempted to study the role of PMA in inducing autophagy in THP- 1 cells...|$|E

In 1905, the church's wood roof was replaced with a metal one, the present stained-glass windows were installed, its interior and woodwork were painted, and new lamps were installed for better illumination. The stained-glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark, New Jersey in memory of his father, who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort. Alling also provided four hanging lamps and <b>calcimine</b> for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of the <b>calcimine</b> deliming process during production of food grade gelatin. This {{process is the}} most important step from chemical engineering and environmental protection standpoint during production of food gelatin. The main objective of the paper is to provide a suitable mathematical description of the chemical deliming process. The proposed model is subsequently used for optimization of the deliming process to minimize the operating costs and environmental burden. The experimental part follows two main aims: determination of the effective diffusion coefficient of calcium sulfate during deliming with ammonium sulfate based on experimentally measured data, and computer simulations of the operating costs from the viewpoint of various soaking numbers, degree of the deliming and strength of the bond of calcium hydroxide to collagen. The results give ground for further optimization and exact transfer of laboratory data into real industrial operations...|$|R

50|$|The film's {{opening scene}} {{takes place in}} a saloon. There are several men in the saloon, both white and black. They are {{preparing}} for the meeting of The Independent Order of <b>Calcimine</b> Artists of America, which is hosted by Hostetter Johnson (who is also the Bookkeeper in the film). Bert Williams (who is played by Bert Williams himself) attends and actively participates in the meeting and heavy gambling. While gambling at the meeting, Bert is hesitant to give up the money he has lost. After the meeting and much argument, Bert Williams carries home his right hand man Limpy Jones, because Limpy has a broken leg. As they walk through a graveyard en route from the saloon, they spot two thieves whom they suspect to be the devil when they hear them speaking. Bert and Limpy run back to the Saloon, with Limpy returning first, then Bert bringing the thieves with him, as he saw them on the way back and became friendly with them. In the saloon they take the thieves' winnings, which happens to be chickens, and force the two thieves to leave. Bert then tries to win in a dice game to earn back the money he had lost prior in the meeting. Brother Scott, who was the leader of the group and was also against gambling, makes everyone involved in gambling leave the saloon, but takes the money left behind. When all the men return, a man named Cicero Sampson enters the saloon, who has just returned from the north with a large amount of earnings he won while gambling there. As the men are now back in the saloon, an interested Bert challenges the successful Cicero to a game. With the help of Limpy, Bert is able to beat Cicero, and wins all of Cicero's money he won while in the north. Shortly after, the police come into the saloon and arrest the men for gambling. The judge orders that all of the winnings from gambling in the saloon go to Brother Scott as a lawyer's fee. The judge gives Cicero three days to leave town and orders Bert to jail for ten days. While in jail, Bert imagines dealing hands of cards.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were not}} {{many people in the}} hotel, but the dining-room was filled by {{citizens}} who came in with the air of frequenters. They were not people of fashion, as we readily perceived, but kindly-looking mercantile folk, and ladies painted as white as newly <b>calcimined</b> house walls; and all gravely polite. There was one gentleman as large round as a hogshead, with a triple arrangement of fat {{at the back of his}} neck which was fascinating. He always bowed when we met (necessarily with his whole back) and he ate with an appetite proportioned to his girth. I could wish still to know who and what he was, for he was a person very much to my mind. So was the head waiter, dark, silent, clean-shaven, who let me use my deplorable Spanish with him, till in the last days he came out with some very fair English which he had been courteously concealing from me. He looked own brother to the room-waiter in our corridor, whose companionship I could desire always to have. One could not be so confident of the sincerity of the little camarera who slipped out of the room with a soft, sidelong [...] "De nada" [...] at one's thanks for the hot water in the morning; but one could stake one's life on the goodness of this camarero. He was not so tall as his leanness made him look; he was of a national darkness of eyes and hair which as imparted to his tertian clean-shavenness was a deep blue. He spoke, with a certain hesitation, a beautiful Castilian, delicately lisping the sibilants and strongly throating the gutturals; and what he said you could believe. He never was out of the way when wanted; he darkled with your boots and shoes in a little closet next your door, and came from it with the morning coffee and rolls. In a stress of frequentation he appeared in evening dress in the dining-room at night, and did honor to the place; but otherwise he was to be seen only in our corridor, or in the cold, dark chamber at the stair head where the camareras sat sewing, kept in check by his decorum. Without being explicitly advised of the fact, I am sure he was the best of Catholics, and that he would have burnt me for a heretic if necessary; but he would have done it from his conscience and for my soul's good after I had recanted. He seldom smiled, but when he did you could see it was from his heart.|$|R
