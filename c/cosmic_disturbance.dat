We can but trust that no <b>cosmic</b> <b>disturbance</b> has dulled her {{excellent}} abilities. My Scharzberger of '96 {{must also be}} rescued, so far as our earnest and united efforts can do it, from {{what would be a}} deplorable waste of a great vintage." [...] He levered his great bulk off the desk, upon which he had sat while he announced the doom of the planet. [...] "Come," [...] said he. [...] "If there is little time left, there is the more need that we should spend it in sober and reasonable enjoyment." ...|$|E

"As to you, Lord John Roxton," [...] he creaked, [...] "your opinion upon {{a matter}} of science is of as much value in my eyes as my views upon {{a new type of}} shot-gun would be in yours. I have my own judgment, sir, and I use it in my own way. Because it has misled me once, is that any reason why I should accept without {{criticism}} anything, however far-fetched, which this man may care to put forward? Are we to have a Pope of science, with infallible decrees laid down ex cathedra, and accepted without question by the poor humble public? I tell you, sir, that I have a brain of my own and that I should feel myself to be a snob and a slave if I did not use it. If it pleases you to believe this rigmarole about ether and Fraunhofer's lines upon the spectrum, do so by all means, but do not ask one who is older and wiser than yourself to share in your folly. Is it not evident that if the ether were affected to the degree which he maintains, and if it were obnoxious to human health, the result of it would already be apparent upon ourselves?" [...] Here he laughed with uproarious triumph over his own argument. [...] "Yes, sir, we should already be very far from our normal selves, and instead of sitting quietly discussing scientific problems in a railway train we should be showing actual symptoms of the poison which was working within us. Where do we see any signs of this poisonous <b>cosmic</b> <b>disturbance?</b> Answer me that, sir! Answer me that! Come, come, no evasion! I pin you to an answer!" ...|$|E

Electronic components currently used in missiles can withstand fields of approx. 300 V/cm, while the fields in case of EMI attack reach thousands of V/cm.|$|R

In addition, there will be massive meteor showers (“the stars… fell”). Thus follows {{the first half of}} the Tribulation where God’s wrath consumes the earth. Such wrath does not harm the Church because it was already 'raptured' before the Tribulation started, according to the pretribulation rapture theory.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was not}} dull. The {{affairs of}} our little world had to be regulated, and, unlike the great world, our world had to be steered in its journey through space. Also, there were <b>cosmic</b> <b>disturbances</b> to be {{encountered}} and baffled, such as do not afflict the big earth in its frictionless orbit through the windless void. And we never knew, from moment to moment, {{what was going to}} happen next. There were spice and variety enough and to spare. Thus, at four in the morning, I relieve Hermann at the wheel.|$|R
6000|$|... "The general {{blurring}} {{and shifting}} of Fraunhofer's {{lines of the}} spectrum point, in my opinion, to a widespread cosmic change of a subtle and singular character. Light from a planet is the reflected light of the sun. Light from a star is a self-produced light. But the spectra both from planets and stars have, in this instance, all undergone the same change. Is it, then, a change in those planets and stars? To me such an idea is inconceivable. What common change could simultaneously come upon them all? Is it a change in our own atmosphere? It is possible, but in the highest degree improbable, since we see no signs of it around us, and chemical analysis has failed to reveal it. What, then, is the third possibility? That {{it may be a}} change in the conducting medium, in that infinitely fine ether which extends from star to star and pervades the whole universe. Deep in that ocean we are floating upon a slow current. Might that current not drift us into belts of ether which are novel and have properties of which we have never conceived? There is a change somewhere. This <b>cosmic</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the spectrum proves it. It may be a good change. It may be an evil one. It may be a neutral one. We do not know. Shallow observers may treat the matter as one which can be disregarded, but one who like myself is possessed of the deeper intelligence of the true philosopher will understand that the possibilities of the universe are incalculable and that the wisest man is he who holds himself ready for the unexpected. To take an obvious example, who would undertake to say that the mysterious and universal outbreak of illness, recorded in your columns this very morning as having broken out among the indigenous races of Sumatra, has no connection with some cosmic change to which they may respond more quickly than the more complex peoples of Europe? I throw out the idea for what it is worth. To assert it is, in the present stage, as unprofitable as to deny it, but it is an unimaginative numskull who is too dense to perceive that it is well within the bounds of scientific possibility.|$|E

40|$|Till {{now there}} were not {{quantitative}} estimations of the <b>cosmic</b> ray (CR) <b>disturbance,</b> as, for example, it is made for the geomagnetic activity. In present work we try to give the special indices {{on the level of}} CR activity, which can characterise some peculiarities of the space weather. These indices are calculated for every hour and every day within the period 1990 - 1995 on the base of CR density and anisotropy, obtained from the world neutron monitor network. As examples of these indices behavior several events during this period are considered. The possibility to obtain indices from a single station data is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to use the cosmic ray data from the IMP, Voyager and Pioneer {{spacecraft}} in the heliosphere out to approximately 65 AU to estimate {{the size of the}} heliosphere. We used several techniques to develop a consistent picture {{of the size of the}} heliosphere. The first method used a response function approach which determined the intensity as a function of time by scaling the modulation effect as they move outward and eventually reach the boundary of the heliosphere. In this model the effects of transient <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>disturbances</b> is included. A second approach using the perturbation method in which drifts are considered as a perturbation to the standard diffusion-convection modulation models was not fully developed. In a third approach the location of the modulation boundary beyond the termination shock was estimated using observations of the intensity and radial gradients between Voyager 2 and Pioneer 10 along with new estimates of the interstellar intensity of more than 70 MeV galactic cosmic rays. Using this method we found that for 7 years, from 1983 to 1990, the modulation boundary remained constant at 83 +/- 5 AU. We infer from these studies that a modulation boundary can be estimated only by extrapolating the observed radial gradients when the solar magnetic field polarity is such that cosmic-ray particles are drifting in the heliosphere inward toward the Earth along the neutral sheet. The boundary distance is larger than the estimates of the location of the termination shock at 67 +/- 5 AU using the same method. Two other studies partially supported by this grant are attached. The first deals with the recovery period of the greater than 70 MeV cosmic rays in the outer heliosphere from 1992 - 1995. In the second paper we compare the rigidity dependence of the 11 -year cosmic ray variation at the Earth in two cycles of opposite solar magnetic field polarity...|$|R
