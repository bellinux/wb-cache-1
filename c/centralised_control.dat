5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing the autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{coordinate}} the FAA, RAF and Navy dispersed any counterstrike. Confusion owing to {{the weather and the}} lack of any <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> of British sea and air forces caused each element to work independently of one another. This caused several friendly fire incidents, such as the attack by No. 217 Squadron on HMS Mackay. The most serious failure was Fighter Command’s failure to provide adequate protection to bomber and naval forces. Although the weather also prevented greater German fighter activity by the time the target area was reached, valuable time had been lost by bomber formations searching for their fighter escorts over the rendezvous positions which either never arrived or were given incorrect orders or direction too late to be acted upon. Little communication was enabled between fighter and bomber units, but also between the strike units themselves. Compounding the problems, RAF Bomber Command’s crews, which made up the majority of the strike forces, were not trained for attacks against naval targets. The only anti-shipping torpedo-bomber squadrons were No. 42 and 217 Squadrons of Coastal Command, which owing to logistical issues, were five torpedoes short of their total complement.|$|E

25|$|Both Yunus and Abed also {{attempted}} to catalyse collective enterprises that were locally owned and controlled. However, problems with internal control and elite manipulation continued, {{and by the}} 1990s Grameen and BRAC, {{along with all the}} main microfinance NGOs in Bangladesh, had abandoned cooperative approaches and developed highly <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> and service delivery structures.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with this plan, the first 8-car trains of 1992 Stock entered service in 1993, {{and while the}} necessary signalling works for ATO were in progress, One Person Operation (OPO) was phased in between 1994 and 1995.

5000|$|Challenges such as gas flaring, {{oil spills}} from pipelines, {{deforestation}} and waste miss-management {{have been made}} more serious by federal laws which <b>centralise</b> <b>control</b> of the oil rich land and allow local government relatively little control over activities.

50|$|Also, {{questions}} have been raised about the nature of Olaf’s Christianity itself. It seems that Olaf, like many Scandinavian kings, used his Christianity to gain more power for the monarchy and <b>centralise</b> <b>control</b> in Norway. The skaldic verses attributed to Olaf do not speak of Christianity at all, but in fact use pagan references to describe romantic relationships and in some cases, this being because Olaf likely had many wives.|$|R
25|$|Daly was not {{comfortable}} with the <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> of the land movement and what he perceived as a drift away from the West, the real area of need, and also was concerned about use of physical force in pursuit of its aims. He returned to local politics and left the Land League. He sold the Connaught Telegraph to T.H. Gillespie in 1888 and became a full time farmer. He continued in local Government and served on Mayo County Council and Castlebar Urban District Council. Remaining a force in local politics, he supported the United Irish League and was President of the Connacht '98 Council.|$|E
25|$|The battle, {{although}} inconclusive, boosted British morale. The Germans learned {{lessons and}} the British did not. Rear-Admiral Moore was quietly replaced {{and sent to}} the Canary Islands and Captain Henry Pelly of the Tiger was blamed for not taking over when Lion was damaged. Beatty's flag lieutenant Ralph Seymour—responsible for hoisting Beatty's two commands on one flag hoist, allowing them to be read as one—remained. The use of wireless allowed <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> of ships from the Admiralty, which cramped the initiative of the men on the spot. Signals between ships continued to be by flag but there was no revision of the signal book or the assumptions of its authors. Signalling on board Lion was again poor in the first hours of Jutland, with serious consequences for the British. The battlecruisers failed to improve fire distribution and similar targeting errors were made at Jutland.|$|E
25|$|The German {{attitude}} to air defence {{was built on}} the 'counterair' action. Air superiority would be attained and won over enemy airspace, safeguarding the homeland from attack. Despite this, many of the ingredients for an improvised defence were on hand or under development in 1939. The Germans possessed large numbers of AAA batteries, of good quality and varying calibers supported by searchlights, sound detectors and visual ranging apparatus. They were also deploying Freya radar on the coastlines supported by observer networks. Shortly, the Würzburg set was to be introduced. This radar was fire-controlling, allowing AAA installations to deliver well-aimed AAA fire. The Luftwaffe supported its defences with its main dayfighter, the Messerschmitt Bf 109 while it had no night fighters. There was also no <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> system and air units were not directed closely from the ground, {{as was the case with}} RAF Fighter Command.|$|E

50|$|The fire {{fighting}} {{needs of the}} city increased as Brisbane continued to develop. A number of fire brigades were formed early after The Fire Brigades Act Amendment Act of 1902 allowed local authorities to establish boards and brigades. Those formed were voluntary bodies with only the superintendent and immediate assistants receiving a salary. The Fire Brigades Act of 1920 rationalised the network of fire brigades in Brisbane and suburbs, <b>centralising</b> <b>control</b> under the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board in 1921.|$|R
500|$|Much church plate, {{such as the}} chalice and pyx {{had been}} confiscated, sold or stolen {{in the heat of}} the Reformation. In the more {{tolerant}} climate of Elizabethan England, the excesses of extreme Protestantism were curbed by <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> of the Church of England, the Act of Uniformity and the Book of Common Prayer. Most churches then had to buy a new chalice; Blakeney's was purchased in 1567, and exchanged for another in 1716. One lost treasure is a [...] "Map of the World" [...] (Mappa Mundi et Chroniculum Mundi), which was recorded as present in the church in 1368. This is thought more likely to be a version of Ranulf Higdon's Polychronicon, a geographical text, than a true map like the Hereford Mappa Mundi.|$|E
500|$|The Second Army {{had five}} corps, of which three {{conducted}} {{the attack and}} two remained on the northern flank, not engaged in the main operation; the XIV Corps was available in General Headquarters reserve.

The effectiveness of the British mines, barrages and bombardments was improved by advances in artillery survey, flash spotting and <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> of artillery from the Second Army headquarters. British attacks from 8 to 14 June advanced the front line beyond the former German [...] (Oosttaverne) line. The Battle of Messines was a prelude to the much larger Third Battle of Ypres, the preliminary bombardment for which began on 11 July 1917.|$|E

2500|$|RC's {{system of}} <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> has been {{deprecated}} by ex-members {{who would have}} preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. It was clear to me that this was pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L. Ron Hubbard.|$|E
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, Brisbane was the largest administrative, commercial and industrial centre in Queensland. Two-thirds of the colony's imports were unloaded onto Brisbane wharves. Administration had become centralised and risen in importance with the expansion of government services. The number of civil servants (excluding teachers) had increased, many of whom were located in Brisbane. Increasingly private organisations were established in, or relocated to, Brisbane, <b>centralising</b> <b>control</b> there.
