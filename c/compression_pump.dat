50|$|The maximum {{efficiency}} of a rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> is the ratio between the volume {{in contact with}} the vacuum and the smallest contracted volume {{in contact with the}} valve. If the ratio is 1:1000 and the pump is exhausting to atmospheric pressure, the highest achievable vacuum is 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. This corresponds to 0.76 Torr or 101.3 Pa. This limitation makes rotary compression pumps very hard to construct if lower pressures than about 1 Torr is to be achieved. The simplicity of the process makes the rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> cheap and it is widely used as a low vacuum pump or a fore pump to a diffusion pump.|$|E
50|$|A rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> {{works in}} cycles. Over each cycle a volume is created {{in contact with}} the chamber where {{pressure}} is to be lowered. By random motion, molecules from the vacuum chamber pass into the volume created by the pump. This volume is then cut off from the chamber and compressed in contact with a one way valve. If the volume is compressed enough some of the molecules will pass through the valve.|$|E

The high pumping rate for hydrocarbons also allows the Roots pump to provide an effective isolation between oiled pumps, such as rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pumps,</b> and the vacuum chamber.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) is {{a proven}} tool to reduce visceral leishmaniasis vectors in endemic villages. In India IRS {{is being done}} with stirrup pumps, whereas Nepal, Bangladesh, and other countries use compression pumps. The present {{study was conducted with}} the objectives to compare the efficiency, cost and user friendliness of stirrup and compression pumps. METHODS The study was carried out in Gorigawan village of the Vaishali district in north Bihar and included a total population of 3259 inhabitants in 605 households. Spraying with 50 per cent DDT was done by two teams with 6 persons per team under the supervision of investigators over 5 days with each type of pump (10 days in total using 2 stirrup pumps and 3 compression pumps) by the same sprayers in an alternate way. The spraying technique was observed using an observation check list, the number of houses and room surfaces sprayed was recorded and an interview with sprayers on their satisfaction with the two types of pumps was conducted. RESULTS On average, 65 houses were covered per day with the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> and 56 houses were covered with the stirrup pump. The surface area sprayed per squad per day was higher for the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> (4636 m²) than for the stirrup pump (4102 m²). Observation showed that it was easy to maintain the spray swath with the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> but very difficult with the stirrup pump. The wastage of insecticide suspension was negligible for the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> but high for the stirrup pump. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS The <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> was found to be more user friendly due to its lower weight, easier to operate, lower operation cost, higher safety and better efficiency in terms of discharge rate and higher area coverage than the stirrup pump.  A A...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lymphedema {{treatment}} {{is difficult and}} there is no consensus on the best treatment. This study evaluated the effect of combined decongestive therapy (CDT) and pneumatic <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> on lymphede-ma indicators in patients with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL). Methods: Twenty one women with BCRL were enrolled. The volume difference of upper limbs, the circumfer-ence at 9 areas and shoulder joint range of motion were measured in all patients. CDT was done by an educated nurse in two phases. In first phase, CDT was accompanied by use of a <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> for 4 weeks, 3 days per week. In second phase, CDT was performed daily without <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> for 4 weeks by patients at home. At the end of each phase, the same primary measurements were done for patients. Results: The mean volume difference of the upper limbs and mean difference in circumference in all areas at different phases decreased significantly. Mean flexion, extension, abduction and external rotation (in degrees) at different phases increased significantly. Conclusion: CDT significantly reduced mean volume and mean circumference of the affected limb, and signifi-cantly increased shoulder joint range of motion. The findings support the optimal effects of CDT in the treatment of secondary lymphedema of upper extremity. Clinical trial registration number: 138902212621 N...|$|E

Two cycle configurations were considered. The first configuration utilized a standard mechanical compressor and pump. The second cycle configuration investigated pumps and compressors with non-moving parts. An innovative generator/cold plate design is also presented.

Reduction in swelling of the treated hand and MP and PIP joint movement were recorded with computerised assessment software (EVAL Hand Evaluation System) in comparison to the uninjured contralateral side. Reduction of swelling in group A was not statistically significant (28.5 % of total swelling or 0.61 cm, SD 0.39, p= 0.42), but in group B it was significant (92 % of total swelling, 3.62 cm, SD 1.48, p< 0.001). Comparison of increases in MP and PIP joint movement (p< 0.0016) showed statistically significant differences in favour of the intermittent <b>compression</b> <b>pump.</b> This study demonstrates that intermittent compression is more effective in the reduction of postoperative oedema and gain of finger movement of the hand than cryotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Australia {{has a very}} sunny climate, with a {{very high}} demand for air conditioning. Implementing solar {{assisted}} air conditioning is an ideal option to achieve a high solar fraction {{which leads to a}} significant amount of energy and greenhouse gas emission savings. Solar assisted air conditioning systems are environmentally friendly by being constructed in a way that minimises the need for chlorofluorocarbons CFC, Hydro chlorofluorocarbons HCFC or Chlorofluorocarbons HFC refrigerants and by using a low grade thermal renewable energy, therefore, making them energy efficient and environmentally safe. They can be used either as stand-alone systems or with conventional AC, to improve the indoor air quality. Solar cooling is a new and a fast growing technology compared to other fields of solar energy applications. On the other hand most of the current solar cooling applications are demonstration projects in nature; the technologies are advancing yet still need a lot of additional design, planning, development, and research efforts. To now solar assisted air conditioning’s main obstacles are the high installation costs, and the lack of knowledge and familiarity with this technology between designers, developers and architects. In this paper a feasibility study is carried out to assess a solar assisted air conditioning system for an office building under three of Queensland’s subtropical climates; Rockhampton, Gladstone, and Emerald. The technical aspects of a proposed solar cooling system are investigated. Cooling load profile for a proposed reference building was obtained using TRNSYS software under the influence of these different climates. An electric vapour <b>compression</b> <b>pump,</b> with 2. 5 coefficient of performance (COP) for cooling is used as a reference system to assess the primary energy consumption, assuming 80 % of primary energy consumed by the reference conventional system is replaced by solar energy.

In the following decades, several researchers, including Beck, Van Allen, Bayliss and Müller as well as Henry and Jouvelet, refined the apparatus and recommended the use of roller pumps for blood transfusion and other applications. After further modifications made by DeBakey in 1934, and application of this pump {{in one of the}} first heart-lung machines constructed by Gibbon, DeBakey's name became inseparably attached to this type of pump. For perfusion experiments, an electrically powered roller pump was first used by Fleisch in 1935. Today, the roller pump is the most frequently used blood pump for cardiopulmonary bypass worldwide, having prevailed against the early pulsatile tube <b>compression</b> <b>pumps</b> and ventricular pumps. In recent years, centrifugal pumps have increasingly competed with roller pumps as systemic blood pumps for cardiopulmonary bypass and have become the preferred arterial pump in a variety of centers. Application of mechanical cardiac assistance has evolved from nonpulsatile roller pump support, followed by an era of pulsatile ventricular pumps to the rediscovery of the nonpulsatile flow mode with modern axial flow pumps.|$|R
