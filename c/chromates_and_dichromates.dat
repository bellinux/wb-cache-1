Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the salt sodium dichromate. Approximately 136000 tonne lb of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985. Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are chromium trioxide and various salts of <b>chromate</b> <b>and</b> <b>dichromate,</b> among others.

Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing [...] "hot work" [...] such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal.

30|$|The second-most {{abundant}} {{metal in}} stainless steel is chromium, at amounts {{of up to}} 20 % in 304 L. Chromium ions, specifically Cr(VI) in <b>chromate</b> <b>and</b> <b>dichromate,</b> are highly toxic to bacterial cells (Garbisu et al. 1998). The presence and concentration of Cr(VI) in our system during treatment is unknown. B. subtilis 168 has a metabolic pathway by which it can reduce Cr(VI) to the much less toxic Cr(III) that functions when chromate ions are present in concentrations of up to 0.5 mM (Garbisu et al. 1998). However, genes for chromate reduction (ywrAB, ycnD) did not show significant changes in expression under our experimental conditions. It {{has been reported that}} the presence of heavy metals, such as zinc, cadmium, and copper, can inhibit chromate reduction by B. subtilis (Garbisu et al. 1997). Genes related to zinc, cadmium, and copper toxicity (copAB) were induced in the presence of 250 μA/cm 2 current in our study. This finding suggests that ions of some heavy metals may be present in our system when using stainless steel as electrodes. Chromium reduction can also occur by chemical processes in solution, and can be enhanced or inhibited by other chemical species in the medium. Most significantly, the presence of Fe 2 + enables the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), at a ratio of 3 Fe 2 + to 1 Cr 6 +, possibly forming Fe/Cr complexes (Buerge and Hug 1997). However, the presence of organic ligands can modify this reaction; ligands specific for Fe 2 + inhibit the reaction, while those for Fe 3 + enhance it (Buerge and Hug 1998). In summary, the interactions of chromium within the system are complex, and killing via hexavalent chromium cannot be ruled out. However, the significant killing of B. subtilis using graphite electrodes suggests that the Cr(VI) ions are not indispensible for the killing effects of DC.|$|R

30|$|The term {{adsorption}} {{refers to}} molecules attached {{directly to the}} surface, normally only one molecular layer thick, and not penetrating into {{the bulk of the}} metal itself. The technique of adding inhibitors to the environment of a metal is a well known method of controlling corrosion in many branches of technology. A corrosion inhibitor may act in a number of ways: it may restrict the rate of the anodic process or the cathodic process by simply blocking active sites on the metal surface. Alternatively, it may act by increasing the potential of the metal surface so that the metal enters the passivation region where a natural oxide film forms. A further mode of action of some inhibitors is that the inhibiting compound contributes to the formation of a thin layer on the surface which stifles the corrosion process, for example, in order to mitigate aluminum corrosion. The main strategy is to effectively isolate the metal from corrosive agents by the use of corrosion inhibitors. Inorganic substances such as phosphates, <b>chromates,</b> <b>dichromate,</b> <b>and</b> arsenates have been found effective as inhibitors of metal corrosion, but a major disadvantage is their toxicity, and as such, their use has become intolerant for its adverse effect to our societal health in the long run [12].|$|R

40|$|During the {{manufacturing}} of chromate salts (1972 – 1992) {{large quantities of}} Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) were released into a decantation pond east of the former chemical plant of Porto-Romano (Durres, Albania), giving rise to yellow colored pond sediments. These Cr(VI) bearing sediments were deposited upon Quaternary silty-clay lagoonal sediments rich in iron oxides and organic matter. The pH values in these lagoonal sediments vary around 6. 6, while in the pond sediments, it is mainly acidic (due {{to the presence of}} the sulfur stock piles in the area and the release of the H 2 SO 4 from the activity of the former chemical plant), varying between 1. 4 and 3. 8. Continuous leaching of the COPR waste resulted in yellow-colored surface water runoff. The prediction of pH changes in the different types of sediments based upon acid/base neutralizing capacity (ANC/BNC) jointly with the quantitative data on release of heavy metals and especially Cr is considered an important advantage of the pHstat leaching test if compared to conventional leaching procedures. Thus, factors controlling the leaching of Cr(VI), Cr(III), Ca, Al, Fe, Mg from the COPR were investigated by means of pHstat batch leaching tests and mineralogical analysis. Moreover, mathematical and geochemical modeling complemented the study. The COPR in the area contain very high concentrations of chromium 24, 409 mg/kg, which mainly occurs as Cr(III) (75 – 90 %) as well as Cr(VI) (25 – 10 %). The leaching of Cr(VI) occurs in all the range (2 – 10) of the tested pH values, however, it decreases under acidic conditions. Beside some reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), the Cr(VI) content of the leachtes remains relatively high in the acidic environment, while the limning of Cr(VI) pond sediments will increase the release of the latter specie. The leaching of the Cr(III) occurs strictly under acidic conditions, whereby limning of these sediments will give rise to the lower solubility of Cr(III). The key mineral phases responsible for the fast release of the Cr(VI) are: the chromate salts (i. e. sodium <b>chromate</b> <b>and</b> sodium <b>dichromate),</b> while sparingly soluble chromatite (CaCrO 4) and hashemite (BaCrO 4) release Cr(VI) very slowly. Thus, pH and mineral solubility have been identified as key factors in the retention and the release of the hexavalent CrO 4 2 − and Cr 2 O 7 − from the COPR-rich pond sediments. status: publishe...|$|R
