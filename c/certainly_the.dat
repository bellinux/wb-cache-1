5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in collective memory. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E
5|$|David {{was born}} on a date unknown in 1084 in Scotland. He was {{probably}} the eighth son of King Malcolm III, and <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> sixth and youngest born by Malcolm's second wife, Margaret of Wessex. He was the grandson of the ill-fated King Duncan I.|$|E
5|$|Ag2r had {{a meager}} 2011 season, {{managing}} only six victories. The pinnacle of the team's season was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> Giro d'Italia. John Gadret, {{one of the}} team's leaders, won the undulating 11th stage to Castelfidardo. Though he was outclassed by the race's truly elite riders, particularly so by Giro champion Alberto Contador, he finished the race in fourth place overall, easily the best final placing in a Grand Tour in the team's history. Hubert Dupont also rode very strongly in this race, to 12th place overall and some high stage placings as well.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to have supported Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E
5|$|<b>Certainly,</b> <b>the</b> Sassanids had {{not been}} cowed by the {{previous}} battles with Rome and in 253 AD the Sassanids under Shapur I penetrated deeply into Roman territory several times, defeating a Roman force at the Battle of Barbalissos and conquering and plundering Antiochia in 252 AD following the Siege of Antiochia. The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD, and Emperor Valerian gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders. In 260 AD at the Battle of Edessa the Sassanids defeated the Roman army and captured the Roman Emperor Valerian.|$|E
5|$|Europeans first sighted {{the area}} in 1770 when the crew of James Cook's Endeavour sailed along the coast. Cook named a bay in the Catlins area Molineux's Harbour after his ship's master Robert Molineux. Although this was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Waikawa River, later {{visitors}} applied the name to a bay to the northeast, close {{to the mouth of}} the Clutha River, which itself was for many years known as the Molyneux River.|$|E

5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Bisceglie {{provided}} {{a copy of}} the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to the FBI. At the UNABOM Task Force headquarters in San Francisco, Supervisory Special Agent Joel Moss immediately recognized similarities in the writings. Linguistic analysis determined that the author of the essay papers and the manifesto were almost <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> same. When combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, that analysis provided the basis for a search warrant.|$|E
5|$|In the 1900s, Bolckow, Vaughan was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> largest steel {{producer}} in Britain, {{and possibly the}} largest in the world. In 1905, the firm produced 820,000 tons of pig iron, which was 8.5% of Great Britain's output, and twice as much as the next largest producer. In 1907 {{it was one of the}} largest firms in Britain, with 20,000 employees.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him as an ally of Cathal mac Finguine. The evidence for such involvement is limited. There {{is the presence of}} Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less <b>certainly,</b> <b>the</b> Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report the presence of a Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E

The flames had been extinguished by the afternoon of 13 December 2005. However, one storage tank re-ignited that evening, which the fire-fighters left to burn rather than attempting to extinguish it again.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> one who attacked. According to this view, Beornwulf may have taken {{advantage}} of the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> church proper {{and the place}} of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{steady decline}} {{appears to have}} halted briefly during Dynasty XVIII (c. 1550– c. 1292 BCE), when Thinis enjoyed renewed prominence, based on its {{geographical}} connection to various oases of possible military importance. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>the</b> office of mayor of Thinis was occupied by several notable New Kingdom figures: Satepihu, {{who participated in the}} construction of an obelisk for Hatshepsut and was himself subject of an exemplary block statue; the herald Intef, an indispensable member of the royal household and the travelling-companion of Thutmose III; and Min, tutor to the prince Amenhotep III.|$|E
5|$|The high plains {{found on}} Triton's eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, and are {{therefore}} almost <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as Leviathan Patera, which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.|$|E
5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain. One {{possibility is that}} he was attempting to establish Norwegian authority in the west as a means to prepare an invasion of England. In so doing, Magnús may have backed the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>the</b> thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E
