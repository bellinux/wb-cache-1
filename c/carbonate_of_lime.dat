2500|$|Streams {{and true}} springs are absent, {{but there are}} {{hundreds}} of basins, varying from [...] in diameter, and from [...] to [...] in depth. [...] The water in them contains <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> which often forms concretions, called pearls, eggs, and snowballs, according to their size. On the fracture these spherical growths are found to be radiated in structure.|$|E
60|$|It is {{desirable}} {{for us to}} start from the knowledge of this fact, though it may not seem to help us very far towards what we seek. For <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> is a widely spread substance, and is met with under very various conditions. All sorts of limestones are composed of more or less pure <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> The crust which is often deposited by waters which have drained through limestone rocks, {{in the form of}} what are called stalagmites and stalactites, is <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Or, to take a more familiar example, the fur on the inside of a tea-kettle is carbonate of lime; and, for anything chemistry tells us to the contrary, the chalk might be a kind of gigantic fur upon the bottom of the earth-kettle, which is kept pretty hot below.|$|E

50|$|An {{analysis}} of the water was commissioned by Anselme Lacadé in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in Toulouse, who determined that the water was potable and that it contained the following: oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, <b>carbonates</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> and magnesia, a trace <b>of</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> iron, an alkaline carbonate or silicate, chlorides of potassium and sodium, traces of sulphates of potassium and soda, traces of ammonia, and traces of iodine. Essentially, the water is quite pure and inert. Lacadé had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which {{would allow him to}} develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring Cauterets and Bagnères-de-Bigorre.|$|R
60|$|We also {{followed}} out M. Marie's find, {{to which}} he had been guided by a patch of red matter, conspicuous on the road from Tiryam to Sharmá. For forty minutes we skirted the seaward face of the old cliff, a line broken by many deep water-gashes and buttressed by Goz, or high heaps of loose white sand. We then turned eastwards or inland, ascended a Nakb ("gorge"), and saw, as before, the corallines and <b>carbonates</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> altered, fused, scorified, and blackened by heated injections; the grey granite scored with quartz veins, running in all rhumbs; and the porphyritic trap forming crests that projected from the sands. The cupriferous stone struck east-west, with a dip to the south; the outcrops, visible without digging, measured fifteen to twenty metres long, by one to one and a half in breadth.|$|R

60|$|From the offing, also, we {{note how}} the later formations, granite and syenite, seamed with a network, and often topped by cones, of {{porphyritic}} trap, have upthrust, pierced, and isolated the older Secondaries. We traced this huge deposit <b>of</b> sulphates and <b>carbonates</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> {{from the southern}} Wady Hamz, through the islets {{at the mouth of}} the Birkat 'Akabah, all along the shore of North Midian. Here it crosses diagonally the northern third of the 'Akabah Gulf, and forms the north-eastern base of the Sinaitic Peninsula; whilst eastward it stretches inland as far as Magháir Shu'ayb. The general disposition suggests that before the upheaval of the Gháts, the Jibál el-Tihámah, this vast gypseous sheet was a plain and plateau covering the whole country, till a movement of depression, caused by the upheaval of the igneous mountains, sank in it the Gulf of 'Akabah. At present the surface is here flat, there hilly like huge billows breaking mostly to the north, and reaching an altitude of twelve hundred feet above the surface. Hence the lines stretching north-south, the Fahísát, the Red Hills, and the Kalb el-Nakhlah, look like so many volcanic island-reefs floating in a sea of greenish-yellow Secondaries.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Hill of Birds," [...] {{which some}} have {{identified}} with the classical Island of Isis,[EN#139] shows a triune profile, what the Brazilians call a Moela or [...] "gizzard." [...] Of its three peaks the lowest is the eastern; and the central is the highest, reaching seven hundred, not a thousand, feet. Viewed from within the Gulf, it is a slope of sand which has been blown in sheets up the backing hills. The ground plan, as seen from a balloon, would represent a round head to the north, a thin neck, and a body rudely triangular, the whole measuring a maximum of five miles in length: the sandy northern circlet, connected by the narrowest of isthmuses, sweeping eastward, forms the noted port. The material is the normal Secondary formation, sulphates and <b>carbonates</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> supporting modern corallines and conglomerates of shell. Horizontal lines of harder stone are disposed in huge steps or roads that number three to six on the flank of the western peak: the manganese-coloured strata which appeared at Magháir Shu'ayb, and in the rent bowels of the Rughámat Makná, are conspicuous from the south. The whole has been upheaved by syenite, which, again, has been cut by dykes of plutonic stone, trap and porphyry.|$|R

60|$|So now {{remember}} that chalk is <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> {{and that it}} is made up of three things, calcium, oxygen, and carbon; and that therefore its mark is CaCO(3), in Analysis's language, which I hope {{you will be able to}} read some day.|$|E
60|$|We now bent to the south-west. Here {{the surface}} is much cut and broken by sandy Wadys, dotted with a few straggling plants: to our right was a Goz or {{inclined}} arenaceous bank, where the south wind had sifted the sand from the gravel, disposing the former in the hollows, and the latter {{on the crest of}} the ripples. Presently we reached a strange formation which, seen from the east, appears a huge vein, red and rusty, beginning close to the sea, and crossing the body of the island from south to north, while a black cone is so disposed that its southern front simulates a crater. A narrow gorge opens upon a semicircular hollow lined with ochraceous or ferruginous matter; in fact, part of the filon, which sends off fibrils in all directions. The confusion of formations was startling. The floor was here of white petrosilex, there of grey granite, variegated with squares and lozenges, drops and pineapples, red, green, neutral tinted, and disposed by oxides of iron and copper in natural designs that looked artificial. Scattered over the bed of the upper ravine beyond the hollow, were <b>carbonates</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> ruddy brown and chocolate-hued, here a pudding-stone, there porous like basalt: the calcareous sulphates were both amorphous and crystalline, the latter affected by contact with plutonic matter. The walls of the gash showed a medley of clay breccias, disposed in every imaginable way; and divided by horizontal veins of heat-altered quartz. A few paces further led {{to the head of the}} ravine, where a tumble of huge rocks, choking the bed, showed that the rain-torrents must at times be violent.|$|R
30|$|The binder is a lime-based (calcitic), nearly homogeneous, micritic {{sometime}} microsparitic matrix, {{although some}} sparse uncarbonated rounded lumps <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> were also observed. The volume occupying by the lime binder is about 50  vol. %, the porosity {{is less than}} 20 % on the total volume of the sample and is due to voids occurring in the binder, in the lithic fragments of the aggregate and sporadically due to cracks at the grain-binder boundary. In its inner part the plaster base reveals a distinct layer, showing a lighter coloured matrix, which seem also distinguished by the finer grain size of the aggregate, a minor content of volcanic lithic fragments and a higher porosity in the binder. Such contrasting features could indicate the occurrence of an older plaster layer, different for, aggregate composition, binder concentration and porosity, which probably suffered <b>carbonate</b> dissolution-reprecipitation <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> binder matrix.|$|R
5000|$|Temporary {{hardness}} {{is a type}} {{of water}} hardness caused by the presence of dissolved bicarbonate minerals (calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate). When dissolved, these minerals yield calcium and magnesium cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) and carbonate and bicarbonate anions (CO32−, HCO3−). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the permanent hardness caused by sulphate and chloride compounds, this [...] "temporary" [...] hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water, or by the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> (calcium hydroxide) through the process <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> softening. Boiling promotes the formation <b>of</b> <b>carbonate</b> from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium <b>carbonate</b> out <b>of</b> solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.|$|R

60|$|We {{were again}} much puzzled {{concerning}} {{the form of}} industry which gave rise to such a large establishment as Sharmá.

Being left in contact with fused <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> potassa, chloride <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and quick lime for some days and then filtered, they were found much injured in insulating power; but after distillation acquired their best state, though even then they proved to be conductors when extensive metallic contact was made with them.|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} these springs is {{in a letter}} from Count de Strzelecki, dated about 1840, and published among the papers of the Tasmanian Society. Of their constituents Strzelecki says:—"They belong to the class of carbonated waters, containing carbonic acid gas, muriatic acid gas, <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> soda, chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda or magnesia, oxide of iron {{in the state of}} a peroxide, and a slight indication <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> From this examination, and from experience, I am led to believe that they are aperient and tonic; they are also sufficiently disgusting to the palate to pass for highly medicinal. ...|$|R
60|$|That this is {{the fact}} you can prove for yourselves by a simple experiment. Get a little lime water at the chemist's, and breathe into it through a glass tube; your breath will at once make the lime-water milky. The {{carbonic}} acid of your breath has laid hold <b>of</b> the <b>lime,</b> and made it visible as white <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> lime--in plain English, as common chalk.|$|R
60|$|This chalk {{consists}} simply of comminuted corals {{and shells}} of the reef. It has been examined microscopically {{and found to}} be destitute of the minute organisms abounding in the chalk of England. (Geology of the United States Exploring Expedition, p. 150.) Mr. Guppy also found chalk-like coral limestones containing 95 p.c. of <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
60|$|Well, I am {{sure that}} Master Synthesis could not put that {{together}} again: and equally sure that Master Analysis might spend ages in taking it to pieces, before he found out how it was made. And--we are lucky to-day, for this lower chalk to the south has very few fossils in it--here is something else which is not mere <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Look at it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments in order to investigate on the effect <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> and fly ash on hydraulic conductivity of sand.

60|$|Nor had we any {{difficulty}} in discovering Haji Wali's tree, a solitary Mimosa {{to the right}} of the caravan-track, springing from the sands of the Shigdawayn gorge.

60|$|In perfect strictness, {{it is true}} that {{chemical}} investigation {{can tell}} us little or nothing, directly, of the composition of living matter, inasmuch as such matter must needs die in the act of analysis,--and upon this very obvious ground, objections, which I confess seem to me to be somewhat frivolous, have been raised to the drawing of any conclusions whatever respecting the composition of actually living matter, from that of the dead matter of life, which alone is accessible to us. But objectors of this class do not seem to reflect that it is also, in strictness, true that we know nothing about the composition of any body whatever, as it is. The statement that a crystal of calc-spar consists of <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> is quite true, if we only mean that, by appropriate processes, it may be resolved into carbonic acid and quicklime. If you pass the same carbonic acid over the very quicklime thus obtained, you will obtain <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> again; but it will not be calc-spar, nor anything like it. Can it, therefore, be said that chemical analysis teaches nothing about the chemical composition of calc-spar? Such a statement would be absurd; but it is hardly more so than the talk one occasionally hears about the uselessness of applying the results of chemical analysis to the living bodies which have yielded them.|$|E
