5|$|Sulfate {{aerosols}} {{have declined}} significantly since 1970 with the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> in the United States and similar policies in Europe. The <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> was strengthened in 1977 and 1990. According to the EPA, from 1970 to 2005, total emissions {{of the six}} principal air pollutants, including PM’s, dropped by 53% in the US. In 1975, the masked effects of trapped greenhouse gases finally started to emerge and have dominated ever since.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act,</b> the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E
5|$|The EPA has {{initiated}} several air quality requirements that help reduce ground-level ozone {{that leads to}} urban heat islands. In the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act,</b> one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that are {{put in place to}} ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act,</b> all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.|$|E

5|$|Chemetco had a {{long history}} of violations. For example, in August and September 1992, while taking air {{emission}} readings, Chemetco was caught using semi-articulated trucks and water sprinklers as a buffer in front of the air emission monitors. This was in contravention of the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act,</b> 42.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bush {{announced}} the Clear Skies Act of 2003, aimed at amending the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> to reduce air pollution {{through the use}} of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.|$|E
5|$|The United States <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act,</b> {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> had its intended impact.|$|E

MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act,</b> the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> Amendments of 1990 {{legislation}} forced many {{utility companies}} in the United States to switch to low-sulfur coal. In response Harrisburg's already waning economy took a severe downturn. The freight yard closed in 1982, Sahara Coal company shut down operations in 1993, 865 jobs {{were lost in the}} county that year. This ended the reign of big coal in Harrisburg, {{a way of life for}} residents for over 100 years. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad/Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway system tracks were taken up in the late 1980s and replaced by the Tunnel Hill State Trail in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act.</b> The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to {{represent}} the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act.</b> The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act.</b> These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E
5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Act</b> 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E
