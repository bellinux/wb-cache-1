A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is backplane assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> or {{smart cards}} are now well-known. Applications such as {{electronic}} purses (cash units stored in cards), subscriber identification cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to file management systems or database management systems where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer. The needs for open and flexible card life cycle enabling to accommodate executable code loaded by different service providers require {{a new generation of}} smart cards. Operating systems based on object-oriented technologies are key components for future integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> applications...|$|R

The developed virtual environment allows prediction of total life time, overall reliability and maintainability for <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> (system level) and their components (component level) through a simulation methodology. Component repair or replace approaches are used within this simulation which gives the user the ability to choose between them based on experience and component history. As excessive temperature is the primary cause of poor reliability in electronics, quantitative accelerated life tests are designed to quantify the life of <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> under different thermal stresses to produce the data required for accelerated life data analysis. This research provides a better understanding and helps in predicting overall system failure characteristics for any given configuration. It allows the user to identify components which contribute the most to downtime and to determine the effect of design alternatives on system performance in a cost-effective manner...|$|R
