5|$|The country {{owes its}} varied topography, {{and perhaps even}} its {{emergence}} above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly {{half the size of}} Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and <b>crumple</b> the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer. He flew to Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and <b>crumple</b> the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the <b>crumple</b> zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crumpled</b> {{graphene}} {{films are}} broadly used, {{for instance in}} electronics 1, energy storage 2, 3, composites 4, 5, and biomedicine 6. Although {{it is known that}} the degree of <b>crumpling</b> affects graphene's properties and the performance of graphene-based devices and materials 3, 5, 7, the controlled folding and unfolding of <b>crumpled</b> graphene films has not been demonstrated. Here we report an approach to reversibly control the <b>crumpling</b> and unfolding of large-area graphene sheets. We show with experiments, atomistic simulations and theory that, by harnessing the mechanical instabilities of graphene adhered on a biaxially pre-stretched polymer substrate and by controlling the relaxation of the pre-strains in a particular order, graphene films can be <b>crumpled</b> into tailored self-organized hierarchical structures that mimic superhydrophobic leaves. The approach enables us to fabricate large-area conductive coatings and electrodes showing superhydrophobicity, high transparency, and tunable wettability and transmittance.

40|$|<b>Crumpling</b> of a {{thin film}} leads to a unique stiff yet {{lightweight}} structure. The stiffness {{has been attributed to}} a complex interplay between four basic elements - smooth bends, sharp folds, localized points (developable cones), and stretching ridges - yet rigorous models of the structure are not yet available. In this letter we show that adhesion, the attraction between surfaces within the <b>crumpled</b> structure, is an important yet overlooked contributer to the overall strength of a <b>crumpled</b> film. Specifically, we conduct experiments with two different polymers films and compare the role of plastic deformation, elastic deformation and adhesion in <b>crumpling.</b> We use an empirical model to capture the behaviour quantitatively, and use the model to show that adhesion leads to an order of magnitude increase in "effective" modulus. Going beyond statics, we additionally conduct force recovery experiments. We show that once adhesion is accounted for, plastic and elastic <b>crumpled</b> films recover logarithmically. The time constants measured through <b>crumpling,</b> interpreted with our model, show an identical distribution as do the base materials measured in more conventional geometries...|$|R
25|$|Both {{sections}} {{struck the}} sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to <b>crumple</b> and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow {{is by far}} the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down {{on top of each other}} and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.|$|E
