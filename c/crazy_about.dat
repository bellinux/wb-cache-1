500|$|During {{his time}} in Spain, he {{developed}} early gasoline and oil bombs, suggested the quartering of personnel on trains to aid in relocation, and following the Nationalist victory was awarded the ‘Spanish Cross in Gold with Swords and Diamonds’ for his contributions. On 24 May 1938 Galland left Spain {{and was replaced by}} Werner Mölders. Before leaving he made ten flights in the Bf 109; deeply impressed with the performance of the aircraft, it persuaded him to change from a strike pilot to a fighter pilot. Galland's fellow student and friend at the Kriegsschule in Dresden, Johannes Janke, later said of him [...] "a very good pilot and excellent shot, but ambitious and he wanted to get noticed.

I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.'

You couldn't even get in to see this guy unless you had $2 million to invest." [...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.|$|E
500|$|Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{called the}} episode [...] "pretty good" [...] {{noting that he}} [...] "wasn't <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> any of the songs" [...] but enjoyed the plot development, {{particularly}} the confrontation between Terri and Will. Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal {{was happy to see}} the [...] "convoluted" [...] fake pregnancy storyline end, and called the performance of [...] "Jump" [...] "lively" [...] and the stunts [...] "incredible", though he wrote that it was [...] "the only memorable song of the episode". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that in previous reviews, he had [...] "never been shy of [...] disdain for Mrs. Schuester", but that his hatred of Terri [...] "vanished" [...] once the lie was over, praising the confrontation between Will and Terri. MTV Aly Semigran praised both actors, especially [...] "a devastated Matthew Morrison" [...] for having [...] "nailed just what a scary, sad, and life-altering moment" [...] it was.

500|$|Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush {{felt the}} line [...] "had {{to see that}} coming" [...] applied to many {{elements}} of the episode, but said [...] "there’s {{a lot of fun}} to be had" [...] and praised the use of the character James, dealing with the character's [...] "self-loathing" [...] well while acknowledging his status as the series' pre-Ghost Rider Ghost Rider. Fitzpatrick added that he was [...] "still not <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> whatever’s going on with “Lucy” and her terrible ghost effects", and felt the Aida story was being pushed aside in favor of a seemingly corporate-mandated Ghost Rider focus. Terri Schwartz at IGN gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] 8.5 out of 10, praising the executive producers for their timing in bringing the season's different groups of characters together in this episode. Schwartz praised the car chase, the handling of the relationship between Simmons and Fitz in regards to his keeping Aida a secret from her, and the use of James, taking advantage of the audience's familiarity of him from the previous season.|$|E

500|$|Jet {{magazine}} reported [...] "Janet's innovative stage performances {{during her}} world tours have won her {{a reputation as}} a world-class performer." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated the [...] "enthralling" [...] choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour [...] "represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] When Jackson was asked [...] "do you understand it when people talk about [...] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, [...] "I'm <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." [...] Her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years." ...|$|E
500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, I think My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Anything Goes" [...] / [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] mash-up {{was widely}} acclaimed. Respers France named Pearce's {{performance}} the best {{moment of the}} episode, {{and found that the}} character positively reminded her of [...] "Glee of old". The song was also a favorite of Lee's, who wrote that the intensity of the actress was perfectly matched to the character's disposition. West, Slezak and Benigno gave the performance an [...] "A"; the former called it an [...] "outstanding rendition" [...] which [...] "felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big-screen musical", and the latter two praised her vocal talent, which Benigno deemed unequalled on Glee. Futterman and Bell found Harmony a credible rival to Rachel vocally, and eagerly anticipated future competition between them. Urban called Pearce's performance merely [...] "serviceable". Though she felt her acting was a weak point, she compared her favorably to season two guest star Charice and praised her vocals. Criticism came from New York Lindy West, who did not understand Rachel's humiliation, as New Directions [...] "sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode". She elaborated, [...] "This is a thing that drives me <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> Glee. As a viewer, there's no knowing whether a performance was 'good' like 'Anything Goes,' or 'bad' like 'We've Got the Beat,' until Rachel starts crying or some cheerleader starts throwing spaghetti." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Real Adventures {{featured}} J. D. Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Dr. Jeremiah Surd. A childhood {{fan of the}} original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's [...] "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something {{he had tried to}} integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, [...] "Jonny is <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special." [...] Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: [...] " [...] {{is one of the few}} roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us." [...] A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for [...] "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an [...] "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".|$|E
500|$|Webb felt a {{responsibility}} to reinvent Spider-Man. One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics. In February 2011, with {{the launch of the}} official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed. Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and [...] noted [...] "the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands {{as one of the great}} comic-book costumes ever." [...] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not <b>crazy</b> <b>about</b> the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine. Webb explained that he felt that [...] "the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect". Webb paid attention to the question of [...] "How would a kid make it?" [...] and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew [...] "wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [...] were something we used to emphasize that." [...] He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker. Webb stated that [...] "With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made". Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.|$|E
