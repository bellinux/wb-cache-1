5|$|Some clock-shift {{problems}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> {{by adjusting}} clocks continuously {{or at least}} more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity {{and has never been}} implemented.|$|E
5|$|The labor tax {{took the}} form of conscripted labor for one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.|$|E
30|$|Although {{successful}} laparoscopic staging {{is feasible}} in endometrium cancer, when preoperative diagnosis and operative utero findings {{are less than}} IbG 2, lymphadenectomies <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoid</b> because of the good prognosis of these patients and the low affected nodes rate.|$|R

[...] Water injection was started at 8pm on 14 March after the cooling system failed at 1pm that day. The meltdown <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if injection had started by 4pm.|$|R
50|$|Higgs {{viewed the}} earlier scandals, {{which led to}} the Cadbury Report <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> had a Code been in place. The Robert Maxwell debacle <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> in his view because many firms already refused to deal with him, and {{disclosure}} of his company's governance practices would have led to more pressure for change.|$|R
5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly by the number of compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, {{conscription}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court {{favored the}} recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops (buqu 部曲).|$|E

30|$|Equinovarus foot is a known {{result of}} {{incorrect}} position while immobilizing a leg and problem with leaving leg short [21]. This <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> potentially <b>avoided</b> {{by a more}} aggressive restoration of the alignment and length. (Also, decreasing the ‘latent’ period could have prevented the subsequent deformity or lessened the severity.) If the adjustments had been started earlier, this morbidity <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>avoided.</b> This <b>could</b> have also <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> by spanning the ankle joint with the frame from the beginning.|$|R

5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E
5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, the Duke of York; William, the Duke of Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the Duke of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E
5|$|Linois's {{operations}} in the Indian Ocean have been compared to those of Captain Karl von Müller in SMS Emden 108 years later: like von Müller, Linois's raids caused significant concern among British merchant houses and the British authorities in the Indian Ocean, in Linois's case principally due to the threat he posed to the East Indiaman convoys such as that encountered off Pulo Aura. The practical effects of his raiding were however insignificant: in three years he took just five East Indiamen {{and a handful of}} country ships, briefly terrorising the Andhra coast in 1804 but otherwise failing to cause major economic disruption to British trade. The only achievement of his cruise was to force Rainier's squadron to operate in defence of British convoys and ports, preventing any offensive operations during Linois's time in the Indian Ocean. The vast distances between friendly ports, the lack of sufficient food supplies or naval stores and the strength of British naval escorts after the initial months of war all played a part in Linois's failings to fully exploit his opportunity, but the blame for his inadequate achievements has been consistently placed with Linois's own personal leadership failings, both among his contemporaries and by historians. In battle Linois refused to place his ships in danger if it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided,</b> he spent considerable periods of the cruise refitting at French harbours and even when presented with an undefended target was reluctant to press his advantage.|$|E
40|$|A {{critique}} of Nyborg's (2009) {{analysis of the}} relationship between IQ and religiousness is presented. It is argued that its problems, although relatively minor, <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if Wilson's (1998) consilience model were followed.

5|$|On 13 March 1806, Warren's {{squadron}} was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of {{the squadron}} were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing together {{some distance from}} the rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker. At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the wind from the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with blue lights, the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron trailing behind. To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails in the distance and turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy. Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> in the night. It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} the dissents was that the Social Security Act of 1935 went beyond the powers that were granted to the federal {{government}} in the Constitution. Imposing a tax that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> only by contributing to a state unemployment compensation fund was effectively coercing each state to make law creating such a fund.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the army also changed in this period. While the Qin had utilized a conscript army, by Eastern Han, the army was made up largely of volunteers and conscription <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by paying a fee. Those who presented the government with supplies, horses, or slaves were also exempted from conscription.|$|E
