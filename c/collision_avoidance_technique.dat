The penalty is gradually increased and the individual trajectories are iteratively replanned to account for the increased penalty until a collision-free solution is found. Using extensive experimental evaluation, we find that such a penalty method constructs trajectories with near-optimal cost on the instances where the optimum is known and otherwise with 4 - 10 % lower cost than the trajectories generated by prioritized planning and up to 40 % cheaper than trajectories generated by local <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>technique</b> ORCA.

Moreover, most of the realized structures only take advantage of the static properties of these structures, although recently, some dynamic applications, such as in the three-DOF actuated robots and tensegrity mobile robot, have been implemented. In this presentation, we shall demonstrate the feasibility of realizing different tensegrity structures using the same set of structural members and an initial structural configuration. In particular, the tensegrity configuration to be considered is the configuration of the simplest form of tensegrity structures commonly called the simplex. Details of the hardware, hardware configuration, the design of the tension and compression structural members and the employed control techniques will be presented.

Widespread use of these vehicles requires that these vehicles be integrated into the National Airspace System (NAS). However, Federal Aviation Administration is not yet ready to allow the integration of these vehicles into the NAS. One of the key requirements is that these vehicles have collision avoidance capabilities. UAV flight control systems must possess human equivalent level of safety to interpret potential collision threats and navigate around them. One of the goals of the current research at Cal Poly Pomona is the development and validation, in simulation and via flight tests, of a novel <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>technique</b> for small UAVs. The UAVs being used for this research are a Sig Kadet Senior and 8 ' Telemaster airplanes, which are equipped with autopilots and sensors for collision detection. The collision avoidance system works in three segments. The first segment determines the number of aircraft that are communicating with the subject aircraft within the detection zone. The second segment refines the list of other aircraft into a group which are within a pre-set distance and determines whether any of the aircraft is in collision course. The last segment of the algorithm plans alternate flight path {{in order to avoid the}} collision and returns to the original course once the collision is avoided. It draws a safety bubble around each of the airplanes from the list. The safety "bubble" has a size determined by how long it could take the airplane to reach any point at the edge of the shape.

Due to the constantly progressing miniaturisation of components, {{it is now possible}} to incorporate enough computing power into a package that can be carried by a miniature helicopter platform to perform useful autonomous missions. In contrast to full size helicopters, miniature rotorcraft are not only much cheaper, but can also be deployed in hazardous application scenarios. This thesis investigates novel techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the areas of visual target tracking, three-dimensional path planning, and target reacquisition. The experimental testing platform of the Oxford Aerial Tracking System (OATS) consists of a petrol-powered helicopter model that is equipped for autonomous operation. In order to focus on high-level tasks, OATS uses an off-the-shelf automatic flight controller that stabilises the aircraft on six degrees of freedom and allows for waypoint navigation. Unlike previous devices of this type, OATS constitutes the first robotic helicopter to incorporate an active vision system that solely relies on onboard based vision processing. The key contributions of this thesis include the implementation of a visual object tracking algorithm that utilises Mean-Shift to reliably track moving objects on the ground. Building on this, a geolocalisation technique was developed that estimates the position of the tracked target within the Global Positioning System's reference frame in real-time. Furthermore, a novel path planning and <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>technique</b> is proposed that incorporates an automatic height change mechanism which enables the aerial robot to safely operate at low flight altitudes. In order to improve the system's target reacquisition capabilities during line-of-sight occlusion, a target trajectory prediction method is presented that employs artificial neural networks which adapt themselves to target movement patterns through learning.

This thesis illustrates the applicability of pseudospectral methods to solve the optimal path planning problem for a system of multi-link, multi-degree of freedom robotic arms. The optimal control problem is defined in standard form and solved using the software package DIDO.
