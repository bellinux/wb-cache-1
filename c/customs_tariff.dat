5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common <b>customs</b> <b>tariff,</b> levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
25|$|The Enlightenment {{had gained}} great {{influence}} in certain Commonwealth circles {{during the reign}} (1764–95) of its last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. As a result, the King had proceeded with cautious reforms such as the establishment of fiscal and military ministries and a national <b>customs</b> <b>tariff.</b> However, the idea of reforms in the Commonwealth was viewed with growing suspicion {{not only by the}} magnates, but also by neighboring countries, which were content with the Commonwealth's contemporary state of affairs and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders.|$|E
25|$|Inter-territorial {{co-operation}} {{between the}} Kenya Colony, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory was formalised in 1948 by the EAHC. This provided a customs union, a common external tariff, currency, and postage. It also dealt with common services in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC {{was replaced by}} the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties {{because of the lack of}} joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position. In 1967, the EACSO was superseded by the EAC. This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common <b>customs</b> <b>tariff,</b> and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.|$|E

25|$|Conflicting reports {{survive as}} to when Heke signed the Treaty of Waitangi. He may have signed with the other chiefs on 6 February 1840, but in any event, he soon found the {{agreement}} not to his liking. Among other things, Heke objected to the relocation of the capital to Auckland; moreover the Governor-in-Council imposed a <b>customs</b> <b>tariff</b> on staple articles of trade {{that resulted in a}} dramatic fall in the number of whaling ships that visited Kororareka (over 20 whaling ships could anchor in the bay at any time); a {{reduction in the number of}} visiting ships caused a serious loss of revenue to Ngāpuhi. Heke and his cousin Titore also collected and divided a levy of £5 on each ship entering the bay. Pomare felt aggrieved that he could no longer collect payment from American whaling and sealing ships that called at Otuihu across from Opua.|$|E
500|$|Pulsford {{spoke for}} five hours in {{the debate on the}} 1902 <b>Customs</b> <b>Tariff</b> Bill, {{although}} he later supported time limits for speeches. Missing out on a frontbench portfolio when the Free Traders were briefly in government from 1904 to 1905, he was absent from parliament for most of 1907. Described by the Tribune as [...] "the best living authority on Australia's tariff question", his pamphlet to the Cobden Club in 1907 attracted a favourable reception. He opposed women's suffrage {{on the grounds that it}} would put Australia [...] "in advance of public opinion throughout the world", believing it would lead to the [...] "vulgarisation of women".|$|E
500|$|O'Connor, who {{had only}} one ministerial {{colleague}} in the upper house, tabled standing orders for the Senate on 10 May 1901 in conjunction with those tabled in the House of Representatives, but the chamber instead adopted a committee to formulate standing orders of its own. He was a vigorous supporter of the White Australia policy, although he also supported voting rights for Aborigines and other [...] "coloured persons who are naturalised subjects", and supported Dalgety as {{the site for the}} national capital. He was also an advocate of proportional representation for the Senate as representative of the [...] "true majority", and managed to guide the 1902 <b>Customs</b> <b>Tariff</b> Act through the Senate with minimal interference. He worked during this period under great financial difficulty as his position as Vice-President of the Executive Council carried with it no salary beyond that of a Senator, and parliamentary sessions in Melbourne greatly interfered with the running of his Sydney law practice. He had been offered a knighthood by Barton in 1902 but refused, lest he appear as [...] "Sir Richard" [...] before the bankruptcy courts. The number of salaried ministers was capped by the Constitution, but O'Connor was forced to write to the Attorney General, his friend Alfred Deakin, that he could not continue to work without remuneration. As a result, Deakin arranged for O'Connor's ministerial colleagues to each contribute £200 a year to a fund for honorary ministers.|$|E

500|$|The Enlightenment greatly {{influenced}} certain Commonwealth circles during the 1764–95 reign {{of its last}} king, Stanisław II August Poniatowski. Poniatowski was an [...] "enlightened" [...] Polish magnate {{who had been a}} deputy to several Sejms between 1750 and 1764 and had a deeper understanding of Polish politics than previous monarchs. The Convocation Sejm of 1764, which elected Poniatowski to the throne, was controlled by the Czartoryski family's reformist Familia party and was backed up by Russian military forces, which the Czartoryskis invited. In exchange for passing decrees favorable to them, the Russians and Prussians let the confederated Convocation Sejm enact a number of reforms, including the weakening of liberum veto and ensuring it no longer applied to treasury and economic matters. A more comprehensive reform package was presented by Andrzej Zamoyski, but opposition from Prussia, Russia and the Polish nobility thwarted this ambitious program, which proposed to decide on all motions by majority voting. In part because his election was imposed by Empress Catherine the Great, Poniatowski's political position was weak from the beginning. He proceeded with cautious reforms such as the establishment of fiscal and military ministries and the introduction of a national <b>customs</b> <b>tariff,</b> which was soon abandoned because of opposition from Frederick the Great of Prussia. These measures had already been authorized by the Convocation Sejm; more legislative and executive improvements inspired by Familia or the King were implemented during and after the 1764 Sejm.|$|E

Prime Minister Deakin's [...] "New Protection" [...] policy was to provide tariff protection to employers in exchange for [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wages for employees. In implementing this policy, the Commonwealth government introduced two bills, that would become the <b>Customs</b> <b>Tariff</b> Act 1906, and the Excise Tariff Act 1906, Higgins {{was a member of the}} Australian Parliament and spoke in support of the bills that imposed custom and excise duties that were payable on certain agricultural machinery, including stripper harvesters.

60|$|The {{situation}} was essentially artificial. There was little {{secret of the}} surrender of protection as a principle. In introducing the proposals for the reform of the <b>customs</b> <b>tariff,</b> Peel made the gentlemen around him shiver by openly declaring that on the general principle of free trade {{there was no difference}} of opinion; that all agreed in the rule that we should buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest; that even if the foreigner were foolish enough not to follow suit, it was still for the interest of this country to buy as cheap as we could, whether other countries will buy from us or no.[161] Even important cabinet colleagues found this too strong doctrine for them.|$|E

40|$|<b>Custom</b> <b>tariffs</b> and {{the policy}} of <b>custom</b> <b>tariffs</b> have always been {{important}} instruments in the protection of domestic production from foreign competition, though the more in the past, the less in today's global economic environment. The idea of protectionism in international trade hasn't evaded the European Union either. The European Union has a common protectionist policy against countries that are not member to it. The agricultural production {{and the policy}} of administrative levies on the import of agricultural products pertain to the area that enjoys the highest degree of protection. The realization of such protectionist policy makes the international trade less free, while the free movement of goods is quintessential to the economic growth of the European Union, other regional economic integrations, individual countries and the society as such. The World Trade Organization, which imposes its own rules on the international trade, the creation of regional economic organizations in today's environment {{of international trade and}} free-trade agreements between individual states shrank to minimal the diapason of various protectionist measures and instruments. The decline of the idea of protectionism in international trade is evidenced by data on the share of the <b>customs</b> <b>tariffs</b> in the total fiscal revenues of the European Union and of the GDP of the member states. Namely, the fiscal impact of <b>custom</b> <b>tariffs</b> for some years shows a descending tendency, above all due to the process of globalization in foreign trade and liberalization at the scale of global economy. The European Union will be able to facilitate the development of the regional economic integrations only through the liberalization of foreign trade, because the idea of protectionism in international trade doesn't have perspectives on the long run...|$|R
