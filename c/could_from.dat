According to Spurr, of Yamatos total crew of 3332, only 269 survived. The Americans lost 12 men in their attack on the Japanese fleet.|$|E
5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason {{to do business with}} the people of Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to be of interest to the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. To guarantee that this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he <b>could</b> <b>from</b> the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E
5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had {{made it difficult for}} the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it <b>could</b> <b>from</b> subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, {{transforming}} playsets were released. Some <b>could</b> transform <b>from</b> one playset to another, such as {{a factory}} to a test track. Others <b>could</b> transform <b>from</b> giant vehicles to playsets, {{such as a}} 6x6 to a jungle. Earlier ones included one that <b>could</b> transform <b>from</b> a toolbox to a city. Another innovative release was a line of special boats in the 1990s. While past boats had merely sunk and were not intended for water use, these new sets could actually float.|$|R
5|$|Although no {{warships}} {{protected the}} convoy, Commodore Dance knew that lookouts <b>could,</b> <b>from</b> a distance, mistake a large East Indiaman for a ship of the line. He raised flags that indicated that his fleet included {{part of the}} Royal Navy squadron operating in the Indian Ocean {{at the time and}} formed into a line of battle. Although Linois's ships were clearly superior, the British reaction unnerved him and he quickly broke off combat. Dance continued his ruse, pursuing Linois for two hours until the body of the convoy was safe. King George III knighted Dance for his courage and various mercantile and patriotic organisations awarded him large sums of money, while both Linois's own officers and the Emperor Napoleon personally castigated the French admiral for his failure to press the attack against a weaker and extremely valuable enemy. Although he remained in command of the squadron for another two years and had some minor success against undefended merchant ships, he suffered a string of defeats and inconclusive engagements against weaker British naval forces. Ironically, Linois was captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 by a numerically superior British battle squadron that he mistook for a merchant convoy.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army under Montgomery spent February at Medinine in {{south-eastern}} Tunisia. Expecting {{an imminent}} {{attack by the}} Axis, the Eighth Army mustered every anti-tank gun it <b>could</b> <b>from</b> Egypt and Libya. The 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Anti-Tank Regiment, including the Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery under Major Savory, duly advanced west from Benghazi and reached the front on 5 March 1943. The Germans and Italians assaulted Medinine the next day, but failed to make much progress and abandoned their attack by the evening. The Rhodesian gunners, held in reserve, did not {{take part in the}} engagement but were attacked from the air. The Rhodesians of the KRRC, now under the 7th Motor Brigade, moved up from Libya during early March. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, which had spent 1942 and the first months of 1943 in Iran and Iraq, returned to North Africa the same month, with the future Prime Minister Ian Smith in its ranks as a Hurricane pilot.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{building}} materials {{and other supplies}} led Admiral Graves to authorise a loyalist merchant to send his two ships Unity and Polly from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, escorted by the armed schooner Margaretta {{under the command of}} James Moore, a midshipman from Graves' flagship Preston. Moore also carried orders to recover what he <b>could</b> <b>from</b> the wreck of , which had apparently been run aground in Machias Bay by a patriot pilot in February 1775. After a heated negotiation, the Machias townspeople seized the merchant vessels and the schooner after a short battle in which Moore was killed. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels with breastwork, armed her with the guns and swivels taken from Margaretta and changed her name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, Jeremiah O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, Diligent and Tatamagouche, whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbour. In August 1775, the Provincial Congress formally recognised their efforts, commissioning both Machias Liberty and Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy, with Jeremiah O'Brien as their commander. The community would be a base for privateering until the war's end.|$|E

50|$|According to tradition, the Hu (胡) surname {{has several}} {{historical}} origins. First, Hu <b>could</b> derive <b>from</b> {{the family of}} Duke Hu of Chen. King Wu of Zhou (r. 1046-043 BCE) enfeoffed his son-in-law Gui Man 媯滿 (supposedly a descendent of the legendary sage king Emperor Shun) {{with the state of}} Chen (in modern Henan Province). His posthumous name was Duke Hu, and some of his descendants adopted Hu as their surname. Second, Hu <b>could</b> derive <b>from</b> two Zhou vassal states named Hu 胡, one located near Luohe (Henan Province) or another near Fuyang (Anhui Province). Third, Hu <b>could</b> derive <b>from</b> non-Chinese people adopting it as their surname. For example, in the 496 Change of Xianbei names to Han names, Hegu/Gegu 紇骨 was changed to Hu 胡. Fourth, Hu <b>could</b> derive <b>from</b> the clan name of the ancient Tiele people within the Xiongnu confederation.|$|R

25|$|Since the Indian {{community}} was geographically dispersed and divided, it comprised less than 25% in any constituency.

25|$|Writers in a {{specialized}} field {{or with a}} narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market {{in the form of}} small presses and self-publishing.

Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.|$|E
