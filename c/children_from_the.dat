5|$|The {{school system}} {{was created for}} the purpose of {{removing}} <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> influence of their own culture and assimilating them into the dominant Canadian culture. Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, about 30%, or roughly 150,000, of Indigenous children were placed in residential schools nationally. At least 6,000 of these students are estimated to have died while residents.|$|E

5|$|As Altrincham {{was part}} of the Bowdon parish, <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{township}} may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9schools, 1college, and 23teachers. The introduction of compulsory education {{during the second half of}} the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12church schools and 8private schools.|$|E
5|$|Brynn {{drove to}} the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} he did not believe her. The pair drove back to the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Children {{arrived at}} the camp in an {{emaciated}} and weak condition from other camps within the Ustaše camp system, {{with a total of}} 3,336 children passing through the camp. Between 449 and 1500 children died there, mainly from disease and malnutrition. A sub-camp was established in nearby Donja Reka. The Yugoslav Partisans liberated about 350 <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main camp inAugust 1942. In October 1942, about 500 of the surviving children were dispersed among local families by the Catholic aid group, Caritas; 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages, and another 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.|$|E

5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, {{he visited}} Botswana {{on behalf of}} the Football Association's {{international}} outreach week and played football with the <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> SOS Children's Village there. On 25 July 2009, Gascoigne appeared on a Sporting Heroes edition of the BBC television quiz The Weakest Link, where he engaged in banter with host Anne Robinson. The next day he played in an England versus Germany charity football match to help raise funds for the Sir Bobby Robson cancer fund. He took part in the first edition of Soccer Aid in 2006, playing for an England team captained by Robbie Williams.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together {{the money to}} send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E

5|$|Sherwood also adopted {{neglected}} or orphaned <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp. In 1807 she adopted Annie Child, {{a three-year-old}} {{who had been}} given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a malnourished two-year-old Sally Pownal. She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, {{on the advice of}} doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that neither she nor any of her children could survive in a tropical climate.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} of the building provides a home to the Fashion Museum, which was known before 2007 as the Museum of Costume. The collection was started by Doris Langley Moore, who gave her collection {{to the city of}} Bath in 1963. It focuses on fashionable dress for men, women and <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 16th century to the present day and has more than 30,000 objects. The earliest pieces are embroidered shirts and gloves from about 1600.|$|E
5|$|The {{pilot schemes}} (designated as identification, {{referral}} and tracking (IRT) schemes) began with Bolton council in 2003 {{and was used}} by eleven other local authorities. There were doubts as to the legality of Bolton council obtaining data of <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local Primary Care Trust {{to put on the}} database, but the council was eventually advised that it was legal. The other pilot areas followed, in different ways. On 8 December 2005, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, Ruth Kelly, made the official announcement of the introduction of the database, confirmed by the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, Beverley Hughes.|$|E

5|$|The {{school is}} a {{charitable}} trust governed by twelve foundation and seven nominated governors, the latter with links to Durham and Newcastle Universities, Durham County Council, Barnard Castle Town Council and the Old Barnardian Association. The school aims to offer the best independent education to <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North East of England. According to information provided to the Charities Commission, the income of the school was £8.6 million in the 2011–12-year, with {{the vast majority of}} the revenue coming from school fees. It has been a member of The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference since 1944.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large groups of women and <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
