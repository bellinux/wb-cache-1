5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe <b>change</b> <b>is</b> likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild <b>change</b> <b>is</b> projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this <b>change</b> <b>is</b> thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour <b>change</b> <b>is</b> mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the <b>change</b> <b>is</b> controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the <b>change</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{stationarity}} {{properties of}} seasonal precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> {{different from one}} season to another and climatic indices that were evidently related to seasonal precipitation changes also differ. Specifically, summer and autumn precipitation changes shared similar changing properties, being influenced mainly by AO. Summer and autumn precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> roughly stationary; spring and winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> nonstationary. Spring precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> influenced mainly by PDO. Winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> influenced by more climate oscillations. The impacts of ENSO and PDO on winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> pronounced. ENSO began to influence precipitation changes during autumn, {{and the influence of}} ENSO became significant during the winter season.|$|R

There are three choices that span {{the range of}} {{outcomes}} produced by the different global climate models used in the CMIP3 project. The Hot/Dry outcome represents a model whose average temperature <b>change</b> <b>was</b> on the high end and whose average rainfall <b>change</b> <b>was</b> on {{the lower end of}} all model projections. The Warm/Wet outcome represents a model whose average temperature <b>change</b> <b>was</b> on the lower end and whose average rainfall <b>change</b> <b>was</b> on the wetter end of the spectrum.

If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E
5|$|Climate <b>change</b> <b>is</b> the {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years.

5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling.

30|$|In summary, we need {{to stress}} that not all <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> viewed as quality flaws. Instead, only drastic, {{irregular}} <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> treated as errors and mistakes.

Because orthograde <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes {{can be seen as}} analogous to Aristotle's formal cause. More loosely, Aristotle's final cause can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.|$|R

5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary <b>change</b> <b>is</b> marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic <b>change</b> <b>is</b> necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|On the {{continent}} itself, the {{large volume of}} ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.
