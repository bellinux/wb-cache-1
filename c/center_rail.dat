25|$|Work {{was begun}} on the Great Incline with such steep grades that no mule could be flogged enough into {{negotiating}} it. Instead, materials were carried {{up on the}} back of laborers. Grading became a particular problem. While funiculars were usually considered to require four rails, two for the ascending car, and two for the descending car, there was not enough room to widen the grade to accommodate four rails. Over night the inventive Thaddeus Lowe {{came up with a plan}} to only use four rails where the cars pass each other and three rails on the upper and lower ends of the run, whereby the cars shared the <b>center</b> <b>rail.</b> The ingenious three-railed funicular not only fit, but it also reduced the amount of required materials. This three-railed design has been applied on other places as well (e.g. Angels Flight).|$|E

50|$|A key {{advantage}} for three-rail track is reverse loops, {{where a train}} enters a loop through a turnout and then exits through the same turnout in order to change the train's direction. With two-rail track, when the track reverses on itself, this causes a short circuit. With three-rail track, because the <b>center</b> <b>rail</b> remains constant and the outer rails are electrically identical, this causes no problems.|$|E
50|$|By 1920, the city's {{private and}} {{municipal}} rail lines {{were the most}} far-flung and most comprehensive {{in the world in}} mileage, even besting that of New York City.

2500|$|The scotch {{turbines}} produced (for example, on Plane 2 West) 235 horsepower using a 45-foot head {{of water}} and had a discharge rate of 1,000 cubic feet per minute. The winding drum was 12 feet in diameter, and had a spiral grove of 3 inch pitch. The rope was fastened on both ends to the drum, {{and there was a}} clutch which allowed reversing the direction of the wheel. The plane had 2 lines of steel rails, with a [...] "gauge" [...] of 12 foot 4½ inches from <b>center</b> of <b>rail</b> to <b>center.</b> <b>Rails</b> were 3⅛ inches wide at top, 3½ inches high, and weighed 76lbs/yard. [...] Also, the cradles had a brake, if things went downhill too fast, as well as the plane-man who would put about ½ the amount of full power through the turbine, so that the boat would not go down too fast. The water was fed into the turbines from below, thus relieving friction on the bearings and balancing them. Some turbines were also reported to develop 704 horsepower.|$|R
50|$|Early toy trains {{used two}} metal rail tracks like most real trains. However, {{manufacturers}} quickly found that using a <b>center</b> <b>rail</b> for electric {{power and the}} two outer rails for common or ground made electrical contact much more reliable and less prone to short circuits. Three rail contact also negates the need for insulated wheels, an important consideration before plastics became widely available. Most scales and gauges that predate HO scale used three rails for electric operation.|$|E

This car has been extensively modified for excursion service, with new floor, elevated side rails and <b>center</b> <b>rail,</b> bench seating for 20 as well as pass-through doorways at each end. The car at one time sported a headlight, bell, horn and control compartment and was used in any order on the train consist providing “lead car and trail car” service, but these items have since been removed.

50|$|The cable {{was pulled}} by two Hamilton Corliss steam engines that spun {{a set of}} cogwheels that drove the cable. Each engine had a 12 in {{diameter}} bore and a 30 in stroke. Steam was supplied by two Manning Patent vertical tubular boilers. As one car went {{up from the bottom}} of the incline, the other car went down from the top of the incline. There was a passing track in the middle of the run where the track split in two, and then rejoined. This was so the cars could pass each other without colliding, as they shared the <b>center</b> <b>rail</b> above and below the passing track.|$|E

More than 475 compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and electric vehicles (EVs) have been incorporated into city fleets. They've also launched Quick Charge L.

5000|$|Prior to the {{replacement}} of the Cushman Street Bridge in 1959, the old bridge was too narrow to accommodate both a large vehicle such as a truck or bus, and another vehicle. Vogler, with Warren A. Taylor as his attorney, sued University Bus Lines in 1948 in what the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner at the time called the [...] "Battle of the Bridge". Vogler sought a permanent injunction against the buses straddling the <b>center</b> <b>rail</b> of the bridge. The feud continued after the Wendell Street Bridge opened in 1953 and Greimann's buses continued using the Cushman bridge instead of the newer, wider bridge. Police were often involved in quelling these confrontations.|$|E
50|$|Decline {{began in}} 1948 {{with the opening}} of {{highways}} that increased Penticton's role as a resort and convention <b>center.</b> <b>Rail</b> business decreased and newer hotels were built. Between 1966 and 1975, the Incola underwent four ownership changes and new extensions and modifications erased the hotel's original appearance. Neglect led to safety hazards, resulting in the fire marshal's order to close the top floor in 1963. Two fires broke out in 1978, leaving a hole in the roof that was not repaired. Broken windows were boarded up and outside walls began to rot due to the absence of drain pipes. By the late 1970s, the premises had become a gathering place for bikers, minors, and regular performances by strippers that destroyed the hotel's reputation. It closed on August 27, 1979, and was demolished in March 1981.|$|E

50|$|Toboggan is a {{portable}} roller coaster {{that was built}} by Chance Industries from 1969 to the mid-1970s. The coaster features a small vehicle, holding two people, that climbs vertically inside a hollow steel tower then spirals back down around the same tower. There is a small section of track {{at the base of}} the tower with a few small dips and two turns to bring the ride vehicle back to the station. Each vehicle has a single rubber tire with a hydraulic clutch braking system that governs the speed of the vehicle as it descends the tower. The rubber tire engages a <b>center</b> <b>rail</b> that begins halfway through the first spiral. The ride stands 45 feet tall with a track length of 450 feet. A typical ride lasts approximately 70 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|In 1900, E. C. Morgan of Chicago {{received}} {{a patent on}} a rack railway system that was mechanically similar to the Riggenbach rack, but where the rack was also used as a third rail to power the electric locomotive. [...] Morgan went on to develop heavier locomotives and with J. H. Morgan, turnouts for this system. [...] In 1904, he patented a simplified but compatible rack, where the teeth on the engine pinions engaged square holes punched in a bar-shaped <b>center</b> <b>rail.</b> [...] J. H. Morgan patented several alternative turnout designs for use with this rack system. [...] Curiously, Morgan recommended an off-center rack {{in order to allow}} clear passage for pedestrians and animals walking along the tracks. [...] Some photos of early Morgan installations show this. [...] A simplified rack mounting system could be used when the Morgan rack was not used for third-rail power and the Morgan rack offered interesting possibilities for street railways. [...] The Morgan rack was good for grades of up to 16 percent.|$|E
