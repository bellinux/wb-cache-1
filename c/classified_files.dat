40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Past research into file type identification has employed many different techniques {{in an attempt}} to accurately <b>classify</b> <b>files</b> and file fragments including N-gram analysis. However, naive application of n-grams breaks down when handling n-grams that are greater than two bytes, due to the sparseness of the feature. As a result, other researchers have generally ignored long n-grams for filetype identification. This thesis explores the use of long n-grams for whole file and file fragment classification by building feature distributions of commonly occurring n-grams for single filetypes and using those distributions to <b>classify</b> unknown <b>files</b> and file fragments. This thesis also utilizes summarized n-grams in order to "collapse" similar n-grams within a file type into common n-grams. The algorithms developed to both generate and compare unknown files are presented as well as results from an experiment that was conducted using another researcher's data set...|$|R

40|$|Retrieval {{of files}} {{without the support}} of file system {{structures}} is arguably essential for digital forensics. Files are typically stored as sequences of data blocks, which have to be reconstructed in the retrieval process. This is commonly performed, among other approaches, through file carving, in general detecting the original block sequences by means of signatures of known headers and footers of files. Of course, this creates challenges with fragmented files, where blocks belonging to different files may be interleaved. Ways to <b>classify</b> <b>file</b> blocks into file types relying on their content may provide a support to achieve a successful reconstruction. We propose to <b>classify</b> <b>file</b> blocks using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and we do so by studying in-depth the impact of an appropriate selection of the features used in the classification process. We analyze several potential features and test their performance over a large and representative collection of file blocks and file types. We find out that SVM classifiers can achieve a good accuracy and that a specific type of features (based on byte frequency distribution) performs well across almost all of the examined file types...|$|R

40|$|Content-based file-type {{identification}} schemes {{often use}} byte-frequency distri-bution as a feature and use statistical and data mining techniques to <b>classify</b> <b>file</b> types. Since those schemes use the entire file content to obtain byte-frequency distribution and use all possible byte patterns in file classification, they are inefficient and time-consuming. This paper proposes two techniques {{to reduce the}} classification time. The first method is a feature selection technique, which uses a subset of highly-occurring byte patterns in building the representative model of a <b>file</b> type and <b>classifying</b> <b>files.</b> To evaluate its effectiveness, we applied it to the six most popular classification algorithms (i. e. neural network, linear discriminant analysis, K-means, K-nearest neigh-bor, decision tree, and support vector machine). On average, the K-nearest neighbor method achieved the optimum accuracy of 90 % using only 40 % of byte patterns; this reduces 55 % of computation time. The second method is the content sampling technique, which uses {{a small portion of}} a file to ob-tain its byte-frequency distribution. It is effective for large size files where a relatively small sample can generate the representative byte frequency distri-bution. For instance, it reduces the sampling size of MP 3 files from 5 MB to 400 KB (without compromising the accuracy). This is a 15 fold size reduction...|$|R
