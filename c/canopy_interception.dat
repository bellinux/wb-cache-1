Transpiration accounts for the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves.

40|$|Mixed and multi-layered forest {{ecosystems}} are sometimes more productive than monospecific and single-layered ones. It {{has been suggested}} that trees of different species and sizes occupy complementary positions in space which would act as a mechanism to increase <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> and wood production. However, greater <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> reduces the average amount and variability of transmitted radiation offering fewer opportunities for all species to regenerate and to maintain forest heterogeneity in the long-run. We investigated whether increasing overstory heterogeneity indeed results in greater <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> and lower variability in transmittance. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of forest stands with 3 typical forest structures, 10 mixtures of four tree species, and 3 different basal areas. We used the forest light interception model SAMSARALIGHT and performed three-way analyses of covariance to analyze the effects of the three varied components of forest heterogeneity. We found no evidence that increasing heterogeneity increases <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception.</b> In contrast, homogeneous stands intercept more light than heterogeneous stands. Variability in transmittance increased in some cases with compositional heterogeneity and, to a lesser extent, with tree size inequalities.

5000|$|Interception {{refers to}} {{precipitation}} {{that does not}} reach the soil, but is instead intercepted by the leaves, branches of plants and the forest floor. It occurs in the canopy (i.e. <b>canopy</b> <b>interception),</b> and in the forest floor or litter layer (i.e. forest floor interception [...] ). Because of evaporation, interception of liquid water generally leads to loss of that precipitation for the drainage basin, except for cases such as fog interception, but increase flood protection dramatically, Alila et al., (2009). Intercepted snowfall does not result in any notable amount of evaporation, {{and most of the}} snow falls off the tree by wind or melts. However, intercepted snow can more easily drift with the wind, out of the watershed. Conifers have a greater interception capacity than hardwoods. Their needles gives them more surface area for droplets to adhere to, and they have foliage in spring and fall, therefore interception also depends on the type of vegetation in a wooded area.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityInterception of photosynthetically active {{radiation}} (PAR) {{is fundamental}} to tree fruit canopy growth, fruit yield, and quality. Many studies have investigated PAR in traditional hedgerow orchard orchards but there are few reports from modern planar canopy architectures. This research aimed to develop a system capable of large-scale measurement of PAR interception and evaluate light relations in modern planar orchard systems. A mobile measurement system capable of continuously collecting high-density PAR data was developed. This system could maintain a constant spatial resolution 0. 01 × 0. 10 m/sample (traveling direction × perpendicular to traveling direction) between 0 - 3. 8 km/h. A graphic data acquisition interface was created for real-time monitoring data acquisition process. The mobile measurement system was utilized to develop a canopy mapping method and a light interception conversion method for obtaining the same measure basis. The canopy mapping method was designed to visualize the canopy shadow as though the sun were directly overhead (i. e., correcting distortion caused by the azimuth and zenith angles). This method was validated in a Y-trellis sweet cherry orchard at dormant and full canopy stages with average relative error of 3. 4 %± 3. 1 % and 4. 8 %± 2. 6 % respectively. An additional study determined {{the best time to}} take single measurement representative of daily <b>canopy</b> PAR <b>interception</b> based on diurnal and seasonal data. The optimum measurement time to represent diurnal PAR interception in a vertical fruiting wall architecture of sweet cherry was from 09 : 30 h to 10 : 30 h (daylight saving time) with ± 10 % tolerance interval of daily light <b>interception.</b> <b>Canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> varies according to measurement time and/or location, resulting different measure basis. Therefore, a light interception conversion method was developed to obtain light interception on the same measure basis. The conversion method was validated in a vertical planar orchard with overall root mean square error of 0. 03 and mean absolute percentage error of 5. 32 %. This research has generated a tool and guidelines for its use in obtaining accurate <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> in modern planar orchard systems.

However, crop models describing the dynamic changes in canopy structure with environmental conditions and the complex interactions between <b>canopy</b> structure, light <b>interception,</b> and dry mass production are only gradually emerging. Using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) as a model crop, a dynamic functional-structural plant model (FSPM) was constructed, parameterized, and evaluated to analyse the effects of temperature on architectural traits, which strongly influence <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> and shoot dry mass. The FSPM predicted the organ growth, organ size, and shoot dry mass over time with high accuracy (> 85 %). Analyses of this FSPM showed that, {{in comparison with the}} reference canopy, shoot dry mass may be affected by leaf angle by as much as 20 %, leaf curvature by up to 7 %, the leaf length: width ratio by up to 5 %, internode length by up to 9 %, and curvature ratios and leaf arrangement by up to 6 %. Tomato canopies at low temperature had higher canopy density and were more clumped due to higher leaf area and shorter internodes. Interestingly, dry mass production and light interception of the clumped canopy were more sensitive to changes in architectural traits. The complex interactions between architectural traits, <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception,</b> dry mass production, and environmental conditions can be studied by the dynamic FSPM, which may serve as a tool for designing a canopy structure which is 'ideal' in a given environment.

40|$|The <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> {{capacity}} {{is a small}} but {{key part of the}} surface hydrology, which affects the amount of water intercepted by vegetation and therefore the partitioning of evaporation and transpiration. However, little research with climate models has been done to understand the effects of a range of possible <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> capacity parameter values. This is in part due to the assumption that it does not significantly affect climate. Near global evapotranspiration products now make evaluation of <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> capacity parameterisations possible. We use a range of canopy water interception capacity values from the literature to investigate the effect on climate within the climate model HadCM 3. We find that the global mean temperature is affected by up to - 0. 64 K globally and - 1. 9 K regionally. These temperature impacts are predominantly due to changes in the evaporative fraction and top of atmosphere albedo. In the tropics, the variations in evapotranspiration affect precipitation, significantly enhancing rainfall. Comparing the model output to measurements, we find that the default <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> capacity parameterisation overestimates <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> loss (i. e. canopy evaporation) and underestimates transpiration. Overall, decreasing <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> capacity improves the evapotranspiration partitioning in HadCM 3, though the measurement literature more strongly supports an increase. The high sensitivity of climate to the parameterisation of <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> {{capacity is}} partially due to the high number of light rain-days in the climate model that means that interception is overestimated.

We use a neutron transport model with various representations of the forest and different parameters describing the subsurface to match measured profiles and time series of thermal and epithermal neutron intensities at a field site in Denmark. A sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the effect of forest canopy representation, soil moisture, complexity of soil matrix chemistry, forest litter, soil bulk density, <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> and forest biomass on neutron intensity. The results show that forest biomass has a significant influence on the neutron intensity profiles at the examined field site, altering both the shape of the profiles and the ground level thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratio.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{rainfall}} interception by canopies {{plays an important}} role in the hydrological cycle. The fraction of rainfall which is intercepted is largely dependent on species-specific vegetation properties, such as leaf- and branch architecture and canopy structure and - density. Because these vegetation properties spatially vary, <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> is a spatially variable process. However, these species-specific vegetation properties are often not, or insufficiently included in hydrological models which focus for example on rainfall-runoff processes, soil moisture balances, transpiration and groundwater recharge from rainfall.

This study aimed at improving an existing spatial interception mapping approach by including relations between species-specific vegetation properties and interception. In order to achieve this goal, a two-fold method was applied. First, the influence of species-specific differences of leaf-and canopy structures on the interception process was studied.

The monthly variations in the modeled soil water content by measured and simulated components (<b>canopy</b> <b>interception,</b> plant transpiration, soil evaporation) were then compared with in situ measured soil water content. Our results shows that the modeled monthly water loss (<b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> + soil evaporation + plant transpiration) by measured and simulated components ranges from 43. 78 mm to 113. 95 mm and from 47. 76 mm to 125. 63 mm, respectively, while the monthly input of water (precipitation) ranges from 27. 30 mm to 108. 30 mm. The relative error between soil water content modeled by measured and simulated components was 6. 41 %. To sum up, the net change in soil water (ΔSW) is negative in every month of the growing season. The soil moisture is approaching to wilting coefficient {{at the end of}} the growth season, and the soil moisture recovered during the following season...|$|E
40|$|Estimating <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> {{of water}} by plants during {{rainfall}} or sprinkler irrigation {{is a critical}} step for evaluating water-use efficiency. Most existing experimental studies and mathematic models of <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> have {{paid little attention to}} the interception losses of water by herbaceous plants. To better understand the <b>canopy</b> <b>interception</b> processes of herbaceous plants and to estimate the interception losses, a process-based dynamic interception model for alfalfa canopy was developed and validated by an experiment under conditions of simulated sprinkler irrigation. The parameters of the model included the maximum interception, the rate of interception of the alfalfa canopy, and the duration of sprinkler irrigation. The model demonstrated that the amount of interception increased rapidly with duration in the early stage of sprinkler irrigation, and then gradually leveled off until the maximum retention capacity of the canopy was reached. The maximum interception by the alfalfa canopy, ranging from 0. 29 to 1. 26 mm, increased nonlinearly with the increase of leaf area index (LAI) and sprinkling intensity. The rate of interception increased with the decrease of LAI and the increase of sprinkling intensities. Meanwhile, a nonlinear equation based on sprinkling intensity and plant height was proposed in order to more practically estimate the maximum interception by alfalfa canopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of awns in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) {{has to be}} evaluated whenever an increase in grain yield is expected due to a greater photosynthetic capacity of the awned ear. Awned and awnless isolines of durum wheat were compared in a 3 -year field trial in Sardinia (Italy). Ear and flag-leaf size, radiation <b>interception,</b> <b>canopy</b> temperature, yield, and yield components were measured. Awns increased the ear surface area from 36 to 59...|$|R
40|$|Salinity in {{agricultural}} soils has large impact on plant performance. Waterlogging and anoxia due to poor soil structure {{is a major}} problem for crop production in saline heavy clay soils. Inadequate oxygen concentration in the rhizosphere exacerbates the effect of salt and leads to poor plant performance. An experiment in the screen house was conducted to investigate growth and yield performance of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) supplied with subsurface aerated water or non-aerated water to soil with four different salinity (ECe) levels of 2, 8, 14, 20 dS/m. The interaction between salinity and aeration was found to be non-significant for the variables measured. Cotton produced a significantly higher dry matter and lint yield with aerated water, irrespective of soil salinity level. The increase in yield was accompanied by an increase in root mass, <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> and harvest index...|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{with the}} Hadley Centre general {{circulation}} model (HadCM 3), including carbon cycle model and forced by a ‘business-as-usual’ emissions scenario, predict a rapid loss of Amazonian rainforest {{from the middle}} of this century onwards. The robustness of this projection to both uncertainty in physical climate drivers and the formulation of the land surface scheme is investigated. We analyse how the modelled vegetation cover in Amazonia responds to (i) uncertainty in the parameters specified in the atmosphere component of HadCM 3 and their associated influence on predicted surface climate. We then enhance the land surface description and (ii) implement a multilayer <b>canopy</b> light <b>interception</b> model and compare with the simple ‘big-leaf’ approach used in the original simulations. Finally, (iii) we investigate the effect of changing the method of simulating vegetation dynamics from an area-based model (TRIFFID) to a more complex size- and age-structured approximation of an individual-based model (ecosystem demography) ...|$|R
