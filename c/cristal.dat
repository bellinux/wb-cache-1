5|$|The Bic <b>Cristal</b> (stylised as BIC Cristal; {{also known}} as the Bic pen) is an {{inexpensive}} disposable ballpoint pen mass-produced and sold by Société Bic of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France. It was first launched in December 1950 and is by far the best selling pen in the world – the 100 billionth was sold in September 2006. It has become the archetypal ballpoint pen and is considered ubiquitous, {{to the extent that the}} Museum of Modern Art has made it a permanent part of its collection. Its hexagonal form and design mimics a classic lead pencil; it is sold in a variety of colours.|$|E

5|$|The Copa Libertadores {{stayed on}} Brazilian soil for the {{remainder}} of the 1990s as Cruzeiro, Vasco da Gama and Palmeiras took the spoils. The cup of 1997 pitted Cruzeiro against Peruvian club Sporting <b>Cristal.</b> The key breakthrough came in the second leg of the final when Cruzeiro broke the deadlock with just under 15 minutes left in a match attended by over 106,000 spectators in the Mineirão. Vasco da Gama defeated Barcelona SC with ease to record their first title in 1998. The decade ended on a high note when Palmeiras and Deportivo Cali, both runners-up in the competition before, vied to become winners for the first time in 1999. The final was a dramatic back-and-forth match that went into penalties. Luiz Felipe Scolari managed to lead yet another club to victory as the Verdão won 4–3 in São Paulo.|$|E

Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after <b>Cristal</b> offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like <b>Cristal,</b> tells Nomi that what she is doing is no different from prostitution.|$|E

25|$|Crystal Cubism (French: Cubisme <b>cristal</b> or Cubisme de <b>cristal)</b> is a {{distilled}} form of Cubism {{consistent with}} a shift, between 1915 and 1916, towards {{a strong emphasis on}} flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes.

When Nomi tells <b>Cristal</b> she dances at Cheetah's Topless Club, <b>Cristal</b> derisively tells her that what she does is akin to prostitution.

James bails her out of jail, but she pays him little notice.|$|E

25|$|The inexpensive, {{disposable}} Bic <b>Cristal</b> (also simply Bic pen or Biro) {{is reportedly}} {{the most widely}} sold pen in the world. It was the Bic company's first product and is still synonymous with the company name. The Bic <b>Cristal</b> {{is part of the}} permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, acknowledged for its industrial design. Its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden pencil and is transparent, showing the ink level in the reservoir. Originally a sealed streamlined cap, the modern pen cap has a small hole at the top to meet safety standards, helping to prevent suffocation if children suck it into the throat.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, {{high-end}} champagne brands have {{been featured in}} rap and hip hop music and videos; bottles featured in videos are often quite blingy and distinctive, often gold. The Louis Roederer brand <b>Cristal,</b> with a gold label, has seen increased popularity since the mid-to-late 1990s due to its association with rap and hip hop artists, notably the New York rappers Biggie Smalls (the Notorious B.I.G.), Puff Daddy, and Jay-Z. This high-end image has been cultivated and managed by Cristal's US importer, Maisons Marques. Since 2006, <b>Cristal</b> has seen a loss of popularity and some boycotts, notably by Jay-Z, due to statements perceived as racist, with other champagnes such as Armand de Brignac (gold bottle) making inroads.|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} of the DVCS calorimeter during data taking has degraded the optical properties of the <b>cristals</b> in a time dependent way. This note presents a method which allows to determine the effective gain of each single block all along data taking, relying on the two absolute elastic calibrations performed {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the experiment. Consideration of time dependent gain is shown to improve the missing mass resolution, allowing for a better identification of DVCS events...|$|R

This is the first reference to Albian evaporites in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin, wihch, on the other hand, were formed in a general humid climate.
