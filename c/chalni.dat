5000|$|A tamis (pronounced [...] "tammy", {{also known}} as a drum sieve, or <b>chalni</b> in Indian cooking) is a kitchen utensil, shaped {{somewhat}} like a snare drum, that acts as a strainer, grater, or food mill. A tamis has a cylindrical edge, made of metal or wood, that supports a disc of fine metal, nylon, or horsehair mesh. To use one, the cook places the tamis above a bowl and adds the ingredient to be strained {{in the center of the}} mesh. The food is then pushed through using a scraper or pestle. Tamises have been in use since the Middle Ages.|$|E
