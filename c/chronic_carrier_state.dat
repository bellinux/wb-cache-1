Unlike Hepatitis A, which is spread by the fecal-oral route and {{is indicative of}} a breakdown in food safety or potable water protection, Hepatitis B, C and HIV are spread by contact with bodily fluids, most frequently blood, although {{in the case of}} HIV, not exclusively so. Also, unlike Hepatitis A in which the sufferer almost always recovers completely, or rarely dies, both Hepatitis B and C give rise to <b>chronic</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>state</b> and indolent disease in many. At present, Hepatitis C is the commonest reason for liver transplantation in the US while HIV is currently incurable although its clinical course can be modified. In any case, between them, they have changed awareness of infectious disease in sports, and certainly changed management on the playing surface. Ironically, evidence for transmission of any of the three as a result of injury and/or contact on the playing surface is exceedingly limited and the greatest risk to the athlete surrounds behavior that may take place off court. A case report in 1982 described 5 of 10 members of a Japanese high school sumo wrestling club who contracted hepatitis. It was hypothesized that spread had occurred through skin cuts and abrasions. An outbreak of HBV in an American football team was reported in 2000. Eleven of 65 athletes were found to be HBV positive in a 19-month surveillance period. Contact with open wounds of an HBV carrier was again hypothesized. Interestingly, both of those case reports originated in Japan. HBV transmission has been estimated to be 50 to 100 times more likely than the risk of transmission of HIV. HBV is also more environmentally stable, is resistant to alcohol and some detergents, and to be capable of surviving on environmental surfaces for more than seven days. [...] The risk of transmission in sport has been estimated at between one transmission in every 10,000 to 50,000 games to one transmission in every 850,000 to 4.25 million games. [...] These calculations are based on the estimated prevalence of HBV among athletes and it should be appreciated that aggressive and successful HBV immunization programs have been promoted since. Another study has described the prevalence of HBV infection in athletes as being no different from blood donors of the same age.Regardless, prudent preventive measures as advocated by the Pediatrics Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness and paraphrased as follows are in wide use: ...|$|E

40|$|The asymptomatic, <b>chronic</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>state</b> of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi {{occurs in}} the bile-rich {{gallbladder}} and is frequently associated {{with the presence of}} cholesterol gallstones. We have previously demonstrated that salmonellae form biofilms on human gallstones and cholesterol-coated surfaces in vitro and that bile-induced biofilm formation on cholesterol gallstones promotes gallbladder colonization and maintenance of the carrier state. Random transposon mutants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium were screened for impaired adherence to and biofilm formation on cholesterol-coated Eppendorf tubes but not on glass and plastic surfaces. We identified 49 mutants with this phenotype. The results indicate that genes involved in flagellum biosynthesis and structure primarily mediated attachment to cholesterol. Subsequent analysis suggested that the presence of the flagellar filament enhanced binding and biofilm formation in the presence of bile, while flagellar motility and expression of type 1 fimbriae were unimportant. Purified Salmonella flagellar proteins used in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that FliC was the critical subunit mediating binding to cholesterol.

Methodology: The study was performed at a tertiary care medical center in North India and involved 52 patients with CaGB, 223 patients with benign gallbladder diseases, 508 healthy individuals and, 424 corpses. For the detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, hepatobiliary specimens were subjected to DNA extraction for specific nested- PCR amplification of the S. Typhi flagellin gene. Anti-Vi S. Typhi antibodies were detected in serum samples from patients by indirect haemagglutination. Results: Thirty five of the 52 (67. 3 %) CaGB patients were PCR-positive for the S. Typhi flagellin gene; significantly higher than for patients with benign gallbladder diseases (95 / 223, 42. 6 %; p< 0. 01) and corpses (35 / 424, 8. 2 %; p< 0. 001). The numbers of individuals that had significant anti-Vi antibody titres (â‰¥ 160) in their serum were 20 / 52 (38. 5 %) for CaGB patients, 31 / 223 (13. 9 %) for patients with benign gallbladder diseases, and 47 / 508 (9. 2 %) for healthy individuals. Conclusions: Specific nested-PCR amplification of the S. Typhi flagellin gene in hepato-biliary specimens was more sensitive for detection of S. Typhi carriage than anti-Vi antibody titres in serum.

40|$|Remarkable {{progress}} has been made in our understanding of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the past 25 years. Availability of sensitive HBV DNA assays and application of sophisticated immunological techniques led to the recognition that HBV replication persists throughout the course of chronic HBV infection, and host immune response plays a pivotal role in HBV-related liver disease. Knowledge of the HBV genome organization and replication cycle led to the unraveling of HBV genotypes and molecular variants, which contribute to the heterogeneity in outcome of chronic HBV infection.

HBxAg may also stimulate the expression of positive growth regulators, such as insulin-like growth factor II and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor. The finding that HBxAg may compromise DNA repair and that it may effect the normal turnover of growth-regulatory molecules in the proteasome may also contribute to its carcinogenic properties.

40|$|Hepatitis B is {{a disease}} that affects people {{throughout}} the world, and over 200 million are persistent carriers of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The chronic sequelae of this infec-tion include chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The development of safe and highly effective hepatitis B vaccines now provides {{the means by which}} HBV infection, including the HBV <b>chronic</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>state,</b> can be prevented and the related mortality significantly reduced. The cost of these vaccines has significantly decreased and will soon approach levels at which the cost-effectiveness (cost per death prevented) of hepatitis B vaccine will be similar to that of other childhood vaccines. In-tegration of hepatitis B vaccine into the Expanded Programme on Immunization for mass vaccination of infants in areas where HBV infection is endemic and morbidity is high would be the most effective means of providing the coverage necessary for effective con-trol and prevention. Hepatitis B {{is a disease}} of global distribution. The reservoir of infection comprises> 200 million per-sistent carriers of this virus. The hepatitis B viru...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{has been}} a worldwide health problem, with two billion people having been infected with HBV, 360 million <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and 600 000 annual deaths from HBV-related liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. 1 Three quarters of <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> are Asians.

40|$|Background: It is {{estimated}} that about 370 million people are <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> of HBV worldwide. Apparently 3 % of Iranian populations are <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> of this virus. We aimed to evaluate the viral DNA in biological fluids of chronic hepatitis patients compared to a control group. Methods: The current case-control {{study was designed to}} evaluate the viral DNA in biological fluids of 70 chronic hepatitis patients compared to a control group using ELISA, PCR and Real Time. Results: All individuals (100 %) in case group were HBsAg positive while in control group only 2 individuals (2. 8 %) were HBsAg positive. Three individuals, in control group were positive using PCR and Real Time PCR indicating that about 7 % of those in control group were <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> of HBV. The interesting point was the copy of viral DNA; (5. 49 Ã— 104, 2. 162 Ã— 103 and 7. 26 Ã— 106) for 3 <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> using sera while it was about (5. 71 Ã— 103, 1. 45 Ã— 102 and 2. 56 Ã— 105) using ear cerumen confirming the necessity of investigating for the carriers of HBV in different biological fluid and by different methods. Conclusion: It can be concluded <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> of hepatitis B are much more than what is diagnosed by routine diagnostic tests. On the other hand ELISA alone can not be relied on as a complete test for screening of <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> in hepatitis B. PCR and Real Time PCR are more reliable tests for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to evaluate the prevalence, incidence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in HBsAg <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers.</b> The evaluation of stored sera was combined with the follow up of a cohort of cases observed in a referral-based university hospital. A total of 183 HBsAg asymptomatic <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> were identified during routine screening and followed for a mean period of 3. 8 years. Stored sera and sera obtained during follow-up were tested for anti-HCV using ELISA. Second-generation RIBA (Ortho) was used as a possible confirmatory test. Demographic data and risk factors were assessed using a standard questionnaire. The prevalence of HCV infection in HBsAg <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> was 2. 7 % (95 % Cl: 1. 2 %- 63 %), higher in males than females (3. 1 % vs 1. 8 %, p = 0. 52) and also higher than that found in voluntary blood donors from the same region. Only 3 out of 5 ELISA-positive cases were RIBA-positive. Patients positive for both types of virus more frequently admitted drug abusers. The presence of anti-HCV was not significantly related to the histological severity. During follow-up no new cases of infection were found. Conclusions: The prevalence of HCV infection in asymptomatic <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> is higher than in blood donors but lower than previously reported for other populations of chronic hepatitis B cases. HCV infection was not found responsible for the frequency or the type of lesions observed in these HBsAg <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers.</b> The {{objectives of}} the study were to evaluate the prevalence, incidence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in HBsAg <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers.</b> The evaluation of stored sera was combined with the follow up of a cohort of cases observed in a referral-based university hospital.
