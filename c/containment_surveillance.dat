Data collection spanned {{the period of}} relocation of Brisbane Women’s from Annerley to Wacol, from a traditional lock-and-key establishment to a keyless unit. This study investigated inmate women’s accounts of education using interview data and analysis of policy. While the study drew upon feminist criminology theory and conversation analysis to provide a theoretical dialogue for investigating prison education, this paper investigates more broadly five key themes. They are categorised as a culture of <b>containment</b> and <b>surveillance,</b> types of education, access to education, pedagogical issues {{and the role of}} support groups in education. Women’s prisons and their rituals have been constructed by men for men, sometimes with concessions made for women and criminal laws have been drawn with reference to the way that men define women and perpetuate the dependence of women on more powerful male others. The structural and interactional features of oral texts such as interviews were examined to understand the educational experiences of women inmates. The research found that women’s involvement in prison education is framed by a culture of <b>containment</b> and <b>surveillance.</b> In the keyless prison, heightened electronic security reported increases in internal body searches and routinized head counts were found to exacerbate the difficulties women inmates experience in prison education.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in radio frequency communication technologies offer {{the motivation to}} consider the use of wireless communication in nuclear safeguards applications. From the Nuclear Safeguards Inspectorates' (NSI) point of view, wireless data transmission - which would be supplemental to wired communication - is attractive for the ease of installation {{and the ability to}} respond to the changing requirements as the inspection approach evolves, resulting in a reduction of costs. However, for wireless technologies to be considered as a viable complement to cables, a number of concerns have to be addressed. First, nuclear operators need to be guaranteed that RF transmission will not interfere with the facilities safety and physical security systems. On their side, the NSI must be satisfied that <b>Containment</b> and <b>Surveillance</b> equipment and data transmission processes will not be affected by the other existing RF equipment. Second, it is desirable, both for the NSI and the operators, that the data being transmitted is not available for analysis by a third party. In addition, the NSI require data to be authenticated as close to the point of acquisition as possible. This paper was prepared as an account of work performed and approved by the ESARDA Working Group on <b>Containment</b> and <b>Surveillance.</b> It is the first of a suite dedicated to bridging RF technologies with safeguards monitoring applications. The paper focuses on technological issues: it introduces basic concepts underlying wireless communication, including methods for transmission, issues on power consumption, frequency, range, and considerations on interference and noise resilience.

The role of nuclear safeguards in these and other events relating to the world`s nuclear material inventory is to assure safekeeping of these materials and to verify the inventory and use of nuclear materials as reported by states that have signed the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty throughout the world. Nuclear safeguards are measures prescribed by domestic and international regulatory bodies such as DOE, NRC, IAEA, and EURATOM and implemented by the nuclear facility or the regulatory body.

Conventional fiber optic seals provide methods for monitoring enclosed inventories, but they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks based on classical physics. We address these vulnerabilities with the development of a quantum seal that offers the ability to detect the intercept-resend attack using quantum integrity verification. Our approach represents an application of entanglement to provide guarantees in the authenticity of the seal state by verifying it was transmitted coherently. We implement these ideas using polarization-entangled photon pairs that are verified after passing through a fiber-optic channel testbed. Using binary detection theory, we find the probability of detecting inauthentic signals is greater than 0. 9999 with a false alarm chance of $ 10 ^{- 9 }$ for a 10 second sampling interval. In addition, we show how the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect concurrently provides a tight bound on redirection attack, in which tampering modifies the shape of the seal. Our measurements limit the tolerable path length change to sub-millimeter disturbances. These tamper-indicating features of the quantum seal offer unprecedented security for unattended monitoring systems. Comment: 9 Pages, 6 Figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{community in the}} post-Cold War period has {{expressed an interest in}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) using its expertise in support of the arms control and disarmament process in unprecedented ways. The pledges of the US and Russian presidents to place excess defense materials under some type of international inspections raises the prospect of using IAEA safeguards approaches for monitoring excess materials, which include both classified and unclassified materials. Although the IAEA has suggested the need to address inspections of both types of materials, the most troublesome and potentially difficult problems involve approaches to the inspection of classified materials. The key issue for placing classified nuclear components and materials under IAEA safeguards is the conflict between these traditional IAEA materials accounting procedures and the US classification laws and nonproliferation policy designed to prevent the disclosure of critical weapon-design information. Possible verification approaches to classified excess defense materials could be based on item accountancy, attributes measurements, and <b>containment</b> and <b>surveillance.</b> Such approaches are not wholly new; in fact, they are quite well established for certain unclassified materials. Such concepts may be applicable to classified items, but the precise approaches have yet to be identified, fully tested, or evaluated for technical and political feasibility, or for their possible acceptability in an international inspection regime. Substantial work remains in these areas. This paper examines many of the challenges presented by international inspections of classified materials...|$|R
40|$|In {{the year}} of its 40 th anniversary, ESARDA can look back on a wealth of {{achievements}} in the European safeguards area, to which its members have substantially contributed. Also today, ESARDA is more active then ever, both due to an extended partnership (with many new members joining in recent years) and a pro-active attitude to tackle new and upcoming issues through its many sectoral Working Groups. ESARDA constitutes today of 9 working groups : Non Destructive Analysis, Destructive Analysis, <b>Containment</b> and <b>Surveillance,</b> Verification Technologies and Methodologies, Integrated Safeguards, Nuclear Material Accounting and Control Audit Focus, Training and Knowledge Management, Fuel Fabrications Plants, Editorial Committee. Most of these working groups organise regular meetings in which they discuss the progress, achievements, problems, challenges and future needs for R&D. They jointly work out solutions to problems and stay abreast of the latest safeguards R&D aspects. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} some most relevant recent achievements of the ESARDA Working Groups and will provide an insight in the challenges identified for safeguards R&D in the near and medium term future. Due to the fact that ESARDA has a healthy mix of members from research, authorities, safeguards inspectorates, industry etc, and that the Working Groups do not work in isolation, ESARDA also discusses and gathers very valuable experience with respect to aspects of safeguards implementation on national and international level. Some feedback of this experience will be included in this paper and food for thought will be delivered for the future safeguards implementation schemes. JRC. E. 9 -Nuclear security (Ispra...|$|R
