40|$|International audienceIn the <b>cops</b> and robber game, {{two players}} play {{alternately}} by moving their tokens {{along the edges}} of a graph. The first one plays with the <b>cops</b> and the second one with one robber. The <b>cops</b> aim at capturing the robber, while the robber tries to infinitely evade the <b>cops.</b> The main problem consists in minimizing the number of <b>cops</b> used to capture the robber in a graph. This minimum number is called the cop-number of the graph. If the <b>cops</b> and the robber have the same velocity, 3 + 3 / 2 g <b>cops</b> are sufficient to capture one robber in any graph with genus g (Schröder, 2001).

40|$|Communities of {{practice}} (<b>CoPs)</b> {{have been identified}} as a means to enable acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge in organizations. <b>CoPs</b> complement or even replace approaches where the focus is on storing and retrieving codified knowledge in documents and systems. This paper highlights some of the problematic aspects of using <b>CoPs</b> as a tool to improve knowledge sharing. Theories on coordination are put forward as a theoretical frame to explain the role of <b>CoPs</b> in organizational functioning. Our study of <b>CoPs</b> in the Amsterdam Police Force shows how <b>CoPs</b> in organizations face several dilemmas. How can <b>CoPs</b> be self-directing and simultaneously contribute to organizational performance? How can they utilize the IT opportunities of contacting anybody, any time, any place and simultaneously circumvent the threats of low commitment and poor mutual understanding in virtual groups? How can members of <b>CoPs</b> produce shared repertoire without falling in the trap of groupthink? How can <b>CoPs</b> act as environments for sharing tacit as well as explicit knowledge? Coordination theory suggests how members of <b>CoPs</b> in organizations can deal with such competing values by making situational choices that reflect paradoxical guidelines. We discuss how police officers use such paradoxical guidelines in organizational prototyping sessions...|$|R

5|$|Mow <b>Cop</b> Castle is an elaborate, Gothic Revival folly, built {{two miles}} from Rode Hall, at Mow <b>Cop,</b> land {{previously}} belonging to the estate. Dating from 1754, the castle was built by Randle Wilbraham III and designed by the Hiorne brothers, the architects {{who worked on the}} 1752 improvements to the hall. It was constructed to improve the view across the valley from the hall. The family often used it as a summer house and for picnics. The castle fell into disrepair a number of times in the 19th century and several programmes of restoration were completed, including the replacement of the doors at a cost of £4 4s. The castle and surrounding land were sold by the Wilbrahams in 1923. The castle is renowned as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism, following a camp meeting there in 1807.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Risk {{factors for}} {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) {{have been proven}} {{to be associated with}} an increased oxidative stress. Several studies have considered cholesterol oxidation products (<b>COPs)</b> as specific in vivo markers of oxidative stress. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between the levels of <b>COPs</b> derived from autoxidation processes and established cardiovascular risk factors, comparing the levels of serum <b>COPs</b> in subjects with or without showing values out of the reference ranges. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study in which 88 subjects were recruited and individual and total <b>COPs</b> from autoxidation origin was analyzed in serum by GC-MS. The simultaneous correlation of <b>COPs</b> with different CVD risk factors have been analyzed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A great variability of total <b>COPs</b> concentrations were found. Subjects presented total <b>COPs</b> values from 0. 091 to 2. 052 μg/mL. Total <b>COPs</b> were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in patients with hypertriglycerolemia, hypertension, diabetes and overweight/ obesity status compared to those subjects who did not present those CVD risk factors. Moreover, 7 α and 7 β hydroxycholesterol and 7 -ketocholesterol were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in patients with hypertension and diabetes. No significant differences in total <b>COPs</b> were found between patients with and without hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results showed that the analyzed <b>COPs</b> correlate well with at least 4 out of 6 risk factors of development of CVD...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coping</b> with {{academic}} difficulties {{at a university}} was based on six aspects: Motivation and Planning, Friends and Planning, Studying and Planning, Emotions, Spiritual Help and <b>Coping</b> by Doing Nothing. Stem-items for each aspect were conceptually ordered by difficulty. Each of the stem-items was answered from three perspectives, Good <b>Coping</b> Strategies, Actual <b>Coping</b> Strategies, and Stress Reduction Strategies. The three response categories were No, not on any occasion this semester; Yes, on 1 to 3 occasions this semester, and Yes, on 4 or more occasions this semester. The convenience sample was 337 students studying education at an Australian university and data were analysed with a Rasch measurement model. A scale was created in which the difficulties of the items were ordered from easy to hard and the student measures of <b>Coping</b> were ordered from low to high. <b>Coping</b> by Doing Nothing and Using Spiritual Help stem-items didn 2 ̆ 7 t fit the measurement model and were deleted. This left an effective item sample of 21 (7 stem-items times 3). The proportion of observed student variance considered true was 0. 88.
