The study was realized for the cooling season of one year based multiannual values of ambient temperature and relative humidity. It was considered two types of fresh air conditioning systems. The classic system was considered composed of a <b>cooling</b> <b>battery</b> powered by an electric chiller and the evaporative system was considered composed by a recuperative heat exchanger, indirect evaporative cooling equipment and the same classic <b>cooling</b> <b>battery.</b> It {{was found that the}} fresh air cooling period starts in May and ends in September.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of {{freezing point depression}} {{as a method of}} determining osmotic potentials in solutions has been used for some time. Re-cently, this same principle has been applied to the determination of moisture stress in plant leaves. The advent of efficient solid state Pettier cooling units has made possible the construction of portable field freezing-point meters of rela-tively low cost and acceptable accuracy (1). Some problems still exist with these units. The first is that the temperature control circuit for the Peltier battery is relatively complex, requiring some skill {{on the part of the}} person constructing its. Next is the fact that the units are not, strictly speaking, portable since they require a large 12 -volt DC current and so are restricted to use in a relatively small area around a vehicle whose battery can supply this current. Lastly, the price of parts for these units varies from $ 200 to $ 250, which becomes prohibitive if a number of units is desired. The unit described here eliminates these problems by use of a different cooling method. The Peltier <b>cooling</b> <b>battery</b> is replaced by a can of pressurized Freon 33 3 refrigerant. The freezing chamber is a piece of %-inch O. D. copper tubing inserted through and soldered onto the side of a large metal snap-on cap for standard-size aerosol cans. This type of cap is used by several com-panies packaging aerosol products and is ap-proximately the same diameter as the can.

40|$|During the 1996 - 1997 {{academic}} year, a {{group of}} five Swarthmore College students created Garnet One, a Hybrid Electric Vehicle. This first version of the HEV was complete, although due to project time constraints, impractical. A team of four students (Jonathan Fiorello, Benjamin Hall, Erik Johnson, and Melissa Morell) continued work on the project in Fall 1997, {{and three of the}} students (Fiorello, Hall, and Johnson) continued work on the vehicle during the Spring of 1998. Their goal was to compete in and complete the 1998 Tour de Sol race without having to constantly worry about system or component failures, or vehicle breakdowns, problems which the 1996 - 1997 team faced daily. To accomplish this goal, the 1997 - 1998 team re-designed and re-engineered all the problematic or impractical systems. As it turned out, while the basic structure of the HEV was unchanged, many systems in the vehicle were modified in some way. The vehicle components modified or re-designed included the EV and ICE wiring, as well as the exhaust, <b>cooling,</b> <b>battery</b> storage, ICE vibration control, fire extinguishing, and CNG transport systems. New systems implemented by the 1997 - 1998 team included a series of analog gauges for vehicle monitoring, a power steering system, and temperature monitoring system. One critical gauge installed was an E-meter to measure vehicle energy usage and the state of battery charge. Modifications to the EV were completed by March 1998. The EV was tested for two weeks before the ICE was re-wired and the HEV tested. Problems were encountered with virtually every system implemented by the 1997 - 1998 team. These problems were solved as they arose, and by mid-Apri 1 1998 the HEV was running smoothly and the team was taking energy usage data. This data was critical in helping to determine how the vehicle would perform in the Tour de Sol race, as the winner of the race is determined by measuring vehicle energy usage per mile driven. Barring any unforeseen catastrophes, the 1997 - 1998 will meet its goals...|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} next generation electric and hybrid vehicle technology is the control and management of heat generation and operating temperatures. Vehicle performance, reliability and ultimately consumer market adoption are integrally dependent on successful battery thermal management designs. It will be shown that in the absence of active cooling, surface temperatures of operating lithium-ion batteries can reach as high as 50 °C, within 5 °C of the maximum safe operating temperature. Even in the presence of active cooling, surface temperatures greater than 45 °C are attainable. It is thus of paramount importance to electric vehicle and battery thermal management designers to quantify the effect of temperature and discharge rate on heat generation, energy output, and temperature response of operating lithium-ion batteries. This work presents a purely experimental thermal characterization of thermo-physical properties and operating behavior of a lithium-ion battery utilizing a promising electrode material, LiFePO 4, in a prismatic pouch configuration. Crucial to thermal modeling is accurate thermo-physical property input. Thermal resistance measurements were made using specially constructed battery samples. The thru-plane thermal conductivity of LiFePO 4 positive electrode and negative electrode materials was found to be 1. 79 ± 0. 18 W/m°C and 1. 17 ± 0. 12 W/m°C respectively. The emissivity of the outer pouch was evaluated to enable accurate IR temperature detection and found to be 0. 86. Charge-discharge testing was performed to enable thermal management design solutions. Heat generated by the battery along with surface temperature and heat flux at distributed locations was measured using a purpose built apparatus containing cold plates supplied by a controlled cooling system. Heat flux measurements were consistently recorded at values approximately 400 % higher at locations near the external tabs compared to measurements taken a relatively short distance down the battery surface. The highest heat flux recorded was 3112 W/m 2 near the negative electrode during a 4 C discharge at 5 °C operating temperature. Total heat generated during a 4 C discharge nearly doubled when operating temperature was decreased from 35 °C to 5 °C, illustrating a strong dependence of heat generation mechanisms on temperature. Peak heat generation rates followed the same trend and the maximum rate of 90. 7 W occurred near the end of 5 °C, 4 C discharge rate operation. As a result, the maximum value of total heat generated was 41. 34 kJ during the same discharge conditions. The effect of increasing discharge rate from 1 C to 4 C caused heat generation to double for all operating temperatures due to the increased ohmic heating. Heat generation was highest where the thermal gradient was largest. The largest gradient, near negative electrode current collector to external tab connection and was evaluated using IR thermography to be 0. 632 °C/mm during 4 C discharge with passive room temperature natural convection air <b>cooling.</b> <b>Battery</b> designs should utilize a greater connection thickness to minimize both electrical resistance and current density which both drive the dominant mode of heat generation, ohmic heating.
