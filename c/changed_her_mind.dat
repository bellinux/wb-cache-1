5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous incarnation of Krishna as a dwarf, she felt a desire to have him as her son and suckle him. She soon <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.|$|E

5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} begin the process of {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling {{too much on the}} classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E
5|$|When {{her family}} went to Ibiza on holiday, Allen {{told her mother}} that she was staying with friends but {{remained}} in Sant Antoni de Portmany instead. She earned money by working at a Plastic Fantastic record store and dealing ecstasy. Allen met her first manager, George Lamb, in Ibiza. She was rejected by several labels, which she attributed to her drinking and being the daughter of actor Keith Allen. She eventually used her father's connections to get signed to London Records in 2002. When the executive who had signed her left, the label lost interest and she left without releasing the folk songs that had been written for her, {{many of which were}} written by her father. She then studied horticulture to become a florist, but <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and returned to music. Allen began writing songs, while her manager introduced her to production duo Future Cut in 2004. They worked in a small studio in the basement of an office building.|$|E

5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the Claimant was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E

Lastly, the suicide of a minor is considered a result of a lack of understanding ("da'at"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.|$|E
