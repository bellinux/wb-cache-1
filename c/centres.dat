5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory <b>centres</b> in the medulla and pons. The respiratory <b>centres</b> control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the <b>centres.</b> There are four respiratory <b>centres,</b> three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory <b>centres</b> directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory <b>centres.</b> High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory <b>centres.</b> The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory <b>centres</b> via the vagus nerve.|$|E
