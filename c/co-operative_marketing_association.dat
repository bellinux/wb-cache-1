The Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933 sought to organise farmers into <b>co-operative</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>associations</b> and created <b>Marketing</b> Boards for bacon, pigs, hops, milk and potatoes. The Import Duties Act 1932 introduced a tariff on most imports including {{fruit and vegetables}} and quotas on imports of bacon, ham and other meat products.

40|$|In 1994 Milk Marketing Boards in the UK were disbanded, {{their role}} as milk purchasers was taken by more than 100 {{licensed}} organisations. It is shown that this change resulted {{in an increase in}} the variation between producers' milk price. The majority of dairy farmers sold milk through the Milk Marketing Boards designated successor; a farmer owned co-operative called Milk Marque. In doing so they accepted a 1. 5 ppl milk price penalty. It is shown farmers who adopted this strategy did so because of the perceived financial security of Milk Marque, goodwill and support for the principle of <b>co-operative</b> <b>marketing</b> and in an attempt to protect the milk price over the longer-term. The marketing environment changed once again in 2000 when Milk Marque was disbanded.
