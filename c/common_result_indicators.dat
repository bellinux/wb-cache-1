40|$|Donor {{agencies}} use {{a number}} of indicators for humanitarian action. In June 2016, ECHO {{reduced the number of}} KRIs (Key <b>Results</b> <b>Indicators)</b> it uses from 113 to 35 (ECHO also permits partners to combine pre-defined key <b>results</b> <b>indicators</b> with additional custom indicators). In addition to the sectors covered in this report ECHO also has humanitarian indicators for mine action and disaster risk reduction / disaster preparedness. DFID does not have any core humanitarian indicators at present. Indicators used by DFID vary across country offices. The research undertaken for this report found very little publicly available information on the humanitarian indicators currently being used by key donor agencies. This report therefore relies heavily on expert input. Moreover, only ECHO provides detailed definitions for each indicator. This makes comparison across donor agencies very difficult...|$|R

40|$|Image {{quality is}} {{important}} for taking full advantage of satellite data. As a common indicator, the National Imagery Interpretability Scale (NIIRS) is widely used for image quality assessment and provides a comprehensive representation of image quality {{from the perspective of}} interpretability. The ZY- 3 (Ziyuan- 3) satellite is the first civil high resolution mapping satellite in China, which was established in 2012. So far, there has been no reports on adopting NIIRS as the common indicator for the quality assessment of that satellite image data. This lack of a <b>common</b> quality <b>indicator</b> <b>results</b> in a gap between satellite data users around the world and those in China regarding the understanding of the quality and usability of ZY- 3 data. To overcome the gap, using the general image-quality equation (GIQE), this study evaluates the ZY- 3 sensor-corrected (SC) panchromatic nadir (NAD) data in terms of the NIIRS. In order to solve the uncertainty resulting from the exceeding of the ground sample distance (GSD) of ZY- 3 data (2. 1 m) in GIQE (less than 2. 03 m), eight images are used to establish the relationship between the manually obtained NIIRS and the GIQE predicted NIIRS. An adjusted GIQE is based on the relationship and verified by another five images. Our study demonstrates that the method of using adjusted GIQE for calculating NIIRS can be used for the quality assessment of ZY- 3 satellite images and reveals that the NIIRS value of ZY- 3 SC NAD data is about 2. 79...|$|R
