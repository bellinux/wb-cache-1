Practice at the case company is unique, in that the former approach has been considered inappropriate by the theoretical literature and the latter is seldom used to manage firms' real cash flow exposures.

The selection of explanatory variables for exchange rate volatility is motivated using a New Keynesian Policy model.

The findings show that measures of inflation synchronization, money velocity synchronization, and interest rate synchronization can be useful indicators for decisions on the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> foreign debt.

If this is the case, then a change in the exchange rate parity among major currencies will affect the trade balance. The empirical evidence provided from Turkey - where exports are mostly denominated in Euros and imports are mostly denominated in USD - suggests that an appreciation of the Euro against the USD would increase the output in the long-run, appreciate the local currency and improve the trade balance for the 1985 : 01 2003 : 07 period. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{a number}} of high-inflation Latin American {{countries}} have experienced persistent "dollarization.

The transaction costs of dollarization define a band for the inflation differential within which there will be no incentive to switch between currencies. Above the upper value of the band, the local currency gradually disappears as the economy becomes fully dollarized; below the lower value, de-dollarization occurs. ...|$|R

We study {{the effect of}} this mismatch on monetary policy in a sticky-price, dynamic general-equilibrium small open economy model in which the country default-risk premium depends on domestic banks' balance sheets due to asymmetric information. A fixed exchange rate rule that stabilizes bank balance sheets offers greater stability than does an interest rate rule that targets inflation to offset the real effects of sticky-prices.

40|$|Credit {{contracts}} {{in developing countries}} are often denominated in foreign currencies, even after many of these economies succeeded in controlling inflation. This paper proposes a new interpretation of this apparent puzzle based on the demand for insurance against real shocks: the fact that devaluations occur more frequently in adverse states of the world provides a motive for holding dollar assets. This approach implies a complementarity between the optimal monetary policy and the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> contracts. When {{a large proportion of}} liabilities is denominated in a foreign currency, the optimal exchange rate volatility is low, which reinforces the demand for dollar assets.

We find that trade network externalities are a key determinant of anchor currency choice, implying that there are multiple steady states for the distribution of anchor currencies in the international monetary system. Other factors found to be related to anchor currency choice include the symmetry of output co-movement, the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> debt, and legal or colonial origins...|$|R

Firms from outside the dollar bloc are more likely to use the euro when the original EU market is relatively large or transaction costs of exchanging the euro are relatively small.

40|$|A {{major feature}} characterizing recent {{currency}} crises in emerging markets {{has been the}} large proportion of private foreign currency debt. This feature has made the conduct of monetary policy particularly difficult. This paper proposes a simple model to better understand these issues where firms are credit constrained and the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> debt matters. I argue that the recent financial crises are well explained by such a model. In this framework, monetary policy can be ineffective since the interest rate and the exchange rate channels of transmission of monetary policy go in opposite directions. This potential ineffectiveness {{should be taken into}} account in the choice of a monetary or exchange rate regime. ...|$|R

40|$|Emerging markets firms often carry foreign-currency debt {{on their}} balance sheets. Following a depreciation, the {{expanding}} "peso" value of "dollar" liabilities could, via a net-worth effect, offset the expansionary competitiveness effect. To assess which effect dominates, we use accounting data (including the currency composition of liabilities) for 450 + nonfinancial firms in five Latin American {{countries in the}} 1990 s. We find that firms holding more dollar debt do not invest less than their peso-indebted counterparts following a depreciation.
