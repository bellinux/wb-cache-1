However, limited data currently exists that describes normal articulatory segment timing {{and the degree of}} variability exhibited by normal speakers when assessed with EPG. Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation was to use the Reading EPG 3 system to quantify segmental timing values and examine articulatory timing variability for three English consonants. Ten normal subjects repeated ten repetitions of CV words containing the target consonants /t/, /l/, and /s/ while wearing an artificial palate. The target consonants were followed by the /i/ vowel and were contained in the carrier phrase 2 ̆ 7 I saw a __ 2 ̆ 7.

In addition, inter-subject articulatory timing variability was investigated using descriptive graphs and intra-subject articulatory timing variability was investigated using a coefficient of variation. Results revealed the existence of intersubject variability for mean segment timing values. This could be attributed to individual differences in the suprasegmental features of speech and individual differences in oral cavity size and structure. No significant differences were reported for degree of intra-subject variability between the three sounds for these same phases of articulation. However, when this data set was collapsed, results revealed that the closure/constriction phase of <b>consonant</b> <b>articulation</b> exhibited significantly less intra-subject variability than both the approach and release phases.

Our further goal was to improve objective speech measures and gain insight into muscle functioning before and after treatment. Methods: In 34 patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal, nasal or nasopharyngeal, or oral or oropharyngeal cancer, we acoustically analyzed nasality, vowel space, precision, and strength of articulation in 12 speech sounds (/alpha/, /i/, /u/, /p/, /s/, /z/, / 1 /, /t/, /tj/, /k/, /x/, /r/) before treatment and 10 weeks and 1 year after treatment. Outcomes were compared between assessment points and between tumor sites. Results: Nasality in nonlaryngeal sites was significantly reduced by treatment. Most affected in articulation were the oral or oropharyngeal cancer sites, followed by the nasal or nasopharyngeal sites. One year after treatment, vowel space had not recovered and <b>consonant</b> <b>articulation</b> had weakened. Laryngeal sites were less affected in articulation by tumor or treatment.

40|$|The vowel space {{reflects}} the right-angled {{shape of the}} vocal tract, and many consonants exploit the palatal wall.

The geometry of each speaker's vocal tract was defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the palatal plane and other rigid structures. This quadrilateral, whose area we refer to as the articulatory (or A) space, provides indices of pharyngeal distance, lower facial height, mandibular position and inclination, and head rotation. The A-spaces of different speakers vary in size and form: the speakers with longer pharyngeal distance tend to have shorter lower facial height.

40|$|Polish is a {{language}} where true geminates appear and {{the occurrence of}} a double consonant letter in spelling corresponds with double or at least prolonged <b>consonant</b> <b>articulation</b> regardless of the morphological structure of the word.

Inaccurate tongue placements against the hard palate during <b>consonant</b> <b>articulation</b> may be one factor underlying the imprecision. To investigate this hypothesis, electropalatography (EPG) was used to assess the spatial characteristics of the tongue-to-palate contacts exhibited by three males (aged 23 - 29 years) with dysarthria following severe TBI. Five nonneurologically impaired adults served as control subjects. Twelve single-syllable words of CV or CVC construction (where initial C = /t, d, S, z, k, g/, V=/i, a/) were read aloud three times by each subject while wearing an EPG palate. Spatial characteristics were analyzed in terms of the location, pattern, and amount of tongue-to-palate contact at the frame of maximum contact during production of each consonant.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{looks at}} two areas where electromyographic {{data from the}} cricothyroid muscle (CT) {{can be used to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the nature of the articulatory representations underlying control of F 0. The first area concerns consonant voicing: Robust differences in CT activity between voiced and voiceless consonants were found. A possible scenario accounting for higher F 0 on the vowel following voiceless consonants is put forward. Voicing-related F 0 differences on the vowel are thus seen as emerging automatically, contingent on <b>consonant</b> <b>articulation.</b> However, evidence was also found that some speakers may actively enhance such automatic effects, with CT differences persisting through the vowel. The second area involves two variations on the theme of vowel intrinsic pitch. Firstly, in the special case of the German tense-lax vowel contrast, a tendency was found for higher CT activity on the lax cognates. Lax vowels have sometimes been considered a problem for mechanical accounts of intrinsic pitch, since their F 0 is higher than would be expected from their tongue position. This result indicates that tongue-pull effects are indeed present, but may be overlaid by active articulatory adjustments. Analysis of vowel height then led to similar conclusions to vowel tenseness. The relationship between F 0 and CT activity revealed even more clearly that an automatic tongue-pull-style effect must be present. However, as for the consonant voicing results, it appeared that some speakers may enhance mechanically given effects, in this case showing higher CT activity for high vs. low vowels. The general conclusion is thus that articulatory control often latches onto mechanical effects, and tries to push them a little bit further. 1. Consonant Voicin...|$|E

In English, listeners effortlessly use strong syllables {{to help them}} to find words in the continuous stream of speech produced by neurologically-intact individuals. However, listeners are not always presented with speech under such ideal circumstances. This thesis explores the question of word segmentation of English speech under one of these less ideal conditions; specifically, when the speaker may be impaired in his/her production of strong syllables, {{as in the case}} of hypokinetic dysarthria. Further, we attempt to discern which acoustic cue(s) are most degraded in hypokinetic dysarthria and the effect that this degradation has on listeners 2 ̆ 7 segmentation when no additional semantic or pragmatic cues are present. ^ Two individuals with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, one with a rate disturbance and one with articulatory disruption, along with a typically aging control, were recorded repeating a series of nonsense syllables.

Articulate Assistant Advanced 2. 0 software was used to semi-automatically generate midsagittal tongue contours at the initial point of maximum velar closure and was used to fit each contour to a curved spline. Patterns of lingual coarticulation and measures of speech motor stability, based on curve-to-curve distance (Zharkova, Hewlett, 2 ̆ 6 Hardcastle, 2011), are investigated to compare the speech of typically fluent speakers to the speech of people who stutter.

This makes difficult to compare palatographic patterns across speakers. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a method to obtain a more realistic information about the articulation which copes with individual morphological differences. From a metrologic study based on plaster casts and a number of articulatory “prints”, we develop a method to obtain a 3 D representation [...] Method: The method we propose to measure the shape of the palate, is based on the projection of a structured light (a grid) onto the palate. We observe that the projected grid is distorded as a function of the palatal shape. As the palate is not flat, columns and rows of the grid are modified and are not straight lines anymore. Taking into account these distortions permits the computation of the palate shape. This morphological information gained by this method can be used in static as well as in electyropalatography. Results: This method has been tested on known shapes, and is presently tested on artificial palates. Conclusions: This method could initiate new studies, by enabling measurements such as the surface, the position, the symmetry of the linguo-palatal contact and would improve intra and inter speakers comparisons.
