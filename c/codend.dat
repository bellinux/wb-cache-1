Over the past few decades, it has become widely recognized that the management strategies of world fisheries must ensure sustainability of target species. The intervening years have seen many improvements {{to the concept of}} gear se-lectivity and methods for measuring the selectivity of fishing towed gears. Improved understanding of the principles of the selection of fish by gears has changed the list of parameters which are known to have a significant effect upon se-lection. The recent development of new mathematical models and the increased availability of powerful computers have resulted in improvements in the analysis procedures for the data produced to measure a gear’s selectivity. The catch of mackerel in the gulf of Guinea has steeply declined during the last two decades, and resource management is clearly required. Therefore, the need for evaluation of trawl <b>codends</b> used in this fishery and the potential improvements to their selectivity are of prime importance. In this paper, we use semi-empirical models to define selective properties of pelagic trawl <b>codends</b> targeting black mackerel (Trachurus spp) in the Gulf of Guinea.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 An {{analysis}} was conducted to estimate the minimum mesh size for managing the common Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi) fishery. Secondary objectives were to establish the selective relationship between mesh size and fish length, to examine growth patterns and related parameters, and to estimate the critical age (or optimum size) at which hake cohorts reach their maximum biomass. Selectivity was estimated from experiments performed on the central coast of Chile using trawls with <b>codends</b> of 60 -, 80 -, 100 -, and 120 -mm mesh size. No differences in gear selectivity were found between sexes, thus a common linear relationship was established. The relative growth of hake proved to be allometric for both females and males with little departure from isometry, and was statistically different between sexes. The Brody growth coefficient, k, was estimated for each sex yielding values of 0. 1382 for females and 0. 3230 for males. Differences in asymptotic weight (Winf = 3, 167. 77 gr in females, and Winf = 776. 23 gr in males) together with minor differences in natural mortality and in the adjusted "age zero", importantly influenced estimates of critical age. The results of critical age determinations were 5. 7 years (49. 74 cm) for females, and 3. 8 years (38. 15 cm) for males. To expedite enforcement, and to produce a minimum departure from their respective age optima, a convenient mesh of 110 mm was recommended. This mesh will theoretically retain the hake at 42. 22 cm which corresponds to an age of 4. 21 years for females, and 4. 96 years for males. Additional studies should be carried out to confirm the selective pattern of gears on hake with tunnels and <b>codends</b> of 110 mm mesh size, and to evaluate the variations in catch caused by differences in trawling speeds, trawling time, type of grounds, migratory movements of hake, and other fishing variables...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate {{the utility of the}} latter category of modifications for penaeid trawls by separating a <b>codend</b> into two compartments (termed a double <b>codend)</b> to alleviate interactions between catches.

The {{performance}} of square-mesh codends (as {{opposed to the}} conventional diamond mesh) was examined as a discard and by-catch reduction device for the Shark Bay saucer-scallop trawl fishery. Of the three different-sized squaremesh codends (50, 55, 60 mm) tested against the standard 100 -mm diamond-mesh <b>codend,</b> the 50 -mm square-mesh <b>codend</b> performed poorly with relatively high retention of small (, 85 mm shell height) scallops, whereas the 55 - and 60 -mm square-mesh codends retained 22 – 33 % less smaller scallops than did the diamond-mesh <b>codend.</b> Overall, a mean of 5 % loss in commercial-sized scallops across all three square-mesh codends and significant by-catch reductions of up to 95 % were achieved compared with the diamond mesh. Catch rate of prawns by the square-mesh <b>codend</b> was less than 2 % of that of the standard prawn net. The {{performance of}} the 60 -mm square-mesh <b>codend</b> presents a good basis for its use in commercial trials in the Shark Bay scallop trawl fishery. A move to square-mesh codends {{could result in a}} significant reduction of small scallops and by-catch and may potentially increase the catches of commercial-sized scallops as a result in improvements in water flow and net efficiency.

Furthermore, we compared catches of standard and adapted beam trawl nets to evaluate the alternatives’ potentials to reduce fish and non-fish discardswhile commercial fish yield is retained (preliminary results) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{change of}} mesh size or shape as a {{management}} measure to improve selectivity {{as proposed by}} the EU should be assessed using actual fishery data, despite being tested experimentally in previous studies. This work was conducted to evaluate the consequences of inserting either a 40 -mm square-mesh or a 50 -mm diamond-mesh (instead of the traditional 40 -mm diamond-mesh) at <b>codends</b> in commercial Spanish trawlers. Landings in terms of biomass, income and catch composition were compared under commercial conditions. Four métiers were identified in the fishery: European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). No significant differences were observed in biomass or income owing to the new mesh in either European hake or red mullet. In contrast, the total biomass of the red shrimp métier and the biomass of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, were significantly higher after the selectivity change. Regarding the catch composition, only the European hake métier showed slight - but not significant - changes after using the new mesh. Considering these results, there was no short-term effect (substantial biological or economic loss) as previous studies had expected. This could possibly be related to a higher performance of the new gear that may compensate for the lower retention of small sizes.
