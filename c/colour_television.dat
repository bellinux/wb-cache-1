5|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>television</b> was {{introduced}} {{at the same}} time as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 – one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date. The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including tennis and rugby. In 1979, a documentary titled Goin' Down The Road, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station'.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} between 1968 and 1969, NBN secured a relay from the Postmaster-General to enhance their news service. In 1970, NBN began {{upgrading}} its studios {{in preparation for the}} commencement of <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> at a cost of A$360,000. The improvements included an enlarged film department; a film editing and cleaning equipment; a larger master control with four video transfer machines; a new telecine room with caption scanner and slide drums; as well as an expansion of the administration and staff offices which also included new offices and a boardroom.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

50|$|BPL {{initially}} {{expanded its}} medical product ranges to include electrocardiographs and patient-monitoring systems.

5|$|Viewership {{increased}} exponentially {{from the}} 1960s {{until the end}} of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> in 1968. Global audience estimates for the 1968 Mexico City Games was 600million, whereas at the Los Angeles Games of 1984, the audience numbers had increased to 900million; that number swelled to 3.5billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. However, at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968. This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era. A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time. With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings. The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest. The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers. Finally, the American television lobby, namely NBC, was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States. The results of these efforts were mixed: ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 it was {{announced}} that all stations would move to colour on 1 March 1975, using the European PAL standard mandated in 1968. The slogan used to sell <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> to the Australian public was 'March first into colour'. Australia was to have one of the fastest change-overs to <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> in the world – by 1978 over 64% of households in Sydney and Melbourne had <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> sets.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Parliament, Keegan {{pressed the}} Government {{for an early}} {{decision}} on which line standards to adopt for <b>colour</b> <b>television.</b> He criticised Sidney Bernstein of Granada Television for arguing against 625 line <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> because ITA stations were restricted to 405 lines, arguing that Bernstein should instead campaign for an early changeover of ITA programmes to 625 lines so that television did not become obsolete. In 1967 he speculated that constant expansion of the BBC {{would lead to the}} corporation applying for permission to run advertising.|$|E

25|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>television</b> was {{introduced}} across the network in 1975, {{when a new}} colour logo was adopted. Rupert Murdoch made an unsuccessful bid for the Herald and Weekly Times, owners of HSV-7, in 1979, later going on {{to gain control of}} rival ATV-10. Fairfax, however, successfully bought a 14.9% share of the company later in the same year.|$|E

25|$|Constructive {{interference}} in thin films can create strong reflection {{of light in}} a range of wavelengths, which can be narrow or broad depending on the design of the coating. These films are used to make dielectric mirrors, interference filters, heat reflectors, and filters for colour separation in <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> cameras. This interference effect is also what causes the colourful rainbow patterns seen in oil slicks.|$|E

40|$|India has immense {{potential}} for growth of exports in various sectors. Electronic Hardware & Software sector {{is one of}} them. The Electronics Industry in India came into existence sometime in the mid 60 ’s with an orientation towards space and defence technologies. This initiative was driven and {{controlled by the government}} and the public sector enterprises. It was soon followed by developments in Consumer Electronics mainly with transistor radio, black & white television, calculators and miscellaneous audio products. <b>Colour</b> <b>televisions</b> followed thereafter. The year 1982 came as a crucial year; the Government allowed thousands of <b>colour</b> <b>televisions</b> sets to be imported into the country to broadcast the Asian Games held in New Delhi. Subsequently, the electronics sector has highly advanced in the present era. The purpose of this research is to determine the export potential of various electronic hardware from India {{on the basis of their}} past export performance of various electronic items from. The present study is based on the available statistical data so acquired, to derive export potential from the country. This study will help stake-holders in encouraging and initiating the exports of concerning sectors along with the sustainable growth and that will definitely lead to promotion of exports of India...|$|R
25|$|Wimbledon {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a piece of}} television history, when on 1 July 1967 the first official <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> broadcast took place in the UK.

25|$|A {{major factor}} in the merger was that when UHF {{transmission}} was introduced in 1969 to accommodate <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> {{it was found that the}} key Bilsdale transmitting station in North Yorkshire so dominated the territories of both companies that its allotment to either individual company would have seriously prejudiced the coverage and sales revenue of the other. The ITA agreed that Tyne Tees and Yorkshire could be considered as one company for the purposes of selling airtime, while expressing their individual identities in their programming output.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Nordmende {{televisions}} were {{renowned for}} their innovative chassis, {{and for the}} rigorous testing and quality control of their finished products.

In 1969, Mende's sons took over the company, and in 1977 a majority shareholding was sold to the French Thomson Brandt company. The following year, the family sold their remaining shares to Thomson. In the 1980s, the factories in Bremen were closed, Nordmende becoming purely a Thomson trademark.|$|R
25|$|In 1975, <b>colour</b> <b>television</b> was {{introduced}} in Australia. Within a decade, the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally.
