5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and <b>canopy</b> assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's <b>canopy,</b> a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the <b>canopy</b> was in place. Once the <b>canopy</b> was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed <b>canopy</b> when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original <b>canopy</b> configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. The downward firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype would be used for all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear <b>canopy</b> in place of the original sliding <b>canopy</b> around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft engine output to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new <b>canopy</b> eliminated the <b>canopy</b> vibrations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Canopies</b> {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, {{he would give}} his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope {{attached}} to their seats to lower their <b>canopies.</b> Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the <b>canopies</b> were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the <b>canopies</b> altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the <b>canopies</b> obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row.|$|R

5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped <b>canopy.</b> The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the <b>canopy</b> is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the <b>canopy</b> may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a <b>canopy</b> is not formed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>canopy</b> hinges open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in the cockpit, {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the <b>canopy</b> to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus.

40|$|Assembly rules {{provide a}} useful {{framework}} fo rpredicting patterns of community assembly under defined environmental conditions. Habitat created by canopy-forming algae (such as kelps) provides a promising system for identifying assembly rules because <b>canopies</b> typically {{have a large}} and predictable influence on understorey communities. Across > 1, 000 km of subtidal South Australian coastline, we identified natural associations between assemblages of understorey algae and (1) monospecific <b>canopies</b> of Ecklonia radiata,(2) <b>canopies</b> comprised of E. radiata mixed with Fucales (Cystophora spp. and Sargassum spp.), and (3) gap samong <b>canopies</b> of algae. We were able to recreate these associations with experimental tests that quantified the assembly of understorey algae among these three habitat types. We propose the assembly rule that understorey communities on subtidal rocky coast in South Australia will be (1) monopolised by encrusting coralline algae beneath monospecific <b>canopies</b> of E. radiata, (2) comprised of encrusting coral lines, encrusting non-coral lines, and sparse covers of articulated coral lines, beneath mixed E. radiata-Fucales <b>canopies,</b> and (3) comprised of extensive covers of articulated coral lines and filamentous turfs, as well as sparse covers of foliose algae and juvenile canopy-formers, within gaps. Consistencies between natural patterns and experimental effects demonstrate how algal <b>canopies</b> {{can act as a}} filter to limit the subsets of species from the locally available pool that are able to assemble beneath them. Moreover, the subsets of species that assemble to subtidal rocky substrata in South Australia appear to be predictable, given knowledge of the presence and composition of <b>canopies</b> incorporating E. radiata...|$|R

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble <b>canopy</b> provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's <b>canopy</b> lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire <b>canopy</b> is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E

40|$|Light {{fluctuations}} and vibrations {{of plant}} were simultaneously measured within rice plant <b>canopies,</b> using the photo diode and strain gauge,respectively.

The standard deviations of light fluctuations within the plant <b>canopies</b> and culm strain rates of a rice plant were proportional to momentum fluxes observed above the plant <b>canopies.</b> This implies that standard deviations of light are directly proportional to those of culm strain rates of a plant, or square of wind velocity. The light fluctuations were studied in the frequency domain, using spectral analysis. The spectrum of light had a maximum peak near 2 Hz and {{a significant portion of}} the energy density in the high frequency range was above 2 Hz. They were not only caused by leaf movements due to vibration of plants but also by leaf flutters. イネ群落における微気象観測の一部として、植物体の揺れと群落内部（イネの草高 75 cm）の光量の変動の同時測定を試みた。植物体の揺れの測定には歪ゲージを、光量の変動の測定にはフォトダイオードを用いた。以下に得られた 2 、 3 の結果について述べる。風速の増加に伴って運動量輸送量が増大し、植被の揺れが激しくなると、群落内部の光量が間欠的にしかも短周期に変動した。イネの稈の歪と群落内部の光量の変動の標準偏差σs、σLは、共に運動量輸送量uに比例して増加した。このことは、群落内部の光量の変動の標準偏差が、植物体の歪もしくは植物体の変位の標準偏差に比例して増加することを意味している。群落内部の光量のパワースペクトルの最大となる周波数は、植物体の揺れの固有周期の 2 倍に対応する 2 Hz付近であったが、それより高周波数側にもかなりのエネルギー密度が存在していた。これらの高周波数成分は、一個体の植物体の揺れや葉の揺らぎばかりでなく、複数の植物体の影響が複合的に重なって生じたものと思われる。今回は、植物体の揺れと光量の変動の測定を試験的に行った結果の報告である。今後は種々の植物群落において、生育段階に応じて群落内部のいろいとな高度センサーを設置して、さらに詳細な観測を行うことが必要と思われる...|$|R
