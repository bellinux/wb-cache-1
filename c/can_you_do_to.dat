You may do much good if you continue still in the land; but alas, what benefit will it be to your friends, or what good <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> them, if you should be sent away beyond the seas into Spain, or Constantinople, or some other remote part of the world?

Mind, I ask no questions. I don't inquire why you decided to come here, or anything as to what your course would have been if he had not died, though I know there's no deliberate harm in ye.

6000|$|I had {{received}} my first quarter's wages, and {{was returning to}} my lodgings, possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that the master who had paid me grudged every penny of that hard-earned pittance--(I had long ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother--he was a hard, grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong, occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me; again and again they uttered the same monotonous phrases. One said: [...] "William, your life is intolerable." [...] The other: [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> alter it?" [...] I walked fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I approached my lodgings, I turned from a general view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to whether my fire would be out; looking towards the window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red gleam.|$|E

[...] "So you thought {{that you were going to}} play it down low on me in that fashion, did you? Well, you've just made a little mistake for once in your life, and I'll tell you what it is, you shall smart for it.

Must I go hungry for you--starveling, robber! A miserable little boy alone and lost in the forest, naked, all {{scratched}} and bleeding with thorns, with no courage in his heart, no strength in his hands! Look at me! I am not weak, but strong and black and fierce; I live here--this is my home; I fear nothing; I am like a serpent, and like brass and tempered steel--nothing can bruise or break me: my teeth are like fine daggers; when I strike them into the flesh of any creature I never loose my hold till I have sucked out all the blood in his heart. But you, weak little wretch, I hate you! I thirst for your blood for stealing my food from me! What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> save yourself? Down, down on the ground, chicken-heart, where I can get hold of you! You shall pay me for the eggs with your life! I shall hold you fast by the throat, and drink and drink until I see your glassy eyes close, and your cheeks turn whiter than ashes, and I feel your heart flutter like a leaf in your bosom! Down, down!" ...|$|E
6000|$|What a question! Oh, ask it yourselves honestly! I {{have been}} out in gales myself, and I cannot {{understand}} how you can go out, in thirty feet of timber, upon that mighty sea, with the wind howling over your heads like a death-bell, and the great hungry waves chasing you for miles, each one {{able and willing to}} swallow you up into the deep, and the gulls screaming over you as if they were waiting to feed upon your floating carcases, and you alone, in a tiny boat, upon that waste, howling wilderness of waters!--I cannot understand, I say, how, when a man is in such a case as that, day after day, year after year, he can forget his God, the only friend who can save him from the sea! the only friend who can send him safe out to his work in the evening, and bring him home safe to his wife at morning. One would think that when you went down to the shore in the morning, you would say, [...] "Oh, God! without whose help I am no stronger than a piece of sea-weed floating up and down, take care of me! Take care of my wife and my children; and forgive me my sins, and do not punish me by calling me away this night to answer for them all!" [...] And when you come home at night, you would say, [...] "Oh, God! who hast kept me safe all this day, what can I do to show how thankful I am to Thee!" [...] Ay! what <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> show how thankful you are to God for His care? What ought you to do to show your thankfulness to Him? What must you do to show your thankfulness to Him? He has told you. [...] "If you love me, He says, keep my commandments. Do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God." ...|$|E

30|$|Teacher {{autonomy}} {{served as}} a locally endogenous variable {{in this study and}} as an exogenous variable to math and science teachers’ intentions to remain in the profession. Six questionnaire items from SASS 08 were considered for use in measuring this variable, using Klassen and Chiu’s study of 2010 as a basis for their selection. In their study, they had three teacher autonomy factors specific to classroom management, student engagement, and instructional strategies and included survey questions like, “How much <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> control disruptive behavior in the classroom?”, “How much <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> implement a variety of assessment strategies?”, and “How much <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> implement alternative strategies in your classroom?” (Klassen and Chiu 2010). For this study, a single teacher autonomy variable was used with the consideration of six questionnaire items from SASS 08 to be included in its scale. These items referred to the teacher’s perception of his or her ability to effectively control the following areas of their craft: (1) selecting textbooks and other instructional materials, (2) selecting content, topics, and skills to be taught, (3) selecting teaching techniques, (4) evaluating and grading students, (5) disciplining students, and (6) determining the amount of homework to be assigned. Each of these items was based on a 4 -point Likert scale with 1 [*]=[*]no control and 4 [*]=[*]a great deal of control.|$|E

Academic networks, like LinkedIn, Academia. edu and more, are used by researchers around the globe to keep in contact with colleagues and collaborators. And social media are everywhere you turn.
