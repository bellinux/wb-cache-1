25|$|Hasidic men most {{commonly}} wear dark overclothes. On weekdays, they wear a long, black, cloth jacket called a rekel, and on Jewish Holy Days, the bekishe zaydene kapote (Yiddish, lit., satin <b>caftan),</b> a similarly long, black jacket, but of satin fabric traditionally silk. Indoors, the colorful tish bekishe is still worn. Some Hasidim wear a satin overcoat, known as rezhvolke. A rebbe's rezhvolke might be trimmed with velvet. Most do not wear neckties.|$|E
25|$|In Islamic teachings, Muslim men are {{forbidden}} to wear silk. Many religious jurists believe the reasoning behind the prohibition lies in avoiding clothing for men that can be considered feminine or extravagant. There are disputes regarding the amount of silk a fabric can consist of (e.g., whether a small decorative silk piece on a cotton <b>caftan</b> is permissible or not) {{for it to be}} lawful for men to wear, but the dominant opinion of most Muslim scholars is that the wearing of silk by men is forbidden. Modern attire has raised a number of issues, including, for instance, the permissibility of wearing silk neckties, which are masculine articles of clothing.|$|E

40|$|Identification {{of an art}} object {{material}} of cultural heritage had received significant attention, because of its importance {{for the development of}} appropriate restoration and conservation strategies. In this work, two important <b>caftans</b> were analysed in the Topkapi Palace Museum. The <b>caftans</b> were dated that one 16 th century and other 18 th century by art historians. But, designs of the <b>caftans</b> have been same features (characteristics). To compare these two art objects, the <b>caftans</b> were investigated by non-destructive and microanalysis methods. Multi analytical techniques were used for the analyses. These methods are high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), scanning electron microscope energy disperse X-ray (SEM-EDX), technical analyses by optical microscopy and CIEL*a*b * for colour measurements...|$|R

2500|$|Though Andre J. often wears {{feminine}} clothing, he {{does not}} consider himself a crossdresser. Rather, he sees himself as unconfined by gender and social conventions. [...] "Most people are conditioned {{to think of a}} black man looking a certain way," [...] they told the New York Times. [...] "They only think of the ethnic man in XXX jeans and Timberlands, and here Andre J. comes along with a pair of hot shorts and a <b>caftan</b> or maybe flip-flops or cowboy boots or a high, high heel." [...] Most recently, Andre J.'s style inspirations have included Cher and model Donyale Luna. They describe their aesthetic as a [...] "60s, not mod, but mod-ish, and hippie look" [...] that is also influenced by the style of 1970s blaxploitation films.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Ellsworth, a {{professor}} of media studies, eavesdropped on several visitors to the exhibition, noting {{that because of the}} exhibition's placement in a self-contained space accessed by a staircase {{at the far end of}} the museum's first floor, the visitors were primarily self-selected as those who would be intrigued enough by such an idea in the first place to actually seek it out. [...] According to her report, the reactions were wide-ranging, from the number of women who teased their male companions about whether they would ever consider wearing skirts (to which several men responded that they would) to the man who said, [...] "A <b>caftan</b> after a shower or in the gym? Can you imagine? 'Excuse me! [...] Coming through!'". [...] An adolescent girl rejected in disgust the notion that skirts were similar to the wide pants worn by hip-hop artists. Two elderly women called the idea [...] "utterly ridiculous". [...] One man, reading the exhibition's presentation on the subject of male skirt-wearing in cultures other than those in North America and Europe, observed, [...] "God! Three quarters of the world's population !" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cumans were {{reported}} to be handsome people with blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes, and desirable women. Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy. Robert de Clari reported that the Cumans often wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest, usually worn in conjunction with bracers. [...] Underneath the vest was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting {{in the front and}} back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a <b>caftan,</b> each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume. The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The brim of the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back. This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically shaped material that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, {{while the rest of the}} hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands.|$|E

25|$|Men's wear was {{simpler and}} only {{occasionally}} {{decorated with a}} modest amount of embroidery. Men wore <b>caftans</b> pleated at the back. These <b>caftans,</b> usually sewn from light gray or white woolen cloth, were later replaced by coats. Shirts, resembling a tunic, were sewn from white linen cloth and were not usually decorated. The most ormamental detail of men's garments were the decorative patterned sashes they wore around their waists. Men also wore high boots and hats with straight brims that were decorated with feathers and flowers.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the seventh}} morning. A guard entered at an unaccustomed hour, and, {{sticking}} a torch into {{a niche in}} the wall, announced that a person was without who had permission {{to speak to the}} prisoner. They were the first human accents that had met the ear of Alroy during his captivity, which seemed to him an age, a long dark period, that cancelled all things. He shuddered at the harsh tones. He tried to answer, but his unaccustomed lips refused their office. He raised his heavy arms, and endeavoured to signify his consciousness of what had been uttered. Yet, indeed, he had not listened to the message without emotion. He looked forward to the grate with strange curiosity; and, as he looked, he trembled. The visitor entered, muffled in a dark <b>caftan.</b> The guard disappeared; and the <b>caftan</b> falling to the ground, revealed Honain.|$|E
60|$|There fell a soft {{step behind}} him and a shadow from the doorway. He turned. A graceful {{stripling}} in turban and <b>caftan</b> of cloth of gold salaamed {{to him from the}} topmast step. And as he came upright and the light of the lanterns fell full upon his face the astonishingly white fairness of it was revealed--a woman's face it might have been, so softly rounded was it in its beardlessness.|$|E

His arms from the elbow and his legs from the knee were bare, and his feet were shod with gold-embroidered red Turkish slippers. He wore a white turban decked by a plume of osprey attached by a jewelled clasp.|$|E

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{a group of}} non-ferrous metal patches discovered in {{the territory of the}} Pruto-Dniester region. An analysis of several analogies allowed the authors to conclude that these items represent paired clothing clasps. The group of studied analogies features the flindings discovered in the Caucasus region where similar clasps existed {{for a long period of}} time. <b>Caftans</b> with paired clasps are a characteristic trait of a girl’s and in certain cases a woman’s ethnographic costume. <b>Caftans</b> with such clasps were worn over a dress. In terms of shape, the samples in question are most similar to the characteristic clasps present in Nogai women’s costume.

60|$|Truth to tell, the {{sometime}} Cornish gentleman {{was difficult}} to discern in him as he sat there still wearing the <b>caftan</b> of cloth of silver over his white tunic and a turban of the same material swathed about his steel headpiece that ended in a spike.
