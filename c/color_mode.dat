When the user {{moves to a}} different page, the other systems wake up, render the new page on the display, {{and then go back}} to sleep. Power consumption in this e-book mode is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.8W. The XO 2.0 is planned to consume even less power than earlier versions, less than 1.0W in full <b>color</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In <b>color</b> <b>mode</b> (when lit {{primarily}} from the rear), the display does not use the common RGB pixel geometry for liquid crystal computer displays, in which each pixel contains three tall thin rectangles of the primary colors. Instead, the XO-1 display provides one color for each pixel. The colors align along diagonals that run from upper-right to lower left (see diagram on the right). To reduce the color artifacts caused by this pixel geometry, the color component of the image is blurred by the display controller as the image {{is sent to the}} screen. Despite the color blurring, the display still has high resolution for its physical size; normal displays [...] put about 588(H)×441(V) to 882(H)×662(V) pixels in this amount of physical area and support subpixel rendering for slightly higher perceived resolution. A Philips Research study measured the XO-1 display's perceived color resolution as effectively 984(H)×738(V). A conventional liquid crystal display with the same number of green pixels (green carries most brightness or luminance information for human eyes) as the OLPC XO-1 would be 693×520. Unlike a standard RGB LCD, resolution of the XO-1 display varies with angle. Resolution is greatest from upper-right to lower left, and lowest from upper-left to lower-right. Images which approach or exceed this resolution will lose detail and gain color artifacts. The display gains resolution when in bright light; this comes at the expense of color (as the backlight is overpowered) and color resolution can never reach the full 200 dpi sharpness of grayscale mode because of the blur which is applied to images in <b>color</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
