50|$|At first-stage burnout, {{explosive}} bolts fired and springs separated the instrument section from the first-stage tankage. The instrument section and the spinning tub were slowly tipped to a horizontal position {{by means of}} four air jets located {{at the base of}} the instrument section. When the apex of the vertical flight occurred after a <b>coasting</b> <b>flight</b> of about 247 seconds, a radio signal from the ground ignited the eleven-rocket cluster of the second stage, separating the tub from the instrument section. The third stage then fired to raise the apogee. Through this system, designed by Wernher von Braun in 1956 for his proposed Project Orbiter, the Jupiter-C obviated the need for a guidance system in the upper stages.|$|E

40|$|A {{description}} of a hybrid simulation of the 040 C orbiter aborting from boost to specified landing site is provided. The simulation starts when the abort is initiated and continues until a terminal energy state (associated with the selected landing site) is reached. At abort {{it is assumed that}} all SRM's are jettisoned with the external tank remaining with the orbiter. The simulation described has six degrees of freedom with the vehicle simulated as a rigid body. A conventional form of autopilot is provided to control engine gimbaling during powered flight.

40|$|Free-flight {{tests in}} the {{transonic}} speed range utilizing rocketpropelled models have been made on three pairs of 0. 11 -scale North American F- 100 airplane wings having an aspect ratio of 3. 47, a taper ratio of 0. 308, 45 degree sweepback at the quarter-chord line, and thickness ratios of 31 and 5 percent to investigate the possibility of flutte r. Data from tests of two other rocket-propelled models which accidentally fluttered during a drag investigation of the North American F- 100 airplane are also presented. The first set of wings (5 percent thick) was tested on a model which was disturbed in pitch by a moving tail and reached a maximum Mach number of 0. 85. The wings encountered mild oscillations near the first - bending frequency at high lift coefficients. The second set of wings 9 percent thick was tested up to a maximum Mach number of 0. 95 at (2) angles of attack provided by small rocket motors installed in {{the nose of the}} model. No oscillations resembling flutter were encountered during the <b>coasting</b> <b>flight</b> between separation from the booster and sustainer firing (Mach numbers from 0. 86 to 0. 82) or during the sustainer firing at accelerations of about 8 g up to the maximum Mach number of the test (0. 95). The third set of wings was similar to the first set and was tested up to a maximum Mach number of 1. 24. A mild flutter at frequencies near the first-bending frequency of the wings was encountered between a Mach number of 1. 15 and a Mach number of 1. 06 during both accelerating and <b>coasting</b> <b>flight.</b> The two drag models, which were 0. ll-scale models of the North American F- 100 airplane configuration, reached a maximum Mach number of 1. 77. The wings of these models had bending and torsional frequencies which were 40 and 89 percent, respectively, of the calculated scaled frequencies of the full-scale 7 -percent-thick wing. Both models experienced flutter of the same type as that experienced-by the third set of wings...|$|E

40|$|Free-flight {{tests in}} the {{transonic}} and supersonic speed ranges utilizing rocket-propelled models have been made on two pairs of 1 / 9 -scale Convair YF- 102 airplane wings with elevons to investigate the possibility of flutter. These wings had modified 60 deg delta plan forms with the trailing edge swept forward 5 deg. The aspect ratio of two exposed wing panels was 2. 19 and the wings had NACA 0004 - 65 (modified) airfoil sections. The model wings and elevons were dynamic-scale models at sea level of the full-scale wings at 20, 000 feet. The first set of wings developed elevon buzz near a Mach number of 1 during both power-on and <b>coasting</b> <b>flight</b> at amplitudes of {{equal to or greater}} than +/- 4 deg [...] The second set of wings did not develop the elevon buzz experienced by the first set but, as the model reached the maximum speed of the test (Mach number 1. 93), {{one or both of the}} wings suddenly failed, possibly as a result of aerodynamic heating or high stresses imposed on the wings at separation from the booster.

25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw.
