50|$|Carburizing, <b>carburising</b> (chiefly British English), or {{carburization}} is a {{heat treatment}} {{process in which}} iron or steel absorbs carbon while the metal is heated {{in the presence of}} a carbon-bearing material, such as charcoal or carbon monoxide. The intent is to make the metal harder. Depending on the amount of time and temperature, the affected area can vary in carbon content. Longer carburizing times and higher temperatures typically increase the depth of carbon diffusion. When the iron or steel is cooled rapidly by quenching, the higher carbon content on the outer surface becomes hard due to the transformation from austenite to martensite, while the core remains soft and tough as a ferritic and/or pearlite microstructure.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{the great}} {{majority}} of <b>carburising</b> is still carried out at atmospheric pressure, recent developments in vacuum furnaces and steel technology have meant that <b>carburising</b> can now be carried out in a more environmentally friendly way under low pressure. The range of material types being carburised under vacuum is increasing with a strongly upward trend towards vacuum <b>carburising</b> evident in many areas. In choosing a suitable <b>carburising</b> process, three main choices have to be made:- which <b>carburising</b> technique and gas (or gases) to employ; which type of vacuum pump system to install; and which quenching gas to use. In particular, the selection of <b>carburising</b> gas has {{a significant impact on the}} efficiency and cleanliness of the process, and on deciding the most appropriate vacuum pump system. This paper describes the current state of the art and practical experiences with low-pressure <b>carburising</b> techniques and examines the various options within these three essential choices. It also considers the safety and environmental implications of these choices. 1...|$|E

The samples were activated in situ for 1  h in air or in H 2 at 773  K for oxide and carbide, respectively, and then outgassed under vacuum (2  ×  10 − 6 mbar) for 1  h. The resulting absorbance bands indicate that only chemisorbed pyridine molecules were retained {{at this stage}} (not shown) with bands characteristic of coordinative adsorption on Lewis acid sites (1610 and 1448  cm− 1) and of the pyridinium ion formed by interaction with Brønsted acid sites (1638 and 1537  cm− 1) [48].

However, gearbox is among the least reliable wind turbine subsystems. In this study, the root failure cause of gearbox components retrieved from the field has been analysed and deduced {{to be the result of}} the combined effects of misalignment, coarse non-metallic inclusions, and inadequate or inconsistent lubrication, which has been verified using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations. Subsequently, duplex surface systems were designed as WC/a-C:H coating deposited on surface hardened steel to mitigate or eliminate the life-limiting problems of gearboxes, which exhibited superior properties and performance than single coating systems and <b>carburised</b> samples.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} plasma {{surface engineering}} {{has been a}} useful method for increasing the hardness and wear resistance of austenitic stainless steel without reducing the corrosion resistance of this alloy. Plasma <b>carburising</b> {{is of particular interest}} as it produces thicker hardened layers than plasma nitriding, and an equivalent improvement in the tribological and corrosion performance of the base material. In this project, the active screen (AS) plasma technique was used to carburise austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 and the obtained layer of carbon expanded austenite was compared with the one produced by conventional DC plasma treatments. The hardening and wear resistance produced by AS and DC plasma <b>carburising</b> were equivalent. With regard to corrosion, the AS treated material performed better than its DC counterpart {{as a consequence of the}} improved surface quality of the former. The mechanism of AS <b>carburising</b> was comparatively studied with its AS nitriding counterpart. Different experimental arrangements and two plasma diagnostic techniques were used for this purpose: optical emission spectroscopy and electrostatic probes. The evidence shows that AS nitriding relies on the deposition of iron nitrides and the active species in the plasma to produce hardening, whilst AS <b>carburising</b> requires the plasma activation and moderate ion bombardment.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thermochemical}} treatment namely <b>carburising</b> on the fatigue behaviour of one carbon and two alloy steels {{has been studied}} in rotating and unidirectional bending. The effect of carbon profile on the unidirect¬ional bending fatigue strength of 63 SA 14 was assessed, and {{it was found that}} single stage <b>carburising</b> with a surface carbon content of 0. 8 % has resulted in a higher fatigue strength than other types of carbon profiles. Residual stresses and other metallurgical variables arising from different carbon profiles, were also considered. The highest compressive stresses h~e resulted from boost-diffuse-carburising. On the other hand surface decarburisation was associated with tensile residual stresses and a reduced fatigue strength. Retained austenite was found to be detrimental in unidirectional bending fatigue; however its presence in carburised 83 SAIS did not seem to influence the rotating bending fatigue strength. Carbide particles in globular and/or intergranular form were detrimental to compressive residual stresses; the unidirectional bending fatigue strength is markedly lowered. The highest fatigue strength was accomplished by vacuum <b>carburising.</b> The absence of internal oxidation was the key factor in the increased fatigue strength; the presence of uniformly distributed fine carbide particles did not upset the superior fatigue strength of vacuum carburised pieces. The effect of mean stress on the fatigue strength of carburised 63 SA 14 was studied. Increasing the mean stress as would be expected resulted in a decreased fatigue strength. Carburisation showed its advantages at low mean stress, but at high mean stress it offers little advantage over the uncarburised hardened conditions. Notch effect was also studied in unidirectional bending of carburised 080 MlS. The general trend showed that the fatigue strength decreases with increasing the stress concentration factor.
