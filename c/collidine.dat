40|$|In {{the recent}} years, the {{legislation}} {{related to the}} safety of industrial processes has become more rigorous and demanding than in the past. The design of inherently safe processes is currently' viewed as a necessary target of the engineering discipline (Gupta and Ed~ards, 2002) [...] Alkylpyridines and their N-oxides are being used widely as intermediates and final products in the Phannaceutical Industry. Under typical industrial conditions the N-oxidation reaction is performed catalytically, in the liquid phaSe in a semi-batch mode. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidising agent. It is dosed over the alkylpyridine-catalyst mixture over a period of time. The desired N-oxidation is accompanied by one only additional reaction, the lpldesired decomposition ofhydrogen peroxide. The catalytic N-oxidation of selected picolines, lutidines and <b>collidines</b> were performed in an HEL SIMULARÃ‚Â® lL calorimeter at conditions very close to the industrial'ones, following a certain procedure. The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide alone, under the same conditions was also studied. A sensitive mass flow-meter MKS 1179 A Mass-FloÃ‚Â® was used for the continuous measurement of the oxygen produced by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, thus. allowing the split {{of the power of the}} two reactions. The heat of reaction has been evaluated for all the selected N-oxidation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition reactions. The concentration of the a 1 kylpyridines and their N-oxides was measured using HPLC. These measurements confirmed that the hydrogen peroxide decompositio~ was the only parallel reaction. Integration of the thermal power evolution curves also provided a continuous measure of concentration [...] These curves were found to be in good agreement with the HPLC measurements. The reactions were studied using heat-flow and power compensation calorimetry at subcooled conditions. Their study shows that their N-oxidation follows Langmuir type kinetics. The paraIlel decomposition ofhydrogen peroxide also follows the same type ofkinetics. Their kinetic study was based on the kinetic model of Sempere et al, 1998, whi~h was improved and refined. The model of Sempere et al., 1998 on a-picoline assumes paths of reaction, in which, the employedÃ‚Â· catalyst, phosphotungstic acid, does not participate. However, as reported in our previous work (papadaki et al., 2002 a), no reaction takes place in the absence of phosphotungstic acid. The kinetic model proposed by Sempere et al. 1998 has thus been modified to account for those paths. The modified model is, as before, based on the assumption of very fast always in equilibrium reactions or interactions for the formation of intermediates which subsequently react in a number of ways to give the final products. All paths of the modified model are catalytic. The new kinetic model has been tested and found to be,:in good agreement with experimental data. A number of runaway scenarios of the excess of hydrogen peroxide used during the N-oxidation of alkylpyridines, under closed and open conditions, were examined. It was found that, in most cases, if the volume of the liquid hydrogen peroxide solution occupies more than 10 % ofthe total volume ofa closed system (e. g. reactor and vent line between reactor and blockage), the production of gases raises the pressure so quickly that evaporation is completely suppressed. Higher that 70 % filling levels result in complete expansion of the liquid~The MTSR(t) (the inaximum temperature attained by the synthesis reaction) of the system falls rapidly if th~ normal process temperature is high, but if a runaway. occurs exactly at the end of dosing, MTST (the maximum temperature reached during the synthesis reaction) will be very high and secondary decompositions will rapidly develop. The results of this study are currently being used to critically assess the current approaches and to further the study ofinherently safer designs.

Hydrogen-bonded species in frozen heterocycle-water mixtures were characterized experimentally using 15 N NMR. When base was in excess, one water molecule was symmetrically bonded to two heterocyclic molecules. This complex {{was characterized by}} the rHN distances of 1. 82 Å for pyridine and 1. 92 Å for <b>collidine.</b> The proton-donating ability of water in such complexes was affected by an anticooperative interaction between the two coupled hydrogen bonds and exhibited an apparent pKa value of about 6. 0. When water was in excess, it formed water clusters hydrogen bonded to base. Theoretical analysis of binding energies of small model heterocycle-water clusters indicated that water in such clusters was oriented as a chain. The NMR estimated rHN distances in these species were 1. 69 Å for pyridine and 1. 64 Å for <b>collidine.</b> Here, the proton-donating ability of the hydroxyl group bonded to the heterocycle was affected by a mutual cooperative interaction with other water molecules in the chain and became comparable to the proton-donating ability of a fictitious acid, exhibiting an apparent pKa value of about 4. 9.

QE-TPDA of n-nonane confirmed substantial formation of mesopores upon desilication, observed also in N 2 adsorption/ desorption isotherms. Very narrow mesopore size distributions with maxima at about 4 nm, typical for partially constricted mesopore networks, were obtained for all desilicated zeolites. It was also observed that desilication with NaOH/TBAOH results in formation of additional slightly larger mesopores (ca. 4 - 6 nm) while even larger mesopores (6 - 10 nm) were found after leaching with NaOH only.

40|$|The structural, textural and acidic {{characteristics}} of hierarchical ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 18 - 32), obtained with two desilication approaches, {{and the effect}} of these treatments on the reactivity in various cracking reactions of variable feedstock size and severity have been investigated. Emphasis is given to understanding the accessibility of acid sites; this was investigated by textural analysis, FTIR probe molecules (pyridine, trimethylacetonitrile and 2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridine) and reactions involving n-decane, 1, 3, 5 -triisopropylbenzene (TIPB), and low and high-density polyethylene, LDPE and HDPE, respectively. Higher surface areas and a narrower pore size distribution were obtained for NaOH&TBAOH-treated materials, comparing to NaOH-treated ones. FTIR studies of pivalonitrile and <b>collidine</b> adsorption correlate well with the mesopore surface area. For n-decane cracking activity, the acid strength is a determining factor, revealing that the NaOH&TBAOH treatment gave stronger sites than NaOH, but lower than the native zeolite. In contrast, the TIPB cracking activity was improved by the developed mesoporosity of the alkaline treated zeolites, and this was correlated to the pivalonitrile and <b>collidine</b> accessibility factors. During the n-decane and TIPB cracking, hydrogen transfer reactions were reduced, leading to high olefin production for the NaOH&TBAOH materials due to the shorter microporous paths after desilication. The increased accessibility of the acid sites also leads to an enhanced cracking activity of polyethylenes at low conversions, as determined by a decrease in the T 5 % and T 50 %; both parameters are linearly dependent on the pivalonitrile and <b>collidine</b> accessibility factors, for LDPE and HDPE. The T 5 % for HDPE is more influenced by the accessibility factors than it is for the LDPE. This is interpreted {{to be the result of}} the branching degree of HDPE and LDPE; linear HDPE is more sensitive to the enhanced number of pore mouths of ZSM- 5 channels on the mesopores. At high conversion, the influence on the T 50 % of the accessibility factors for HDPE and LDPE is weaker, suggesting that the cracking at this stage involves intermediate molecules of smaller size with fewer diffusional limitations.

Copper acetate reacts with dtbp-H in a reaction medium containing pyridine, DOC, THF, and CH 3 OH to yield a one-dimensional polymeric complex [Cu(dtbP) (2) (py) (2) (mu-OH 2) ](n) (1) as blue hollow crystalline tubes. The copper atoms in 1 are octahedral and are surrounded by two terminal phosphate ligands, two pyridine molecules, and two bridging water molecules. The mu-OH 2 ligands that are present along the elongated Jahn-Teller axis are responsible for the formation of the one-dimensional polymeric structure. Recrystallization of 1 in a DMSO/THF/CH 3 OH mixture results in the reorganization of the polymer and its conversion to a more stable tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu- 4 (mu(3) -OH) (2) (dtbP) (6) (py) (2) ] (2) in about 60 % yield. The molecular structure of 2 is made up of a tetranuclear core [Cu- 4 (mu(3) -OH) (2) ] which is surrounded by six bidentate bridging dtbp ligands. While two of the copper atoms are pentacoordinate with a tbp geometry, the other two copper atoms exhibit a pseudooctahedral geometry with five normal Cu-O bonds and an elongated Cu-O linkage.

Cu nonbonded distances in the tetranuclear core of 2 lead to magnetic ordering at low temperature with an antiferromagnetic coupling at similar to 20 K (J(p) = - 44 cm(- 1), J(c) = - 66 cm(- 1), g = 2. 25, and p = 0. 8 %).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal that <b>collidine</b> and 2 -apy capped zinc phosphates 1 - 6 exist as discrete tetrameric zinc phosphate molecules, exhibiting a cubane-shaped D 4 R core. In contrast, when the same reaction has been carried out {{in the presence of}} 4 -cyanopyridine (4 -CNpy), polymeric zinc phosphates {[Zn- 4 (X-dipp) (4) (4 -CNpy) (2) (MeOH) (2) ]center dot 2 H(2) O}(n) (X = Cl (7), Br (8), I (9)) have been isolated. Compounds 7 - 9 are square-wave-shaped, one-dimensional polymers composed of fused S 4 R repeating units. The common structural motif found both in D 4 R cubanes 1 - 6 and polymers 7 - 9 is the S 4 R building block, which presumably undergoes further fusion because of the coordinative unsaturation at zinc and the simultaneous presence of free P=O. The closed shell cubanes 1 - 6 are obviously formed by a face-to-face dimerization involving two S 4 R units in which the two P=O groups are in cis-configuration. On the other hand, the one-dimensional (1 -D) square-wave polymers 7 - 9 are formed from a face-to-face association of S 4 R building units in which the two P=O groups are in a trans-configuration. In order to stabilize these elusive S 4 R zinc phosphates, the reaction between Cl-dippH 2 and zinc acetate was carried out in the presence of excess imidazole as an ancillary ligand (1 : 1 : 4), although only an imidazole decorated cubane cluster [Zn(Cl-dipp) (imz) ] 4. 2 MeOH (10) was isolated. The chelating N,N'-donor 1, 10 -phenanthroline ligand was used to eventually isolate cyclic S 4 R phosphate [Zn(mu(2) -Cl-dipp) (1, 10 -phen) (OH 2) ](2) center dot MeOH center dot H 2 O (11). The change of Zn 2 + source to zinc nitrate and the phosphate source to 2, 6 -dimethylphenyl phosphate (dmppH 2) led to the isolation of another polymeric phosphate [Zn(dmpp) (MeOH) ](n) (12), with a zigzag backbone, formed through an edge-to-edge to polymerization of S 4 R building units with P=O groups in trans-configuration. The isolation of four different structural types of zinc phosphates A-D in the present study can be rationalized in terms of fusion of S 4 R rings {{in a variety of ways}} to either produce discrete clusters or 1 -D polymers...|$|E

40|$|A {{versatile}} desilication design {{strategy for}} the creation of hierarchical H–ZSM- 5 zeolite catalysts with different Si/Al ratios has been demonstrated. The nature, strength, and the accessibility of the acid sites after the alkaline treatment was elucidated by employing a range of physico-chemical characterization tools; notably probe-based FTIR spectroscopy along with Solid State (SS) MAS NMR spectroscopy. In addition, structural and textural properties of the hierarchical zeolites were also explored and compared to their corresponding microporous analogues.

Definitive studies demonstrating specific photosensitivity of the skin in the porphyric rats have been carried out. It has been established that the magnitude of porphyrin excretion {{as well as the}} type of porphyric pattern is dosage dependent. Increased fecal protoporphyrin output can occur without other evidence of porphyria at a low dosage level. As the drug dosage is increased, fecal and urinary coproporphyrin and finally urinary uroporphyrin values are additionally increased. These changes in porphyrin output have been explained on the current theory that DDC inhibits the incorporation of protoporphyrin into heme and the production of heme compounds so that by a positive feedback mechanism ALA synthetase is activated and excess urinary copro and uroporphyrin excretion occurs. The <b>collidine</b> derivative was well tolerated by animals receiving a conventional rat diet ad libitum, but in animals on purified diets a state of chronic nutrient deprivation precipitated acute toxicity.

I i The three alkaloids are postulated to be derived biogenetically from vincoside, the fused pyridine ring being formed via opening of the iridoid glycoside ring by ammonia (or equivalent). tocabstractChemistryMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of radiation on clinical and histologic changes, and on cutaneous eicosanoid metabolism, in Skh:HR- 1 hairless albino mice rendered protoporphyric by the administration of <b>collidine.</b> At 0. 1 – 18 h after exposure to 12 kJ/m 2 of 396 – 406 nm irradiation, thicknesses of back skin and ears were measured, and histologic changes were evaluated by using hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) and Giemsa's stains. Activities of eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes in epidermal and dermal homogenates were assessed by incubating the tissue homogenates with 3 H-AA, followed by quantitation of the eicosanoids generated by radio-TLC. In irradiated protoporphyric mice, an increase of back-skin thickness was noted at 0. 1 h, reaching a peak at 18 h, whereas maximal increase in ear thickness was observed at 12 h. Histologic changes included dermal edema, increased mast cell degranulation, and mononuclear cells in the dermis. In these irradiated protoporphyric animals, generations of 6 keto- PGF 1 a, PGF 2 a, PGE 2, PGD 2, and HETE by epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes were markedly suppressed at all the timepoints studied. Dermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes of irradiated protoporphyric mice generated increased amounts of PGE 2 and HETE at 18 h, probably reflecting the presence of dermal cellular infiltrates. The suppression of the activities of epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes was prevented by intraperitoneal injection of WR- 2721, a sulfhydryl group generator, prior to irradiation, suggesting that the suppression was secondary to photo-oxidative damage of the enzymes during the in vivo phototoxic response. These {{results suggest that the}} effect of protoporphyrin and radiation on cutaneous eicosanoid metabolism in this animal model in vivo is that of a down regulation of the activities of epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the well-known reaction of phosphonic acids RP(O) (OH) (2) with divalent transition-metal ions that yields layered metal phosphonates [RPO(3) M(H(2) O) ](n), the 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl ester of phosphoric acid, dippH(2), reacts with zinc acetate in methanol under ambient conditions to afford tetrameric zinc phosphate [(ArO) PO(3) Zn(MeOH) ](4) (1). The coordinated methanol in 1 can be readily exchanged by stronger Lewis basic ligands at room temperature. This strategy opens up {{a new avenue for}} building double-four-ring (D 4 R) cubane-based supramolecular assemblies through strong intercubane hydrogen-bonding interactions. Seventeen pyridinic ligands have been used to synthesize as many D 4 R cubanes [(ArO) PO(3) Zn(L) ](4) (2 - 18) from 1. The ligands have been chosen {{in such a way that}} the majority of them contain an additional functional group that could be used for noncovalent synthesis of extended structures. When the ligand does not contain any other hydrogen-bonding donor-acceptor sites (e. g., 2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridine (<b>collidine)),</b> zero-dimensional D 4 R cubanes have been obtained. The use of pyridine, lutidine, 2 -aminopyridine, and 2, 6 -diaminopyridine, however, results in the formation of linear or zigzag one-dimensional assemblies of D 4 R cubanes through strong intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot O or N-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions. Construction of two-dimensional assemblies of zinc phosphates has been achieved by employing 2 -hydroxypyridine or 2 -methylimidazole as the exo-cubane ligand on zinc centers. The introduction of an alcohol side chain on the pyridinic ligand in such a way that the -CH(2) OH group cannot participate in intracubane hydrogen bonding (e. g., pyridine- 3 -methanol, pyridine- 4 -methanol, and 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole-N-ethanol) leads to the facile noncovalent synthesis of three-dimensional framework structures. Apart from being useful as building blocks for noncovalent synthesis of zeolite-like materials, compounds 1 - 18 can also be thermolyzed at approximately 500 degrees C to yield high-purity zinc pyrophosphate (Zn(2) P(2) O(7)) ceramic material...|$|E
30|$|Grain {{samples were}} {{evaluated}} for 2 -AP concentration by synchronization distillation and extraction method (SDE) combined with GCMS-QP 2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) {{as described by}} Huang et al. (2012). Briefly, <b>Collidine</b> (2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridine) (Sigma, Switzerland), {{was used as an}} internal standard. 10  g of finely ground grain was transferred into a 500  mL round-bottom flask containing 145  mL purified water; 5  mL of 0.914  μg∙mL− 1 internal standard was then added. A steam distillation continuous extraction head was attached to the flask, and the flask was heated at 150 °C by an oil bath pot, ZKYY (Guangzhou, China). Attached to the other head of the steam distillation continuous extraction instrument, diethyl ether (35  mL) was used as the solvent in a 500  mL round-bottom flask, and the flask was heated at 42 °C by a water bath pot, HH- 2 (Jiangsu, China). During isolation, the steam distillation continuous extraction was maintained at 10 °C by a cold water circulation machine, YKKY-LX- 300 (Beijing, China). The isolation was performed for 35  min. The ether extract was then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered (0.22  μm filter paper, Shimadzu, Japan), and then directly used to measure 2 -AP concentrations with the GCMS-QP 2010 Plus method as described in Huang et al., (2012). The GCMS-QP 2010 Plus working conditions were as followings: gas chromatograph equipped with a Restek Rxi- 5  ms (Shimadzu, Japan) silica capillary column (30  m[*]×[*] 0. 32  mm[*]×[*] 0. 25  μm). The auto injector was AOC- 20 i, SPL 1. High purity helium gas (99.999 %, Guangzhou Gases Co., LTD, China) was the carrier gas at the flow rate of 2.0  mL∙min− 1. The temperature of the GC oven was 40 °C (1  min), increased at 2 °C∙min− 1 to 65 °C and held at 65 °C for 1  min, and then increased to 220 °C at 10 °C∙min− 1, and held at 220 °C for 10  min. The ion source temperature was 200 °C. Under these conditions, the retention time of 2 -AP was 7.5  min. 2 -AP content was expressed as μg∙kg− 1. The relative content of the aroma compounds were identified {{on the basis of their}} mass spectra by comparing the spectra with the records of the NIST library.|$|E
40|$|A {{solid-state}} NMR {{study of}} a range of tin- and silver-containing compounds has been carried out in order to obtain information on the chemical shifts, coupling constants and relaxation times. The results are discussed in relation to the crystal structures, where known, and some crystallographic information obtained in cases with no previously-known structures. For tin-containing compounds, solid-state (^ 119) Sn and (^ 31) P NMR comprise the majority of this work. Nevertheless, (^ 13) C NMR studies have been also carried out to assist the structure determination. Six Sn(II) compounds have been examined, including three which also contain phosphorus. Spinning sideband analysis has been achieved for (^ 119) Sn (in some cases (^ 31) P), giving information on the shielding tensors. Satellite peaks observed on the (^ 119) Sn NMR spectra of SnHPO(_ 3) and SnHP 0 (_ 4) reveal that the spectra contain information about indirect Sn(_ 2) Sn coupling. Since surprisingly large values of 2600 ± 200 Hz and 4150 ± 200 Hz are found for SnHPO(_ 3) and SnHPO(_ 4), respectively, the calculated relative intensities of the satellites and the results of a single Hahn echo experiment have been discussed in detail. The relatively isolated ((^ 1) H,(^ 31) P) spin pair in solid SnHPO(_ 3) have been extensively investigated in this work, though the systems are rather complicated. The (^ 1) H and (^ 31) P spectra display an intensity distribution of the spinning sidebands, which is the characteristic of an interplay of shielding, dipolar and indirect coupling tensors dominated, by the strong dipolar interactions. A single Hahn echo experiment was employed to reveal indirect spin-spin coupling ((^ 1) JPH). Strong oscillatory polarization transfer by dipolar interaction occurs during short contact times on moderately fast magic-angle spinning and the P,H distances were extracted (including for SnHPO(_ 4)). Rather complicated (^ 1) H NMR spectra under (^ 31) P continuous-wave decoupling arises from a second-order recoupling of the heteronuclear dipolar-coupling tensor and the shielding tensor of ^'P, leading to line-splittings and broadenings in the {(^ 31) P}(^ 1) H spectra. Additionally, measurement of (^ 1) H and (^ 31) P relaxation times has been undertaken, producing results which were expected to follow the behaviour characteristic of an isolated two-spin system, but anomalies were observed. Various nuclei, such as (^ 13) C, (^ 15) N, (^ 31) P and (^ 109) Ag, in silver-containing compounds have been studied, and provide information on indirect spin-spin interactions, (^ 1) J((^ 109) Ag (^ 14) N) and (^ 1) J((^ 109) Ag(^ 15) N). The (^ 109) Ag NMR spectra for [Ag(NH(_ 3) (_ 2)) (_ 2) X where X = SO(_ 4), SeO(_ 4), NO(_ 3) show spinning sideband manifolds, which are typical for systems with moderately large shielding anisotropy. Other silver compounds namely [Ag(R) (_ 2) ]NO(_ 3) where R = pyridine, <b>collidine,</b> 2 -picoline, quinoline and AgY where Y = HPO(_ 4) and PO(_ 4), have been investigated to give as much complementary information about the chemical shifts as possible.
