25|$|Dudayev {{was born}} in Yalkhoroy in the {{abolished}} Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), {{just days before the}} forced deportation of his family together with the entire Chechen and Ingush population on the orders of Joseph Stalin. His family was of the Yalhoroy Teip. He was the thirteenth youngest child of veterinarian Musa and Rabiat Dudayev. He spent the first 13 years of his life in internal exile in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. His family was only able to return to Chechnya in 1957. Following the 1957 repatriation of the Chechens and Ingush, he studied at evening school in <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> and qualified as an electrician. In 1962, after two years studying electronics in Vladikavkaz, he entered the Tambov Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots from which he graduated in 1966. Dudayev joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1968 and in 1971–1974 studied at the prestigious Gagarin Air Force Academy. He married Alla, a Russian poet and the daughter of a Soviet officer with whom he had three children (a daughter and two sons).|$|E
25|$|In Chechnya, using tactics partly {{copied from}} the Baltics, anti-Communist {{coalition}} forces {{led by former}} Soviet general Dzhokhar Dudayev staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing {{the resignation of the}} Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed <b>Checheno-Ingushetia's</b> independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to his desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the First Chechen War. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.|$|R

Most of Ingushetia's {{territory}} had been settled by Ossetians and part of the region had been transferred to North Ossetia. The returning Ingush faced considerable animosity from the Ossetians. The Ingush were forced to buy their homes back from the Ossetians and Russians. These hardships and injustices led to a peaceful Ingush protest in Grozny on 16 January 1973, which was crushed by the Soviet troops In 1989, the Ingush were officially rehabilitated along with other peoples that had been subjected to repressions.|$|E
2500|$|From 1991 to 1994, tens of {{thousands}} of people of non-Chechen ethnicity left the republic amidst reports of violence and discrimination against the non-Chechen population (mostly Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians). Chechen industry began to fail as a result of many Russian engineers and workers leaving or being expelled from the republic combined with the Soviet era's crippling of the non-Russian/Armenian/Ukrainian populace (Chechens, some Ingush and Nogais, Jews) through Russian-only schooling, heavy discrimination in the public sector of the workforce, and other similar measures (even as late as 1989, <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> was ruled by a bureaucracy of ethnic Russians). During the undeclared Chechen civil war, factions both sympathetic and opposed to Dudayev fought for power, sometimes in pitched battles with the use of heavy weapons. In March 1992, the opposition attempted a coup d'état, but their attempt was crushed by force. A month later, Dudayev introduced direct presidential rule, and in June 1993, dissolved the Chechen parliament to avoid a referendum on a vote of non-confidence. In late October 1992, Russian forces dispatched to the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict were ordered to move to the Chechen border; Dudayev, who perceived this as [...] "an act of aggression against the Chechen Republic", declared a state of emergency and threatened general mobilization if the Russian troops did not withdraw from the Chechen border.

50|$|By {{the next}} summer, <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> was dissolved; {{a number of}} Chechen and Ingush placenames were {{replaced}} with Russian ones; mosques and graveyards were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical Chechen texts was near complete. Throughout the North Caucasus, about 700,000 (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297, of which the majority, 479,478, were Chechens, along with 96,327 Ingush, 104,146 Kalmyks, 39,407 Balkars and 71,869 Karachays) were deported. Many died along the trip, and the extremely harsh environment of Siberia {{as well as of}} other regions the people were deported to (especially considering the amount of exposure) killed many more.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of this, by the mid-1970s a {{systematic}} emigration of Russians from the republic started, due to the social discirimation in favour of the only nationality (all administrative roles of <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> by the late 1970s were held by Chechens). By {{the end of the}} 1980s, Chechens formed the majority in all mountainous regions, and almost half of the population in traditional ethnic Russian/Cossack regions (left banks of the Terek and Sunzha Rivers, cities of Grozny and Gudermes) the catalyst was set for the mass ethnic cleansing of the Russian population {{that took place in the}} 1990s. Today Russians make up a tiny minority in both Chechnya and Ingushetia.|$|E
5000|$|... ===After {{the return}} from Central Asia=== After 13 years of exile Ingush {{were allowed to}} return to <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> (but not to Ordzhonikidze a.k.a.

5000|$|Many {{returning}} Chechens {{were settled}} in the lowland steppe regions, and in Grozny itself rather than the historical mountainous districts. The goal of this (and, indeed, adding Shelkovskaya and Naursky to <b>Checheno-Ingushetia)</b> {{was to try to}} forcefully assimilate the Chechens by keeping them away from the mountains and reminders of [...] "their ancient struggles", and to keep them mixed in with supposedly more loyal Russians so they could not rebel without a counter-force present. Ultimately, the attempt to make <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> more multi-ethnic in order to weaken the potential for national awakening and uprising failed, however, due to the Vainakh's much higher birthrate. It did however succeed in deepening and renewing ethnic conflict between Chechens and Russians. The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership (they had come to view the lands they had settled as [...] "theirs") and job competition, rioted as early as 1958. In the 1958 Grozny riots, the Russians seized the central government buildings and demanded either a restoring of Grozny Oblast, or a creation of a non-titular autonomy, re-deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, establishment of [...] "Russian power", mass search and disarming of Vainakh, before Soviet law-enforcement dispersed the rioters. On the 27th, Major General Stepanov of the Military Aviation School issued an ultimatum to the local Soviet that the Chechens must be sent back to Siberia and Central Asia or otherwise his Russians would [...] "tear (them) to pieces". Although the riot was dispersed and it was denounced as [...] "chauvinistic", afterward, the republican government made special efforts to please the Russian populace, and mass discrimination against the Chechens aimed at preserving the privileged position of the Russians commenced (see below).|$|E
50|$|By 1943, as the Germans {{began to}} retreat in the Eastern Front, the {{mountain}} guerrillas saw their fortunes change as many former rebels defected to the Soviets in exchange of amnesty. On December 6, 1943, German involvement in Chechnya ended when Soviet counter-intelligence agents infiltrated and arrested the remaining German operatives in Chechnya. After the German {{retreat from the}} Caucasus, almost 500,000 of Chechen and Ingush people from <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> {{as well as other}} republics were forcibly resettled to Siberia and Central Asia (mostly to Kazakhstan SSR) en masse, resulting in a large number of deaths among the deportees. Many of those who were not deported were simply massacred on the spot. In mountainous regions of the country, mass atrocities such as the Khaibakh massacre took place.|$|E
50|$|By {{the next}} summer, <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> was dissolved; {{a number of}} Chechen and Ingush placenames were {{replaced}} with Russian ones; mosques and graveyards were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical Chechen texts was near complete (leaving the world depleted of what {{was more or less}} the only source of central Caucasian literature and historical texts except for sparse texts about the Chechens, Ingush, etc., not written by themselves, but by Georgians) Throughout the North Caucasus, about 700,000 (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297, of which the majority, 479,478, were Chechens, along with 96,327 Ingush, 104,146 Kalmyks, 39,407 Balkars and 71,869 Karachais).

5000|$|On November 25, 1990, {{the first}} Chechen National Congress {{declared}} the [...] "rightful sovereignty" [...] of the [...] "Chechen Republic of Noxçi-ço". Two days later, on November 27, the Supreme Soviet declared its agreement with this by declaring Checheno-Ingushetia's sovereignty and {{adding that it}} would negotiate with Russia on equal footing, raising Chechnya {{to the level of}} Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia - that is, a Union Republic. At this point, the Chechen Communists had begun supporting [...] "full sovereignty at a minimum", meaning utterly every major party in Chechnya that included Chechens - the VDP, the Greens, the Communists, the Islamic Path Party, and the secularist Popular Front of <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> (modeled off that of Azerbaijan) - supported sovereignty, if not full independence.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the main}} cause in modern days of the {{critical}} choice the Ingush made in 1991 was acquired during Russian imperial rule- the East Prigorodny conflict, where the Ossetes were encouraged, with Russian assistance, to dispossess the Ingush of roughly a little over half their land, kick them out, and massacre those that tried to stay. The conflict over the land, which the Ingush view as necessary to any Ingush political unit, continues today, and the Ingush considered it more important than unity with their brothers (much to the Chechens' dismay). This meant that when <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> declared independence from Russia in November 1991, the Ingush would decide to withdraw, not {{because they did not}} want independence, but because a state boundary splitting them from Prigorodny would put it out of their reach.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, the hugely {{inadequate}} government {{response to}} the earthquakes in Armenia and Azerbaijan triggered a mass desertion of the Soviet system in general by the Eastern Caucasian regions (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Dagestan) that had been relatively loyal previously. The Azeri Popular Front, formed in 1989, {{was to become a}} pole to which the opposition gravitated. It's habitually theatrical activities paired with its occasional tendency to cite pan-Turkist ideology and the ethnic similarities between Azeris and the Karachays and Balkars drew the mass interest of the Balkar and Karachay public. Nonetheless, their activities remained timid. It wasn't until 1991, after Georgia and Armenia had already seceded from the Soviet Union, Dudayev had defected from the Red Army (while back in <b>Checheno-Ingushetia</b> the anti-Zavgayev forces were gathering power), and Azerbaijan was preparing to leave the union (only Dagestan had no plans for secession, because of its own multiethnic makeup and fragile situation), that the Balkars and Karachay began to stage their own demands.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the {{unravelling}} of the Restructuring, the Soviet government {{attempted to}} find a new structure which would reflect the increasing power of the republics. Some autonomous republics, like Tatarstan, <b>Checheno-Ingushetia,</b> Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Transnistria, Gagauzia sought the union statute in New Union Treaty. Efforts of foundation of Union of Sovereign States proved unsuccessful and the republics began to secede from the Union. By 6 September 1991, the Soviet Union's State Council recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania bringing the number of union republics down to 12. On 8 December 1991, the remaining republic leaders signed the Belavezha Accords which agreed that the USSR would be dissolved and replaced with a Commonwealth of Independent States. On 25 December, President Gorbachev announced his resignation and turned all executive powers over to Yeltsin. The next day the Council of Republics voted to dissolve the Union. Since then, the republics have been governed independently with some adopting significantly more liberal policies while others, particularly in Central Asia, retain leadership personnel from the Soviet time to this day.|$|E

50|$|The {{end of the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774 ensured Russia's {{expansion}} into the Caucasus and created a need in populating these lands with Russian subjects in order to hasten its exploration. In {{the late eighteenth century}} the government permitted families of Volga Germans to settle in Kuban. However, poor infrastructure, lack of organization of the officials responsible for the settlement, and the refusal of the military personnel to have these lands populated by non-Russians were an obstacle to steady and constant migration of the Germans. By the late 1840s there were five German colonies in the North Caucasus. The migration waves (especially to Don Voisko Province) grew beginning {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century with the capitalist influence on farming in Russia. Germans would immigrate not only from the regions adjacent to the Volga River but also from the Black Sea region and Germany. By the time of the October Revolution, there were over 200 German colonies in the North Caucasus; of those over 100 were in Rostov Oblast, 60 in Stavropol Krai and around 20 in Krasnodar Krai. In 1942 more than 160,000 Germans were deported from these entities as well as from elsewhere in the North Caucasus and the Don region (Kabardino-Balkaria, Kalmykia, North Ossetia, Dagestan, and <b>Checheno-Ingushetia).</b>|$|E

The historical experience of {{the development of the}} vocational education system can be used in the process of modernization of the economy, business and scientific-educational sphere of the Chechen Republic. The results of the study show that the diversified production with high potential for technological development, created in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic by the mid- 1980 s, was a promising basis for further development of the vocational education system, including training of specialists and skilled workers in the most modern professions in the field of precision engineering and information technologies. The demand for these educational fields and their relevance to the social and cultural needs of the Chechen youth are proved by the modern trends of innovative development of vocational education in the Chechen Republic. Modernization process in the Chechen Republic in the early XXI century demonstrates the effectiveness of combining traditional cultural values with innovative technologies in education, industrial production and social sphere and with creation of dynamic competitive economy and educational system in the Republic. </p...|$|E
