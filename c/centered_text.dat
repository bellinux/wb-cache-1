5000|$|Text {{can also}} be [...] "centered", or symmetrically aligned along an axis {{in the middle of}} a column. This is often used for the title of a work, headlines, and for poems and songs. As with flush-right alignment, <b>centered</b> <b>text</b> is often used to present data in tables. <b>Centered</b> <b>text</b> is {{considered}} less readable for a body of text made up of multiple lines because the ragged starting edges make it difficult for the reader to track from one line to the next.|$|E
5000|$|This public {{disclosure}} {{is done in}} a form that lists the participants in a specified order according to their role in underwriting or brokering the transaction. The name of this disclosure comes from the appearance of advertisement used, a 'tombstone ad', so called because the simple, <b>centered</b> <b>text</b> style with large amounts of whitespace and few if any images or other adornments make them resemble some of the tombstones found in cemeteries. Additional information such as [...] "photographs of investment properties or descriptions of the tax benefits of investments" [...] are not allowed in financial tombstones. However, another view is that in the 19th century, financial notices were published in newspapers alongside birth and death notices.|$|E

5000|$|WordPad can {{format and}} print text, {{including}} fonts, bold, italic, colored, and <b>centered</b> <b>text,</b> etc., but lacks such features as a spell checker, thesaurus, {{and control over}} pagination. It does not support footnotes or endnotes. However WordPad can read, render, and save many Rich Text Format (RTF) features that it cannot create such as tables, strikeout, superscript, subscript, [...] "extra" [...] colors, text background colors, numbered lists, right or left indent, quasi-hypertext and URL linking, and various line spacings. Among its advantages are low system-resource usage, simplicity, and speed. Pasting into or from an HTML document such as from the internet or email will typically automatically convert {{most or all of}} it to RTF (although this is partially browser-dependent). As such, WordPad is well suited for taking notes, writing letters and stories, or for usage in various tablets, PCs, and smart phones. However, WordPad is underpowered for work that relies heavily on graphics or typesetting such as most publishing-industry requirements for rendering final hard copy.|$|E
5000|$|PC Magazine {{stated in}} March 1983 that [...] "WordPerfect is very impressive, {{a more than}} full-featured program with a few truly {{state-of-the-art}} goodies tucked into the package". It cited WordPerfect's inclusion of mail merge, footnotes, and macros—all missing from WordStar—as well as [...] "virtually every ... feature that one ought to expect from a higher-priced program" [...] including find-and-replace, bold and underline display, and automatic paragraph reflow. BYTE in December 1984 noted the application's built-in print buffer, ability to show bold, underline, and <b>centered</b> <b>text,</b> and extensive math capabilities. It criticized {{the quality of the}} spell checker and difficult tab settings, but concluded that [...] "its powerful capabilities far outweigh the problems mentioned". Compute! in August 1985 called WordPerfect [...] "excellent". It especially praised the clean, uncluttered screen and fast spell checker. Noting the spell checker's size and the company's [...] "excellent track record of supporting its software", Antic in May 1988 concluded that [...] "If you want to own the most power-packed word processor available for the ST today, and can live with the relative complexity needed for harnessing this power, WordPerfect is what you've been waiting for." ...|$|E

Our model allows to consider {{a certain kind of}} structural information: tags that represent logical structure (title, section, etc.) as well as tags related to formatting (bold font, <b>centered</b> <b>text,</b> etc.). We first take into account the tags influence by estimating the probability that tags distinguishes terms which are the most relevant. Then, these weights are impacted on terms weighting function using several combining schemes. Experiments on a large collection during INEX 2008 XML IR evaluation campaign (INitiative for Evaluation of XML Retrieval) showed that using tags leads to improvements on focused retrieval...|$|E
