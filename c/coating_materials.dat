25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other <b>coating</b> <b>materials</b> over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part epoxy coating.|$|E
