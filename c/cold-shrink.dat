40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of two <b>cold-shrink</b> stress control tube based on {{ethylene propylene diene}} monomer (EPDM) and silicon rubber were analyzed to determine the suitable expressions for the electrical parameters {{to be used in}} numerical programs. The influence of the polymeric matrix, the elastic deformation due to the different shrinkage diameter and temperature on the properties of the materials were considered. The elastic deformation induced by the different shrinkage diameter produced some modifications especially in the characteristics of EPDM based composites. A non-monotonic behaviour of either the resistivity or the permittivity versus the shrinkage diameter was shown for these materials...|$|E
