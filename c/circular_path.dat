5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is the <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> on {{the celestial}} sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E

50|$|From {{ancient times}} until the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the motions of}} the planets were {{believed}} to follow perfectly <b>circular</b> geocentric <b>paths</b> as taught by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Ptolemy. Variations in the motions of the planets were explained by smaller <b>circular</b> <b>paths</b> overlaid on the larger path (see epicycle). As measurements of the planets became increasingly accurate, revisions to the theory were proposed. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a heliocentric model of the solar system, although he still believed that the planets traveled in perfectly <b>circular</b> <b>paths</b> centered on the sun.|$|R
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly <b>circular</b> <b>path.</b> The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
5|$|The Avon rises east of {{the town}} of Chipping Sodbury in South Gloucestershire, just north of the village of Acton Turville. Running a {{somewhat}} <b>circular</b> <b>path,</b> the river drains east and then south through Wiltshire. Its first main settlement is the village of Luckington, two miles (3km) inside the Wiltshire border, and then on to Sherston. At Malmesbury it joins up with its first major tributary, the Tetbury Avon, which rises just north of Tetbury in Gloucestershire. This tributary is known locally as the Ingleburn, which in Old English means 'English river'. Here, the two rivers almost meet but their path is blocked by a rocky outcrop of the Cotswolds, almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of Malmesbury to sit on. Upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the 'River Avon (Sherston Branch)' to distinguish it from the Tetbury Branch.|$|E

5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
25|$|One common example {{involving}} {{centripetal force}} {{is the case}} in which a body moves with uniform speed along a <b>circular</b> <b>path.</b> The centripetal force is directed at right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the <b>circular</b> <b>path.</b> The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens.|$|E

50|$|Weak {{focusing}} {{occurs in}} particle accelerators when charged particles are passing through uniform magnetic fields, {{causing them to}} move in <b>circular</b> <b>paths</b> due to the Lorentz force.

25|$|The {{resulting}} protons then {{enter the}} booster ring, a 468m-circumference circular accelerator whose magnets bend beams of protons around a <b>circular</b> <b>path.</b> The protons {{travel around the}} Booster about 20,000 times in 33 milliseconds, adding energy with each revolution until they leave the Booster accelerated to 8GeV.|$|E
25|$|These {{equations}} express mathematically that, in {{the case}} of an object that moves along a <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> with a changing speed, the acceleration of the body may be decomposed into a perpendicular component that changes the direction of motion (the centripetal acceleration), and a parallel, or tangential component, that changes the speed.|$|E
25|$|From {{the fixed}} {{inertial}} {{frame of reference}} above Earth, the train travelling east now rotates at twice the rate as when it was at rest—so the amount of centripetal force needed to cause that <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> increases leaving less force from gravity {{to act on the}} track. This is what the Coriolis term accounts for on the previous paragraph.|$|E

40|$|Micro-end-milling {{requires}} high spindle {{rotational speed}} to achieve effective material removal. This results in the requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A <b>circular</b> tool <b>path</b> geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry during end-milling along a <b>circular</b> tool <b>path</b> is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for <b>circular</b> tool <b>paths</b> with higher tool path radius, {{this is not the case}} for lower tool path radius often used in micro-milling. In this study, the effect of <b>circular</b> tool <b>path</b> on the cutting force for varying tool path rotation angle, tool path radius, and feed rate is experimentally investigated. Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the measured cutting force signal along linear and several <b>circular</b> tool <b>paths.</b> Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the cutting force profiles obtained using different tool path radii, tool path orientations, and feed rates. This implies the need for an improved chip thickness formulation dedicated to micro-end-milling with <b>circular</b> tool <b>path</b> rather than approximating it with formulations derived for linear tool path. 9 Authors 2011.

25|$|By {{combining}} the magnetron concept with resonator loops created by drilling holes in solid copper, an idea from W. W. Hansen's work on klystrons, the two constructed a model {{version of what}} they called the resonant cavity magnetron. They placed it inside a glass enclosure evacuated with an external vacuum pump, and placed the entire assembly between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet, which caused the electrons to bend around into a <b>circular</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{circular}} motion {{is a movement}} of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a <b>circular</b> <b>path.</b> It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves {{circular motion}} of its parts. The equations of motion describe {{the movement of the}} center of mass of a body.|$|E

25|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} {{velocity and}} acceleration vectors for uniform motion at four {{different points in}} the orbit. Because the velocity v is tangent to the <b>circular</b> <b>path,</b> no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant speed, its direction is always changing. This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration a, whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) held constant, but whose direction also is always changing. The acceleration points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.|$|E
25|$|In physics, uniform {{circular}} motion describes {{the motion of}} a body traversing a <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> at constant speed. Since the body describes {{circular motion}}, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates {{the presence of an}} acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times towards the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|Another hunting weapon, {{based on}} {{different}} principles than the spear, is the throwing stick. While at its simplest the throwing stick {{is just a}} heavy club thrown at the game, a well designed throwing stick uses the principles of an airfoil shape and gyroscopic stability; the oldest of these dates back 200,000 years to ancient Poland. The kylie, for example, an Australian hunting boomerang in use into modern times, uses the bent shape and a symmetric airfoil cross section to provide stability and low drag for long, accurate throws. Kylies do not return (a good thing, since they are large, heavy, and dangerous) but smaller, lighter versions, the classic boomerang, exhibit the classic <b>circular</b> <b>path</b> that made the boomerang famous. Boomerangs, of both the non-returning and returning variety, {{have been found in}} many ancient cultures, ranging from Egypt to North America.|$|E
