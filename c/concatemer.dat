25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in <b>concatemer</b> formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAVs also present very low immunogenicity, seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined cytotoxic response. This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for human gene therapy.|$|E

50|$|A <b>concatemer</b> {{is a long}} {{continuous}} DNA molecule {{that contains}} multiple copies of the same DNA sequences linked in series. These polymeric molecules are usually copies of an entire genome linked end to end and separated by cos sites (a protein binding nucleotide sequence that occurs once in each copy of the genome). Concatemers are frequently the result of rolling circle replication, and {{may be seen in}} the late stage of bacterial infection by phages. As an example, if the genes in the phage DNA are arranged ABC, then in a <b>concatemer</b> the genes would be ABCABCABCABC and so on. They are further broken by ribozymes.|$|E
50|$|The P1 plasmid has a {{separate}} {{origin of replication}} (oriL) that is activated during the lytic cycle. Replication begins by a regular bidirectional theta replication at oriL but later in the lytic phase,it switches to a rolling circle method of replication using the host recombination machinery. This results in numerous copies of the genome being present on a single linear DNA molecule called a <b>concatemer.</b> The end of the <b>concatemer</b> is cut a specific site called the pac site or packaging site. This {{is followed by the}} packing of the DNA into the heads till they are full. The rest of the <b>concatemer</b> that does not fit into one head is separated and the machinery begins packing this into a new head. The location of the cut is not sequence specific. Each head holds around 110kbp of DNA so there is a little more than one complete copy of the genome (~90kbp) in each head, with the ends of the strand in each head being identical. After infecting a new cell this terminal redundancy is used by the host recombination machinery to cyclize the genome if it lacks two copies of the lox locus. If two lox sites are present (one in each terminally redundant end) the cyclization is carried out by the cre recombinase.|$|E

50|$|In the viral {{particle}} the DNA molecule is longer (110Kbp) {{than the actual}} length of the genome. It is created by cutting an appropriately sized fragment from a concatemeric DNA chain having multiple copies of the genome (see the section below on lysis for how this is made).

50|$|Although most ribozymes {{are quite}} {{rare in the}} cell, their roles are {{sometimes}} essential to life. For example, the functional part of the ribosome, the molecular machine that translates RNA into proteins, is fundamentally a ribozyme, composed of RNA tertiary structural motifs that are often coordinated to metal ions such as Mg2+ as cofactors. In a model system, there is no requirement for divalent cations in a five-nucleotide RNA catalyzing trans-phenylalanation of a four-nucleotide substrate with 3 base pairs complementary with the catalyst, where the catalyst/substrate were devised by truncation of the C3 ribozyme.

It {{has been shown}} in studies that activation of the MRN complex and ATM biochemical cascade is consistent for a resulting HSV-1 infection. When there is an HSV-1 infection, the nucleus is reorganized causing the formation of RCs (replication compartments) where gene expression and DNA replication occurs. Proteins in the host used for DNA repair and damage response are needed for virus production. ICP8, which is a viral single-strand binding protein, is known to interact with several DNA repair proteins, such as Rad50, Mre11, BRG1, and DNA-PKcs. Ul12 and ICP8 viral proteins function together as a recombinase, possibly showing that while working with the host's recombination factors, work to form a <b>concatemer</b> by stimulating homologous recombination. These proteins may move the MRN complex towards the viral genome so it is able to promote homologous recombination, and to prevent non-homologous recombination as non-homologous recombination can have anti-viral effects. This possibly shows that the reaction between UL12 and MRN regulates the complex in a way that benefits the herpes virus.|$|E

40|$|Serial {{analysis}} of gene expression (SAGE) and related techniques are gaining popularity as tools for exploring expression of plant genes but remain suboptimal because of smaller-than-expected average <b>concatemer</b> sizes. The presence of low-molecular-weight contaminants in high-molecular-weight <b>concatemer</b> fractions reduces the average size of cloned fragments, thereby limiting {{the viability of}} high-throughput sequencing methods. Implementation of an additional digestion step to promote formation of linear <b>concatemer</b> fragments appears to reduce the proportion of contaminants indirectly, but with variable results. We explored the effect of initial ditag polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantity on the average size of cloned concatemers from the greater than 1000 -bp fraction.

40|$|Herpesviruses {{have large}} {{double-stranded}} linear DNA genomes that are formed by site-specific cleavage from complex concatemeric intermediates. In this process, {{only one of}} the two genomic ends are formed on the <b>concatemer.</b> Although the mechanism underlying this asymmetry is not known, one explanation is that single genomes are cleaved off of <b>concatemer</b> ends in a preferred direction. This implies that cis elements control the direction of packaging. Two highly conserved cis elements named pac 1 and pac 2 lie near opposite ends of herpesvirus genomes and are important for cleavage and packaging. By comparison of published reports and by analysis of two additional herpesviruses, we found that pac 2 elements lie near the ends formed on replicative concatemers of four herpesviruses: herpes simplex virus type 1, equine herpesvirus 1, guinea pig cytomegalovirus, and murine cytomegalovirus. Formation of pac 2 ends on concatemers depended on terminal cis sequences, since ectopic cleavage sites engineered into the murine cytomegalovirus genome mediated formation of pac 2 ends on concatemers regardless of the orientation of their insertion. These findings are consistent with a model in which pac 2 elements at <b>concatemer</b> ends impart a directionality to <b>concatemer</b> packaging by binding proteins that initiate insertion of <b>concatemer</b> ends into empty capsids...|$|E
40|$|The ligand-binding {{region of}} the low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) receptor is formed by seven N-terminal, imperfect, cysteine-rich (LB) modules. This segment is followed by an epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain with two N-terminal, tandem, EGF-like modules that are thought to participate in LDL binding and recycling of the endocytosed receptor to the cell surface. EGF-A and the <b>concatemer,</b> EGF-AB, of these modules were expressed in Escherichia coli. Correct protein folding of EGF-A and the <b>concatemer</b> EGF-AB was achieved in {{the presence or absence}} of calcium ions, in contrast to the LB modules, which require them for correct folding. Homonuclear and heteronuclear H- 1 -N- 15 NMR spectroscopy at 17. 6 T was used to determine the three-dimensional structure of the <b>concatemer.</b> Both modules are formed by two pairs of short, anti-parallel beta -strands. In the <b>concatemer,</b> these modules have a fixed relative orientation, stabilized by calcium ion-binding and hydrophobic interactions at the interface. N- 15 longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates, and {H- 1 }-N- 15 heteronuclear NOEs were used to derive a model-free description of the backbone dynamics of the molecule. The <b>concatemer</b> appears relatively rigid, particularly near the calcium ion-binding site at the module interface, with an average generalized order parameter of 0. 85 +/- 0. 11. Some mutations causing familial hypercholesterolemia may now be rationalized. Mutations of D 41, D 43 and E 44 in the EGF-B calcium ion-binding region may affect the stability of the linker and thus the orientation of the tandem modules. The diminutive core also provides little structural stabilization, necessitating the presence of disulfide bonds. The structure and dynamics of EGF-AB contrast with the N-terminal LB modules, which require calcium ions both for folding to form the correct disulfide connectivities and for maintenance of the folded structure, and are connected by highly mobile linking peptides.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intracellular}} replicating form of T 7 DNA is a <b>concatemer</b> {{in which}} linear genomes are joined {{head to tail}} by sharing 160 -bp terminally repeated sequences. A unique hairpin (M-hairpin) end generated {{on the left side}} of the TR was proposed to be responsible for the duplication of the <b>concatemer</b> junction for efficient packaging. We characterized the defects caused by loss of the M-hairpin by constructing a recombinant T 7 (T 7 Δm) deleted in themregion. Initially, the intracellular growth rate of progeny phage was normal in T 7 Δminfection. However, the titer of progeny phage was eventually reduced by two- to threefold and lysis was significantly delayed. The restriction fragment, LEΔ 160, generated simultaneously with the double-strand cleavage at the onset of packaging reaction was found more or less at the same intensity in both T 7 +and T 7 Δminfection at the beginning but preferentially in T 7 Δminfection during the later phase of infection. These observations suggest that the DNA packaging of T 7 proceeds on the intact <b>concatemer</b> junctions during the early stage of infection while the duplication of the <b>concatemer</b> junction by the M-hairpin seemed to be important during the later phase, presumably due to reduced replication. While the generation of the M-hairpin involves DNA replication, the loss ofmdid not reduce DNA synthesis, suggesting that the role of the M-hairpin as an origin of replication is minimal...|$|E

40|$|The ligand-binding {{domain of}} the low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) receptor is comprised of seven tandemly repeated ligand-binding modules, each being approximately 40 amino acids long and containing six conserved cysteine residues. We have expressed and characterized a <b>concatemer</b> {{of the first two}} modules (LB 1 and LB 2) of the human LDL receptor. Oxidative folding of the recombinant <b>concatemer</b> (rLB(1 - 2)), in the presence of calcium ions, gave a single dominant isomer with six disulfide bonds. Peptic cleavage of the short Linker region that connects the last cysteine residue of LB 1 and the first cysteine residue of LB 2 yielded two discrete fragments, thus excluding the presence of intermodule disulfide bonds. The N-terminal module, LB 1, reacted with a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (IgG-C 7) made to LB 1 in the native LDL receptor. From this, we concluded that the first module was correctly folded, with the same set of disulfide bonds as LB 1 of the LDL receptor. The disulfide bond connections of LB 2 were identified from mass spectral analysis of fragments formed by digestion of the C-terminal peptic fragment with elastase. These data showed that the disulfide bonds of LB 2 connected Cys(I) and Cys(III), Cys(II) and Cys(V), and Cys(IV) and Cys(VI). This pattern is identical to that found for recombinant LB 1 and LB 2. The <b>concatemer</b> has two high-affinity calcium-binding sites, one per module. An analysis of the secondary chemical shifts of C alpha protons shows that the conformations of LB 1 and LB 2 in the <b>concatemer</b> are very {{similar to those of the}} individual modules, with no evidence for strong interactions between the two modules...|$|E

Infection with E 4 -deleted viruses results in activation of a DNA damage response, accumulation of cellular repair factors in foci at viral replication centers, and joining together of viral genomes into concatemers. The cellular DNA repair complex composed of Mre 11, Rad 50, and Nbs 1 (MRN) is required for <b>concatemer</b> formation and full activation of damage signaling through the protein kinases Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-Rad 3 -related (ATR). The E 4 orf 3 and E 4 orf 6 proteins expressed from the E 4 region of Ad type 5 (Ad 5) inactivate the MRN complex by degradation and mislocalization, and prevent the DNA damage response. Here we investigated individual contributions of the MRN complex, <b>concatemer</b> formation, and damage signaling to viral DNA replication during infection with E 4 -deleted virus. Using virus mutants, short hairpin RNA knockdown and hypomorphic cell lines, we show that inactivation of MRN results in increased viral replication. We demonstrate that defective replication {{in the absence of}} E 4 is not due to <b>concatemer</b> formation or DNA damage signaling. The C terminus of Nbs 1 is required for the inhibition of Ad DNA replication and recruitment of MRN to viral replication centers. We identified regions of Nbs 1 that are differentially required for <b>concatemer</b> formation and inhibition of Ad DNA replication. These results demonstrate that targeting of the MRN complex explains the redundant functions of E 4 orf 3 and E 4 orf 6 in promoting Ad DNA replication.

For example, the DNA <b>concatemer,</b> one of the simplest DNA constructs in shape, {{has been used to}} enhance signals in biosensing. In this thesis, concatemers were designed and characterized towards sequence-specific target amplifiers for single molecule mechanical studies. The project firstly focuses on exploring how to obtain concatemers of satisfactory length by self-assembly in bulk. Concatemers formed in solution by mixing of the different components were characterized by gel electrophoresis and AFM. Experimental results show that the <b>concatemer</b> yield could be increased primarily by increasing the ionic strength, and linear concatemers of expected length could be separated from mixed sizes and shapes. As an alternative, a platform for <b>concatemer</b> formation based on a planar surface was investigated by immobilizing and sequentially hybridizing oligonucleotides to concatemers. This method was further improved by involving click-reaction to link the nicks on backbones of the concatemers. QCM-D and SPR were utilized to monitor the step-by-step construction process. Gel electrophoresis shows that concatemers with desired length were successfully formed in a controllable manner. Furthermore, the surface-based <b>concatemer</b> formation platform was applied to study DNA-ligand interaction using QCM-D and SPR. We selected three ligands, known to bind to DNA: spermidine, spermine and RAD 51. We observed that polyamines condense the DNA layers; by contrast, RAD 51 induces an extension of the DNA layer. This study provides some guidelines for QCM-D and SPR-based characterization of changes in the properties of DNA films (e. g., thickness, viscoelastic properties) on sensor surfaces. It is interesting to correlate these changes to structural and mechanical changes induced in single DNA molecules upon ligand binding. The biosensing approach provides rapid access to kinetic data of DNA-ligand interactions, which is typically useful in various screening applications...|$|E

Infection of KB human epidermoid carcinoma cells with either mutant resulted in production of large concatemers of viral DNA. Only monomer viral genome forms were produced, however, when mutants infected W 162 cells, a monkey kidney cell line transformed with and expressing the E 4 genes.

Recombination of the plasmid was monitored by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blot hybridization in cells infected with representatives from each of 32 complementation groups of temperature-sensitive mutants ts 42 and ts 17 did not replicate nor detectably recombine the input plasmid. All except one of the mutants that synthesized normal amounts of viral DNA and protein replicated and recombined the plasmid in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type virus. The remaining mutant, ts 13, only poorly replicated and recombined the input plasmid. Thus, the processes of replication and recombination could not be separated by using this battery of mutants. Viral mutants defective in late protein synthesis were unable to resolve the vaccinia virus <b>concatemer</b> junction in plasmids but carried out intramolecular homologous recombination with plasmids as efficiently as did wild-type virus at the conditionally lethal temperature. This result distinguishes homologous recombination, which requires early gene products, from resolution of <b>concatemer</b> junctions, which requires additional late gene products...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequential}} hybridization of a 534 {{base pair}} DNA <b>concatemer</b> layer was monitored by QCM-D and SPR, and the QCM-D {{data were analyzed}} by Voigt viscoelastic models. The results show that Voigt-based modeling gives a good description of the experimental data but only if shear viscosity and elasticity are allowed {{to depend on the}} shear frequency. The derived layer thickness, shear viscosity and elasticity of the growing film give a representation of the DNA film in agreement with known bulk properties of DNA, and reveal a maximum in film viscosity when the molecules in the layer contain 75 base pairs. The experimental data during construction of a 3084 bp DNA <b>concatemer</b> layer were compared to predictions of the QCM-D response of a 1 mu m thick film of rod-like polymers. A predicted nonmonotonous variation of dissipation with frequency (added mass) is in qualitative agreement with the experiments, but with a quantitative disagreement which likely reflects that the flexibility of such long DNA molecules is not included in the model...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the fate of}} DNA microinjected into nuclei of cultured mammalian cells. The sequence composition and the physical form of the vector carrying the selectable gene affected the efficiency of DNA-mediated transformation. Introduction of sequences near the simian virus 40 origin of DNA replication or in the long terminal repeat of avian sarcoma provirus into a recombinant plasmid containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. (pBR 322 /HSV-tk) enhanced the frequency of transformation of LMtk- and RAT- 2 tk- cells to the TK+ phenotype 20 - to 40 -fold. In cells receiving injections {{of only a few}} plasmid DNA molecules, the transformation frequency was 40 -fold higher after injection of linear molecules than after injection of supercoiled molecules. By controlling the number of gene copies injected into a recipient cell, we could obtain transformants containing a single copy or as many as 50 to 100 copies of the selectable gene. Multiple copies of the transforming gene were not scattered throughout the host genome but were integrated as a <b>concatemer</b> at one or a very few sites in the host chromosome. Independent transformants contained the donated genes in different chromosomes. The orientation of the gene copies within the <b>concatemer</b> was not random; rather, the copies were organized as tandem head-to-tail arrays. By analyzing transformants obtained by coinjecting two vectors which were identical except that in one a portion of the vector was inverted, we were able to conclude that the head-to-tail concatemers were generated predominantly by homologous recombination. Surprisingly, these head-to-tail concatemers were found in transformants obtained by injecting either supercoiled or linear plasmid DNA. Even though we demonstrated that cultured mammalian cells contain the enzymes for ligating two DNA molecules very efficiently irrespective of the sequences or topology at their ends, we found that even linear plasmid DNA was recruited into the <b>concatemer</b> by homologous recombination...|$|E
40|$|In {{a search}} for {{trypanosome}} DNA sequences that permit replication and stable maintenance of extrachromosomal elements, a 1 -kilobase-pair (kbp) fragment from a mitochondrial kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircle of Trypanosoma brucei was isolated and characterized. The plasmid pTbo- 1, carrying the kDNA element, is maintained in T. brucei as a supercoiled <b>concatemer</b> containing approximately seven to nine pTbo- 1 monomer units (5. 6 kbp each) in a head-to-tail orientation. The <b>concatemer</b> is found in approximately one copy per cell when procyclic trypanosomes are cultured {{in the presence of}} 100 micrograms of hygromycin per ml; however, in the absence of continuous hygromycin selection, the plasmid is lost from the population with a t 1 / 2 of approximately 8. 7 days (17 cell generations). A second unrelated kDNA minicircle was also able to serve as an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) element in T. brucei, suggesting that this is a general property of kDNA minicircles. Replication of mitochondrial DNA in the nucleus may be due to either a specific consensus sequence (such as in yeast ARS elements) or nonspecific sequence characteristics (such as the degree of A&T-richness or bent DNA) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{manipulate}} the vaccinia virus (VAC) genome, as a plasmid in bacteria, would greatly facilitate genetic studies and provide a powerful alternative method of making recombinant viruses. VAC, like other poxviruses, has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome with covalently closed hairpin ends that are resolved from transient head-to-head and tail-to-tail concatemers during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Our strategy to construct a nearly 200, 000 -bp VAC-bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) was based on circularization of head-to-tail concatemers of VAC DNA. Cells were infected with a recombinant VAC containing inserted sequences for plasmid replication and maintenance in Escherichia coli; DNA <b>concatemer</b> resolution was inhibited leading to formation and accumulation of head-to-tail concatemers, {{in addition to the}} usual head-to-head and tail-to-tail forms; the concatemers were circularized by homologous or Cre–loxP-mediated recombination; and E. coli were transformed with DNA from the infected cell lysates. Stable plasmids containing the entire VAC genome, with an intact <b>concatemer</b> junction sequence, were identified. Rescue of infectious VAC was consistently achieved by transfecting the VAC–BAC plasmids into mammalian cells that were infected with a helper nonreplicating fowlpox virus...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on <b>concatemer</b> {{formation}} and integration pattern of transgenes in zebrafish embryos. A reporter plasmid based on enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, pCMV-pax 6 in-eGFP, was constructed to reflect transgene behavior in the host environment. After removal of the insertion fragment by double digestion with various combinations of restriction enzymes, linearized pCMV-pax 6 in-eGFP vectors were generated with different combinations of 5 &# 8242;-protruding, 3 &# 8242;-protruding, and blunt ends that were microinjected into zebrafish embryos. Repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) was monitored by GFP expression following religation of the reporter gene. One-hundred-and-ninety-seven DNA fragments were amplified from GFP-positive embryos and sequenced to analyze the repair characteristics of different DSB end combinations. DSBs involving blunt and asymmetric protruding ends were repaired efficiently by direct ligation of blunt ends, ligation after blunting and fill-in, or removed by cutting. Repair of DSBs with symmetric 3 &# 8242;- 3 &# 8242; protrusions was less efficient and utilized template-directed repair. The results suggest that non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) was the principal mechanism of exogenous gene <b>concatemer</b> formation and integration of transgenes into the genome of transgenic zebrafish. </p...|$|E
