5|$|Pizza cheese {{encompasses}} several {{varieties and}} types of <b>cheeses</b> and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed <b>cheeses</b> and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular <b>cheeses</b> used {{in the preparation of}} pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza <b>cheeses</b> manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza <b>cheeses</b> are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone <b>cheeses</b> as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed <b>cheeses</b> prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{types of}} <b>cheeses</b> require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in <b>cheeses</b> such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, small privately owned dairies began to produce {{handmade}} <b>cheeses</b> from goat and sheep’s milk {{as well as}} cow’s milk, resembling traditional <b>cheeses</b> like those made in rural France, Spain and Italy. Many are made with organic milk. These are now also produced by kibbutzim and the national Tnuva dairy.|$|E
5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly <b>cheeses,</b> of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern <b>cheeses</b> like Cheddar, Northern <b>cheeses</b> typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Cheddar <b>cheese</b> is most {{commonly}} used for <b>cheese</b> on toast, as this is a particularly good <b>cheese</b> for toasting. Lancashire dairies, {{in conjunction with a}} [...] "National <b>Cheese</b> on Toast Day", have promoted Lancashire <b>cheese</b> as the best <b>cheese</b> to use. In Scotland similar dishes are often referred to as roasted <b>cheese</b> or 'melted cheese', where the bread need not be toasted before applying the <b>cheese.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Pike Place Market store now sells roughly thirty-five {{other local}} artisan cheese brands, in {{addition}} to the various Beecher's products. The Pike Place Market location also offers classes to the public about cheese making, cheese history, and the pairing of wine with cheese. The collection of Pacific Northwest <b>cheeses</b> on sale at the retail store has been described as the best in the entire region by Will O'Donnell in Northwest Magazine. In keeping with Dammeier's idea that his cheese business should encourage the growth of the artisan cheese businesses in the area, the Beecher's retail store makes special efforts to feature and sell <b>cheeses</b> from new and small Northwest cheesemakers. The Flatiron location incorporates the Northwest influence its cheesecase, but carries a significant number of Northeast artisanal <b>cheeses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza <b>cheeses</b> are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza <b>cheeses</b> include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E

5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey <b>cheeses,</b> like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder <b>cheeses.</b> Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E

5|$|Several <b>cheeses</b> may {{be mixed}} {{together}} in its formulation, {{and each has}} individual browning and blistering characteristics. For example, a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{were also}} early adopters of {{roasting}} cheese. An early incarnation of Welsh rarebit {{was being made}} in medieval times, and {{by the middle of}} the 15th century Rarebit was considered a national dish. The acid soil of Wales meant that the milk produced by their cattle created a soft cheese, which was not as good for roasting, so Welsh people would trade for harder <b>cheeses</b> such as Cheddar.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of <b>cheeses,</b> such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue <b>cheeses</b> will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
