The process of granting credit is one of the central functions of a credit union; therefore, the use of instruments that support that process is desirable and may become a key factor in credit management. The steps undertaken by the present case study to perform the knowledge discovery process were data selection, data pre-processing and cleanup, data transformation, data mining, and the interpretation and evaluation of results. The results were evaluated through cross-validation of ten sets, repeated in ten simulations.

50|$|Some {{proponents of}} {{consensus}} decision-making view procedures that use majority rule as undesirable for several reasons. Majority voting {{is regarded as}} competitive, rather than <b>cooperative,</b> framing <b>decision-making</b> in a win/lose dichotomy that ignores the possibility of compromise or other mutually beneficial solutions. Carlos Santiago Nino, on the other hand, has argued that majority rule leads to better deliberation practice than the alternatives, because it requires {{each member of the}} group to make arguments that appeal to at least half the participants. A. Lijphart reaches the same conclusion about majority rule, noting that majority rule encourages coalition-building. Additionally, opponents of majority rule claim that it can lead to a 'tyranny of the majority', a scenario in which a majority places its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression. Some voting theorists, however, argue that majority rule may actually prevent tyranny of the majority, in part because it maximizes the potential for a minority to form a coalition that can overturn an unsatisfactory decision.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision-making</b> in {{one-shot}} interactions is a history-dependent dynamic process: promoting intuition versus deliberation has typically {{a positive effect on}} cooperation (dynamism) among people living in a cooperative setting and with no previous experience in economic games on cooperation (history-dependence).

We find two major results: (i) promoting intuition versus deliberation has no effect on cooperative behavior among inexperienced subjects living in a non-cooperative setting; (ii) experienced subjects cooperate more than inexperienced subjects, but only under time pressure. These results suggest that cooperation is a learning process, rather than an instinctive impulse or a self-controlled choice, and that experience operates primarily via the channel of intuition.

40|$|Consensus {{is a form}} of <b>cooperative,</b> non-coercive <b>decision-making.</b> Though {{simple to}} describe, this process usually {{requires}} great understanding and a fair bit of experience to practice well. Briefly, a group of people gathers together, raises an issue, discusses it, poses various solutions, and then chooses the decision that best satisfies the group. Individual preferences and concerns are considered, but the decision is for the group and so must satisfy the group as best it can — not any individual. If there is too much disagreement and uncertainty as to the best decision, the decision can be left for each person to make and act on individually or the decision can be deferred to a later time. Usually though, in a group that wants to work together, some satisfactory decision can be devised at the first meeting. When this does not happen, the meeting process is often deficient. Then the process must be changed so the group can re-establish the cooperative atmosphere necessary for productive behavior. Below is an outline of useful facts, ideas, and notes about the history, theory, and practice of cooperative decisionmaking and techniques {{to get back on track}} when things have gone awry.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ways in which the {{distribution}} of power and well-being within couple households is gendered in the sense of having gendered determinants, from inside the household, rather than just gendered outcomes. We model such households, as Sen (1990) suggests, as sites of <b>cooperative</b> conflict, where <b>decision-making</b> has a component reflecting shared views and a component representing a bargain over conflicting views. Using household panel data from the British Household Panel Survey (1996 - 2003), in which individual answers can be matched across couples, the method takes answers to a question about financial satisfaction to be indicators of (i) the level of current and potential resources of the household, and (ii) intra-household bargaining over the entitlement each individual has to these resources. Individual financial satisfaction can then be decomposed into two elements; the first, the average of a couple's satisfaction scores, represents their shared view; the second is the difference between their answers. Stripping out the effects of unobserved heterogeneity through the use of fixed effects panel methods and carefully chosen controls, the effect of explanatory factors on this difference can then be identified as the result of a perceived difference in entitlements to household income that is the result of unequal power between male and female partners. Our results suggest the co-existence of shared and conflicting views, with a significant gendered pattern. Some policy implications are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Köpet av en bostadsrätt är för de flesta människor den största investering i deras liv. Som bostadsrättsinnehavare förvaltas huset och fastigheten av en bostadsrättsförening. För att finansiera driften och underhållet tar föreningen ut en avgift från bostadsrättsinnehavaren, en månadsavgift. Månadsavgiften, tillsammans med eventuella räntekostnader som uppstår om finansiering skett genom lån, utgör den sammanlagda boendekostnaden för bostadsrättsinnehavaren. Därför bör det vara av stor vikt att köparen försäkrar sig om att föreningen har god ekonomi och har skötts på ett bra sätt, för att undvika stora och oväntade höjningar av månadsavgiften vilket medför ökade boendekostnader. Den här uppsatsen syftar till att undersöka i vilken omfattning aktörer på bostadsmarknaden använder årsredovisningen som beslutsunderlag vid köpet av bostadsrätt samt att ge förslag på hur man kan göra årsredovisningen mer lättläst och förståelig. Data insamlades genom fastighetsekonomisk facklitteratur, myndigheter och organisationer som är verksamma inom området. Frågeställningarna ovan besvarades genom empiriska undersökningar i form av enkäter och intervjuer samt en jämförelsestudie av tre stycken bostadsrättsföreningar i Stockholms innerstad. Resultaten från enkäterna indikerade på att endast de med ekonomisk utbildning använde sig av och kunde tolka årsredovisningarna inför köpet av sin bostadsrätt. I de mer diskuterande intervjuerna framgick att även de med ekonomisk utbildning saknade kunskaperna som krävdes för att analysera föreningarnas årsredovisning på djupet, även om de hade större förståelse än de utan ekonomisk utbildning. Jämförelsestudien illustrerade hur nyckeltal kan användas för att analysera en bostadsrättsförenings ekonomiska status. Slutsatsen är att aktörer på bostadsrättsmarknaden utan ekonomisk utbildning inte använder sig av årsredovisningen som beslutsunderlag vid köp av bostadsrätter. De med ekonomisk utbildning använder sig av föreningens årsredovisning men saknar förmågan att analysera föreningens ekonomi på djupet. Uppsatsen föreslår att de behandlade nyckeltalen med tillhörande förklarande text bör presenteras i varje årsredovisning, förslagsvis under förvaltningsberättelsen. Det skulle medföra att samtliga aktörer på bostadsrättsmarknaden kan analysera föreningens ekonomi på djupet och försäkra sig om att göra ett välgrundat köp.

40|$|Comprising of a {{potentially}} large team of autonomous cooperative robots locally interacting and communicating with each other, robot swarms provide a natural diversity of parallel and distributed functionalities, high flexibility, potential for redundancy, and fault-tolerance. The use of autonomous mobile robots {{is expected to}} increase in the future and swarm robotic systems are envisioned to play important roles in tasks such as: search and rescue (SAR) missions, transportation of objects, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. To robustly deploy robot swarms on the field with humans, this research addresses the fundamental problems in the relatively new field of human-swarm interaction (HSI). Four groups of core classes of problems have been addressed for proximal interaction between humans and robot swarms: interaction and communication; swarm-level sensing and classification; swarm coordination; swarm-level learning. The primary contribution of this research aims to develop a bidirectional human-swarm communication system for non-verbal interaction between humans and heterogeneous robot swarms. The guiding field of application are SAR missions. The core challenges and issues in HSI include: How can human operators interact and communicate with robot swarms? Which interaction modalities can be used by humans? How can human operators instruct and command robots from a swarm? Which mechanisms can be used by robot swarms to convey feedback to human operators? Which type of feedback can swarms convey to humans? In this research, to start answering these questions, hand gestures have been chosen as the interaction modality for humans, since gestures are simple to use, easily recognized, and possess spatial-addressing properties. To facilitate bidirectional interaction and communication, a dialogue-based interaction system is introduced which consists of: (i) a grammar-based gesture language with a vocabulary of non-verbal commands that allows humans to efficiently provide mission instructions to swarms, and (ii) a swarm coordinated multi-modal feedback language that enables robot swarms to robustly convey swarm-level decisions, status, and intentions to humans using multiple individual and group modalities. The gesture language allows humans to: select and address single and multiple robots from a swarm, provide commands to perform tasks, specify spatial directions and application-specific parameters, and build iconic grammar-based sentences by combining individual gesture commands. Swarms convey different types of multi-modal feedback to humans using on-board lights, sounds, and locally coordinated robot movements. The swarm-to-human feedback: conveys to humans the swarm's understanding of the recognized commands, allows swarms to assess their decisions (i. e., to correct mistakes: made by humans in providing instructions, and errors made by swarms in recognizing commands), and guides humans through the interaction process. The second contribution of this research addresses swarm-level sensing and classification: How can robot swarms collectively sense and recognize hand gestures given as visual signals by humans? Distributed sensing, <b>cooperative</b> recognition, and <b>decision-making</b> mechanisms have been developed to allow robot swarms to collectively recognize visual instructions and commands given by humans in the form of gestures. These mechanisms rely on decentralized data fusion strategies and multi-hop messaging passing algorithms to robustly build swarm-level consensus decisions. Measures have been introduced in the cooperative recognition protocol which provide a trade-off between the accuracy of swarm-level consensus decisions and the time taken to build swarm decisions. The third contribution of this research addresses swarm-level cooperation: How can humans select spatially distributed robots from a swarm and the robots understand that they have been selected? How can robot swarms be spatially deployed for proximal interaction with humans? With the introduction of spatially-addressed instructions (pointing gestures) humans can robustly address and select spatially- situated individuals and groups of robots from a swarm. A cascaded classification scheme is adopted in which, first the robot swarm identifies the selection command (e. g., individual or group selection), and then the robots coordinate with each other to identify if they have been selected. To obtain better views of gestures issued by humans, distributed mobility strategies have been introduced for the coordinated deployment of heterogeneous robot swarms (i. e., ground and flying robots) and to reshape the spatial distribution of swarms. The fourth contribution of this research addresses the notion of collective learning in robot swarms. The questions that are answered include: How can robot swarms learn about the hand gestures given by human operators? How can humans be included in the loop of swarm learning? How can robot swarms cooperatively learn as a team? Online incremental learning algorithms have been developed which allow robot swarms to learn individual gestures and grammar-based gesture sentences supervised by human instructors in real-time. Humans provide different types of feedback (i. e., full or partial feedback) to swarms for improving swarm-level learning. To speed up the learning rate of robot swarms, cooperative learning strategies have been introduced which enable individual robots in a swarm to intelligently select locally sensed information and share (exchange) selected information with other robots in the swarm. The final contribution is a systemic one, it aims on building a complete HSI system towards potential use in real-world applications, by integrating the algorithms, techniques, mechanisms, and strategies discussed in the contributions above. The effectiveness of the global HSI system is demonstrated {{in the context of a}} number of interactive scenarios using emulation tests (i. e., performing simulations using gesture images acquired by a heterogeneous robotic swarm) and by performing experiments with real robots using both ground and flying robots...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Some {{professional}} e-mails contain {{knowledge about}} how actor face problem {{in order to}} realize projects. This type of knowledge is produced in cooperative activity. Representing project knowledge leads to structure link between coordination, <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision-making</b> and communication. The main objective of our work is to extract knowledge from daily work. So the main questions of our research are: • Can we extract knowledge from professional e-mails? • If so, which type of knowledge can be represented? • How to link this knowledge to project memory? We present in this paper our first work in this aim. Our hypothesis is tested on a software development application...|$|E

Recent {{years we}} can {{hear a lot about}} <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision-making,</b> group or {{collaborative}} decision-making. These types of decisions are the consequences of developed working conditions: geographical dispersion, team working, and concurrent working. In the paper we present two research works concerning two different collective decision situations: face-to-face decision-making and synchronous distributed decision-making. These two research studies adopt different approaches in order to support decision-making process, in view to different research objectives. Nevertheless, the conclusions show complementary aspect of these two studies...|$|E
