CITES listed the endangered species, for which trade control is required, to its list. Included in the list is majority of Madagascar-based succulents plants. This thesis reviews trade with the Madagascar-based succulent plants protected by CITES between the Czech Republic and other countries. The trade was reviewed based on data from CITES Trade Database administered by UNEP WCMC for periods between 1992 and 2012. The most frequent reason of the trade with the selected group of plants was commercial interests. The main <b>country</b> <b>of</b> import and <b>re-export</b> was Madagascar with dominant share of specimens originating from wild nature. Almost all specimens were live plants from Appendix II. The share of represented genus in import, re-export and export was very similar. The development trends were not demonstrable from the statistical point of view...|$|R

40|$|China's {{trade has}} three features: high {{incidence}} <b>of</b> <b>re-exports</b> through Hong Kong, {{high degree of}} trade related to foreign investment, and large amount <b>of</b> `illegal' trade. <b>Re-exports</b> occur when imports to Hong Kong are consigned to a buyer in Hong Kong, who adds a markup, and exports the goods elsewhere without fundamentally changing the goods. Using U. S. data and accounting for re-exports, the U. S. -China trade balance has to be lowered by 35 percent. Foreign investments in China accounted for 45 percent of China's exports. Foreign investments include foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign subcontracting. `Illegal' trade between China and Taiwan has been induced by Taiwan's `no direct trade' policy. Illegal trade such as smuggling and tariff evasion also affect China's trade with her other trading partners. ...|$|R

It analyses the relationship between the exchange rate regime and the performance of exports in Benin, a member <b>country</b> <b>of</b> the CFA Franc Zone for the 1980 - 2003 period. The study focuses, in particular, on the impact of the exchange rate policy differential on trade between Benin and Nigeria by incorporating informal trade data. Consequently, four indicators of the real effective exchange rate were designed: on the one hand, an indicator of the internal real exchange rate to measure the evolution of consumer prices with respect to the wholesale price index for the United States; on the other hand, three indicators of the real effective exchange rate were developed: a real effective exchange rate index for exports, a real effective exchange rate index for imports and a real effective exchange rate for trade. These indicators allow us to explore the ways and means of diversifying and making export activities profitable in Benin, given that its export base is relatively poorly diversified, and to raise the question of the future <b>of</b> <b>re-export</b> trade towards Nigeria. This study underscores the difficulty of obtaining a comprehensive and detailed real exchange rate index...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} agricultural trade <b>of</b> the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> the Visegrad Group with emphasis on development {{of the value of}} agricultural exports <b>of</b> the individual <b>countries.</b> The subject matter of the analysis is the sensitivity of the commodity structure of agricultural exports <b>of</b> individual <b>countries</b> and the identification of aggregations that are the least and the most sensitive to changes to the external and internal economic environment. From the conducted research, agricultural trade in the V 4 countries was found to have developed very dynamically from 1993 to 2008, while the commodity structure of exports has constantly narrowed as the degree of specialization <b>of</b> the individual <b>countries</b> has increased (this applies especially to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary). From the results of analysis of sensitivity to changes of selected variables relating {{to the development of the}} value of agricultural exports of the individual V 4 countries, it appears that the aggregations that react most sensitively to changes are those that are the subject <b>of</b> <b>re-exports,</b> followed by the aggregations that are characterized by a high degree of added value. In general it can be said that products of agricultural primary production exhibit less sensitivity in comparison with grocery industry products.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{representing}} transshipment or re-exports {{are almost}} always excluded from analytical portrayals of international trade, yet transshipment is potentially an important phenomenon in understanding a number of economic questions, and is increasing in importance. Rapid technological change {{in areas such as}} containerization and hub-and-spoke routing has promoted the practice of transshipment. While there are significant gaps in the data, the share <b>of</b> <b>re-exports</b> in global exports has undoubtedly increased rapidly, from perhaps 1 in 20 in the mid- 1980 s to perhaps 1 in 6 today. Econometric analysis of U. S. domestic exports and foreign exports (<b>re-exports)</b> over pairs <b>of</b> U. S. ports and destinations suggests that re-exports are significantly more sensitive than domestic exports to factors influencing transaction costs, including distance, containerization, price-fixing liner agreements, and port efficiency and restrictive port policies in the importing country...|$|R

Traders in Hong Kong supply information on markets and producers in China, which provides welfare gains to foreign firms using these services. During the 1990 s, Hong Kong intermediated about one-half of the goods that China exported {{to the rest of}} the world. Using constant elasticity demand curves, we find that the gains to intermediary services provided by Hong Kong are roughly equal to the value of these Hong Kong re-exports, and four to five times larger than the markups earned in Hong Kong. Using a linear approximation to the demand curves instead, we find that the gains are one-quarter as much as the value <b>of</b> <b>re-exports,</b> or slightly larger than the markups. ...|$|R

Not consolidating the national tables leads to a further under-estimation of 11 - 16 %. Both types of errors are substantial. With these underestimations removed, the exports to third countries still only explain around 11 % of the EU 27 GDP. ...|$|R
