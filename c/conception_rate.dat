5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the <b>conception</b> <b>rate</b> is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{high rates}} of very early {{miscarriage}} (25% of pregnancies are lost within the first six weeks since the woman's last menstrual period, or LMP), the methods used to detect pregnancy may lead to bias in conception rates.

A Chinese study of couples practicing random intercourse to achieve pregnancy used very sensitive pregnancy tests to detect pregnancy. It found a 40% <b>conception</b> <b>rate</b> per cycle over the 12-month study period.|$|E
40|$|Environmental heat {{can reduce}} <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> (the {{proportion}} {{of services that}} result in pregnancy) in lactating dairy cows. The study objectives were to identify periods of exposure relative to the service date in which environmental heat is most closely associated with <b>conception</b> <b>rates,</b> and to assess whether the total time cows are exposed to high environmental heat within each 24 -h period is more closely associated with <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> than is the maximum environmental heat for each 24 -h period. A retrospective observational {{study was conducted in}} 25 predominantly Holstein-Friesian commercial dairy herds located in Australia. Associations between weather and <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> were assessed using 16, 878 services performed over a 21 -mo period. Services were classified as successful based on rectal palpation. Two measures of heat load were defined for each 24 -h period: the maximum temperature-humidity index (THI) for the period, and the number of hours in the 24 -h period when the THI was > 72. <b>Conception</b> <b>rates</b> were reduced when cows were exposed to a high heat load from the day of service to 6 d after service, and in wk - 1. Heat loads in wk - 3 to - 5 were also associated with reduced <b>conception</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, management interventions to ameliorate the effects of heat load on <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> should be implemented at least 5 wk before anticipated service and should continue until at least 1 wk after service. High autocorrelations existed between successive daily values in both measures, and associations between day of heat load relative to service day and <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> differed substantially when ridge regression was used to account for this autocorrelation. This indicates that when assessing the effects of heat load on <b>conception</b> <b>rates,</b> the autocorrelation in heat load between days should be accounted for in analyses. The results suggest that either weekly averages or totals summarizing the daily heat load are adequate to describe heat load when assessing effects on <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> in lactating dairy cows...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present research were to study {{the factors that influence}} postpartum reproductive characteristics of suckling beef cows in extensive production systems in Mozambique and to develop new management strategies to improve their reproductive efficiency. The effects and interactions between post-partum BW, BCS, age and parity number on plasma concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, creatinine, urea and cortisol around oestrus and the related <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> of Bos indicus cows in extensive production system were analysed as well as the minimum BCS at the beginning of breeding to maximise the subsequent <b>conception</b> <b>rates.</b> Thirty-five days prior to the breeding season cows were synchronised using Crestar. During the second oestrus after synchronisation, 18 blood samples were collected per animal for hormonal analysis, from 24 hr before oestrus to 24 hr after oestrus. The hormonal pattern of estradiol and progesterone around oestrus were similar to that observed in Bos taurus cows under intensive conditions. <b>Conception</b> <b>rates</b> of cows in the experimental group were 90. 5 %. Better results on estradiol pattern and <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> were related to a BCS of ≥ 2. 5 and it was thus concluded that the post-partum management of extensive Bos inducus cows should aim to achieve at least a BCS of 2. 5 {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. Twelve-hour and 48 -hr calf removal were conducted separately to evaluate their effects on <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> of Bos indicus beef cows in extensive production systems and to quantify the related effects on calf-weaning weights. The 12 -hr calf removal was performed from 45 days post-partum to the beginning of the breeding season, and the 48 -hr calf removal was performed preceding the onset of the breeding season. It was concluded that 12 -hr calf separation at night enhance the energy balance (3 %), increases the <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> (80 %) and improves the calf-weaning weights, whereas 48 -hr calf removal increases <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> (76 %) and does not affect calf weaning weights. Both calf removal management strategies concentrate conceptions in the early part of the breeding season and stress the importance of the effect of BCS and estradiol on <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> in Bos indicus beef cows in extensive production systems.

40|$|In year-round calving herds, {{reproductive}} performance {{has traditionally been}} described in relation to each cow 2 ̆ 7 s calving date. This research described {{reproductive performance}} in year-round and seasonal calving dairy herds using herd-level measures based on interval from each cow 2 ̆ 7 s initiation of breeding program date, and assessed interrelationships between such measures. A large, prospective, single cohort study, implemented in 1997 and 1998, included 29, 327 cows from 167 Australian dairy herds. Herd reproductive performance was described using 2 measures of primary importance to herd managers: the proportion of cows that became pregnant by 6. wk after their initiation of breeding program date (6 -wk pregnancy rate) {{and the proportion of}} cows that were nonpregnant 21. wk after their initiation of breeding program date (21 -wk nonpregnancy rate). Measures that contribute to these primary measures (secondary measures) were calculated for each herd for both the first and second 3 -wk periods of each cow 2 ̆ 7 s breeding program; submission rates were calculated as proportions of cows that were inseminated at least once in the 3 -wk period, and <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated as the proportions of inseminations in the 3 -wk period that resulted in pregnancy. The individual herd was the unit of analysis. The study results indicate that high submission rates are essential if herd reproductive performance is to be achieved. Six-week pregnancy rate was predicted to increase by 6 to 8 percentage points following a 10 -percentage-point increase in submission rates in both 3 -wk periods, and by 6 to 10 percentage points following a 10 -percentage-point increase in <b>conception</b> <b>rates.</b> Submission rates were more variable than <b>conception</b> <b>rates,</b> indicating that managers may be able to achieve large increases in submission rates more easily than substantial increases in <b>conception</b> <b>rates.</b> However, the predicted benefits of increasing submission rates were greatest when <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> were high and vice versa, highlighting the need to improve both submission and <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> when both are low.

Those detected in estrus were inseminated, whereas the rest received a timed AI (TAI) between 65 and 74 hours after PGF 2 ". Few females (5. 1 %) were inseminated between open diagnosis and day 8. On day 10, more ECPthan GnRH-treated females were inseminated after detected estrus (24 vs. 6 %). Overall, more Ovsynch than Heatsynch females received a TAI (82 vs. 62 %). <b>Conception</b> <b>rates</b> tended to be greater for females inseminated after estrus (37 %) than after TAI (29 %), and the tendency was more pronounced for those treated with Heatsynch (41 vs. 27 %) than for those treated with Ovsynch (33 vs. 31 %). <b>Conception</b> <b>rates</b> for females having elevated progesterone 7 days after the not-pregnant diagnosis were greater than <b>conception</b> <b>rates</b> of those having low progesterone in Heatsynch (42 %; n = 133 vs. 25 %; n = 55) and Ovsynch protocols (33 %; n = 142 vs. 15 %; n = 45). <b>Conception</b> <b>rates</b> were greater in heifers than in lactating cows (43 vs. 28 %), regardless of protocol employed. Although overall pregnancy outcomes were similar in response to either the Ovsynch or Heatsynch protocol, inseminations performed after detected estrus before the scheduled TAI reduced days to eventual conception and tended to increase <b>conception</b> <b>rates,</b> particularly after Heatsynch...|$|R
