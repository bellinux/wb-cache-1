5000|$|Pilea nummulariifolia is a {{perennial}} evergreen herbaceous plant {{commonly known as}} <b>creeping</b> <b>charlie</b> native to the Caribbean (including Florida) and northern South America. [...] It can be grown indoors, for example in a hanging pot.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} for {{broadleaf}} weeds, particularly <b>Creeping</b> <b>Charlie</b> (Glechoma hederacea). It is sold under the trade names Turflon, Weed-B-Gon (purple label), and Brush-B-Gon ("Poison Ivy Killer") for these purposes. It is a major ingredient in Confront, which was withdrawn from most uses due to concerns about compost contamination from the other major ingredient, clopyralid.|$|E
50|$|Glechoma hederacea (syn. Nepeta glechoma Benth., Nepeta hederacea (L.) Trevir.) is an aromatic, perennial, {{evergreen}} creeper of {{the mint}} family Lamiaceae. It is {{commonly known as}} ground-ivy, gill-over-the-ground, <b>creeping</b> <b>charlie,</b> alehoof, tunhoof, catsfoot, field balm, and run-away-robin. It is also sometimes known as creeping jenny, but that name more commonly refers to Lysimachia nummularia. It has numerous medicinal uses, and is used as a salad green in many countries. European settlers carried it around the world, and it has become a well-established introduced and naturalized plant {{in a wide variety of}} localities.|$|E
40|$|Ground-ivy or <b>{{creeping}}</b> <b>Charlie</b> (Glechoma hederacea) is a creeping perennial in the Mint Family {{that forms}} dense prostrate patches in turfgrass, damp shady meadows, and disturbed sites.

Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and evaluate alternative approaches for the control of ground ivy in turfgrass that are effective and environmentally sound...|$|E
40|$|Field bindweed, {{also known}} as small-flowered morning glory, European morning glory, <b>Creeping</b> <b>Charlie,</b> Russian Creeper, and Creeping Jennie, is {{becoming}} each year a greater menace to farm lands. The infestation of cultivated fields with this pest lowers the yield of crops an average of 30 percent, increases the labor costs, and reduces land and loan values. It is therefore important that land-owners learn to identify bindweed and guard against its introduction on their farms. Where it has become established, steps should be taken at once for its eradication. This 1935 extension circular discusses identifying field bindweed, prevalence and spread of field bindweed, eradication, clean tillage, chemical treatments used to destroy bindweed, and other treatments...|$|E

The control of ground ivy using chemical and mechanical methods {{has largely been}} unsuccessful in turfgrass where it is considered a major weed. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate alternative approaches for the control of ground ivy in turfgrass that are effective and environmentally sound. Several rust fungi {{have been reported to}} infect ground ivy in its native Eurasian range. In 1998, one of these rusts, Puccinia glechomatis, was found in North America including on ground ivy plants growing in Syracuse, NY. Research to date has demonstrated that this rust fungus infects only plant species within the genus Glechoma. The goal {{of this study was to}} (1) determine the distribution of the Puccinia glechomatis rust on turfgrass ground ivy populations in the Ithaca, NY area and surrounding counties, (2) assess the potential of the rust to effectively suppress ground ivy in turfgrass, and (3) determine whether the rust infects non-host plant species in turfgrass...|$|E
