40|$|The Mach Effect Thruster (MET) is {{a device}} which {{utilizes}} {{fluctuations in the}} rest masses of accelerating objects (capacitor stacks, in which internal energy changes take place) to produce a steady linear thrust. The theory has been given in detail elsewhere [1, 2] and references therein, so here we discuss only an experiment. We show how to obtain thrust using a heavy reaction mass {{at one end of}} our <b>capacitor</b> <b>stack</b> and a lighter end cap on the other. Then we show how this thrust can be eliminated by having two heavy masses {{at either end of the}} stack with a central mounting bracket. We show the same <b>capacitor</b> <b>stack</b> being used as a thruster and then eliminate the thrust by arranging equal brass masses on either end, so that essentially the <b>capacitor</b> <b>stack</b> is trying to push in both directions at once. This arrangement in theory would only allow for a small oscillation but no net thrust. We find the thrust does indeed disappear in the experiment, as predicted. The device (in thruster mode) could in principle be used for propulsion [1, 2]. Experimental apparatus based on a very sensitive thrust balance is briefly described.

While the deposition of ultrathin layers below crystallization temperature inhibits the full layer crystallization, local epitaxial growth of CaTiO 3 crystals on top of specific oriented Pt crystals occurs. The result is a formation of crystals embedded in an amorphous matrix. An epitaxial alignment of the cubic CaTiO 3 direction {{on top of the}} underlying Pt { 111 } surface has been observed.

40|$|During DRAM {{capacitor}} scaling a lot {{of effort}} was spent searching for new material stacks to overcome the scaling limitations of the current material stack, such as leakage and sufficient capacitance. In this study, very promising results for a SrTiO 3 based capacitor with a record low capacitance equivalent thickness value of 0. 2 nm at target leakage current are presented. Due to the material properties of SrTiO 3 films (high vacancy concentration and low band gap), which are leading to an increased leakage current, a physical thickness of at least 8 nm is required at target leakage specifications. However, this physical thickness would not fit into an 18 nm DRAM structure.

These capacitors exhibited significant leakage (in the range 8 â 210 Î¼A/cm 2) and dielectric loss. Measured breakdown strength for the sputtered doped barium titanate films was in the range 200 kV/cm â 2 MV/cm.

50|$|The <b>capacitor</b> in the <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{scheme is}} {{constructed}} {{above the surface}} of the substrate. The capacitor is constructed from an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric sandwiched in between two layers of polysilicon plates (the top plate is shared by all DRAM cells in an IC), and its shape can be a rectangle, a cylinder, or some other more complex shape. There are two basic variations of the <b>stacked</b> <b>capacitor,</b> based on its location relative to the bitline - capacitor-over-bitline (COB) and capacitor-under-bitline (CUB). In a former variation, the capacitor is underneath the bitline, which is usually made of metal, and the bitline has a polysilicon contact that extends downwards to connect it to the access transistor's source terminal. In the latter variation, the capacitor is constructed above the bitline, which is almost always made of polysilicon, but is otherwise identical to the COB variation. The advantage the COB variant possesses is the ease of fabricating the contact between the bitline and the access transistor's source as it is physically close to the substrate surface. However, this requires the active area to be laid out at a 45-degree angle when viewed from above, which makes it difficult to ensure that the capacitor contact does not touch the bitline. CUB cells avoid this, but suffer from difficulties in inserting contacts in between bitlines, since the size of features this close to the surface are at or near the minimum feature size of the process technology (Kenner, pp. 33-42).|$|R

The high unit cell capacitance and low repeating element thickness will allow for the fabrication of a low-volume, low-weight device, favorable characteristics for space applications. These same characteristics also make the capacitor attractive for terrestrial applications, such as load-leveling batteries or fuel cells in electric vehicle applications. Although the projected energy densities for electrochemical capacitors are about two orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} batteries, the high-power-density characteristics of these devices render them as potentially viable candidates for meeting pulse or peak electrical power requirements for some anticipated aerospace mission scenarios, especially those with discharge times on the millisecond to second time scale.

Capacitors created with the first generated SDM dielectrics (alumina with boric acid solution), herein called New Paradigm Super (NPS) capacitors display typical electrostatic capacitive behavior, such as increasing capacitance with decreasing thickness, and can be cycled, but are limited to a maximum effective operating voltage of about 0. 8 V. A simple theory is presented: Water containing relatively high concentrations of dissolved ions saturates all, or virtually all, the pores (average diameter 500 Ã) of the alumina. In an applied field the positive ionic species migrate to the cathode end, and the negative ions to the anode end of each drop. This creates giant dipoles with high charge, hence leading to high dielectric constant behavior. At about 0. 8 V, water begins to break down, creating enough ionic species to âshortâ the individual water droplets. Potentially NPS <b>capacitor</b> <b>stacks</b> can surpass âsupercapacitorsâ in volumetric energy density.

30|$|Improvement in the time-zero {{dielectric}} breakdown (TZDB) endurance of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) <b>capacitor</b> with <b>stacking</b> structure of Al/HfO 2 /SiO 2 /Si is demonstrated in this work. The misalignment of the conduction paths between two stacking layers {{is believed to}} be effective to increase the breakdown field of the devices. Meanwhile, the resistance of the dielectric after breakdown for device with stacking structure would be less than that of without stacking structure due to a higher breakdown field and larger breakdown power. In addition, the role of interfacial layer (IL) in the control of the interface trap density (Dit) and device reliability is also analyzed. Device with a thicker IL introduces a higher breakdown field and also a lower Dit. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of the samples with different IL thicknesses is provided to confirm that IL is needed for good interfacial property.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In the {{realisation}} of discrete-component analogue {{electronic circuits}} {{it is common}} practice, because of costs, to specify passive component values from a set preferred of values. For the design of Integrated Circuits {{it can also be}} desirable to use a standard set of passive component values. For example, to obtain accurate ratio matching of integrated resistors and <b>capacitors</b> by <b>stacking</b> identical unit valued components [1]. The usual design approaches produce circuits in which the permitted component values are assumed to be unrestricted. The circuit is then converted to a practical circuit by simple rounding of the exact component values to the nearest value in the permitted set. Of course, in general the circuit performance realised will differ from the ideal. It may then be necessary to repeat the design with a more stringent specification or to use a more closely spaced set of permitted values, both of which can have cost implications. However if other combin...|$|R
40|$|Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) <b>capacitor</b> with HfTiONHfSiON <b>stack</b> {{structure}} as high- k gate dielectric is fabricated, and its electrical properties are {{compared with those}} of a similar device with HfTiON only as gate dielectric. Experimental results show that the device with HfTiONHfSiON gate dielectric exhibits better interface properties, lower gate leakage current, and enhanced high-field reliability. All these improvements should be attributed {{to the fact that the}} HfSiON buffer layer effectively blocks the diffusion of Ti atoms to the Si substrate, thus resulting in a Si O 2 Si -like HfSiONSi interface.

Results {{show that the}} sample pretreated in NO ambient has excellent interface properties, low gate leakage current density and high reliability. This is attributed {{to the formation of}} a SiON interlayer with suitable proportion of N and O, and N-barrier role of isolating Ti in HfTiO from Si of the substrate, thus effectively preventing the inter-diffusions of Ti and Si during post-deposition annealing.
