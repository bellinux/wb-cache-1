25|$|The {{traditional}} problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, {{natural language}} processing, perception {{and the ability}} to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals. Approaches include statistical methods, <b>computational</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, neural networks and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, artificial psychology and many others.|$|E

500|$|Many {{researchers}} in AI in 1990s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, knowledge-based systems, cognitive systems or <b>computational</b> <b>intelligence.</b> In part, {{this may be}} because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, but also the new names help to procure funding. In the commercial world at least, the failed promises of the AI Winter continued to haunt AI research into the 2000s, as the New York Times reported in 2005: [...] "Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers." ...|$|E

Other soft computing approaches to AI include fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of <b>computational</b> <b>intelligence.</b>|$|E

Swarm robotics is a relatively new and rapidly developing fiel which draws inspiration from swarm intelligence. It is an interesting alternative to classical approaches to robotics because of some properties of problem solving present in social insects, which is fl xible, robust, decentralized and self-organized.

2500|$|The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of {{what people}} know is not {{represented}} as [...] "facts" [...] or [...] "statements" [...] that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it [...] "feels too exposed" [...] or an art critic can take one look at a statue and {{realize that it is}} a fake. These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain. Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI, <b>computational</b> <b>intelligence,</b> or statistical AI will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.|$|E
