50|$|It was March 1912, and a {{man named}} John Lane had {{purchased}} a bankrupt box plant in Altavista for $500.

Since the Lanes didn't know how successful their new venture was going to be, they didn't want to put their name on it, so they incorporated the little company as the Standard Red Cedar Chest Company, with John Lane as President and Ed Lane as Vice President and General Manager.

50|$|Probber {{referred}} to the concept as a modular system, and the individual pieces as modules. Although what was then called “unit furniture” dates to {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century, Probber’s modular seating was the first of its kind. Taking the concept further, he introduced “nuclear furniture”—which included occasional tables with interchangeable pedestals, in different shapes and sizes that could, like seating, be clustered in varying configurations. In the 1960s, he extended the idea to <b>case</b> <b>goods,</b> making it possible to offer many variations on one basic design… the same case was available in a choice of finishes, legs, bases, heights, and hardware. Differences that were cosmetic rather than conceptual were economical to produce—evidence that Probber’s business acumen matched his design ability.|$|E

50|$|Dr Grant {{was held}} to have relied upon the skill and {{judgment}} of the retailer that the garments were fit for wearing, with the Privy Council saying: It {{is clear that the}} reliance must be brought home to the mind of the seller, expressly or by implication. The reliance will seldom be express: it will usually arise by implication from the circumstances: thus to take a case like that in question, of a purchase from a retailer, the reliance will be in general inferred from the fact that a buyer goes to the shop in the confidence that the tradesman has selected his stock with skill and judgment: the retailer need know nothing about the process of manufacture: it is immaterial whether he be manufacturer or not: the main inducement to deal with a good retail shop is the expectation that the tradesman will have bought the right goods of a good make: the goods sold must be, {{as they were in the}} present <b>case,</b> <b>goods</b> of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply: there is no need to specify in terms the particular purpose for which the buyer requires the goods, which is none the less the particular purpose within the meaning of the section, because it is the only purpose for which any one would ordinarily want the goods.
