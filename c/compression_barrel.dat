40|$|Nowadays, {{the filling}} and {{solidification}} of macro-scale injection mouldings can be predicted using commercial CAE software. For micro-injection moulding, the conventional tools {{do not work}} for all process conditions. The reasons might be the lack of high quality database used in the simulation and the improperly specified boundary conditions which {{do not reflect the}} real state in the cavity. Special aspects like surface tension or "size dependent" viscosity might also be responsible for the inaccuracy of the simulations. In this paper, those aspects related to the boundary conditions were taken into consideration, especially the thermal contact behaviour and the melt <b>compression</b> in the <b>barrel</b> which affects not only the temperature of the melt due to the compression heating, but also reduces the actual volume rate in the cavity. It can be shown that the heat transfer coefficient between the melt and the mould wall has a significant influence on the simulation results. In combination with precise material data and considering the reduction of the volume rate due to the melt <b>compression</b> in the <b>barrel,</b> the heat transfer coefficient may be quantified by means of reverse engineering. In general, it decreases when either the cavity thickness or the injection speed increases. It is believed that a pressure dependent model for the heat transfer coefficient would be more suitable to describe the thermal contact behaviour in micro injection moulding. The melt <b>compression</b> in the <b>barrel</b> affects definitely the filling behaviour and subsequently the heat transfer in the cavity as well, which is especially true for micro parts of high aspect ratio...|$|R

40|$|Tribology {{is one of}} {{the major}} issues in forming processes. It is {{influenced}} by many factors such as workpiece and tool material, lubrication, process parameters, geometric scale etc. Especially in microforming processes, friction plays an important role due to an increased surface to volume ratio and the domination of open over closed lubricant pockets [1 - 3]. A simple and sensitive method to quantify the friction factor under realistic conditions of massive forming is the <b>barrel</b> <b>compression</b> test [4]. The friction factor is calculated out of the friction-dependent barreling of cylinder samples while being compressed between two parallel tool surfaces. In these investigations, the <b>barrel</b> <b>compression</b> test was applied to determine the friction factor between cylindrically shaped samples made of the aluminium alloy AlMg 4. 5 Mn 0. 7 (EN AW 5083) and polished surfaces made of the tool steel 1. 3343. The specimen diameter was varied between 0, 5 mm and 10 mm. The focus of investigations was the size-dependence of the friction factor under the variation of the parameters such as forming degree, lubrication conditions, and die velocity. In addition to the calculation of the friction factor, surfaces were evaluated by microscopy and roughness measurements...|$|R

50|$|The D-20 has a 34 calibre (5.195 m) barrel, with {{a double}} baffle muzzle brake and a {{semi-automatic}} vertical sliding block breech, with a tied jaw and the block moving down to open. The barrel is mounted in a long ring cradle with the trunnions just forward of the breech. The recoil system (buffer and recuperator) is mounted on the cradle above the <b>barrel.</b> <b>Compression</b> balancing gear is attached behind the saddle support, passing through the complex shaped saddle to connect to the cradle just forward of the trunnions. This can be manually re-pressured by a pump below the breech. The breech has a projectile retaining catch to prevent the shell sliding out at higher elevations before it is rammed with a manual rammer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{composite}} softball bat and {{two different}} softball constructions were investigated using experimental and finite element (FE) methods. Softball characterizations were completed using COR (coefficient of restitution against a flat wall), CCOR (cylindrical coefficient of restitution), compression, and dynamic stiffness.

Softballs were modeled using the viscoelastic material models, and the composite softball bat model was constructed per the ply stack-up and ply properties as provided by the manufacturer.

40|$|Tribological {{conditions}} between workpiece and tool have a {{major impact}} onto forming processes. Besides lubrication, temperature, and material, they are mainly influenced by the tool surface characteristics, especially by its topography, which is a result of finishing technology. Thereby formed lubricant pockets are of prime importance for the tribosystem due to its ability to separate the tribopartners by storing lubricant. The influence of four different tool finishing processes and their according surface topographies onto frictional behaviour have been investigated and quantified by the <b>barrel</b> <b>compression</b> test, in dry and lubricated tribosystems. The tool steel surfaces were stochastically microstructured by grinding and spark erosion as well as deterministic structured with micro calottes, applied by jet electrochemical machining and compared to a polished reference tool. The allocation of open and closed lubricant pockets over tool surfaces before and after the forming process was analysed by a self-made MATLAB tool...|$|R
40|$|Within the German Collaborative Research Center 39 PT-PIESA {{the forming}} of micro {{cavities}} into aluminum sheets is one challenging task. During this forming process high forces and stresses occur {{which lead to}} a high tool wear. Hence, the actually applied cold forming process should be replaced by a warm forming process. This paper shows the tribological investigations for the warm forming process. Within the experiments the <b>barrel</b> <b>compression</b> test [1] is used to determine the friction conditions by varying the size of the cylindrically shaped samples of AlMg 4, 5 Mn 0, 7, the forming degree and the lubrication condition (dry, graphite, forming oil). The flat punches were made from hardened steel 1. 3343. The friction factor was calculated, and surface roughness was evaluated by 3 D-laser microscopy. The experiments show that the friction factor increases, especially at forming degrees below 1 and for small specimen size, compared to cold forming processes [2]. In addition to that, an influence of the lubrication condition onto the surface roughness was observed. For experiments conducted with graphite, the surface roughness is significantly higher than for samples, which were formed dryly or with forming oil...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in high-temperature deformation process. Friction affects local displacement field in the tool-workpiece interface region, thus affecting the overall material flow. Under high-temperature compression, macro-indicators like bulge radius and load displacement curves are not sensitive enough to distinguish subtle differences between various friction models. Hence, a new approach to match the experimental Lagrangian flow field with flow field obtained from FE simulation is proposed. For this uniaxial <b>barreling,</b> <b>compression</b> tests at constant temperature were conducted on Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The compression tests were conducted at different strain, strain rate and friction conditions. Finite element simulations employing various friction models and parameters were performed for matching the experimental conditions. Experimental Lagrangian flow fields were obtained from the grain flow lines observed on high-resolution larger area micrographs of the specimen. It was observed that all the investigated friction models provided equally good fit with the macro-experimental indicators (bulge radius and load displacement curves). However, Coulomb friction model was the only friction model that provided the closest fit with the experimentally obtained Lagrangian flow fields. Coulomb friction model provided the best agreement between experimental and numerical simulation for both lubricated and non-lubricated conditions using friction coefficients mu = 0. 2993 and mu = 0. 3895, respectively...|$|R
