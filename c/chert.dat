40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} the major and {{rare earth element}} compositions of siliceous deposits from the Upper Devonian Liujiang Formation, Lower Carboniferous Luzhai Formation, Lower–Middle Permian Sidazhai Formation and Tapi Formation, which are widely distributed as bedded <b>cherts</b> in the interplatform basinal successions of the Youjiang Basin. The Liujiang Formation and Luzhai Formation <b>cherts</b> generally have high Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) values (0. 38 – 0. 94) and are non-hydrothermal <b>cherts.</b> These <b>cherts</b> are generally characterized by moderately negative Ce anomalies and high Y/Ho values relatived to PAAS, indicating that the Youjiang Basin might have evolved into an open rift basin during the Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous. The Sidazhai Formation <b>cherts</b> from Ziyun generally have high Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) values (0. 60 – 0. 78), suggesting negligible contribution from a hydrothermal component. The Sidazhai Formation <b>cherts</b> from Hechi and the Tapi Formation <b>cherts</b> from Malipo generally have low Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) values (0. 09 – 0. 41), indicating an intense hydrothermal input. Relatived to the Sidazhai Formation <b>cherts,</b> the Tapi Formation <b>cherts</b> have higher Ce/Ce* values (0. 68 ± 0. 19) and lower Y/Ho values (41. 83 ± 13. 27), which may {{be affected by the}} terrigenous input from the Vietnam Block. The Sidazhai Formation <b>cherts</b> from Ziyun and Hechi exhibit negative Ce anomalies (0. 43 ± 0. 12, 0. 33 ± 0. 17, respectively) with high Y/Ho values (57. 44 ± 16. 20, 46. 02 ± 4. 27, respectively), resembling the geochemical characteristics of open-ocean basin <b>cherts.</b> These <b>cherts</b> were deposited on a passive continental margin adjacent to the Babu branch ocean, which may have contributed to upwelling.

Anywhere else, the Supragriotte limestones are conformably overlain by pre-orogenic sediments that begin with the Lower <b>Cherts</b> of the Tournaisian. The Lower <b>Cherts</b> comprise 50 m of black, phosphate nodule-bearing <b>cherts</b> interlayered with black shales.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of marine and lacustrine <b>cherts</b> demonstrates that Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd systems {{may be used}} in elucidating the origin and evolution of <b>cherts,</b> and that the Rb-Sr system may be used for dating. All samples have high Rb/Sr ratios, and though the site of these elements in <b>cherts</b> was not established, they appear to be correlated with Al content. Sm/Nd ratios were typical of continental sources, and the results show the Rb-Sr system in <b>cherts</b> to be isolated from the associated carbonate, with little Sr exchange. Data suggest that in many cases <b>cherts</b> are formed by dissolved SiO 2 nucleating on clay-like material which preserves the isotropic characteristics of the detrital source, while in some cases it is possible that <b>cherts</b> were formed from silica-saturated waters from a nonmarine source...|$|R

These occurrences are {{unusual in}} that radiolarian <b>cherts</b> are com-monly {{associated}} with ophiolites, pelagic sediments or turbidites. No other occurrences are known where such <b>cherts</b> rest directly on rocks of continental derivation. These two occurrences are now {{separated by a}} distance of 900 km.

5|$|The {{earliest}} ceramic evidence excavated at Buena Vista {{dates to}} {{the very end of the}} Early Preclassic period, indicating that the site was initially settled at the transition between the Early and Middle Preclassic periods. The long occupational history of Buena Vista may be linked to its proximity to chert-rich hills. Excavations have revealed evidence of <b>chert</b> workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.|$|E
5|$|Transitional fossils are {{not only}} those of animals. With the {{increasing}} mapping of the divisions of plants {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, the search began for the ancestor of the vascular plants.

5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and <b>chert.</b> Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here.

40|$|Results {{from the}} first {{detailed}} radiolarian biostratigraphic study conducted in Luzon are reported. The data were obtained from <b>cherts</b> associated with the Casiguran Ophiolite, a dismembered ophiolite mass consisting of serpentinized peridotites, gabbros, dolerite dikes and pillow basalts exposed along the eastern coast of the Northern Sierra Madre, Luzon, Philippines. <b>Cherts</b> and limestone interbeds conformably overlie the ophiolite. The radiolarian assemblages from the <b>cherts</b> constrain the stratigraphic range of the <b>cherts</b> to the Lower Cretaceous (upper Barremian-lower Aptian to Albian). This new biostratigraphic result is {{in contrast with the}} Upper Cretaceous stratigraphic range previously reported in the region. Radiolarian biostratigraphic results from the Casiguran Ophiolite provide additional evidence for the existence of Mesozoic oceanic substratum upon which Luzon and neighboring regions within the Philippine archipelago were likely built. Interestingly, the result closely resembles those reported for the ophiolite in southeastern Luzon as well as the oceanic crust of the Huatung Basin situated east of Taiwan and the ophiolites in eastern Indonesia. In light of this, along with previously gathered geochemical data from the ophiolites, a common provenance is being looked into for these crust-upper mantle sequences in the western Pacific region...|$|R

5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and <b>chert</b> probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E
5|$|It {{is presumed}} that the fungi colonized the land during the Cambrian (542–488.3Ma), long before land plants. Fossilized hyphae and spores {{recovered}} from the Ordovician of Wisconsin (460Ma) resemble modern-day Glomerales, and existed {{at a time when}} the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular bryophyte-like plants. Prototaxites, which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late Silurian. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early Devonian (416–359.2Ma), when they occur abundantly in the Rhynie <b>chert,</b> mostly as Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota. At about this same time, approximately 400Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged, and all modern classes of fungi were present by the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian, 318.1–299Ma).|$|E
5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie <b>Chert.</b> The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E
