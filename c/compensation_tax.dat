40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{coordination and}} profit allocation in a profit-center organization using a single transfer price. The model includes <b>compensations,</b> <b>taxes,</b> and minority interests of two divisions deciding on capacity and sales. The analysis covers arm’s length transfer prices which are either administered by central management or negotiated by the divisions. Administered transfer prices refer to past transactions and therefore maximize firm-wide profit net of divisional <b>compensations,</b> <b>taxes,</b> and minority profit shares only for given decentralized decisions. From an ex-ante perspective, it is shown that {{adverse effects on}} coordination may result in inefficient divisional profits of which all stakeholders suffer. We motivate a positive effect of advance pricing agreements, intra-firm guidelines, and restrictive treatments {{of changes in the}} firm’s accounting policy. By contrast, negotiations ignore <b>compensations,</b> <b>taxes,</b> and minority shares but yield efficient divisional profits. Negotiations seem compelling as they perfectly reflect the arm’s length principle. Moreover, common practices such as arbitration or one-step pricing schemes allow the firm to engage in manipulation {{at the expense of other}} stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|In 1916, Henry Ford faced a {{legal battle}} with {{shareholders}} in Ford Motor Company (including, most notably, the Dodge brothers) over a plan to end the company’s practice of giving special dividends. The Dodge brothers wanted to force the company to continue giving special dividends and Ford wanted to end the practice {{in order to use}} the cash to expand operations. Ford, who was the President of the company, said his motivation for this shift was “to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their homes. ” While the Michigan Supreme Court would eventually rule against him, Ford’s plan was simple: share the success with workers through higher wages and more hiring, and with customers through less expensive cars which will earn their loyalty and their business. More than ninety-five years later, Howard Schultz, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Starbucks, appeared on the Piers Morgan Show and asked American corporations and executives to realize the same principle—that “success is best when it’s shared. ” In the same interview, Schultz implored CEOs of American companies to put short-term profits aside and use company funds to invest in the long-term success of their country and their companies, claiming that the private sector “can’t wait for Washington” to act to fix the ailing U. S. economy. Given {{the state of the economy}} and the unseemly growth in executive compensation while employee wages and job growth remain stagnant, it is now Washington who cannot wait to act. This Article suggests a first step towards such action ultimately rests on the simple premise that the fruits of any successful endeavor must be shared equitably with those who gave their effort to bring about that success. In this context, equity requires that the profits of large corporate enterprises be shared according to some positive relationship with the risk of loss and the responsibility for success. Working from that premise, it is unacceptable that the profits of large corporate enterprises are currently shared by a few and the losses are spread amongst the many. The chief culprit in bringing about such an unacceptable state of affairs is the unchecked and undisrupted growth of executive compensation. This Article argues that in order to reduce the current inequities of the compensation of executives as compared to employees, Congress should tax the earnings of executives in excess of 100 times that of the average employee at a rate of 90 %. Such a tax will help to reduce the grossly disparate inequality of earnings between executives and average employees because executives will either make less money after taxes, will negotiate smaller compensation packages, or average employees will be paid more. The text that follows consists of three main parts. Part I reviews the current executive <b>compensation</b> <b>tax</b> scheme as it relates to executive salaries. Part II then reviews the current executive <b>compensation</b> <b>tax</b> scheme as it relates to non-salary compensations. Part III details the shortcomings of the current executive <b>compensation</b> <b>tax</b> scheme. Part IV then argues that executive compensation should be deemed excessive if it surpasses 100 times the gross yearly wages of the average employee. Additionally, Part IV argues that executive compensation regulation through the tax code is best met by imposing a large individual tax burden on executive compensation. In conclusion, this Article contrasts this proposed legislation scheme by comparing it to the current executive <b>compensation</b> <b>tax</b> scheme...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{influence}} of corporate compensation policies on firms’ tax aggressiveness in an emerging market where executive compensation is primarily in cash form. Based on a hand-collected dataset of 958 firm-year observations of Chinese listed firms for the 2006 - 2012 period, we find that firms paying higher executive cash compensation are associated with lower tax aggressiveness. This relationship also holds for the excess cash compensation measures which control for executive shareholding, firm profitability, size, growth opportunity, and board independence. We further document that mutual funds ownership pressure firms paying higher compensation to reduce their tax aggressiveness, suggesting adverse selection by mutual funds on firms exhibiting risky tax avoidance activities. High leverage offsets the negative link between cash compensation and tax aggressiveness, indicating a complementary effect between debt and tax avoidance, and, hence, suggesting that creditor monitoring is weak. These results are robust to the system-GMM estimation, which simultaneously account for the endogeneity of executive <b>compensation,</b> <b>tax</b> aggressiveness, ownership and control, leverage, and corporate governance. Our findings on Chinese firms have important policy implications for developing {{countries around the world}} with concentrated ownership structure, weak institutional environment, widespread corruption, ineffective rule of law, and ongoing significant social and political transformation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the links between}} corporate tax avoidance, the growth of highpowered incentives for managers, {{and the structure of}} corporate governance. We develop and test a simple model that highlights the role of complementarities between tax sheltering and managerial diversion in determining how high-powered incentives influence tax sheltering decisions. The model generates the testable hypothesis that firm governance characteristics determine how incentive compensation changes sheltering decisions. In order to test the model, we construct an empirical measure of corporate tax avoidance - the component of the book-tax gap not attributable to accounting accruals - and investigate the link between this measure of tax avoidance and incentive compensation. We find that, for the full sample of firms, increases in incentive compensation tend to reduce the level of tax sheltering, suggesting a complementary relationship between diversion and sheltering. As predicted by the model, the relationship between incentive compensation and tax sheltering is a function of a firm. s corporate governance. Our results may help explain the growing cross-sectional variation among firms in their levels of tax avoidance, the. undersheltering puzzle,. and why large book-tax gaps are associated with subsequent negative abnormal returns.

40|$|The paper {{traces the}} Baltics’ {{adjustment}} strategy during the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis. The abrupt {{end to the}} externally-financed domestic demand boom triggered a severe output collapse, bringing per capita income levels back to 2005 / 06 levels. In response to this shock, the Baltics undertook an internal devaluation that relied on unprecedented fiscal and nominal wage adjustment, steps to preserve financial sector stability as well as complementary efforts to facilitate voluntary private debt restructuring. One-and-half years on, the strategy is making good progress but not yet complete. Confidence in the exchange rate was maintained, the banking system was supported by its parent banks, external imbalances and inflation have largely disappeared, competitiveness is improving, and fiscal deficits are gradually being brought back towards pre-crisis levels. However, amid record levels of unemployment, further reforms are needed to foster a return to more balanced growth, fiscal sustainability, and a healthier banking system.

40|$|This Article is, in essence, a strident {{expression}} of indignation {{about what a}} majority of tax scholars and, indeed, legislators consider a glaring yet persistent inequity in the tax code. In short, sometimes extraordinarily well-paid fund managers receive <b>compensation</b> <b>taxed</b> at capital gains rates.

The result is clearly regressive and yet, as of late, even some respected and knowledgeable scholars-though still in the minority-have unabashedly set forth sophisticated-sounding justifications.
