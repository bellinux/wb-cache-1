In early 2010, heavy rainfall affected Machu Picchu and Cuzco. On January 25, 2010, 2,000 tourists were stranded near Machu Picchu when a landslide blocked the railroad connecting the site with Cuzco. The tourists were evacuated by ten helicopters, including four from the United States military on loan from the embassy in Lima.|$|E
5|$|Antalcidas, meanwhile, {{had entered}} into {{negotiations}} with Tiribazus, and {{reached an agreement}} under which the Persians would enter into the war on the Spartan side if the allies refused to make peace. It appears that the Persians, unnerved by certain of Athens' actions, including supporting king Evagoras of Cyprus and Akoris of Egypt, {{both of whom were}} at war with Persia, had decided that their policy of weakening Sparta by supporting its enemies was no longer useful. After escaping from the blockade at Abydos, Antalcidas attacked and defeated a small Athenian force, then united his fleet with a supporting fleet sent from Syracuse. With this force, which was soon further augmented with ships supplied by the satraps of the region, he sailed to the Hellespont, where he <b>could</b> <b>cut</b> off the trade routes that brought grain to Athens. The Athenians, mindful of their similar defeat in the Peloponnesian War less than two decades before, were ready to make peace.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{is able to}} play {{across the}} front line, {{operating}} either as an attacking midfielder, second striker or centre-forward, or in his favoured position out on the wing. During his time at the Castilla, Jesé was often deployed in a false 9 role in the team's 4–3–3 formation, and regularly switched flanks due to his ability to use both feet. In 2013, {{in his role as}} the club's sporting director at the time, Zinedine Zidane declared himself an admirer of Jesé's direct style of football and goal scoring ability. Following Jesé's promotion to Real Madrid's first team in 2013, manager Carlo Ancelotti played him in a winger position, where he <b>could</b> <b>cut</b> inside from the wing both with the ball and without, to create chances and score goals.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{suffered a}} downturn {{between the two}} world wars, as working horses were replaced by lorries and peat demand dropped, but after the Second World War peat {{was used by the}} horticultural industry in increasing volumes, and harvesting expanded again. From 1947, experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways, and they soon replaced horses. A total of 23 had worked on the system {{by the time it was}} closed down. The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s, with the introduction of machines that <b>could</b> <b>cut</b> and stack the peat turves. In 1981 mechanical loading of the turves into the trains was introduced. Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985, which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors.|$|E

Plows, tractors, spreaders, combines {{to name a few}} are some mechanized implements for the grain crop or horticultural farmer which are labour saving devices. Many Canadian museums such as Reynolds-Alberta Museum will showcase the evolution and variety of farm machinery.|$|E

He supported lower rates for Toronto's poorer residents, arguing that transit passes could be mailed out with welfare cheques. This idea was opposed by then-TTC chair Mike Colle. Moscoe also advocated lower advertising rates for small businesses, noting that a national recession was resulting in many spaces being left unused. He opposed the TTC's elimination of environmentally friendly trolley services in January 1992, and led a successful initiative for their restoration later in the same year. Moscoe also opposed a 16% fare increase in 1992, arguing that the TTC <b>could</b> <b>cut</b> expenses through administration instead.|$|E

25|$|Because of fuel {{shortage}} during the Second World War, the trolleybus network was expanded in 1943 with line 21 from Skillebekk to Carl Berners plass converted. As {{part of this}} work a trolley line was built from Torshov to Bjølsen Depot to allow buses access to the depot. Oslo Sporveier decided {{at the end of}} the war that some of the tram lines with the least traffic should be closed. At the time trams had both a motorman and a conductor while buses only had a driver, and Oslo Sporveier <b>could</b> <b>cut</b> operating costs through this. Oslo Sporveier therefore decided to electrify another three lines. One of these was line 23, which ran from Bjølsen and Linnaaes gate downtown.|$|E
