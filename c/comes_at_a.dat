5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
5|$|Two {{and a half}} centuries {{after the}} First War of the Races, Brona returns as the Warlock Lord, now with Skull Bearers as his servants. Chronicled in the prequel novel First King of Shannara, the Second War of the Races begins with the {{destruction}} of the Druid Order. A lone Druid, Bremen, forges a magical talisman to destroy the Warlock Lord; it is given to the Elven King, Jerle Shannara. As it {{takes the form of a}} blade, the talisman is named the Sword of Shannara. It succeeds in banishing the Warlock Lord. He is not killed, but his army is defeated by the combined armies of the Elves and Dwarves. Peace <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high price, interracial tension is renewed and the Druids have vanished.|$|E
25|$|When a {{programming}} language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> price when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E

25|$|Eggs can be lost due to {{predation}} or carelessness. Crows and gulls are opportunist egg thieves. Eggs {{are also}} knocked from ledges during fights. If the first egg is lost, the female may lay a second egg. This egg is usually {{lighter than the}} first, with a lighter yolk. Chicks from second eggs grow quicker than those from first eggs. However this rapid growth <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost, first chicks have larger fat reserves and can withstand temporary shortages of food.|$|E
25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where playing the same strategy Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost (or negative externality).|$|E
25|$|The naked carp, {{a closely}} related species native to the high-altitude Lake Qinghai, is also able to remodel their gills in {{response}} to hypoxic conditions. In response to oxygen levels 95% lower than normoxic conditions, apoptosis of ILCM increases lamellar surface area by up to 60% after just 24 hours. However, this <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> significant osmoregulatory cost, reducing sodium and chloride levels in the cytoplasm by over 10%. The morphological response to hypoxia by scaleless carp is the fastest respiratory surface remodelling reported in vertebrates thus far.|$|E

The program offers a four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) course in six disciplines: Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Material Science, Mathematics, and Physics. The course aims at exposing the students to the inter-disciplinary nature in which scientific research is done in many upcoming fields, and <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when the importance of science education at the undergraduate level is emphasised and several incentives are provided by the Government to promote the same.|$|E
25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a buzz in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{literature}} suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} trailhead {{parking lot at}} the top of Platte Clove, {{recently}} expanded by NYSDEC, hikers follow the old Steenburg Road, now the snowmobile trail, blazed both with large orange plastic discs for snowmobiles (rarely seen) and smaller blue ones for foot users (A color given on all DEC lands to sections of the Long Path not part of other designated trails). The cascades of a nearby tributary of Platte Creek beckon through hemlock stands, but are on private land. Vehicle tracks can still be seen as there are several forks leading to private homes in the area, usually chained off.

With them, Elbryan Wyndon and his friends strike quickly {{at the edges of the}} enemy, doing all in their power to weaken them. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the only way to truly stop the encroaching darkness is to defeat the dactyl itself. Intent on this quest, the three friends, accompanied by the elves Belli'mar Juraviel and Tuntun and others, journey to the Barbican and Mount Aida to face their enemy. In the end the demon is defeated by Avelyn Desbris and his amethyst gemstone. Though they are victorious, victory <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high price. The monk Avelyn gives his life to end the demon dactyl's influence.|$|E

Mundo histórico y Reino de Dios (2006) is a lecture in theology of history, while Los siete primeros concilios. La formulación de la ortodoxia católica (2003) discusses evolution of the early Catholic doctrine. The work which falls into none of the fields discussed earlier is En torno al diálogo católico-protestante (1966); written in course of Vaticanum II it advanced a somewhat competitive approach towards ecumenism and claimed that stress on components unifying Christian faiths <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost of de-emphasizing the core message.

25|$|On average, stem mothers {{distribute}} themselves {{among the}} leaves of a Populus tree according to the ideal free distribution model. Stem mothers sharing a leaf have to split the available resources, and this sharing <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost to the stem mother's reproductive success. Two stem mothers sharing a leaf spend {{a significant amount of}} their time engaging in territorial behavior instead of feeding or gall forming. Thus, stem mothers sharing a leaf produce less offspring than single stem mothers on leaves of the same size. When one stem mother is removed from a shared leaf, the reproductive success of the remaining occupant(s) rise accordingly. Some stem mothers choose to settle alone on smaller leaves instead of sharing a larger leaf with another individual. This creates a scenario where, on average, there is no difference between the reproductive success of stem mothers occupying leaves singly and stem mothers sharing leaves with other individuals.|$|E

As the Duke tells the two {{that he plans to}} expose Ingrid to all of Arendelle, Ingrid attempts to freeze the Duke, but he pulls Helga in front of him, causing Ingrid to freeze her instead. As a stunned Ingrid kneels by her frozen sister, Helga's body crumbles into a pile of ice shards. As Gerda shows up, she is stunned by what Ingrid did to Helga. Refusing to believe her and fearing that Ingrid has become a danger to everyone around her, Gerda takes the urn and traps a sobbing Ingrid inside. Later, Gerda goes to the Grand Pabbie and asks him to make a potion that will cause the residents of Arendelle to forget Ingrid and Helga ever existed {{in order to protect the}} future of the kingdom.

500|$|The {{iterative}} algorithms {{were widely}} used after 1980 {{because they are}} faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically {{increase the number of}} correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally multiply the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, the Canadian brothers John and Peter Borwein produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step.See [...] for details of algorithms. Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician Yasumasa Kanada to set several records for computing [...] between 1995 and 2002.
