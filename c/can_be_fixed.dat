25|$|DNA {{replication}} at the {{replication fork}} can be halted by {{a shortage of}} deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) or by DNA damage, resulting in replication stress.

Stalling signals are deactivated if the problems causing the replication fork are resolved.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example is}} {{obtained}} by replacing the planes, as model surfaces, by spheres, which are homogeneous under the Möbius group of conformal transformations. There {{is no longer}} a unique sphere tangent to a smooth surface S at each point, since the radius of the sphere is undetermined. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> by supposing that the sphere has the same mean curvature as S at the point of contact. Such spheres can again be rolled along curves on S, and this equips S with another type of Cartan connection called a conformal connection.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} {{application of}} methylene blue is the intravital or supravital staining of nerve fibers, an effect first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1887. A dilute {{solution of the}} dye is either injected into tissue or applied to small freshly removed pieces. The selective blue coloration develops with exposure to air (oxygen) and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> by immersion of the stained specimen in an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate. Vital methylene blue was formerly much used for examining the innervation of muscle, skin and internal organs. The mechanism of selective dye uptake is incompletely understood; vital staining of nerve fibers in skin is prevented by ouabain, a drug that inhibits the Na/K-ATPase of cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|Although QTL {{analysis}} has generated {{a vast amount}} of information on gene locations and the magnitude of effects on many traits, the identification of the genes involved has remained elusive. This is due to poor resolution of QTL analysis. The solution for this problem would be production of recombinant chromosome substitution line, or stepped aligned recombinant inbred lines. Here, backcrossing is carried out until a desired level of recombination has occurred and genetic markers are used to detect desired recombinant chromosome substitution lines in the target region, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> by doubled haploidy. In rice, molecular markers {{have been found to be}} linked with major genes and QTLs for resistance to rice blast, bacterial blight, and sheath blight in a map produced from DH population.|$|E

25|$|Reconciliation {{methods can}} rely on a parsimonious or a {{probabilistic}} framework to infer the most likely scenario(s), where the relative cost/probability of D, T, L events <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fixed</b> a priori or estimated from the data. The space of DTL reconciliations and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through dynamic programming algorithms. In some programs, the gene tree topology can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario {{as well as the}} initial sequence alignment. More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages, reflecting the loss of efficiency of HR with phylogenetic distance, for ILS, or {{for the fact that the}} actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages. Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scalesmodelling independent evolution of gene fragments or recognising co-evolution of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) within and across genomes.|$|E
