5|$|Macroeconomics descends {{from two}} areas of research: {{business}} <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> and monetary theory. Monetary theory {{dates back to}} the 16th century and the work of Martín de Azpilcueta, while business cycle analysis dates from the mid 19th.|$|E
5|$|Rothbard wrote {{extensively}} on Austrian business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> {{and as part}} of this approach, strongly opposed central banking, fiat money, and fractional-reserve banking and advocated a gold standard and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their {{business}} cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, price level, and interest rates.|$|E

5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E

25|$|Austrian School economists such as Jesús Huerta de Soto and Murray Rothbard {{have also}} {{strongly}} criticized fractional-reserve banking, calling {{for it to}} be outlawed and criminalized. According to them, not only does money creation cause macroeconomic instability (based on the Austrian Business <b>Cycle</b> <b>Theory),</b> but it is a form of embezzlement or financial fraud, legalized only due to the influence of powerful rich bankers on corrupt governments around the world. Politician Ron Paul has also criticized fractional reserve banking based on Austrian School arguments.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{extend the}} {{architecture}} of agents (and robots) based upon fixed, one-size-fits-all cycles of operation, by providing a framework of declarative specification of agent control. Control is given in terms of <b>cycle</b> <b>theories,</b> which define in a declarative way the possible alternative behaviours of agents, depending on the particular circumstances of the (perceived) external {{environment in which they}} are situated, on the internal state of the agents at the time of operation, and on the agents' behavioural profile. This form of control is adopted by the KGP model of agency and has been successfully implemented in the PROSOCS platform. We also show how, via <b>cycle</b> <b>theories,</b> we can formally verify properties of agents' behaviour, focusing on the concrete property of agents' interruptibility. Finally, we give some examples to show how different <b>cycle</b> <b>theories</b> give rise to different, heterogeneous agents' behaviours...|$|R

25|$|Chapter 2 {{is about}} {{economics}} {{as it has}} been practised in the years leading up to 2009. The author refers to Keynes's view that an over-reliance on maths is a mistake, because mathematical models will always depend on the validity of their underlying assumptions. Skidelsky says that modern mainstream macroeconomics has become closely integrated with maths, {{at the expense of other}} disciplines such as political economy and history, and that this is partly why it became so unreliable at making accurate predictions or offering good advice. Various schools of thought within modern economics are briefly discussed, such as rational expectations, real business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> and efficient market theory.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{intellectual}} example of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Tugan-Baranovsky looked to England for {{the path that}} developing nations such as Russia inevitably must travel. He next journeyed to London {{in the spring and}} summer of 1891 to work in the British Museum, there examining the collection of rare books and statistical works. He then returned to Russia, spending two more years at work in St. Petersburg on a substantial tome of business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory,</b> Industrial Crises in Contemporary England: Their Causes and Influences on the Life of the People. Publication of the book in 1894 earned Tugan-Baranovsky a Master's degree in Political Economics from Moscow University.|$|E
500|$|Lucas (1973) {{proposed}} a business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> based on rational expectations, imperfect information, and market clearing. While building this model, Lucas attempted {{to incorporate the}} empirical fact {{that there had been}} a trade-off between inflation and output without ceding that money was non-neutral in the short-run. This model included the idea of money surprise: monetary policy only matters when it causes people to be surprised or confused by the price of goods changing relative to one another. Lucas hypothesized that producers become aware of changes in their own industries before they recognize changes in other industries. Given this assumption, a producer might perceive an increase in general price level as an increase in the demand for his goods. The producer responds by increasing production only to find the [...] "surprise" [...] that prices had increased across the economy generally rather than specifically for his goods. This [...] "Lucas supply curve" [...] models output as a function of the [...] "price" [...] or [...] "money surprise," [...] the difference between expected and actual inflation. Lucas's [...] "surprise" [...] business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> fell out of favor after the 1970s when empirical evidence failed to support this model.|$|E

50|$|While {{the model}} was at first widely {{accepted}} among Anglo-Saxon scholars, in Continental Europe it met some resistance with German scholars Albrecht and Walther Penck, Siegfried Passarge and Alfred Hettner standing out as early opponents to the model.

500|$|While [...] "money surprise" [...] models floundered, efforts {{continued}} {{to develop a}} new classical model of the business cycle. A 1982 paper by Kydland and Prescott introduced real business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> (RBC). Under this theory business cycles could be explained entirely by the supply side, and models represented the economy with systems at constant equilibrium. RBC dismissed the need to explain business cycles with price surprise, market failure, price stickiness, uncertainty, and instability. Instead, Kydland and Prescott built parsimonious models that explained business cycles with changes in technology and productivity. Employment levels changed because these technological and productivity changes altered the desire of people to work. RBC rejected the idea of high involuntary unemployment in recessions and not only dismissed the idea that money could stabilize the economy but also the monetarist idea that money could destabilize it.|$|E
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} <b>cycle</b> <b>theory,</b> which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's {{theory of money}} and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers are saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E

2500|$|Some economists {{argue that}} Austrian {{business}} <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> requires bankers and investors to exhibit {{a kind of}} irrationality, because the Austrian theory posits that investors will be fooled repeatedly (by temporarily low interest rates) into making unprofitable investment decisions.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} {{computational}} counterpart of the KGP (Knowledge, Goals, Plan) declarative model of agency for Global Computing. In this context, a computational entity {{is seen as}} an agent developed using Computational Logic tools and techniques. We model a KGP agent by relying upon a collection of capabilities, which are then used to define a collection of transitions, to be used within logically specified, context sensitive control theories, which we call <b>cycle</b> <b>theories.</b> In close relationship to the declarative model, the computational model mirrors the logical architecture by specifying appropriate computational counterparts for the capabilities and using these to give the computational models of the transitions. These computational models and the one specified for the <b>cycle</b> <b>theories</b> are all based on, and are significant extensions of, existing proof procedures for abductive logic programming and logic programming with priorities. We also discuss a prototype implementation of the overall computational model for KGP. ...|$|R

Furthermore the theory allows for the explicit derivation of gauge interactions, without postulating gauge invariance, directly from relativistic geometrodynamical transformations, in close analogy with the description of gravitational interaction in general relativity.

2500|$|According {{to their}} study, the [...] "New Deal labor and {{industrial}} policies did not lift the economy {{out of the}} Depression but that the [...] "New Deal policies are an important contributing factor to {{the persistence of the}} Great Depression." [...] They claim that the New Deal [...] "cartelization policies are a key factor behind the weak recovery". They say that the [...] "abandonment of these policies coincided with the strong economic recovery of the 1940s". The study by Cole and Ohanian is based on a real business <b>cycle</b> <b>theory</b> model. The underlying assumptions of this theory are subject to numerous criticisms and the theory is unable to posit any convincing explanations for the initial causes of the Great Depression. Laurence Seidman noted that according to the assumptions of Cole and Ohanian the labor market clears instantaneously, which leads to the incredible conclusion that the surge in unemployment between 1929 and 1932 (before the New Deal) was, in their opinion, both optimal and solely based on voluntary unemployment. Additionally, Cole and Ohanian's argument does not count workers employed through New Deal programs. Such programs built or renovated 2,500 hospitals, 45,000 schools, 13,000 parks and playgrounds, 7,800 bridges, [...] of roads, 1,000 airfields and employed 50,000 teachers through programs that rebuilt the country's entire rural school system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of the New York Times, Paul is [...] "not a fan" [...] of the Federal Reserve. In his own words, Paul advocates that we should [...] "End the Fed". Paul's {{opposition}} to the Fed is supported by the Austrian Business <b>Cycle</b> <b>Theory,</b> which holds that instead of containing inflation, the Federal Reserve, in theory and in practice, is responsible for causing inflation. In addition to eroding the value of individual savings, this creation of inflation leads to booms and busts in the economy. Thus Paul argues that government, via a central bank (the Federal Reserve), is the primary cause of economic recessions and depressions. He believes that economic volatility is decreased when the free market determines interest rates and money supply. [...] He has stated in numerous speeches that most of his colleagues in Congress are unwilling to abolish the central bank because it funds many government activities. He says that to compensate for eliminating the [...] "hidden tax" [...] of monetary inflation, Congress and the president would instead have to raise taxes or cut government services, either of which could be politically damaging to their reputations. He states that the [...] "inflation tax" [...] is a tax on the poor, because the Federal Reserve prints more money which subsidizes select industries, while poor people pay higher prices for goods as more money is placed in circulation.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{an analysis of}} influence of political cycle on public procurement assignment. In the first part, there are main political <b>cycle</b> <b>theories</b> and existing studies summarized and compared. Three hypotheses are created according to political <b>cycle</b> <b>theories.</b> The first hypothesis assumes that incumbent behaviour is opportunistic and the quantity and volume of public procurement rise before elections. The second hypothesis assumes a decrease of these variables after elections. The third hypothesis examines the structure of public procurement and expects a significant rise of the quantity and volume of construction procurement before elections. There are econometric models created {{in the second part}} of this thesis. They test the influence of elections on performance of selected variables. Examined variables are the volume and the quantity of public procurement. Data for testing are collected from 41 cities and years 2004 - 2012 and they are divided quarterly. The result of this research is an expression of the influence of elections on the public procurement and confirmation of tested hypotheses...|$|R
