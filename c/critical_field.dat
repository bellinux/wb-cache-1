25|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the heat capacity and the critical temperature, <b>critical</b> <b>field,</b> and critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|A {{superconductor}} can be TypeI, {{meaning it}} has a single <b>critical</b> <b>field,</b> above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or TypeII, meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called vortices. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors {{it is possible to}} have combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of Type-1.5.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} the superconducting phase {{transition}} was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no latent heat. However, {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence, when the magnetic field is increased beyond the <b>critical</b> <b>field,</b> the resulting phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting material.|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> for vortex expulsion for an infinitely long superconducting strip, using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism. Two <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be defined}} associated with the disappearance of either the energetic stability or metastability of vortices {{in the center of}} the strip for decreasing magnetic fields. We compare the theoretical predictions for the <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> in the London formalism with ours and with recently published experimental results.

40|$|The role of bias {{fields in}} {{micromagnetism}} is illustrated for some basic 3 -D shapes with {{dimensions of the}} order of 100 nm. A bias field selects among possible modes that break the symmetry at <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> and greatly decreases the time for reaching equilibrium {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>critical</b> <b>fields.</b> The magnetization reversal in a toroidal shell is discussed in detail as an example to demonstrate the importance of bias fields and to compare analytic and numerical results...|$|R
40|$|Breakdown of gate oxides {{from heavy}} ions is investigated. Soft {{breakdown}} was observed for 45 8, oxides, {{but not for}} 75 8, oxides. Lower <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> were observed when experiments were done with high fluences during each successive step. This implies that oxide defects {{play an important role}} in breakdown from heavy ions and that breakdown occurs more readily when an ion strike occurs close to a defect site. <b>Critical</b> <b>fields</b> for 75 8, oxides are low enough to allow gate rupture to occur at normal supply voltages for ions with high LET.

25|$|A {{superconductor}} {{with little}} or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value H'c1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second <b>critical</b> <b>field</b> strength H'c2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are TypeI, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are TypeII.|$|E
6000|$|As an {{illustration}} of De Quincey's review of history, one should try Joan of Arc or The Revolt of the Tartars, which are not historical studies but romantic dreams inspired by reading history. In the <b>critical</b> <b>field,</b> [...] "The Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth," [...] "Wordsworth's Poetry" [...] and the [...] "Essay on Style" [...] are immensely suggestive. As an example of ingenious humor [...] "Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts" [...] is often recommended; but it has this serious fault, {{that it is not}} humorous. For a concrete example of De Quincey's matter and manner there is nothing better than [...] "Levana or Our Ladies of Sorrow" [...] (from the Suspiria), with its mater lachrymarum Our Lady of Tears, mater suspiriorum Our Lady of Sighs, and that strange phantom, forbidding and terrible, mater tenebrarum Our Lady of Darkness.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the moduli space of conformal field theories {{by setting up}} a canonical process for exponentiating perturbations corresponding to <b>critical</b> <b>fields.</b> We show that for the Gepner model of the Fermat quintic, this process works for the dilaton and the "image of a dilaton under mirror symmetry". We also show that the same process fails for the other <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> at the stage related to the 4 point function, raising doubts {{about the existence of}} axiomatic conformal field theories in the vertex operator formalism which would correspond to those non-linear Ïƒ-models.

A linear temperature dependence of the parallel and perpendicular upper <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> indicate a 3 D-like penetration of magnetic field into the sample.

40|$|We {{determine}} the critical Zeeman energy splitting of a homogeneous Fermi superfluid at unitary {{in terms of}} the Fermi energy $\epsilon_{\text F}$ according to recent experimental results in LKB-Lhomond. Based on the universal equations of state for the superfluid and normal phases, we show that there exist two <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> $H_{c 1 }$ and $H_{c 2 }$, between which a superfluid-normal mixed phase is energetically favored. Universal formulae for the <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> and the <b>critical</b> population imbalance $P_c$ are derived. We have found a universal relation between the <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> and the <b>critical</b> imbalances: $H_{c 1 }=\gamma\xi\epsilon_{\text F}$ and $H_{c 2 }=(1 +\gamma P_c) ^{ 2 / 3 }H_{c 1 }$ where $\xi$ is the universal constant and $\gamma$ is the critical value of the chemical potential imbalance in the grand canonical ensemble. Since $\xi$, $\gamma$ and $P_c$ have been measured in the experiments, we can {{determine the}} <b>critical</b> Zeeman <b>fields</b> without the detail information of the equation of state for the polarized normal phase. Using the experimental data from LKB-Lhomond, we have found $H_{c 1 }\simeq 0. 37 \epsilon_{\text F}$ and $H_{c 2 }\simeq 0. 44 \epsilon_{\text F}$. Our result of the polarization $P$ {{as a function of the}} Zeeman field $H/\epsilon_{\text F}$ is in good agreement with the data extracted from the experiments. We also give an estimation of the <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>field</b> for dilute neutron matter at which the matter gets spin polarized, assuming the properties of the dilute neutron matter are close to those of the unitary Fermi gas.

50|$|This {{behavior}} {{is different from}} type-II superconductors which exhibit two critical magnetic fields. The first, lower <b>critical</b> <b>field</b> occurs when magnetic flux vortices penetrate the material but the material remains superconducting outside of these microscopic vortices.

50|$|Superconductivity is {{characterized}} both by perfect conductivity (zero resistance) {{and by the}} expulsion of magnetic fields (the Meissner effect).

40|$|We present <b>{{critical}}</b> <b>fields,</b> thermally-activated {{flux flow}} (TAFF) and critical current density of tetragonal phase beta-FeSe single crystals. The upper <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> Hc 2 (T) for H||(101) and H(101) are nearly isotropic {{and are likely}} governed by Pauli limiting process. The obtained large Ginzburg-Landau parameter k âˆ¼ 72. 3 (2) indicates that beta-FeSe is a type-II superconductor with smaller penetration depth than in Fe(Te,Se).

40|$|AbstractFor a {{cylindrical}} superconductor {{surrounded by}} a normal material, we discuss transition to the normal phase of stable, locally stable and critical configurations. Associated with those phase transitions, we define <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> and we provide a sufficient condition for which those <b>critical</b> <b>fields</b> coincide. In particular, when the conductivity ratio of the superconducting and the normal material is large, we show that the aforementioned <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> coincide, thereby proving that {{the transition to the}} normal phase is sharp. One key-ingredient in the paper is the analysis of an elliptic boundary value problem involving â€˜transmissionâ€™ boundary conditions.

For constant {{thickness of the}} Gd layers we observe with decreasing thickness d(Nb) of Nb layers a decrease of T(c) and H(c 2 perpendicular-to) down to a critical thickness d(c), below which superconductivity is completely destroyed.
