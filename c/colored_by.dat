5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that he}} was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

It is unknown whether this version, a hand-colored print struck from a second-generation negative, was <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> Elisabeth Thuillier's lab, but the perforations used imply that the copy was made before 1906. The flag waved during the launching scene in this copy is colored to resemble the flag of Spain, indicating that the hand-colored copy was made for a Spanish exhibitor.|$|E
5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have {{been marked by}} numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with {{detrimental effects on the}} local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson. A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed. Modern politics in Madagascar are <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.|$|E

40|$|The Petersen {{coloring}} of 3 -regular graph G {{is equivalent}} to the normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> five <b>colors.</b> The normal coloring is a good coloring of edges such that every edge and its four neighbours have together three or five different colors. Jaeger conjectures that every bridgeless 3 -regular graph has a Petersen coloring. If the conjecture were true, it would imply other interesting statements about 3 -regular graphs. In this text we investigate normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> more than five colors. Jaeger theorem about nowhere-zero Z 2 3 -flow implies that every bridgeless graph has normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> seven <b>colors.</b> Independently on the Jaeger theorem, we prove the existence of normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> nine <b>colors</b> for graphs with a bridge, a cut of size two or with a triangle. The idea of our proof comes from Andersen's proof of existence of strong <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> ten <b>colors</b> for 3 -regular graphs. Finally, we sketch the idea of the proof for other classes of 3 -regular graphs. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} 2nd-century {{collection of}} Orphic Hymns (second century AD) and the Saturnalia of Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius (fifth century) {{are influenced by}} the theories of rationalism and the syncretizing trends as well. The Orphic Hymns are a set of pre-classical poetic compositions, attributed to Orpheus, himself the subject of a renowned myth. In reality, these poems were probably composed by several different poets, and contain a rich set of clues about prehistoric European mythology. The stated purpose of the Saturnalia is to transmit the Hellenic culture Macrobius has derived from his reading, even though much of his treatment of gods is <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> Egyptian and North African mythology and theology (which also affect the interpretation of Virgil). In Saturnalia reappear mythographical comments influenced by the Euhemerists, the Stoics and the Neoplatonists.|$|E
5|$|An {{assessment}} of his record as the Byzantine Empire's first minister is difficult. Of the few available sources on his career, the Vita Euthymii, compiled years after Zaoutzes's death, is extremely hostile, seeking to pin {{the responsibility for}} several of the reign's failures or unpopular decisions on him, and thus preserve Leo from blame. The account of the Vita is further <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> the fierce rivalry between Zaoutzes and Euthymios, then a synkellos and Leo's spiritual father, over influence on the Byzantine emperor. Thus the Vita accuses Zaoutzes of being responsible for the sacking of the successful general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder from the army, {{as well as for}} the outbreak of hostilities with Bulgaria in 893: allegedly, two of his protégés moved the main market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessalonica and then proceeded to extract exorbitant fees from the Bulgarian merchants. When Leo, at the behest of Zaoutzes, rejected the merchants' protests, the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I found a pretext to attack Byzantium. It has, however, been recently suggested by the scholar Paul Magdalino that the transfer was in fact Leo's initiative, aiming to enrich Thessalonica, whose patron saint, Saint Demetrius, he showed special favor to.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} centuries BCE, {{the worship of}} Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she {{became one of the}} most popular deities in the region. Although this new, {{multicultural}} form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but <b>colored</b> <b>by</b> Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.|$|E
