40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} have assumed {{for years that}} the availability of free-standing water was a primary factor limiting the distribution, productivity, and recruitment of desert ungulates in the southwestern United States. As a result, wildlife management agencies and sportsman's organizations have invested significant time and resources in the construction and maintenance of water <b>catchments</b> for game species, including desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Recently the efficacy of these <b>catchments</b> has been questioned and their use has become controversial. Although water <b>catchments</b> {{have been used as}} a wildlife management tool for decades, very few studies have experimentally examined the influence of these <b>catchments</b> on populations. The objective {{of this study was to}} experimentally examine the influence of water <b>catchments</b> on diet, movement, home range size, mortality, productivity, and recruitment of desert bighorn sheep.

40|$|The {{results from}} seven choice {{modelling}} applications designed to value improved river health in New South Wales are reported. These applications {{were designed to}} provide value estimates that could be used, through benefit transfer, to value improvements in the health of other rivers within the state. Because of limitations {{on the number of}} rivers that could be valued and populations sampled, a pooled model for use in benefit transfer was also estimated. The results indicate that both use and non-use values were found to exist for all <b>catchments.</b> In addition, value estimates were found to differ across <b>catchments</b> when populations resident within <b>catchments</b> were sampled. However, when populations resident outside <b>catchments</b> were sampled for two of these <b>catchments,</b> value estimates were found to be statistically similar. This indicates the importance of valuing improved river health in specific <b>catchments</b> by sampling populations within <b>catchments.</b> Yet, it also indicates that it is less critical to conduct multiple surveys of residents outside <b>catchments</b> to value improved river health.

In this paper, 4 similar <b>catchments</b> in Iran, with high quality rainfall-runoff records, were studied.

40|$|Tracer-aided {{hydrological}} {{models are}} increasingly {{used to reveal}} fundamentals of runoff generation processes and water travel times in <b>catchments.</b> Modelling studies integrating stable water isotopes as tracers are mostly based in temperate and warm climates, leaving <b>catchments</b> with strong snow influences underrepresented in the literature. Such <b>catchments</b> are challenging, as the isotopic tracer signals in water entering the <b>catchments</b> as snowmelt are typically distorted from incoming precipitation due to fractionation processes in seasonal snowpack. We used the Spatially distributed Tracer-Aided Rainfall– Runoff (STARR) model to simulate fluxes, storage, and mixing of water and tracers, as well as estimating water ages in three long-term experimental <b>catchments</b> {{with varying degrees of}} snow influence and contrasting landscape characteristics. In the context of northern <b>catchments</b> the sites have exceptionally long and rich data sets of hydrometric data and – most importantly – stable water isotopes for both rain and snow conditions. To adapt the STARR model for sites with strong snow influence, we used a novel parsimonious calculation scheme that takes into account the isotopic fractionation through snow sublimation and snowmelt. The modified STARR setup simulated the streamflows, isotope ratios, and snow pack dynamics quite well in all three <b>catchments.</b> From this, our simulations indicated contrasting median water ages and water age distributions between <b>catchments</b> brought about mainly by differences in topography and soil characteristics. However, the variable degree of snow influence in <b>catchments</b> also had a major influence on the stream hydrograph, storage dynamics, and water age distributions, which was captured by the model. Our study suggested that snow sublimation fractionation processes can be important to include in tracer-aided modelling for <b>catchments</b> with seasonal snowpack, while the influence of fractionation during snowmelt could not be unequivocally shown. Our work showed the utility of isotopes to provide a proof of concept for our modelling framework in snow-influenced <b>catchments...</b>|$|R

From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards water <b>catchments</b> area has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising water <b>catchments</b> area in Sleman Regency.

5|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} has resided {{with a number of}} legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 <b>catchment</b> areas were established, and a <b>Catchment</b> Board was then created for each one, with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut <b>Catchment</b> Board was created.

Both approaches require an equal degree of calibration and provide similar performances.
