Consequently, the trade in illicit drugs nowadays also occurs on the dark net – {{that part of the}} internet that is intentionally hidden and requires specific privacy enhancing software to gain access. As a result, governments and law enforcement agencies are faced with a new phenomenon. Several scholars and EU reports have called for a new approach. With this thesis, the application of the current European Framework on illicit drugs is applied to three characteristics of the illicit drug trade on the dark net: the lack of borders, its dependency on conventional postal services and the level of anonymity. This study found that the consequences of these characteristics in the field of jurisdiction, <b>controlled</b> <b>deliveries</b> and privacy do not necessarily constitute problems for the application of the current EU Framework on the illicit drug trade on the dark net...|$|E

After 6 weeks, samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-CT and histology. The average bone mineral density and mineralized bone volume fraction were higher with medium- and high-dose PLGA-Zol (30 and 300 µg Zol, respectively) than control and low-dose Zol (3 µg PLGA-Zol; p< 0. 05).
