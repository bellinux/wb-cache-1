50|$|Von Michalewsky {{was born}} in Dahlewitz, a town on the {{outskirts}} of Berlin. After having earned his living as a dock worker, a <b>coffee</b> <b>harvester</b> in the Congo, and a diver in the Mediterranean, he worked as a journalist in the Algerian war, eventually to start writing fictional works in the late 1950s, mostly juvenile novels. He expanded his field to documentary filming and writing of radio drama in the 1960s, an expertise he became very successful at. At {{the end of his life}} he would have more than 500 broadcast radio dramas to his name. In 1969 he was approached by German book publisher Herder to write a science fiction book for juveniles. Despite having no previous experience in the field of science fiction, von Michalewsky's first book in the genre, Bordbuch Delta VII, was an instant success.|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o desempenho de derriçadoras portáteis durante a colheita seletiva e total dos frutos, em dois sistemas de colheita. Foram determinados a carga pendente da planta, a capacidade de derriça, o índice de desfolha, a eficiência de derriça, o índice de frutos verdes no produto, o nível de ruído e o consumo horário e específico de combustível. O sistema de colheita, utilizando-se duas derriçadoras portáteis, simultaneamente na mesma fileira de cafeeiros, apresentou melhor desempenho. A colheita seletiva foi muito influenciada pela porcentagem de frutos maduros e carga pendente do cafeeiro. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the performance of a}} portable <b>coffee</b> <b>harvester</b> to mountain areas. Two procedures were tested: harvesting all fruits in only one operation, and the selective harvesting. Coffee yield, harvesting capacity, index of leaves taken during harvesting process, harvesting efficiency, noise level and fuel consumption were measured. The harvesting system with two portable harvester presented better performance than with only one machine. Selective harvesting was highly influenced by the percentage of ripen fruits and by coffee yield...|$|E
40|$|Dentre as operações {{realizadas}} na colheita do café, a de derriça é considerada a mais complexa, por sua grande influência no custo de colheita, sendo que a mecanização da operação de derriça do café pode ter efeito significativo em redução do custo final da saca de café colhido, além de ser na região do sul de Minas Gerais, um dos sistemas mais utilizados por produtores de pequeno e médio portes, que utilizam, nesta operação, o sistema de derriçadores mecânicos portáteis, o qual pode apresentar rendimento até oito vezes superior ao da colheita manual. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o desempenho operacional de derriçadores mecânicos portáteis utilizados na colheita de café e avaliar o custo operacional do sistema de colheita semi-mecanizado, comparativamente ao sistema de colheita manual. Conclui-se que a colheita de café semi-mecanizada apresentou desempenho operacional superior ao da colheita manual, tornando-se uma alternativa viável para os produtores de pequeno a médio porte, visando minimizar os custos de colheita. In {{the coffee}} harvesting, the harvest {{is considered the}} most complex operation because of its great influence in the harvesting cost therefore, mechanization of the same may have significant effect on reduction of the final cost of the bag of harvested coffee. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the operational performance of portable coffee harvesting machines and to evaluate the operational cost of the semi-mechanized harvest system in comparison to the system of manual harvest. The trials were conducted in five plantation of coffee crop variety Catuaí 74 (IAC 62), under different management conditions. Three models of portable coffee harvesting machines available commercially and in use were evaluated. The experiment was constituted of 20 treatments (combinations of three types of portable coffee harvesting machines plus manual harvest and five types of coffee crop), in a randomized block design. On the basis of obtained results, it may be concluded that the semi-mechanized <b>coffee</b> <b>harvester</b> presented superior operational performance in comparison to manual harvest system, becoming a viable alternative for the small to medium size farmers in order to minimize the production costs...|$|E

40|$|Paraoxonase 1 (PON 1), a {{high-density}} lipoprotein-associated antioxidant enzyme, hydrolyzes several organophosphate {{pesticides and}} oxidized lipids. The PON 1 Q 192 R polymorphism affects the catalytic efficiency {{and is considered}} {{a risk factor for}} pesticide intoxication and cardiovascular disease (CVD) but the association is not consistent between individuals or populations. We aimed to study the association of PON 1 Q 192 R polymorphism with CVD risk in <b>coffee</b> <b>harvesters</b> of central Colombia. Demographics were collected from 205 subjects via standardized questionnaires. Lipid profiles and serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were measured by standard procedures. The calculated 10 -year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk was used as the cardiovascular risk estimate. Q 192 R genotype was determined by real-time PCR. Prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and the 10 -year ASCVD risk was 33 %, 62 %, and 22 %, respectively. BChE levels were no indicative of recent pesticide exposure, although a positive correlation was observed with BChE and hypercholesterolemia. The Q 192 R genotype frequencies were 38 % (QQ), 44 % (QR), and 18 % (RR). We found an association of the 192 Q genotype with hypertension. The results of this study signal the importance to evaluate the influence and potential interactions of BChE and PON 1 192 Q allele with known genetic and environmental factors implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD...|$|R
40|$|Design of an {{agricultural}} machine {{is a highly}} complex process due to interactions between the operator, machine, and environment. Mountain coffee plantations constitute an economic sector that requires huge investments {{for the development of}} agricultural machinery to improve the harvesting and post-harvesting processes and to overcome the scarcity of work forces in the fields. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a preliminary design for a virtual prototype of a <b>coffee</b> fruit <b>harvester.</b> In this study, a project methodology was applied and adapted for the development of the following steps: project planning, informational design, conceptual design, and preliminary design. The construction of a morphological matrix made it possible to obtain a list of different mechanisms with specific functions. The union between these mechanisms resulted in variants, which were weighed to attribute scores for each selected criterion. From each designated proposal, two variants with the best scores were selected and this permitted the preparation of the preliminary design of both variants. The archetype was divided in two parts, namely the hydraulically articulated arms and the harvesting system that consisted of the vibration mechanism and the detachment mechanism. The proposed innovation involves the use of parallel rods, which were fixed in a plane and rectangular metal sheet. In this step, dimensions including a maximum length of 4. 7 m, a minimum length of 3. 3 m, and a total height of 2. 15 m were identified based on the functioning of the harvester in relation to the coupling point of the tractor...|$|R
