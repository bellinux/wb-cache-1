40|$|Abstract: Cancers arise as {{a result}} of {{stepwise}} accumulation of mutations which may occur at the nucleotide level and/or the gross chromosomal level. Many cancers particularly those of the colon display a form of genomic instability which may facilitate and speed up tumor initiation and development. In few instances, a “mutator mutation ” has been clearly implicated in driving the accumulation of other <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations.</b> For example, the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair deficiency results in dramatic increase in insertion/deletion mutations giving rise to the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype and may predispose to a spectrum of tumours when it occurs in the germline. Although many sporadic cancers show multiple mutations suggesting unstable genome, the role of this instability in carcinogenesis, as opposed to the power of natural selection, has been a matter of controversy.

RUNX 2 can interact with cell cycle regulators: cyclin-dependent kinases, pRB and p 21 Cip 1 proteins, as well as the master regulator of the cell cycle, the p 53 tumor suppressor. RUNX 2 is involved in many signaling pathways, including those important for estrogen signaling, which, in turn, are significant for breast carcinogenesis. RUNX 2 can promote breast cancer development through Wnt and Tgfβ signaling pathways, especially in estrogen receptor (ER) -negative cases. ERα interacts directly with RUNX 2 and regulates its activity. Moreover, the ERα gene has a RUNX 2 binding site within its promoter.

But it is also known that UV light absorbed by DNA bases may damage the double helix and lead to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations.</b> 1 The interplay between stability and photodamage depends on the way that the energy of a UV photon is distributed among the electronic excited states of the double helix before it is eliminated as heat. Ultrafast dissipation of the excitation energy is indeed a common property of all the monomeric DNA building blocks: the major part of the excited state population of nucleosides and nucleotides in aqueous solution lives for less than one picosecond. 2, 3 When applied to double helices, composed exclusively of adenine-thymine base pairs (A-T duplexes, both homopolymeric and alternating), femtosecond spectroscopy reveals a different picture: organization of the bases within duplexes causes an overall lengthening of the excited state lifetimes. 4 - 9 This is due to the emergence of new excited states, shared between at least two bases.

Mammalian cells hence have various mechanisms to eliminate 8 -oxoGua in DNA and nucleotide pools. Since MutT-related enzymes, MTH 1 and NUDT 5, can hydrolyze 8 -oxoGua-containing nucleotides in nucleotide pools, the expressions of MTH 1 and NUDT 5 are likely to be involved in controlling oxidation-induced carcinogenesis. In the present study, we examined the expressions of 8 -oxoGua, MTH 1, and NUDT 5 in human normal keratinocytes and human oral squamous carcinoma cells treated with H 2 O 2. Principal resultsThe immunofluorescent study demonstrated that the localization of 8 -oxo-dGTP changed from cytoplasm to nucleus in the treatment with H 2 O 2 in both cell types. The Western blotting analysis as well as RT-PCR revealed that H 2 O 2 enhanced the expression of NUDT 5, but not MTH 1, in normal keratinocytes. The increased NUDT 5 proteins were also detected in the nuclear extracts of keratinocytes treated with H 2 O 2. In contrast, H 2 O 2 had no effects on the expressions of NUDT 5 and MTH 1 in squamous carcinoma cells. Major conclusionsNUDT 5 may thus be involved in preventing <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations</b> in keratinocytes under oxidative stress, and its impaired expression may promote their carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} genome stability, {{cells with}} damaged DNA must arrest to allow repair of mutations before replication. Although several key components required to elicit this arrest have been discovered, {{much of the}} pathway remains elusive. Here we report that pRB acts as a central mediator of the proliferative block induced by a diverse range of DNA damaging stimuli. Rb−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts are defective in arrest after γ-irradiation, UV irradiation, and treatment {{with a variety of}} chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast, the pRB related proteins p 107 and p 130 do not play an essential part in the DNA damage response. pRB is required specifically for the G 1 /S phase checkpoint induced by γ-irradiation. Despite a defect in G 1 /S phase arrest, levels of p 53 and p 21 are increased normally in Rb−/− cells in response to γ-irradiation. These results lead us to propose a model in which pRB acts as an essential downstream target of the DNA damage-induced arrest pathway. The ability of pRB to prevent replication of damaged DNA is likely to inhibit the propagation of <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations</b> and may therefore contribute to its role as a tumor suppressor.

Results: Tissue biopsies were taken during colonoscopies of 77 patients at 4 different risk levels for colon cancer, including 19 patients who had never had colonic neoplasia (who served as controls).

40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: Tumors {{that develop}} in {{patients}} with Crohn's disease tend be multifocal, so field cancerization (the replacement of normal cells with nondysplastic but tumorigenic clones) might contribute to intestinal carcinogenesis. We investigated patterns of tumor development from pretumor intestinal cell clones. METHODS: We performed genetic analyses of multiple areas of intestine from 10 patients with Crohn's disease and intestinal neoplasia. Two patients had multifocal neoplasia; longitudinal sections were collected from 3 patients. Individual crypts were microdissected and genotyped; clonal dependency {{analysis was used to}} determine the order and timing of mutations that led to tumor development. RESULTS: The same mutations in KRAS, CDKN 2 A(p 16), and TP 53 that were observed in neoplasias were also present in nontumor, nondysplastic, and dysplastic epithelium. In 2 patients, <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations</b> were detected in nontumor epithelium 4 years before tumors developed. The same mutation (TP 53 p. R 248 W) was detected at multiple sites along {{the entire length of the}} colon from 1 patient; it was the apparent founder mutation for synchronous tumors and multiple dysplastic areas. Disruption of TP 53, CDKN 2 A, and KRAS were all seen as possible initial events in tumorigenesis; the sequence of mutations (the tumor development pathway) differed among lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Pretumor clones can grow extensively in the intestinal epithelium of patients with Crohn's disease.

Conventional genetic {{theories}} {{have failed to}} explain why cancer (1) is not heritable and thus extremely rare in newborns, (2) is caused by non-mutagenic carcinogens, (3) develops only years to decades after initiation by carcinogens, (4) follows pre-neoplastic aneuploidy, (5) is aneuploid, (6) is chromosomally and phenotypically “unstable”, (7) carries specific aneusomies, (8) generates much more complex phenotypes than conventional mutation such as multidrug resistance, (9) generates nonselective phenotypes such as metastasis (no benefit at native site) and “immortality ” (not necessary for tumorigenesis), and (10) does not contain <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations.</b> We propose, instead, that cancer is a chromosomal disease. Accordingly carcinogenesis is initiated by random aneuploidies, which are induced by carcinogens or spontaneously. Since aneuploidy unbalances 1000 s of genes, it corrupts teams of proteins that segregate, synthesize and repair chromosomes. Aneuploidy is therefore a steady source of chromosomal variations from which, in classical Darwinian terms, selection encourages the evolution and malignant progression of cancer cells. The rates of specific chromosomal variations can exceed conventional mutations by 4 – 11 orders of magnitude, depending on the degrees of aneuploidy. Based on their chromosomal constitution cancer cells are new cell “species ” with specific aneusomies, but unstable karyotypes. The cancer-specific aneusomies generate complex, malignant phenotypes through the abnormal dosages of 1000 s of genes, just as trisomy 21 generates Down syndrome. In sum, cancer is caused by chromosomal disorganization, which increases karyotypic entropy. Thus, cancer is a chromosomal rather than a genetic disease. The chromosomal theory explains (1) non-heritable cancer because aneuploidy is not heritable, (2) non-mutagenic carcinogens a...|$|R

Structural design of these probes to specifically recognize O 6 -alkylguanine adducts requires an understanding of chemical and sequence related factors involved in base-pair interactions. We have evaluated thermal stabilities of duplex combinations containing structurally varied synthetic nucleosides paired with O 6 -alkylated DNA adducts. Influence of base structure, modified base pair position and/or neighboring base identity on stability of modified duplexes has been evaluated. Data indicate that favorable H-bonding rather than inter-strand stacking interactions dictate the stabilities of the modified base pairs. To understand the molecular basis of modified base pairing, oligonucleotides harboring site-specifically incorporated base pairs containing synthetic nucleoside probe Per were synthesized and subjected to NMR and X-ray crystallography analysis.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of how DNA mutations are fixed within the human gastrointestinal tract {{and how they}} spread are poorly understood and are hotly debated. It {{has been well documented}} that human colonic crypts are clonal units; one epithelial stem cell within the crypt becoming dominant and taking over the crypts' entire stem cell population [...] so called monoclonal conversion. Studies have revealed that crypts can exist as families and develop into patches. The questions have been how do such patches in the human colon develop? Does this have implications on how DNA mutations spread? We have previously shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, which result in the deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase, are established within a single colonic crypt stem cell, resulting in a crypt with a mixed phenotype. Over time that mutated stem cell can take over the entire stem cell population resulting in a wholly-mutated crypt. We have furthered this research by showing that entirely cytochrome c oxidase-deficient crypts are able to divide by a process called crypt fission, to form two cytochrome c oxidase-deficient daughter crypts, each sharing the exact parental mtDNA mutation. Furthermore, patches of these crypts also possess a founder mtDNA mutation suggesting that fission repeats itself to form patches, which increase in size with age. Here, we hypothesize that this can be expanded into other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the stomach, where there is a paucity of data regarding clonality and the spread of DNA mutations. We ask if these mutated crypts expand at a different rate to wild type ones. We also discuss the implications for the spread of potential <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations</b> within the gut...|$|R
40|$|Conventional genetic {{theories}} {{have failed to}} explain why cancer (1) is not heritable and thus extremely rare in newborns, (2) is caused by non-mutagenic carcinogens, (3) develops only years to decades after initiation by carcinogens, (4) follows pre-neoplastic aneuploidy, (5) is aneuploid, (6) is chromosomally and phenotypically “unstable”, (7) carries specific aneusomies, (8) generates much more complex phenotypes than conventional mutation such as multidrug resistance, (9) generates nonselective phenotypes such as metastasis (no benefit at native site) and “immortality” (not necessary for tumorigenesis), and (10) does not contain <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations.</b> We propose, instead, that cancer is a chromosomal disease. Accordingly carcinogenesis is initiated by random aneuploidies, which are induced by carcinogens or spontaneously. Since aneuploidy unbalances 1000 s of genes, it corrupts teams of proteins that segregate, synthesize and repair chromosomes. Aneuploidy is therefore a steady source of chromosomal variations from which, in classical Darwinian terms, selection encourages the evolution and malignant progression of cancer cells. The rates of specific chromosomal variations can exceed conventional mutations by 4 – 11 orders of magnitude, depending on the degrees of aneuploidy. Based on their chromosomal constitution cancer cells are new cell “species” with specific aneusomies, but unstable karyotypes. The cancer-specific aneusomies generate complex, malignant phenotypes through the abnormal dosages of 1000 s of genes, just as trisomy 21 generates Down syndrome. In sum, cancer is caused by chromosomal disorganization, which increases karyotypic entropy. Thus, cancer is a chromosomal rather than a genetic disease. The chromosomal theory explains (1) non-heritable cancer because aneuploidy is not heritable, (2) non-mutagenic carcinogens as aneuploidogens, (3) long neoplastic latencies by the low probability of evolving new species, (4) nonselective phenotypes via genes hitchhiking with selective chromosomes, and (5) immortality because, through their cellular heterogeneity, cancers survive negative mutations and cytotoxic drugs via resistant subspecies...|$|R
40|$|Senescence is a {{permanent}} withdrawal from cell cycle that occurs naturally in cells {{in response to the}} shortening of telomeres. This natural 2 ̆ 2 clock 2 ̆ 2 serves {{to limit the number of}} cell divisions and therefore protects the cell from potentially <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations.</b> However, senescence also occurs in response to external stresses to the cell, which is known as induced senescence. This study compares the mechanisms of natural senescence, a response to the shortening of telomeres during replication, with induced senescence by using various drugs to induce senescence: 5 -aza- 2 -deoxycytidine (a demethylating agent), Adriamycin (a chemotherapeutic drug), and H 2 O 2 (an agent causing oxidative stress). MDAH 041 cells, which are fibroblasts isolated from a patient with Li Fraumeni Syndrome, have heterozygous alleles of p 53 and can therefore undergo natural senescence with serial cell culture or at a low frequency spontaneously immortalize once the wildtype copy of p 53 is lost. Therefore, this cell model provides naturally senescent cells as well as immortal cells which can be treated with the aforementioned drugs resulting in induced senescence. Using these conditions, gene expression profiling was performed. Gene expression analysis revealed 48 genes differentially expressed in all 4 senescence types compared to the immortal control. Pathway analysis of these 48 genes from all types of cellular senescence revealed several pathways, each of which are involved in innate immunity, showing for the first time a common gene expression profile among different types of senescence, as well as a central role for the IFN pathway in both natural and induced senescence. Specifically, I have focused on the IL 1 pathway which is up-regulated in all types of senescence compared to immortal proliferating cells and will be the basis for additional mechanistic studies...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{grafting}} hematopoietic stemcells from solid organs {{has emerged}} as apromising concept in autologous trans-plantation settings in onco-hematology. The rationale is that contamination by malignant stem cells could be avoided provided that multipotent stem cells residing outside bone marrow are preserved from <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutation(s)</b> {{as a consequence of}} early embry-onic divergence. Liver could be a valuable can-didate in this context because hematopoiesis and hepatic development share common stages. 1 The hematopoietic potential of adult liver cells has been described by a few teams. 2 - 6 However, there is still controversy about the origin of the stem cells responsible and the underlying mechanisms. The hematopoietic activity of adult liver cells could be related to circulating hemato poietic stem cells, which reside in the liver but that have come from bone marrow (BM). Con sistent with this hypothesis, Uchida et al. 5 reported that mouse liver contains a spectrum of hematopoietic cells that are phenotypically and functionally similar to those of marrow; Kotton et al. sug-gested that the hematopoietic activity is restricted to CD 45 -positive side population cells. 6 Alternatively, hematopoietic activity of adult liver could be explained by adult stem cell plasticity, a concept that has been introduced to explain the capacity of resident tissue stem cells to recapitulate the ontogeny of other tis-sues. 7 Unfortunately, as a general concern, ini-tial enthusiastic descriptions of plasticity in mice have not been confirmed in large animal models. Thus, there is still a need to character-ize human liver stem cells and to compare their functionality with that of BM hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Our team has suggested a non-hematopoietic origin for liver stem cells with in vitro hematopoietic poten-tial [...] 8 The present study was aimed at clarify-ing some of these points. Hepatic mononu-clear cells (HMNC) were first transplanted alone. Then, based on studies from our group and others, 9, 10 we tested the putative enhanc-ing effect of co-grafting liver cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) ...|$|R

To enhance flavor or improve preservation meat is treated by salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to create {{processed meat}}. Nitrates and nitrites found in processed meat (e.g. bacon, ham, salami, pepperoni, hot dogs, and some sausages) can be converted by the human body into nitrosamines that can be <b>carcinogenic,</b> causing <b>mutation</b> in the colorectal cell line, thereby causing tumorigenesis and eventually leading to cancer. In its Press Release 240 (16 Oct. 2015) the International Agency for Research on Cancer, based on a review of 800 studies over 20 years, concluded that processed meat is definitely carcinogenic (Group 1) and found that for each additional 50g of processed meat consumed per day, the risk of colorectal cancer increased by 18% (up {{to a maximum of}} approximately 140g); it also found that there appeared to be an increase in gastric cancer but this was not as clear.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cancers often arise {{within an}} area of cells (e. g. an {{epithelial}} patch) that is predisposed {{to the development of}} cancer, i. e. a "field of cancerization" or "field defect. " Sporadic colon cancer is characterized by an elevated mutation rate and genomic instability. If a field defect were deficient in DNA repair, DNA damages would tend to escape repair and give rise to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>mutations.</b> Purpose To determine whether reduced expression of DNA repair proteins Pms 2, Ercc 1 and Xpf (pairing partner of Ercc 1) are early steps in progression to colon cancer. Results Tissue biopsies were taken during colonoscopies of 77 patients at 4 different risk levels for colon cancer, including 19 patients who had never had colonic neoplasia (who served as controls). In addition, 158 tissue samples were taken from tissues near or within colon cancers removed by resection and 16 tissue samples were taken near tubulovillous adenomas (TVAs) removed by resection. 568 triplicate tissue sections (a total of 1, 704 tissue sections) from these tissue samples were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for 4 DNA repair proteins. Substantially reduced protein expression of Pms 2, Ercc 1 and Xpf occurred in field defects of up to 10 cm longitudinally distant from colon cancers or TVAs and within colon cancers. Expression of another DNA repair protein, Ku 86, was infrequently reduced in these areas. When Pms 2, Ercc 1 or Xpf were reduced in protein expression, then either {{one or both of the}} other two proteins most often had reduced protein expression as well. The mean inner colon circumferences, from 32 resections, of the ascending, transverse and descending/sigmoid areas were measured as 6. 6 cm, 5. 8 cm and 6. 3 cm, respectively. When combined with other measurements in the literature, this indicates the approximate mean number of colonic crypts in humans is 10 million. Conclusions The substantial deficiencies in protein expression of DNA repair proteins Pms 2, Ercc 1 and Xpf in about 1 million crypts near cancers and TVAs suggests that the tumors arose in field defects that were deficient in DNA repair and that deficiencies in Pms 2, Ercc 1 and Xpf are early steps, often occurring together, in progression to colon cancer. </p...|$|R
