Herein we characterise novel targets of doxycycline describing the structural background supporting its effectiveness as a neuroprotector at subantibiotic doses. Our results show that doxycycline reshapes α-synuclein oligomers into off-pathway, high-molecular-weight species that do not evolve into fibrils. Off-pathway species present less hydrophobic surface than on-pathway oligomers and display different β-sheet structural arrangement. These structural changes affect the α-synuclein ability to destabilize biological membranes, cell viability, and formation of additional toxic species. Altogether, these mechanisms could act synergically giving novel targets for repurposing this drug...|$|R

We have identified an apical-basal polarity gene crumbs (crb) as a genetic modifier of Ab 42 -mediated-neuropathology. Misexpression of Ab 42 caused upregulation of Crb expression, whereas downregulation of Crb either by RNAi or null allele approach rescued the Ab 42 -mediated-neurodegeneration. Co-expression of full length Crb with Ab 42 increased severity of Ab 42 -mediated-neurodegeneration, due to three fold induction of cell death in comparison to the wild type. Higher Crb levels affect axonal targeting from the retina to the brain. The structure function analysis identified intracellular domain of Crb to be required for Ab 42 -mediated-neurodegeneration.

40|$|Concrete is {{basically}} a mixture of two components: aggregates and paste. The paste, comprised of Portland cement and water, binds the aggregates (usually sand and gravel or crushed stone) into a rocklike mass as the paste hardens because of the chemical reaction of the cement and water. In our society today some of the cement brands that are being sold are not up to standard {{and this may be}} traced to negligence {{on the part of the}} manufacturers by paying very little attention to the quality and also the regulatory body does not put strict measures to enforce the required standard. This problem has led to the production of poor quality concrete that increases the risk of collapse of building structures. This research determined the cement brands that have the highest compressive strength to enhance the quality and durability of the structures being built in the country. Different brands of Portland cement were used to produce concrete varying with 1 : 2 : 4 and 1 : 3 : 6 mix ratio respectively with a <b>curing</b> <b>date</b> of 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days respectively. No additive was used in any of the mix. The tests carried out include slump test at its fresh state while compressive strength was carried out for the hardened concrete, also the vicat test was carried out on the cement brands to determine the setting time. Compressive strength at 28 days showed that Dangote 3 X cement produced 25. 27 N/mm 2, Ibeto cement 38. 89 N/mm 2, Purechem cement 24. 58 N/mm 2, Unichem cement 21. 16 N/mm 2 and Elephant cement 27. 9 N/mm 2 for 1 : 2 : 4 mix ratio respectively.

Migrating GBM cells seem to be less prone to resist autophagy (Type II programmed cell death), and disruption of the pathway controlled by mTOR induces marked autophagic processes in GBM cells. Temozolomide is the most efficacious cytotoxic drug employed today to combat glioblastoma, and this drug exerts its cytotoxic activity through proautophagic processes.

In as many as 35 - 50 % of the AD patients symptoms of circadian rhythm disturbances are observed. These symptoms, rather than the cognitive decline, are often the primary cause of institutionalization. The relationship between AD and circadian rhythms is complex. The neurodegenerative processes specific to AD alter several aspects of the circadian timing system, which explains the circadian rhythm disturbances. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that circadian rhythms and sleep affect AD pathology. Currently prescribed drugs are only minimally effective and are associated with a lot of side effects. Interventions based on chronobiological principles offer an interesting and attractive alternative for improving circadian rhythm disturbances in AD patients.

40|$|Background: Decentralization of DOTS has {{increased}} the number of cured smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients. However, the rate of recurrence {{has increased}} mainly due to HIV infection. Recurrence rate could be taken as an important measure of long-term success of TB treatment. We aimed to find out the rate of recurrence in smear-positive patients cured under DOTS in southern Ethiopia. Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study on cured smear-positive TB patients who were treated from 1998 to 2006. Recurrence of smear-positive TB was used as an outcome measure. Person-years of observation (PYO) were calculated per 100 PYO from the <b>date</b> of <b>cure</b> to <b>date</b> of interview. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression methods were used to determine the survival and the hazard ratio (HR). Results: 368 cured smear-positive TB patients which were followed for 1463 person-years. Of these, 187 patients (50. 8 %) were men, 277 patients (75. 5 %) were married, 157 (44. 2 %) were illiterate, and 152 patients (41. 3 %) were farmers. 15 of 368 smear-positive patients had recurrence. The rate of recurrence was 1 per 100 PYO (0. 01 per annum). Recurrence was not associated with age, sex, occupation, marital status and level of education. Conclusion: High recurrence rate occurred among smear-positive patients cured under DOTS. Further studies are required to identify factors contributing to high recurrence rates to improve disease free survival of TB patients after treatment...|$|R
40|$|Galectins form {{a family}} of carbohydrate-binding {{proteins}} defined by their affinity for beta-galactosides containing glycoconjugates. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) {{is responsible for the}} specificity of galectins for saccharides. This binding may result in modulated cell proliferation, cell death and cell migration, three processes that are intimately involved in cancer initiation and progression. Galectins can also display protein-protein types of interactions with their binding partners. Certain galectins directly involved in cancer progression seem to be promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cancer. Indeed, migrating cancer cells resistant to apoptosis still constitute the principal target for the cytotoxic drugs used to treat cancer patients. Reducing the levels of migration in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells can restore certain levels of sensitivity to apoptosis (and so to pro-apoptotic drugs) in restricted-migration cancer cells. Anti-galectin agents can restrict the levels of migration of several types of cancer cell and should therefore be used in association with cytotoxic drugs to combat metastatic cancer. We provide experimental proof in support of this concept. While the present review focuses on various experimental strategies to impair cancer progression by targeting certain types of galectins, it pays particular attention to glioblastomas, which constitute the ultimate level of malignancy in primary brain tumors. Glioblastomas form {{the most common type of}} malignant brain tumor in children and adults, and no glioblastoma patient has been <b>cured</b> to <b>date.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

With contemporary improved risk assessment, chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and supportive care, approximately 80 % of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 50 % of those with myeloid neoplasm can be <b>cured</b> to <b>date.</b> Current emphasis is placed not only on increased cure rate but also on improved quality of life. In Section I, Dr. Ching-Hon Pui describes certain clinical and biologic features that still have prognostic and therapeutic relevance in the context of contemporary treatment programs. He emphasizes that treatment failure in some patients is not due to intrinsic drug resistance of leukemic cells but is rather caused by subopti-mal drug dosing due to host compliance, phar-macodynamics, and pharmacogenetics. Hence, measurement of minimal residual disease, which accounts for both the genetic (primary and secondary) features of leukemic lymphoblasts and pharmacogenomic variables of the host, is the most reliable prognostic indicator. Finally, he contends that with optimal risk-directed systemic and intrathecal therapy, cranial irradiation may be omitted in all patients, regardless of the presenting features. In Section II, Dr. Martin Schrappe performs detailed analyses of the prognostic impact of presenting age, leukocyte count, sex, immunophenotype, genetic abnormality, early treatment response, and in vitro drug sensitivity/ resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on the large database of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster consortium.

Case presentation We report a 44 -year-old Caucasian female presenting with remarkable circumscribed, erythematous to skin-coloured, indurated skin eruptions at the forehead, arms, shoulders, legs and the gluteal region. Routine histology and Alcian blue labelling confirmed a massive deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides. Immunohistochemical investigations revealed proliferating fibroblasts and a discrete lymphocytic infiltration as well as increased dermal expression of MIB- 1 + and anti-mastcell-tryptase + cells. Bone marrow biopsies confirmed a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance without morphological characteristics of plasmocytoma; immunofixation unveiled the presence of IgG-kappa paraproteins. Conclusions Taking all data into account, our patient exhibited a complex form of lichen mxyoedematosus, which could most likely be linked a variant of scleromyxoedema. Experimental treatment with methotrexate resulted in a stabilisation of clinical symptoms but no improvement after five months of therapy. A subsequent therapeutic attempt by the use of medium-dose ultraviolet A 1 cold-light photomonotherapy led to a further stabilisation of clinical symptoms, but could not induce a sustained amelioration of skin condition. </p...|$|R

Cassia tora, Calendula officinalis and Momordica charantia {{are well known}} plants in Asia including India which posses wide range of pharmacological activities. These drugs {{have been used in}} India as  folk remedy in the form of decoctions and infusions to treat bacterial infections and also claimed to be an effective against variety of skin conditions like psoriasis, acne, wounds etc. The present investigation was carried out to study the unexplored area of these drugs towards their antibacterial activity with respect to their traditional use as antipsoriatic agents. The herbs were subjected to successive extraction using different solvents and the extracts were subjected to antibacterial evaluation against both gram positive and gram negative organisms by cup plate technique. Among the various extracts, aqueous extracts were found to be more effective against all the bacteria. Staphyllococcus aureus was more susceptible to the aqueous extracts among the tested organisms.   Industrial relevance : The selected herbs have been used traditionally for treating skin diseases like psoriasis, {{for which there is no}} complete <b>cure</b> till <b>date.</b> Though exact mechanism of these herbs for their effectiveness in psoriasis is not understood, according to American academy of dermatology antibacterial therapy could also be used for treating psoriasis. In view of this study of antibacterial activity was carried out. Among the various extracts, aqueous extracts exhibited highest activity especially against S. aureus which has been one of the organisms which aggravate conditions like psoriasis. As the aqueous extracts have shown excellent activity, these extracts could be formulated individually or in combination as external or internal dosage forms. In this regard there is great scope for developing new herbal formulation for treating psoriasis using the above said herbal combination.   Further scope exists for research with formulation and development, pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy in patients (clinical trial). This kind of study could generate more such ideas for re-inventing and using herbs in combination to treat many more diseases. </p...|$|R
