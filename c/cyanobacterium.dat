The oil shale is located in a single calcareous layer 2.5–3meters in thickness and is buried at depths from 7 to 100m. The total area of the basin is about 3,000km2. Oil yield from Kukersite is 30 to 47%. Most of the organic matter is derived from the fossil green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, which has affinities to the modern <b>cyanobacterium,</b> Entophysalis major, an extant species that forms algal mats in inter-tidal to very shallow subtidal waters. Matrix minerals include low-magnesium calcite, dolomite, and siliciclastic minerals. It is not enriched in heavy metals.|$|E

Additionally, perspective studies of <b>cyanobacteria</b> recruitment in lakes were pointed out. In light of the existing knowledge, <b>cyanobacteria</b> recruitment could be regarded as a process that benthic overwintering <b>cyanobacteria</b> migrated to the pelagic phase after germination and growth renewal under suitable conditions. This process was divided into three consecutive phases: germination, a potential growth phase and migration to the pelagic phase. Previous studies mostly focused on the migration from sediments to water. To date, several kinds of traps had been designed to investigate <b>cyanobacteria</b> recruitment.

25|$|The theory {{suggests}} that an anaerobic cell probably ingested an aerobic bacterium but failed to digest it. The aerobic bacterium flourished within the cell because the cell's cytoplasm was abundant in half-digested food molecules. The bacterium digested these molecules with oxygen and gained great amounts of energy. Because the bacterium had so much energy, it probably leaked some of it as adenosine triphosphate into the cell's cytoplasm. This benefited the anaerobic cell because it was now able to breathe aerobically, which means more potential for energy gain. Eventually, the aerobic bacterium could no longer live independently from the cell, and it, therefore, became a mitochondrion. The origin of the chloroplast {{is very similar to}} that of the mitochondrion. A cell must have captured a photosynthetic <b>cyanobacterium</b> and failed to digest it. The <b>cyanobacterium</b> thrived in the cell and eventually evolved into the first chloroplast. Other eukaryotic organelles may have also evolved through endosymbiosis; it has been proposed that cilia, flagella, centrioles, and microtubules may have originated from a symbiosis between a Spirochaete bacterium and an early eukaryotic cell, but this is not widely accepted among biologists.|$|E
25|$|While primary chloroplasts have {{a double}} {{membrane}} from their cyanobacterial ancestor, secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, {{as a result of}} the secondary endosymbiotic event, when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the <b>cyanobacterium</b> at the beginning of this story. The engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus, forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes—the two cyanobacterial membranes, sometimes the eaten alga's cell membrane, and the phagosomal vacuole from the host's cell membrane.|$|E
