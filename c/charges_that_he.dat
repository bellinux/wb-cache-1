5|$|After the {{fighting}} in Normandy, Model established his headquarters at Oosterbeek, near Arnhem in the Netherlands, where he set about the massive task of rebuilding Army Group B. On 17 August 1944, Model {{was appointed to the}} temporary command of OB West, upon Kluge's recall to Berlin to answer <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had involvement with the failed July 20 plot (Kluge would commit suicide en route). Model retained command of OB West for eighteen days before Hitler appointed Gerd von Rundstedt as permanent replacement for Kluge, allowing Model to return to the command of Army Group B.|$|E

Gravel denied later press <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships. As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees and feuded with Alaska State Senate president Robert J. McNealy.|$|E
5|$|In {{a highly}} publicized scandal, Beecher was tried on <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{committed}} adultery with a friend's wife, Elizabeth Tilton.

At the same session, Mihretab was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a 1,000 Birr fine, along {{with a number of}} their friends and relatives who heard their sentences at the same time.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} for assisting Zangi, the Abbasid authorities sought punitive measures against Ayyub. Simultaneously, {{in a separate}} incident, Shirkuh killed a close confidant of Bihruz on <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had sexually assaulted a woman in Tikrit. The Abbasid court issued arrest warrants for both Ayyub and Shirkuh, but before the brothers could be arrested, they departed Tikrit for Mosul in 1138. When they arrived in Mosul, Zangi provided them with all the facilities they needed and he recruited the two brothers into his service. Ayyub was made commander of Ba'albek and Shirkuh entered the service of Zangi's son, Nur ad-Din. According to historian Abdul Ali, it was under the care and patronage of Zangi that the Ayyubid family rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, who was Bishop of Winchester and papal legate in England, {{called an}} ecclesiastical council at Winchester on 29 August 1139, and summoned the king to answer <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had unlawfully arrested clergy. The king refused to attend, {{and sent a}} {{representative}} instead. After meeting for a few days, the council was dismissed on 1 September without deciding anything except {{to appeal to the}} pope in Rome. In the end, the appeal never reached Rome. Part of the problem confronting the assembled bishops was that Stephen had not expelled Roger's family from their ecclesiastical offices, merely their secular ones. Stephen's representatives argued that the bishops had given up their castles and money voluntarily to avoid secular charges. The defence taken by the king was not novel; it had been used before by William I and William II against Odo of Bayeux and William de St-Calais, respectively.|$|E

The Flames ended October with {{consecutive}} home losses, to the Colorado Avalanche and Washington Capitals, in which they surrendered two-goal leads in both. The team entered November {{in the midst of}} a streak where they lost six of seven games. During the slump, rookie forward Brett Sutter was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> assaulted a cab driver. Sutter apologized for the incident and his teammates issued a release expressing support, but he was demoted to Abbotsford a few days later. He was subsequently traded to the Carolina Hurricanes along with Ian White in exchange for defenceman Anton Babchuk and forward Tom Kostopoulos in a deal that was being discussed by the two teams prior to Sutter's legal troubles.|$|E
5|$|Maulay {{remained}} in office {{under the new}} king, Henry III, who succeeded to the throne in late 1216. While at Corfe, he had custody of William of Lancaster, who had been captured by the royalist side at Rochester in 1215. Ranulf de Blondeville, the Earl of Chester, attempted to secure William's freedom but was rebuffed by Maulay, leading the earl to threaten to depart England and the king's cause and go on crusade. In early 1217 Maulay was ordered by the regent, William Marshal, to surrender control of Sherborne Castle and Somerset to William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, to help secure the return of Longespee to the royal cause. But Maulay refused to do so. In October 1217, Maulay was summoned to the royal court to answer <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had waged a private war against the earl over control of Somerset, {{and that he had}} broken a truce that had held between the two men. The dispute was finally solved in February 1218 when Maulay was confirmed by the regent as custodian of Sherborne Castle and in the office of Sheriff of Somerset. Maulay compensated Longespee for his loss with a payment of 500 pounds, and a further payment of 1000 pounds by the government and custody of a royal ward.|$|E
