5|$|Traditionally, Ireland is {{subdivided}} into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In {{a system that}} developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these <b>counties</b> <b>are</b> in the Republic of Ireland and six are in Northern Ireland.

5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe <b>counties</b> <b>are</b> in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E
5|$|Eleven other {{historical}} {{counties have}} existed in Massachusetts, most becoming defunct when their lands were {{absorbed into the}} colony of New Hampshire or the state of Maine, {{both of which were}} created out of territory originally claimed by Massachusetts colonists. The oldest counties still in Massachusetts are Essex County, Middlesex County, and Suffolk County, created in 1643 with the original Norfolk County which was absorbed by New Hampshire and bears no relation to the modern Norfolk County. When these counties were created, they were a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which would remain separate from the Plymouth Colony and that colony's counties until 1691. Hampden County, created in 1812, is the most recently created county still in Massachusetts, although Penobscot County, Maine bore that distinction until Maine broke off from Massachusetts in 1820. The majority of Massachusetts <b>counties</b> <b>are</b> named in honor of English place names, reflecting Massachusetts' colonial heritage.|$|E
25|$|What {{remained}} of Albany County in 1774 {{became the most}} populated county in the state {{with a population of}} 42,921 and it continued to be the most populous county until at least 1790, when the population was 75,921. Albany lost population as new <b>counties</b> <b>were</b> created from within: Columbia <b>County</b> <b>was</b> created in 1786; Rensselaer and Saratoga <b>counties</b> <b>were</b> formed in 1791; Schoharie <b>County</b> <b>was</b> created in 1795 from parts of both Albany and Otsego <b>counties</b> (Otsego having <b>been</b> created from part of Montgomery County in 1791); Greene <b>County</b> <b>was</b> formed in 1800 from parts of both Albany and Ulster counties; Schenectady <b>County</b> <b>was</b> created in 1809; and Warren <b>County</b> <b>was</b> formed in 1813 from Washington <b>County.</b> Fulton <b>County</b> <b>was</b> the last <b>county</b> in the Capital District to be formed.

5|$|Five of the state's <b>counties</b> <b>are</b> wholly {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
5|$|Harrison County {{is located}} in the far {{southern}} part of Indiana, about halfway between the state's east and west borders. The Ohio River defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of Kentucky and the city of Louisville. The Blue River runs along the county's western border. Six <b>counties</b> <b>are</b> adjacent to Harrison County. Three are in Indiana: Washington County to the north, Floyd County to the east, and Crawford County to the west. The other three are in Kentucky: Jefferson County and Hardin County are to the southeast and Meade County is to the south.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey was {{governed by}} {{two groups of}} proprietors as two {{distinct}} provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey, between 1674 and 1702. New Jersey's first counties were created as administrative districts within each province, with East Jersey split in 1675 into Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth counties, while West Jersey's initial counties of Burlington and Salem date to 1681. The most recent county created in New Jersey is Union County, created in 1857 and named after the union of the United States when the Civil War was imminent. New Jersey's county names derive from several sources, though most of its <b>counties</b> <b>are</b> named after place names in England and prominent leaders in the colonial and revolutionary periods. Bergen County is the most populous county—as of the 2010 Census—with 905,116 people, while Salem County is the least populous with 66,083 people.|$|E
