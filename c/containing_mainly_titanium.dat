In the process an atmosphere containing oxygen is generated in the chamber while material (3) <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>titanium</b> is evaporated by an electron beam (5). Deposition is reinforced by a plasma generated {{on the surface of}} the cathode material (5) and evaporated by an arc discharge. The coating rate is at least 20 nm/s. The temperature is maintained at 100 - 500 deg. C during deposition. The titanium oxide layer is deposited primarily as an anatase phase, and in crystalline form. USE - Used for the application of a photocatalytic titanium oxide coating to a self-cleaning object, e. g. a window. ADVANTAGE - The coating application rate is faster and has better photocatalytic performance than prior art...|$|E

40|$|NiTi was surface {{treated by}} laser {{oxidation}} for improving corrosion resistance. While the corrosion behavior of laser oxidized NiTi is reported elsewhere, {{the present study}} aims at characterizing the oxide film formed in laser oxidation by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area diffraction (SAD). The naturally formed (NF) oxide film on a mechanically polished substrate {{is included in the}} study for comparison with the laser formed (LF) oxide film. The LF oxide film on NiTi carries a golden-yellowish interference color, and has a thickness of about 25 nm versus a thickness of 5 nm for the NF film, as determined by TEM or estimated from XPS depth profiling. The average surface roughness Ra increases from 1. 02 nm for the NF oxide film to 13. 1 nm for the LF oxide film. XPS analysis shows a surface Ni/Ti atomic ratio of 0. 17 for laser oxidized samples, which is lower than that of 0. 30 for mechanically polished samples. Depth profiling of composition by XPS reveals that the LF oxide film <b>contains</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>titanium</b> oxides, together {{with a small amount of}} Ni in oxidized and metallic states. The oxidation state of Ti changes from Ti 4 + (corresponding to TiO 2) in the top layer of the LF oxide film to lower oxidation states Ti 3 + and Ti 2 + (corresponding to Ti 2 O 3 and TiO). The LF film is composed of nanocrystallites, as evidenced from SAD patterns. High-resolution TEM image shows that the crystallite size in the LF oxide film is about 10 nm. These findings show clearly that laser oxidation significantly changes the characteristics of the oxide film on NiTi and also provide an explanation for the improvement in surface properties due to laser oxidation.

40|$|This study {{represents}} {{the most extensive}} analysis of batch-to-batch variations in spray paint samples to date. The survey was performed as a collaborative project of the ENFSI (European Network of Forensic Science Institutes) Paint and Glass Working Group (EPG) and involved 11 laboratories. Several studies have already shown that paint samples of similar color but from different manufacturers can usually be differentiated using an appropriate analytical sequence. The discrimination of paints from the same manufacturer and color (batch-to-batch variations) is of great interest and these data are seldom found in the literature. This survey concerns the analysis of batches from different color groups (white, papaya (special shade of orange), red and black) {{with a wide range}} of analytical techniques and leads to the following conclusions. Colored batch samples are more likely to be differentiated since their pigment composition is more complex (pigment mixtures, added pigments) and therefore subject to variations. These variations may occur during the paint production but may also occur when checking the paint shade in quality control processes. For these samples, techniques aimed at color/pigment(s) characterization (optical microscopy, microspectrophotometry (MSP), Raman spectroscopy) provide better discrimination than techniques aimed at the organic (binder) or inorganic composition (fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) or elemental analysis (SEM - scanning electron microscopy and XRF - X-ray fluorescence)). White samples <b>contain</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>titanium</b> dioxide as a pigment and the main differentiation is based on the binder composition (Csingle bondH stretches) detected either by FTIR or Raman. The inorganic composition (elemental analysis) also provides some discrimination. Black samples <b>contain</b> <b>mainly</b> carbon black as a pigment and are problematic with most of the spectroscopic techniques. In this case, pyrolysis-GC/MS {{represents the}} best technique to detect differences. Globally, Py-GC/MS may show a high potential of discrimination on all samples but the results are highly dependent on the specific instrumental conditions used. Finally, the discrimination of samples when data was interpreted visually as compared to statistically using principal component analysis (PCA) yielded very similar results. PCA increases sensitivity and could perform better on specific samples, but one first has to ensure that all non-informative variation (baseline deviation) is eliminated by applying correct pre-treatments. Statistical treatments can be used on a large data set and, when combined with an expert's opinion, will provide more objective criteria for decision making...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of bimetallic silver-cobalt clusters {{with less than}} 50 atoms is studied experimentally and their associated geometries are predicted by classical modeling. The clusters are created by laser vaporization and inert gas condensation. Their mass distribution is analyzed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, we find strong quantum size effects related to itinerant behavior of the silver and cobalt valence electrons. In the case of clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, no pronounced size effects appear in the mass spectra. Photofragmentation experiments reveal that neutral silver atom evaporation is the favorable channel, suggesting that the Ag{single bond}Co bonds are weaker than the Co{single bond}Co bonds. Consistently, and for both sets of clusters, Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations predict these clusters to have icosahedral based structures that may depend on temperature. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, cobalt sits at the cluster center and fragmentation proceeds by the evaporation of silver surface atoms. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, silver atoms also locate at the periphery and are more weakly bound to the cluster than cobalt surface atoms. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.
