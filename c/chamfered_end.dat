40|$|Abstract: A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite-element method}} computer program {{was developed to}} establish the elastic–plastic, residual, and service stress distributions in cylinders with flush and non-protruding optimal-chamfered cross-bores under internal pressure. Eight-noded brick and four-noded tetrahedral isoparametric elements and the displacement formulation were used. The incremental theory of plasticity with a 5 per cent yield condition and von Mises yield criterion were assumed. The incipient and 5 per cent overstrain (ov) pressures were established for various thickness ratios and cross-bore to main bore radius ratios. For the optimum chamfer angle geometrical configuration, the stresses were determined for varying ov. The maximum and minimum effective stresses were located 7. 58 from the meridional and transverse planes, respectively. Meridional plane through thickness yielding occurred at an ov of 41 per cent. The service stress gradients at the cross-bore <b>chamfer</b> <b>end</b> increased with ov for ovs. 30 per cent. Stress reversals were eliminated for overstrain. 27 per cent. Alternative autofrettage and yield condition procedures were proposed...|$|R

The 67 B is conventional ‘C’-type dipole magnet. The magnetic field properties are improved by the magnet end effect.

40|$|A magnetorheological (MR) damper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} devices used in a semiactive control system to mitigate unwanted vibration because the damping force can be controlled by changing the viscosity of the internal magnetorheological (MR) fluids. This study proposes a typical double coil MR damper where the damping force and dynamic range were derived from a quasistatic model based on the Bingham model of MR fluid. A finite element model was built to study the performance of this double coil MR damper by investigating seven different piston configurations, including the numbers and shapes of their <b>chamfered</b> <b>ends.</b> The objective function of an optimization problem was proposed and then an optimization procedure was constructed using the ANSYS parametric design language (APDL) to obtain the optimal damping performance of a double coil MR damper. Furthermore, experimental tests were also carried out, and the effects of the same direction and reverse direction of the currents on the damping forces were also analyzed. The relevant results of this analysis can easily be extended to the design of other types of MR dampers...|$|R
5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with <b>chamfered</b> <b>ends,</b> and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R

By chamfering the removable pole, the distribution tolerance of high magnetic field is optimized to +/- 2 x 10 (- 4).

50|$|The William Street facade is {{primarily}} symmetrical with a ground floor colonnade of five pointed arches between two slightly projecting bays. Blind circular openings {{are located in}} the infills between each arch. The colonnade is reached via central stone stairs. Five sets of horizontal-pivot timber sash windows align with the five arches of the colonnade. The entry is asymmetrical and located at the Stephens Lane end of the colonnade. The two end bays have stop-chamfered corners to the ground and first floors which are rendered and painted. Engaged columns capped with foliated convex elements are located within the stop <b>chamfers.</b> Each <b>end</b> bay has a centrally located segmental arch which surrounds a rendered section containing two lancet-type windows with semi-circular heads. The first floor levels have three similarly styled windows, symmetrically placed, and the second floor levels have larger scale windows which project above the eaves line and have curved pediments. A variety of bonds make up the brickwork, including English, Flemish, and English Garden Wall. The bricks of the William Street wing are discernibly better quality than those of the rear wing and have struck or ruled pointing. Carved sandstone brackets line the eaves.|$|R
40|$|Linear Induction Motor (LIM) {{which is}} also known as non-adhesion drive system has been chosen as {{propulsion}} system for most of mass transit railway all over the world. This is due to several advantages such as quiet and smooth running, no mechanical coupling, capable of climbing steep gradients, excellent acceleration and deceleration, and less susceptibility to weather condition. However, the disadvantages of LIM is it has finite length of the primary or secondary parts thus causes end effects also called discontinuous airgap flux phenomenon. Assymmetric airgap magnetic flux density at end parts of LIM produces unbalanced normal force which is airgap tends to increase at the entry and decrease at the exit part. This unbalanced normal force adversely affect the performance of the LIM propulsion system. Main objective of this research is to reduce magnetic flux leakage that leads to end effect phenomenon thus proves effectiveness method of <b>chamfering</b> in weakening <b>end</b> effect phenomenon. In this research, there will be 3 models of LIM. First is known as reference LIM which is LIM with no chamfered angle. Two others are LIM with chamfered angle 30 ° and 45 °. Software used in this research is JMAG-Designer. Reference and chamfered LIM 2 D models consists of mover (primary), coil, aluminium sheet, and stator (secondary) are created using Geometry Editor included in JMAG-Designer. After running analysis 3 different models of LIM following parameters given, results were displayed in the form of tables that indicates value of magnetic flux for 3 phase current (U, V, W). Graph is being drawn to make views of these results more clearly and precisely. X-axis in the graph indicates times whereas Y-axis in the graph indicates value of magnetic flux for 3 different model of LIM. After that, figure of distribution of magnetic flux density for 3 models of LIM is shown. From the results, chamfering is proven to reduce end effect at the LIM. At the <b>end,</b> <b>chamfered</b> angle 45 ° LIM has highest number of magnetic flux, least leakage flux, least end effect thus has highest thrust value for LIM propulsion system...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} thesis {{was written}} in 1989 / 90 on a Macintosh Plus with a processor at 8 Mhz and 2. 5 Mb of RAM; it was written using Micro$oft Word Version 4 for the Macintosh {{and all of the}} figures, {{with the exception of the}} photographs, were included. Significant changes in computer technology have occurred in the years between the writing and the generation of this electronic copy in 2008, there have been some problems with backward compatibility of the software used, in particular with respect to the graphics handling capability, so there have been some significant problems with the use of old file formats; consequently not all of the figures are as clear as they were when the original was written. Tubes of glass reinforced thermosetting resins have been tested in axial compression between steel platens with one <b>end</b> <b>chamfered</b> to prevent critically high loads causing catastrophic centre failure. By testing in such a manner these tubes crush in a progressive and controlled manner, and are capable of exhibiting high levels of energy absorption, particularly when related to the material mass involved. Polymers are known to display viscoelastic behaviour and polymer composites are similarly sensitive to test speed and temperature. Energy absorption in tube crushing has been shown to be speed and temperature sensitive and the purpose of this project has been to understand the variability of the energy absorption and the associated mechanisms. The main aim has been to show how the two variables interrelate. The materials used have been produced by hot rolling of pre-preg cloth or by resinjection into closed moulds. Reinforcement has consisted of woven glass cloth or random glass mat; matrix materials have been epoxy and polyester resins. Trends to higher values of specific energy absorption with increasing speed have been observed for epoxy matrix tubes, while polyester matrix tubes have shown less certain trends and give lower values of specific energy absorption at high speeds. All the tubes have shown a rapid drop in specific energy absorption with increasing temperature above normal room temperature, with changes in crush mode being very apparent. At temperatures in excess of about 100 degrees C the tubes have failed by centre buckling, the transition temperature from normal crushing to buckling being sensitive to the crush speed. The interrelation between speed and temperature effects has been examined. Three factors that prevent simple interrelation have been identified; these are inertial effects of crush debris, residual stresses in the hoop direction of the tube and frictional heating in the crush zone. Speed sensitivity of the energy absorption has been determined over a range of temperatures and various features of these responses related to the responses of the material properties. Frictional temperature rises have been modelled mathematically and the predictions have been shown to be reasonably consistent with experimental measurements. These temperature rises have been shown to be important in determining the speed sensitive behaviour of the energy absorption levels, particularly for polyester resin matrix tubes tested at high speeds...|$|R
