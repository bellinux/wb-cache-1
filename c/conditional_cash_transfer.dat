40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfers</b> as a mechanism of governing health risk by buying behaviour change in sexual practice. <b>Conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfers</b> {{have come to be}} identified as a potential {{solution to the problem of}} HIV prevention, and as such look likely to be applied throughout countries with high prevalence rates in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper {{considers the}} implications of two pilot studies in Tanzania and Malawi for governing the risk of HIV infection. It outlines the problem of behaviour change and individual rationality, the potential of <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfers</b> as a relatively inexpensive programme with high outcomes, and some of limitations and implications of these initiatives for individual bodies, rationality and global health governance. The paper makes the argument that <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfers</b> should be met with caution and that governing health risk by buying behaviour represents the intersection of biopolitical control with neoliberal forms of economic incentive through financial gain. The balancing of long term health needs with short term financial gain induces will to change behaviour: the problem being the sustainability of such change in the absence of financial gain and the long term consequences of constructing behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} family poverty, Jamaica and Tanzania, among other strategies, decided to introduce the <b>Conditional</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Transfers</b> programs (CCTs) in reducing the magnitude of poverty for marginalized groups. Jamaica introduced the Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) in 2002 to address poverty among {{the young and the}} elderly in rural areas, among female-headed households and among large families. Tanzania under Tanzania Social Action Fund phase one (TASAF 1) established the Community-Based <b>Conditional</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Transfers</b> Program in 2008 to alleviate poverty among the marginalized groups. It is against this background that this study was formulated to review literature on the role played by <b>Conditional</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Transfers</b> in the process of poverty alleviation, which focused on most vulnerable children in both countries. The study focused on <b>Conditional</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Transfers</b> to poor families living with most vulnerable children succeeded in investing in human capital using the capability approach in breaking down the intergenerational cycle of poverty. The study found that, the provision of <b>Conditional</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Transfers</b> enabled poor families to increasingly enrolling their school going children as well as paying visits to health centres. However, these results cannot sufficiently explain the final outcomes (achievements) in schools. For instance, the capacity of children to get high scores and proceedings to the next class and their health status could have been explained by other factors than the CCTs. The study also found that the targeting strategies used in these programs are inadequate since some of the most vulnerable children like, street children, are not living with families. However, since donor driven programs lead to weak implementation, for these programs to maintain sustainability, both countries should increase social protection budgets and involve communities to full participation from the beginning to the post completion follow up to check on the quality of services provided.

25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfer</b> and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as when she is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{protection}} {{actions are}} geared towards children who {{could potentially be}} trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfer</b> programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the I.L.O, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities {{from all over the}} world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.|$|E

When credit constrained households can be perfectly targeted by the government, we show that CCT are more effective than UCT in enhancing efficiency and equivalent in terms of welfare. When public education quality is very low, raising quality is welfare improving, but is never efficiency enhancing. If the government cannot target constrained households, UCT may be the best policy both in terms of efficiency and welfare. <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfers,</b> public education, education quality, unconditional <b>cash</b> <b>transfers,</b> credit constraint, efficiency, welfare...|$|R

This paper explores that question using Brazilian public opinion data on preferences regarding taxation, <b>conditional</b> <b>cash</b> <b>transfers,</b> pension schemes and educations. It is found that disagreement across socio-economic groups arises on how government should address inequality rather than whether it should do so. While poorer respondents support <b>cash</b> <b>transfers</b> more than the rich, the rich are more likely than the poor to support expenditures on public education.
