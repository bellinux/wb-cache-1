25|$|The start zone of an {{avalanche}} must be steep {{enough to allow}} snow to accelerate once set in motion, additionally convex slopes are less stable than concave slopes, because of the disparity between the tensile strength of snow layers and their compressive strength. The composition {{and structure of the}} ground surface beneath the snowpack influences the stability of the snowpack, either being a source of strength or weakness. Avalanches are unlikely to form in very thick forests, but boulders and sparsely distributed vegetation can create weak areas deep within the snowpack through the formation of strong temperature gradients. Full-depth avalanches (avalanches that sweep a slope virtually <b>clean</b> of <b>snow</b> cover) are more common on slopes with smooth ground, such as grass or rock slabs.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of {{dust on the}} snow’s surface {{has been shown to}} decrease albedo by as much as 40 % compared to a <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> cover. Thus dust on snow affects snow surface radiative fluxes, generally resulting in earlier snowmelt compared to “clean ” snowpacks. Less understood is how dust on snow events may affect infiltrating meltwater movement in the snowpack. An aeolian dust event with a distinctive red color that was deposited in February of 2006 at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range provides opportunity to investigate how dust on snow may change the surface characteristics of snow and meltwater movement through the snowpack. Ice columns found in <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> had a mean depth of 60 cm, which was significantly longer (p= 0. 0001) compared to the mean depth of 16. 7 cm in red snow. The shape also varied, with ice columns in <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> having a uniform width along the entire length, whereas those found in red snow were widest at the snow surface and decreased in width with depth. The movement of liquid water through the snowpack in “red ” snow appears to be more uniform, decreasing the size of preferential flowpaths that give rise to ice columns when compared to “clean ” snow. Thus the variation in ice column morphology between red and <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> gives insight into how dust deposition events may affect the energy balance, subsequent melt, and meltwater flowpaths in snow covered areas.

40|$|Abstract. Why develop polar robots? As {{with space}} missions, {{logistics}} costs predominate polarscience budgets largely to maintain safe human operations in harsh environments. Reducing this logistics burden would greatly expand research {{opportunities in the}} Polar Regions. We have developed a simple four-wheel-drive, solar-powered Cool Robot to conduct autonomous summertime science campaigns in Antarctica and Greenland. The 60 -kg robot measures 1. 2 x 1. 2 x 1 m and can easily carry a 20 -kg science payload. A low-profile chassis supports a five-sided, lightweight box of solar cells. Reflected sunlight from polar snowfields contributes 20 – 40 % of the power input, and the side panels capture this power while avoiding the complexity of sun-tracking. Under clear polar skies, 15 W of payload power are available while the robot drives and over 200 W when it is stationary. The robot navigates by GPS waypoint following across largely obstacle-free polar terrain. It requires no fuel caches, and emits no pollutants so it can conduct <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> and air measurements. Mobility considerations predominate the robot’s design. Although polar snow is firm, rolling resistance accounts for about 90 % of the power budget.

The goal of this study was to characterize SD-associated bacteria transported to the European Alps, deposited and entrapped in snow. During two distinct events in February and May 2014, SD particles were deposited and promptly covered by falling snow, thus preserving them in distinct ochre layers within the snowpack. In June 2014, we collected samples at different depths from a snow profile at the Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps; 3621 m a. s. l.). After filtration, we performed various microbiological and physicochemical analyses of the snow and dust particles therein that originated in Algeria.

40|$|Precise {{information}} about the size and spatial distribution of glaciers is needed for many research applications, for example water resources evaluation, determination of glacier specific changes in area and volume, and for calculation {{of the past and}} future contribution of glaciers to sea-level change. However, mapping glacier outlines is challenging even under optimal conditions due to time consuming manual corrections of wrongly classified pixels. In the last decades, advantages in computer technologies have {{led to the development of}} object-based-image analysis (OBIA), an image classification technique that can be seen as an alternative to the common pixel-based image analysis (PBIA). In this study we compare the performance of OBIA with PBIA for glacier mapping in three test regions with challenging mapping conditions. In both approaches, a ratio image was created to map <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> and ice while thermal and slope information was used to assist in the identification of debris-covered ice. The mapping results of OBIA have overall a ￼ 3 % higher quality than PBIA, in particular in the processing of debris-covered glaciers where OBIA has a 12 % higher accuracy. The post-processing possibilities in OBIA (e. g., the application of a processing loop and neighborhood analysis) are especially powerful to improve the final classification. This leads also to a reduction of the workload for the manual corrections, which are still required to achieve a sufficient accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Black carbon (BC) {{and dust}} {{deposited}} on snow and glacier surfaces {{can reduce the}} surface albedo, accelerate snow and ice melt, and trigger albedo feedback. Assessing BC and dust concentrations in snow and ice in the Himalaya is of interest because this region borders large BC and dust sources, and seasonal snow and glacier ice in this region are {{an important source of}} water resources. Snow and ice samples were collected from crevasse profiles and snow pits at elevations between 5400 and 6400 m a. s. l. from Mera glacier located in the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal during spring and fall 2009, providing the first observational data of BC concentrations in snow and ice from the southern slope of the Himalaya. The samples were measured for Fe concentrations (used as a dust proxy) via ICP-MS, total impurity content gravimetrically, and BC concentrations using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP 2). Measured BC concentrations underestimate actual BC concentrations due to changes to the sample during storage and loss of BC particles in the ultrasonic nebulizer; thus, we correct for the underestimated BC mass. BC and Fe concentrations are substantially higher at elevations < 6000 m due to post-depositional processes including melt and sublimation and greater loading in the lower troposphere. Because the largest areal extent of snow and ice resides at elevations < 6000 m, the higher BC and dust concentrations at these elevations can reduce the snow and glacier albedo over large areas, accelerating melt, affecting glacier mass balance and water resources, and contributing to a positive climate forcing. Radiative transfer modeling constrained by measurements at 5400 m at Mera La indicates that BC concentrations in the winter–spring snow/ice horizons are sufficient to reduce albedo by 6 – 10 % relative to <b>clean</b> <b>snow,</b> corresponding to localized instantaneous radiative forcings of 75 – 120 W m − 2. The other bulk impurity concentrations, when treated separately as dust, reduce albedo by 40 – 42 % relative to <b>clean</b> <b>snow</b> and give localized instantaneous radiative forcings of 488 to 525 W m − 2. Adding the BC absorption to the other impurities results in additional radiative forcings of 3 W m − 2. The BC and Fe concentrations were used to further examine relative absorption of BC and dust. When dust concentrations are high, dust dominates absorption, snow albedo reduction, and radiative forcing, and the impact of BC may be negligible, confirming the radiative transfer modeling. When impurity concentrations are low, the absorption by BC and dust may be comparable; however, due to the low impurity concentrations, albedo reductions are small. While these results suggest that the snow albedo and radiative forcing effect of dust is considerably greater than BC, there are several sources of uncertainty. Further observational studies are needed to address the contribution of BC, dust, and colored organics to albedo reductions and snow and ice melt, and to characterize the time variation of radiative forcing...|$|E
40|$|Black carbon (BC) in {{snow in the}} Himalayas has {{recently}} attracted considerable interest due to its impact on snow albedo, snow and glacier melting, regional climate and water resources. A single particle soot photometer (SP 2) instrument {{was used to measure}} refractory BC (rBC) in a series of surface snow samples collected in the upper Khumbu Valley, Nepal between November 2009 and February 2012. The obtained time series indicates annual cycles with maximum rBC concentrations before the onset of the monsoon season and fast decreases during the monsoon period. Detected concentrations ranged from a few up to 70 ppb with rather large uncertainties due to the handling of the samples. Detailed modeling of the snowpack, including the detected range and an estimated upper limit of BC concentrations, was performed to study the role of BC in the seasonal snowpack. Simulations were performed for three winter seasons with the snowpack model Crocus, including {{a detailed description of the}} radiative transfer inside the snowpack. While the standard Crocus model strongly overestimates the height and the duration of the seasonal snowpack, a better calculation of the snow albedo with the new radiative transfer scheme enhanced the representation of the snow. However, the period with snow on the ground without BC in the snow was still overestimated between 37 and 66 days, which was further diminished by 8 to 15 % and more than 40 % in the presence of 100 or 300 ppb of BC. Compared to snow without BC, the albedo is reduced on average by 0. 027 and 0. 060 in the presence of 100 and 300 ppb BC. While the impact of increasing BC in the snow on the albedo was largest for <b>clean</b> <b>snow,</b> the impact on the local radiative forcing is the opposite. Here, increasing BC caused an even larger impact at higher BC concentrations. This effect is related to an accelerated melting of the snowpack caused by a more efficient metamorphism of the snow due to an increasing size of the snow grains with increasing BC concentrations. The melting of the winter snowpack was shifted by 3 to 10 and 17 to 27 days during the three winter seasons in the presence of 100 and 300 ppb BC compared to <b>clean</b> <b>snow,</b> while the simulated annual local radiative forcing corresponds to 3 to 4. 5 and 10. 5 to 13. 0 W m − 2. An increased sublimation or evaporation of the snow reduces the simulated radiative forcing, leading to a net forcing that is lower by 0. 5 to 1. 5 W m − 2, while the addition of 10 ppm dust causes an increase of the radiative forcing between 2. 5 and 3 W m − 2. According to the simulations, 7. 5 ppm of dust has an effect equivalent to 100 ppb of BC concerning the impact on the melting of the snowpack and the local radiative forcing...|$|E
