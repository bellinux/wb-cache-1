5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, {{he got the}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch {{government}} appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country {{in the throes of}} political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a tefillin stand was erected with {{permission}} from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers visitors the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on Tefillin, a daily Jewish ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The stand is staffed by multilingual volunteers and an estimated 100,000 visitors put on tefillin there annually.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals paired United with Porto, against {{whom they had}} played in the first {{knockout}} round of the 2003–04 competition. The draw also determined the semi-final pairings, with United or Porto drawn to play against Arsenal or Villarreal. The first leg of the quarter-final was played at Old Trafford, giving Porto the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the pressure on Manchester United with an away goal. That away goal came in the fourth minute of the game, but Wayne Rooney equalised tenminutes later and Carlos Tevez gave United {{the lead in the}} 85thminute. However, with only oneminute left in the game, United suffered a defensive lapse, allowing Mariano González to score Porto's second away goal. Those away goals meant that United travelled to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto needing a win or a score-draw of 2–2 or higher to remain in the competition. A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixthminute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be {{the only one of the}} game, making Manchester United the first English side to win in Porto.|$|E
50|$|With all the {{differences}} concerning details, historical researchers agree {{that in the}} German Revolution, the <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the republic on a firm footing were considerably better than the dangers coming from the extreme left. Instead, the alliance of the SPD with the old elites constituted a considerable structural problem for the Weimar Republic.|$|R
60|$|Branwen {{felt that}} her only <b>chance</b> was <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a bold face on matters. She, therefore, by a violent effort, subdued her emotion and continued.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when he came}} on as a late {{substitute}} in the relegation decider at Barnet on 5 May 2001, {{he missed}} several <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game beyond Barnet's reach, or at least test their goalkeeper, only adding to the anxiety of the fans in the away end. It was no surprise that Gayle was released by Colin Lee in May 2001, joining non-league Moor Green where he ended his playing career.|$|R
25|$|Following the season, it {{was decided}} that Hitzfeld should leave the club and Felix Magath, a former player for Hamburger SV during the late 1970s to mid-1980s which was so highly {{competitive}} with Bayern and also successful in Europe, was given the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his mark on a new Bayern generation. In his first year in charge he steered the club to a double.|$|E
25|$|Two plays {{after the}} turnover, Buffalo {{defensive}} back Mark Kelso intercepted a pass from Moon {{and returned it}} 28 yards to the Oilers 18-yard line, setting up Norwood's 27-yard field goal to increase their lead to 17–3. Buffalo's defense forced another turnover on Houston's ensuing drive when Derrick Burroughs recovered a fumble from receiver Haywood Jeffires on the Oilers 26-yard line. The Bills now had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away, but Norwood hit the uprights on a 36-yard field goal attempt.|$|E
25|$|His family {{got into}} dire {{economic}} circumstances {{after the death}} of his father in 1825. Berwald tried to get several scholarships, but only got one from the King, which enabled him to study in Berlin, where he worked hard on operas despite not having any <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them on the stage. To make a living, Berwald started an orthopedic and physiotherapy clinic in Berlin in 1835, which turned out to be profitable. Some of the orthopedic devices he invented were still in use decades after his death.|$|E
60|$|This over, William {{addressed}} {{his soldiers}} {{from a little}} hillock, and put on his armor, hanging-round his neck, as a witness of Harold's falsehood, one of the relics on which the oath had been taken. He <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on his hawberk with the wrong side before, and seeing some of his men disconcerted, fancying this a token of ill, {{he told them that}} it boded that his dukedom should be turned to a kingdom.|$|R

25|$|In 1973, Keegan won {{his first}} major honours. Don Revie's Leeds United visited Anfield on Easter Monday for a {{showdown}} involving {{two of the three}} 1972-73 Football League challengers. The game turned on a few minutes either side of half time. First Leeds' Peter Lorimer contrived to miss an open goal. Two minutes after the break Peter Cormack took his <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Liverpool ahead. Keegan added a late second to seal the win. With Arsenal dropping a point at Southampton, Liverpool duly closed out the title with a final game 0-0 draw against Leicester City. This was their first major trophy since seven years before in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo {{had a great}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{the game}} away when Lou Piccone blocked a Chargers punt that was {{recovered}} by linebacker Ervin Parker on the San Diego 38. But safety Glen Edwards intercepted a pass from Ferguson on the San Diego 9-yard line to keep the Bills from scoring. With 6:17 left in regulation, Buffalo got another chance to get a decisive score when they recovered a fumbled punt return from Mike Fuller. But two plays later, defensive tackle Fred Dean dropped Joe Cribbs for a 1-yard loss on third and 1, and then Nick Mike-Mayer missed a 49-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to San Diego with 3:59 left.|$|E
25|$|Cruzado had {{the rare}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her stamp on {{five of the}} university's colleges in 2011 and 2012. The dean of the College of Business and {{the dean of the}} College of Arts and Architecture both left MSU in 2011. In 2012, the dean of the College of Letters and Science stepped down to return to the faculty, while the dean of the library and the dean of the College of Education, Health and Human Development both retired. With so many vacancies, Cruzado hired a {{professional}} search firm to assist with recruitment, and she and Potvin held numerous meetings on campus to solicit input from faculty and students about the type of deans they wanted to see hired.|$|E
50|$|The Ravens then crushed two opponents {{from the}} NFC North at home, beating the Detroit Lions 48-3 and the Chicago Bears 31-7. The Ravens {{improved}} to 8-6, {{second in the}} AFC North, and {{in line for the}} fifth seed. They looked ahead to their division rivals, the Steelers, who were coming off a dramatic last-second win against the Packers. A win would give the Ravens a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> clinch a playoff spot and would knock the Steelers out of contention. But the Ravens, who committed 11 penalties and blew several <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> additional points on Pittsburgh, lost 23-20. The Ravens still had a shot at the playoffs with a week 17 victory, and made it defeating the Oakland Raiders 21-13.|$|R
50|$|Bonner {{played in}} all of Ireland's games at Euro 88, {{including}} the 1-0 victory over England in Stuttgart. Ireland scored early and dominated in the first half, missing several <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game beyond England. However, in the second half, Bonner produced a number of outstanding saves to keep Ireland in the lead, most notably from Gary Lineker, and was named Man of the Match. It was Bonner's eighth consecutive clean sheet for Ireland. In the second game, Ireland drew 1-1 with the Soviet Union. Ireland narrowly missed out on a semi-final appearance, conceding a goal in the dying minutes of their final group match against eventual champions, the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his victory}} {{speech at the}} declaration, he said, [...] "Dont regard me as a Unionist. I am {{a member of the}} National Party {{until the end of the}} Japanese war, when you will then have a <b>chance</b> again <b>to</b> <b>put</b> me in or out." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Arsenal came out on top, {{constantly}} pressing for an equaliser. They were denied two penalties by referee Lee Probert before they finally got an equaliser in the 71st minute, with centre-back Laurent Koscielny bundling a header from Bacary Sagna over the line following a corner. Many believed that a goal kick should have been given instead of a corner as it appeared that substitute Yaya Sanogo got the last touch. In the 79th minute, Gibbs had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Arsenal in front when he had just goalkeeper Allan McGregor to beat, but he could not hit the target, shooting high of the goal. Arsenal had another chance for a winning goal in injury time, but Olivier Giroud's shot was saved by McGregor.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} {{play of the}} third quarter, Bledsoe's 39-yard {{completion}} to Glenn led to a 46-yard field goal from Vinatieri, cutting their deficit to 7-6. After a punt from each team, the Steelers had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away with a drive to the Patriots 1-yard line. On fourth down, coach Bill Cowher tried to ice {{the game with a}} conversion attempt, but Stewart was stuffed for no gain with 3:24 left in regulation. This gave New England one last chance to drive for a winning field goal and they managed to reach their own 42, but rookie linebacker Mike Vrabel stripped the ball from Bledsoe, and fellow linebacker Jason Gildon recovered it. The Patriots managed to get it back with 34 seconds left, but linebacker Levon Kirkland intercepted Bledsoe's Hail Mary pass on the game's final play.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the final}} quarter, the Raiders took a 14–12 lead {{at the end of}} an 80-yard drive {{highlighted}} by Chester's 27-yard catch. On the last play, van Eeghen scored his second 1-yard touchdown run of the day. Later on, the Raiders had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away when they recovered a fumble from Sipe on the Browns 24-yard line with 4:19 left in the game. But after moving to a third and 1 situation on the 15, van Eeghen was stuffed for no gain on two consecutive plays. On the second play after the turnover, Sipe completed a 29-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and later a 23-yarder to Greg Pruitt. Then Mike Pruitt ran the ball 14 yards to the Raiders 14-yard line. Pruitt gained another yard on the next play, and the team called a timeout from the 13 with 49 seconds left.|$|E
25|$|However, Seattle {{tied the}} game in the third quarter after kicker Norm Johnson made two field goals of his own. Later in the third quarter, Moon threw a 29-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Willie Drewrey to give his team a 20–13 lead. Houston later had two <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away in the fourth quarter, but Zendejas hit the uprights on a 52-yard field goal, and later missed a kick from 29 yards out. With only 1:47 left in regulation, Krieg started an 80-yard drive that included a 10-yard completion to Largent on fourth and 10 and eventually finished it with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Largent, tying the game with 26 seconds left.|$|R
60|$|A hearty, generous spirit, when vigorously displayed, always finds a ready {{response}} from human hearts. The few sailors {{who were on}} deck at the time, {{and one or two}} of the sick men who <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their heads up the hatchway, rushed to the side, waved their mittens--in default of caps--and gave vent to three hearty British cheers. The effect on the drooping spirits of the hunting-party was electrical. They pricked up like chargers that had felt the spur, wheeled round, and returned the cheer with interest. It was an apparently trifling incident, but it served to lighten the way, and make it seem less dreary for many a long mile.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped in}} {{alongside}} by him, {{as though it}} were her appointed position, and took the pace of the pack. He did not snarl at her, nor show his teeth, when any leap of hers <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her in advance of him. On the contrary, he seemed kindly disposed toward her--too kindly to suit her, for he was prone to run near to her, and when he ran too near it was she who snarled and showed her teeth. Nor was she above slashing his shoulder sharply on occasion. At such times he betrayed no anger. He merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several awkward leaps, in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country swain.|$|R
25|$|Exhibiting his {{trademark}} poise {{in front of}} an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Law again provided a number of big shots. Hitting 13 of his 15 free-throw attempts, he ended the game with 26 points, including the final two points of the game. The Aggie's 72–69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 {{for the first time since}} 1980. In a show of good sportsmanship, Law spent time after the game consoling disappointed Louisville freshman Edgar Sosa, complimenting him on his performance. On March 22, however, Law and his teammates faced the #2 seed Memphis Tigers. The score was close throughout and Law had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> A up by three on a break away lay up that he missed with just a few seconds to play. The Aggies lost in a narrow contest 65–64, ending his collegiate career.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Broncos {{defenders}} Karl Mecklenburg and Greg Kragen forced a fumble from Worley that defensive back Tyrone Braxton recovered on the Steelers 37-yard line, setting up quarterback John Elway's 37-yard {{touchdown pass to}} wide receiver Vance Johnson {{to tie the game}} at 17. Brister struck back, completing a 19-yard screen to Hoge and a 30-yard pass to rookie receiver Mark Stock {{on the way to a}} 35-yard Anderson field goal. Then in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh defensive back Thomas Everett intercepted an Elway pass and returned it 26 yards to midfield, setting up Anderson's 32-yard field goal to make the score 23-17. The Steelers appeared to have a big <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away following a Denver punt. But after a productive start to their drive, Braxton tackled Hodge 1-yard short of a first down at the Denver 41 to bring up fourth down and force a punt.|$|E
25|$|Of Abbas' five sons, {{three had}} survived past childhood, so the Safavid {{succession}} seemed secure. He was {{on good terms}} with the crown prince, Mohammed Baqir Mirza (born 1587; better known in the West as Safi Mirza). In 1614, however, during a campaign in Georgia, the shah heard rumours that the prince was conspiring against him with a leading Circassian, Farhad Beg Cherkes. Shortly after, Mohammed Baqir broke protocol during a hunt by killing a boar before the shah had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his spear in the animal. This seemed to confirm Abbas' suspicions and he sunk into melancholy; he no longer trusted any of his three sons. In 1615, he decided {{he had no choice}} but to have Mohammed killed. A Circassian named Behbud Beg executed the Shah's orders and the prince was murdered in a hammam in the city of Resht. The shah almost immediately regretted his action and was plunged into grief.|$|E
5000|$|... 20th Minute: Australia had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{effectively}} <b>put</b> {{the game}} {{out of reach}} when Darren Lockyer looked to have got {{on the end of}} a Cameron Smith grubber kick. Yet, when referee Ashley Klein went to the video referee it was clear that Lockyer had not grounded the ball and the try was not awarded.|$|R
50|$|Now she is {{starting}} {{over in a}} city far from home, far from Bobby. And in this place she uses a name that isn't hers, and cradles her son in her arms, and tries to forget. For the woman who now calls herself Beth, {{every day is a}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> heal, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> together the pieces of her shattered self. And every day she waits for Bobby to catch up to her. Because Bobby always said he would never let her go. And despite the flawlessness of her escape, Fran Benedetto is certain of one thing: It {{is only a matter of}} time...|$|R
50|$|With the {{momentum}} on their side, the Indians looked {{to finish off}} the defending champs. Andy Pettitte and Jaret Wright once again faced off. The Indians would take a 3-0 lead in the third thanks to back-to-back two-out hits by Manny Ramírez and Matt Williams. Then a sac fly by Tony Fernández in the fourth made it 4-0. However, the Yankees gave the Indians cause to pause in the fifth when an error by Ramírez cut the lead in half. Then Wade Boggs's pinch hit RBI single made it a one-run game in the sixth. The score remained 4-3 and the Yankees blew multiple <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> take the lead. The Indians also had their share of <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the series away. The frustration mounted in the ninth when Paul O'Neill's two-out double gave Bernie Williams a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> hit the go-ahead homer off José Mesa, but Mesa got Williams to fly out (a fairly deep fly ball) to Brian Giles to end the series and ensure a new World Champion in 1997.|$|R
25|$|Jones was {{employed}} {{as one of}} the Superintendents of Works for the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton's gigantic cast iron and glass palace, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within, and this was the architectural project which first brought Jones to the wider public's attention. Based on his observations of primary colour polychromy within the architecture of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and at the Alhambra, he chose a simple palette of red, yellow and blue for the interior ironwork. Colour theories were relatively new, and his controversial paint scheme created much debate and negative publicity in the newspapers and journals of the day. Crucially, after early viewings, Prince Albert maintained his support, and Jones ploughed on regardless. The public and professional criticism gradually dissipated until the building was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim – some commenting that Jones's colouring was similar in effect to the paintings of Turner. Jones had been offered a rare <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> some of his theories on polychromy into practice on a grand scale: six million people witnessed his vision at the Great Exhibition during its short existence – roughly three times the population of London at that time.|$|E
25|$|Ledley {{scored in}} the first match of the 2006–07 season, the opener in a 2–1 win over Barnsley. He then scored several weeks later, as Cardiff City beat fellow {{promotion}} contenders Birmingham City, 2–0, to move top of the table. At this match Cardiff City had a full stadium, 20,000 fans, {{for the first time}} in over 45 years. This signalled their growing momentum in the league and the belief within the club that they were able to get promoted. Ledley was identified as one of the key players in Cardiff City's team, his pace on the left wing being vital to their tenacious style of play. On 25 September, Ledley scored in a 3–0 win over Southend United to confirm Cardiff's status as early season favourites. Cardiff entered the FA Cup at the third round and drew Tottenham Hotspur. The match ended 0–0 but Ledley had an excellent <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Cardiff City in the lead after 55 miuntes, he got on the end of a cross but hit his shot just over the bar. The match went to a replay and Tottenham Hotspur won 4–0 at White Hart Lane on 17 January. On 2 February Ledley suffered a hamstring injury in a 2–0 win over Barnsley. At the end of the season he picked up the Football League goal of the season award for his strike against Barnsley.|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by a [...] "concentrated {{multiplatform}} promotional campaign" [...] {{that included}} articles in Nickelodeon's magazine {{and on its}} webpage, an arc of three episodes introduced Burns' replacement Donovan Patton, who played Steve's brother Joe. Patton was subjected to {{the same kind of}} scrutiny to earn the job, and was selected out of 1,500 auditions. Patton had never seen Blue's Clues before he auditioned for the part but, like Burns, was the favorite with preschool test audiences. Burns helped train Patton to perform the role. [...] "We saw Steve Burns' retirement from the show as a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Blue's Clues on a new course," [...] Johnson said. Also, according to Johnson, Joe's character was more like a preschooler and more innocent than Steve.|$|E
60|$|Lifting up {{the end of}} {{her tail}} and wiping her mouth therewith, Arnalooa smiled at Edith's look of reproach, and ran {{laughing}} towards the shore, where she and Okatook washed their hands, after which they followed Edith and Chimo to their favourite ravine. Although she knew that they did not understand a word of what she said, Edith invariably kept up a running fire of small talk, in reference chiefly to the objects of nature by which they were surrounded. To this the little hairy creatures listened intently with smiling faces, and sometimes they laughed prodigiously, as though they understood what was said, so that their companion {{felt as if she were}} really conversing with them, although she was sadly perplexed at the utter impossibility of obtaining an intelligible reply to a question when she <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> one.|$|R
5|$|East Orange, New Jersey-born field athlete Dorian Scott {{competed for}} Jamaica in the men's shot put. He was 26 {{years old at}} the time, and had not competed at any Olympic games prior to his {{performance}} in Beijing. During the August 14 qualifying round, Scott was placed in the second heat, which included 23 athletes. He was given three <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the shot. During his first attempt, the shot flew 19.54meters, placing him 10th; in the second, 19.94meters, placing him sixth; and in the third, 19.71meters. However, since his second score was the best mark he received, the third score went unranked and the second score was used as his final score in the qualifying round. Overall, Scott placed 15th out of the 40 placing athletes, falling behind the Ukraine's Andriy Semenov (20.01meters) but displacing Australia's Justin Anlezark (19.91meters). He did not progress to the final round on August 15.|$|R
50|$|Southampton {{looked to}} {{continue}} {{where they had}} left off in the second half, pressuring the City half quickly and continuously; it remained an open game though, as the visitors also enjoyed several promising attacks in the early exchanges. Rodriguez almost put Southampton in the lead after a one-on-one with goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, before Osvaldo struck over the crossbar from the rebound; Osvaldo and Steven Davis continued to pressure the City goal, enjoying a few more chances in the next ten minutes. The visitors constantly responded in kind, with Agüero at the centre of most of their pressure, and Aleksandar Kolarov also received a couple of <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his team ahead again. A number of free-kicks came to nothing late in the game, and the open contest finished as a draw which saw the Saints pick up their first point in almost a month.|$|R
