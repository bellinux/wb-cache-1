50|$|In 1932 Schuyler C. Hulett {{patented}} {{an improved}} design, which used cardboard <b>tubes</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the upper}} and lower parts of the wire to prevent wrinkles, and in 1935 Elmer D. Rogers added a tube on the lower bar, which is still used.|$|R
50|$|On surface ships, towed {{array cables}} are {{normally}} stored in drums, then spooled {{out behind the}} vessel when in use. U.S. Navy submarines typically store towed arrays inside an outboard <b>tube,</b> <b>mounted</b> along the vessel's hull, with an opening on the starboard tail.|$|R

50|$|A {{version of}} the CRV7-PG was also {{developed}} for special forces use, fired from a single <b>tube</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 6 x 6. In use, the weapon would be driven into the field and fired from behind cover, aiming at a designated location from a forward team.|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} based on the French Admiralty 630 series design, but with more power and better armament. The class had six {{internal}} 550 mm torpedo tubes (four in the bow and two in the stern) and three 400 mm <b>tubes</b> <b>mounted</b> externally on a moveable triple mount.|$|R
50|$|Anderson was {{the first}} of the Sims class to be {{delivered}} in early 1939, and was found to be 150 tons overweight and dangerously top-heavy due to insufficient metacentric height. This touched off a redesign and rebuilding of the class, completed during 1941. One 5 inch gun (No. 3) and one quad torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mount</b> were removed, with another torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mount</b> relocated to the centerline. It was determined that an underestimate by the Bureau of Engineering of the weight of a new machinery design was responsible, and that the Bureau of Construction and Repair did not have sufficient authority to detect or correct the error during the design process. This eventually led to the consolidation of the previous bureaus into the new Bureau of Ships on 20 June 1940.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of World War II the fort {{was used as a}} {{training}} battery for coastal gunners and it was equipped with torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>mounted</b> on the pier. After the war it was used as a National Service training station. Its military use came to an end in 1962.|$|R

50|$|Tatsuta had a steel {{hull and}} {{retained}} a full barque rigging with two masts for auxiliary sail propulsion {{in addition to}} her steam engine. She was armed with two QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I-IVs guns, four QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns, five 2.5-pounder guns and five torpedo <b>tubes,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the deck.|$|R
500|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Duncan had a single 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine guns mounted {{on the sides of}} her bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mounts</b> for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. In 1936, the 12-pounder was replaced by two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns. Sometime after the Dunkirk evacuation, the ship's rear torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mount</b> was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the quadruple 0.5-inch machine guns were replaced by [...] Oerlikon AA guns.|$|R
50|$|From Mach to April 1941, Badger was {{refitted}} {{to better}} equip the ship for escort duties. The ship's gun armament and {{two sets of}} torpedo tubes were removed, replaced by six 3"/50 caliber dual purpose guns. Two triple torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mounts</b> were retained, and an improved anti-submarine armament of 24 depth charges was fitted.|$|R
50|$|Their {{armament}} was two 10 cm L/50 calibre guns. Secondary armament {{was provided}} by six 66 mm 45 calibre guns. Two of these were on special anti-aircraft mountings. The gun armament was completed by a single 7.8 mm machine gun. Their main offensive capability came from four 450 mm torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>mounted</b> in pairs.|$|R
500|$|The ship mounted twelve 50-calibre 6-inch (152mm) guns in four three-gun turrets. Her {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} eight 4-inch (102mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns in four twin turrets. Jamaica mounted two quadruple 2-pounder (40mm) light AA mounts ("pom-poms"). Her short-range AA armament is not known. The ship carried two above-water triple torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mounts</b> for [...] torpedoes.|$|R
40|$|A 3 -inch-diameter plastic <b>tube</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{truck was}} {{designed}} for distributing bait (cut carrots or grain) for mammal control. Baits are fed into the tube by an operator standing in the truck bed. The device is light-weight and detachable and permits rapid, accurate placement of bait along a line {{on the ground or}} in a plowed furrow...|$|R
50|$|The Brumaire-class {{submarines}} {{were armed}} with 17.7 in torpedoes, of which eight were carried. They had one 17.7 inch torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mounted</b> in the bow, with one torpedo loaded and one carried as a reload, and six carried externally. Of these four were in Drzewiecki drop collars {{and two in}} external cradles alongside the conning tower.|$|R
5000|$|In pyrotechnics, a flame {{projector}} is {{a special}} effects device that projects a column of flame upwards, for a short, determined and controllable, period, usually {{on the order of}} a few seconds. [...] The simplest form of flame projector is simply a vertical <b>tube</b> <b>mounted</b> on a base, containing powder and a hole for an electric match.|$|R
50|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear.

5|$|The {{design of}} the Ibuki class was a minor {{improvement}} over the last pair of the Mogami class after those ships had been upgraded during the late 1930s. The main improvement was {{the replacement of the}} triple torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mounts</b> in the older ships with quadruple mounts. They cost 60,000,000 yen each and had a crew of 54 officers and 822 enlisted men.|$|R
50|$|During World War I {{the class}} was {{equipped}} {{with one or two}} depth charge racks for the convoy escort mission. Also during World War I, the single torpedo tubes were replaced with two twin torpedo tubes on Truxton and Worden, with the number of torpedoes remaining at four. Whipple was modified with one twin torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mount</b> and four torpedoes at this time.|$|R
50|$|The Pluviôse-class {{submarines}} {{were armed}} with 17.7 in torpedoes, of which eight were carried. They had one 17.7 inch torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>mounted</b> in the bow, with one torpedo loaded and one carried as a reload, and six carried externally. Of these two were in Drzewiecki drop-collars and four in external cradles alongside the conning tower, two trained forward and two aft.|$|R
50|$|She shipped four Mk V QF (quick fire) 4-inch L/45 guns in four single center-line mounts. These were {{disposed}} as two {{forward and}} two aft in super imposed firing positions. She also carried one QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun aft {{of the second}} funnel. Aft of the 3-inch gun, she carried four 21-inch Torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>mounted</b> in pairs on the center-line.|$|R

It was determined that an underestimate by the Bureau of Engineering of the weight of a new machinery design was responsible, and that the Bureau of Construction and Repair did not have sufficient authority to detect or correct the error during the design process. Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison proposed consolidation of the design divisions of the two bureaus. When the bureau chiefs could not agree on how to do this, he replaced both chiefs in September 1939. The consolidation into the new Bureau of Ships was finally effected by a law passed by Congress on 20 June 1940.|$|R
