40|$|Mechanical rock {{excavators}} {{are widely}} used in the mining and civil industries. Estimating the performance of these machines can be difficult {{as well as a}} costly and time-consuming process. A number of methods exist to assess the <b>cuttability</b> of a rock, ranging from laboratory based cutting tests through to more convenient empirical approaches. Recent research has focussed on developing empirical relationships between rock cutting performance and rock properties involving an indirect assessment of <b>cuttability.</b> This paper outlines the results of a study to determine the level of correlation between the strength and <b>cuttability</b> for rock that is commonly associated with coal-measure formations. A resonable correlation was found between the uniaxial compressive strength and <b>cuttability</b> performance of rock samples, the latter including specific energy, cutting force and normal forces...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{chemical}} solutions {{have been}} shown to reduce the degradation effect of water on the material properties of rock and increase the strength and <b>cuttability</b> of clay-bearing rock. Consequently, there is potential for the application of chemical solutions to enhance the cutting performance of mechanical excavators and for maintaining ground stability in clay-bearing rocks that exist surrounding coal formations. A study investigated the effect of temperature of chemical solutions on rock properties. The temperatures ranged between 5 ⁰C and 40 ⁰C. It was found that temperature effect varied with different solutions. In the case of potassium chloride, there were changes in abrasivity, weatherability and <b>cuttability</b> of rock with temperature whereas the results were less consistent with magnesium chloride and copper sulphate solutions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>cuttability</b> {{of selected}} rocks in south-western (S/W) Nigeria. Rock samples from this region were tested for rebound hardness value, uniaxal compressive strength, and silica content using Schmidt hammer, 1100 KN compression machine and X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. These properties {{were correlated with}} the cutting rate of the rock samples. The regression carried out gives values of R 2 = 0. 863, R 2 = 0. 861 and R 2 = 0. 860 for cutting rate and rebound hardness value, uniaxal compressive strength and silica content, respectively. This shows {{that there is a}} strong linear relationship between the cutting rate and the three rock properties investigated.

40|$|Specific cutting energy (SE) {{has been}} widely {{used to assess the}} rock <b>cuttability</b> for {{mechanical}} excavation purposes. Some prediction models were developed for SE through correlating rock properties with SE values. However, some of the textural and compositional rock parameters i. e. texture coefficient and feldspar, mafic, and felsic mineral contents were not considered. The present study is to investigate the effects of previously ignored rock parameters along with engineering rock properties on SE. Mineralogical and petrographic analyses, rock mechanics, and linear rock cutting tests were performed on sandstone samples taken from sites around Ankara, Turkey. Relationships between SE and rock properties were evaluated using bivariate correlation and linear regression analyses. The tests and subsequent analyses revealed that the texture coefficient and feldspar content of sandstones affected rock <b>cuttability,</b> evidenced by significant correlations between these parameters and SE at a 90...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} {{relationship between}} the companies that produce multi-wire cutting machines and the stone slab producers {{is based on the}} classification of the rocks, mainly determined by the users themselves, that take into account the relative ease of cutting. This classification is principally based on the cutting speeds (feed and peripheral), which are obviously correlated with stone properties and cannot be evaluated before the working phase. The aim {{of this study is to}} use inexpensive and simple tests to make, before cutting, a <b>cuttability</b> prediction of the new stone in order to avoid dangerous and expensive cutting endeavors when an unknown stone is being worked upon. In order to predict stone workability, the results of ultrasonic pulse velocity and Knoop micro-hardness on 18 different types of stone was correlated. Seven classes were drawn as follows : from 1 (easier to cut rocks) to 7 (harder to cut rocks). The results of this rock <b>cuttability</b> scientific classification provide a good correlation with the industrial classificatio...|$|E
40|$|Many clay-bearing rocks {{will undergo}} changes in {{material}} properties after immersion in water. This is {{often accompanied by}} a reduction in strength and <b>cuttability</b> properties associated with increased degradation. In extreme cases such as with water active shales, {{it can lead to}} complete collapse or sloughing of the material. This can have important implications for Australian coal mining operations in terms of maintaining ground stability where clay-bearing rocks are in close proximity to coal formations. Previous research has examined whether chemical solutions containing potassium chloride and copper sulphate could arrest these changes in rock properties. While they provided encouraging results, they did not fully explore the effects of altering the exposure times or concentrations of chemical solutions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline the effect of changes in the concentration and exposure times of potassium chloride, magnesium chloride and copper sulphate solutions on clay-bearing rock. The Slake Durability Index Test was used to examine the degradation of a claystone after immersion in a range of chemical solutions at different concentrations. There was little quantitative change due in part to the low permeability of the rock. Qualitatively it was found however that degradation was exacerbated following immersion in a copper sulphate solution and to a lesser extent with magnesium chloride. Conversely, potassium chloride at all concentrations was found to reduce the degradation effects of water. Immersion of the test specimen in each of the solutions of potassium chloride, magnesium chloride and copper sulphate improved rock <b>cuttability</b> relative to dry, untreated rock...|$|E

40|$|In {{community}} detection, {{the theme}} of correctly identifying overlapping nodes, i. e. nodes which belong {{to more than one}} community, is important as it is related to role detection and to the improvement of the quality of clustering: proper detection of overlapping nodes gives {{a better understanding of the}} community structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel measure, called <b>cuttability,</b> that we show being useful for reliable detection of overlaps among communities and for improving the quality of the clustering, measured via modularity. The proposed algorithm shows better behaviour than existing techniques on the considered datasets (IRC logs and Enron e-mail log).

It also offers further advantages like less coal/mineral loss and less dilution, improved coal/mineral recovery with improved quality and finer fragment size which eliminates crushing. Surface miner {{can work in}} mining of limestone and coal with competitive cost if deployed judicially. The productivity of surface miner largely depends on the rock properties, machine configuration and application of surface miner. The rock properties are immutable and the machine configuration is one time decision of the higher management. Thus, mining engineer has to operate surface miner judicially to achieve the maximum production. In this paper, the development of computer software is presented, which helps mining engineer for selecting the surface miner based on <b>cuttability</b> index and the optimum mode of operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It {{is the key}} {{to guide}} rock-breaking design and {{engineering}} practice for how to obtain a reasonable test indicator to assess the <b>cuttability</b> of the rock. Some sandstone samples were tested by using the linear rock cutting machine in the school of mining engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. The curves characteristics for the weight percent of the broken debris with the mesh size distribution were obtained through the screening statistics. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the specimen broken debris was derived through theoretical calculations and statistical analysis. The results showed that the rock cutting fragmentation is of significant fractal features under the mechanical shock loads. The broken debris fractal dimension of the structural integrity specimens is bigger, the range of the fractal dimension is smaller and the broken debris size distribution is more even than that of the poor structural integrity specimens. The fractal dimension is the ideal test indicator to assess and analysis the rock-breaking degree...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in bio-based plastics due to environmental concerns as well as fluctuating oil and gas prices. Bio-based plastics, as defined here, are those plastics that are fully or partially produced from renewable feedstock. As with many products, sealing and cutting of semi-finished parts are required. This is particularly true with packaging applications, such as food packages, where there is a natural fit for bio-plastics because of the product 2 ̆ 7 s short life cycle (3 ̆c 1 year) and large amount of waste associated with this product (12. 5 million tons of containers and packaging per year). In order to increase the acceptance of polylactic acid (PLA a starch derived bioplastic), its weldability and <b>cuttability</b> was studied in detail. Ultrasonic and heat welding, which are two common welding techniques in industrial applications, are examined in terms of weld strength, cycle time, and weld strength consistency. While the ultrasonic welding of PLA is very effective, heat welding is examined in great detail to find the activation energy for diffusion in such processes. In addition, the ultrasonic cutting that is often done simultaneously with ultrasonic welding processes is examined here too. The <b>cuttability</b> of PLA was studied by examining the cutting speed, the mechanical properties of the material after cutting as well as the surface of the cut. In addition, a new kind of cutting tool was developed that can cut and seal simultaneously. However, the manufacturing of products from bio-based plastics may result in more energy consumption, waste, and emissions than traditional plastics, which would reduce or eliminate the acceptance of PLA. In order to address this issue, a model was generated to examine the `Carbon Footprint 2 ̆ 7 of bio-plastics such as zein (a corn based protein polymer), soy protein isolate (SPI) (a soy bean based protein polymer), and polylactic acid (PLA) which compares these materials to petroleum based plastics with similar mechanical properties and potentially similar applications, such as polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS). The results show the energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and costs during the life cycle steps of material production, manufacturing of plastic products, and the beneficial as well as non-beneficial effects of the end-of-life recovery processes of the considered materials...|$|E
40|$|Rock is a random-composite material, {{and rock}} cutting {{diamonds}} are randomly shaped tools. Based on this, a research {{program has been}} planned, starting from single diamond operation on actual rock specimens. Points to be elucidated are the forms of the mathematical linkages between cutting force, normal force, {{cross section of the}} kerf produced and rock micro-hardness; the last point, due to obvious scale effects, {{does not seem to be}} reasonably predictable from conventional geo-mechanical tests and macroscopic scale cutting tests, nor from conventional rock mechanics theories. Following a synthetic discussion of the problem, the experimental apparatus is described and the results of tests under different conditions are presented. These tests cover the range of the normal and tangential forces applied by a single diamond of a wire saw bead, on different rock types. The results are then analysed, and a mathematical model of the single diamond action, in a form suitable to the application to a simulation of the multi-diamond cutting tool, is presented.

Both traditional, state-of-the-art and possible materials and solutions beyond these have been investigated. Examples of these may be mineral wool, expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, polyurethane, vacuum insulation panels, gas insulation panels, aerogels, and future possibilities like vacuum insulation materials, nano insulation materials and dynamic insulation materials. Various properties, requirements and possibilities have been compared and studied. Among these are thermal conductivity, perforation vulnerability, building site adaptability and <b>cuttability,</b> mechanical strength, fire protection, fume emission during fire, robustness, climate ageing durability, resistance towards freezing/thawing cycles, water resistance, costs and environmental impact. Currently, there exist no single insulation material or solution capable of fulfilling all the requirements with respect to the most crucial properties. That is, for the buildings of today and the near future, several insulation materials and solutions are used and will have to be used depending on the exact circumstances and specifications. As of today, new materials and solutions like e. g. vacuum insulation panels are emerging, but only slowly introduced in the building sector partly due to their short track record. Therefore it will be of major importance to know the limitations and possibilities of all the insulation materials and solutions, i. e. their {{advantages and}} disadvantages. In this respect new conceptual thermal building insulation materials are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|When rock {{is deemed}} to be rippable, it is {{essential}} to classify how difficult to actually rip this rock on site. The rating on the difficulty is termed as rippability classification, and it is based on mass and material properties of the rock which contribute to its resistance against ripping. This paper highlights a study to establish a similar classification for quartzite which is based on specific energy (SE) and field production rate (Qr). To facilitate in analysis of data, the study area (located in Dengkil, Selangor) is divided into 6 panels (A to F). Collected data are grouped according to these panels. Laboratory assessments include verification on <b>cuttability</b> and strengths of the rock samples. Seismic survey and in situ ripping test were field appraisals conducted to assess rippability of the in situ quartzite. Analysis of data indicates that besides its material properties, rippability of quartzite can be evaluated using its SE. Ranging between 3. 19 and 6. 19 MJ/m 3, the SE is related to the Qr, which is between 147 and 292 m 3 /hr. For the six panels investigated, it is found that the higher the SE, the lower is the Qr (i. e. more difficult to rip). Based on the SE, Qr and horsepower of ripper dozer, rippability classification for the quartzite is established. This classification is essential for planning and costing of major earthworks, particularly in estimating capacity of ripper dozer and duration of earthwork...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 79 - 86 Abradable seals are {{employed}} in turbomachinery to reduce leakage gaps between stationary and rotating parts to improve efficiency and stall margin. Thermally sprayed abradable seals {{have been used in}} the compressor section of jet engines since the late 1960 s. These seals are predominantly coatings made from composite material that derive their abradability from the use of low shear strength materials or form a porous, friable coating structure. Due to the extreme temperatures on the turbine side of gas turbine engines, brazed or welded metallic structures made from nickel (Ni) based alloys have typically been used to provide gas path sealing. When thermal shock resistant ceramics because available, oxide ceramic, mostly zirconia based high temperature abradable seals for the high pressure turbine stages were developed. For the highest temperature stages, thermally sprayed oxide ceramics with or without metallic strain isolators are frequently used. On stages with reduced temperatures both ceramic and metallic coatings of the McrA 1 Y type can be used. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in compressor and turbine clearance control materials and systems, whereby a focus is placed on novel thermally sprayed ceramic turbine seals with encouraging property combinations, which are achieved by the introduction of alternative stabilizers. Normally ceramic seal surfaces require hard tipping of the rotor blades to allow them to cut properly and suitable hard tipping solutions will be presented. However, examples will be given of recent developments aimed at developing ceramic abradables that can be but by untipped blades. Examples will be given. Finally, the paper gives an overview of <b>cuttability</b> of thermally sprayed metallic turbine seal coatings by tipped and untipped blades at high temperature...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} Thesis is {{to examine}} how the rock mass and intact rock {{properties}} influence the excavatability of rock in surface mine. One {{of the most important}} decisions in the design of surface mine is the selection of mine equipment and plant. Now that increasing effort is being invested in the design and manufacture of continuous surface miners it is appropriate to examine how their performance can be related to the physical properties of the rock mass and intact rock. Over the years many {{attempts have been made to}} develop a means of assessing the excavatability of rock. Most of them are based on an empirical rating system whilst some authorities still propose the use of seismic velocity as a direct predictor of the rippability of a rock mass. On the other hand there are a number of classical models which have been developed to define the cutting force required at the pick or tooth of continuous miners. Whilst these methods have been applied with various degrees of success to the design of excavation systems there is no generally acceptable method of defining the excavatability or <b>cuttability</b> of a rock mass in terms of the machine power required to generate a particular rate of production. An attempt is made to overcome this deficiency by recording the intact and rock mass properties at Limestone quarry in Retznei, Austria; Openpit Gold Mines in Meekatharra and Mt Gibson of Western Australia and Openpit Coal Mine in Air Laya, Indonesia, where VASM- 2 D and Bucket Wheel Excavator O&K SchRs(800 / 1. 2) 15 or O&K S 630 were in use in the first mine sites and Air Laya respectively to use this data to examine the relationships between the relevant dimensionless groups developed from a dimensional analysis of the problem. The dimensionless groups are obtained by examining the factors which influence the productivity of a surface miner. These include intact rock and rock ++mass properties, and machine power required for a particular rate of production and lead to the development of dimensionless groups namely, Rock <b>Cuttability</b> Index (RCI), Rock Mass Factor (RMF), Brittleness Index (BI), Rock Excavatability Index. The monitoring of machine power was carried out at Mt. Gibson and Air Laya mines. As a part of this study, field seismic tests were carried out at Mt. Gibson and Air Laya with the intention of seeking the most appropriate method of this type of test and analysis for excavation purposes. The test results indicate that borehole tests are the most promising and the output of seismic velocity obtained from a built-in program seismograph needs further thorough examination. The analysis of field data at all the sites proved that the most appropriate measure of discontinuities in the rock mass is the mean distance between discontinuities in a direction parallel to the cutting direction of the machine. Since the lateritic rock mass is different to other ordinary rock masses, a modified RMR is proposed. This is done by adjusting classification criteria on spacing and condition of discontinuity. The results proved that the discontinuity spacing obtained from the proposed method warrants wide application of the power cutting model developed. The RMR, Q-System and Excavatability Index are used to assess the performance of the continuous surface miners investigated. The results indicated that the Excavatability Index is the most acceptable criterion for the excavatability assessment. The outcome of this research has confirmed the significance of the RCI as a predictor of cutting performance of mechanical machines. The relationship between the RCI and REI can be used to good effect in analysing the performance of operating machines. A good example of this is given in the analysis of the performance of the BWE at the Mae Moh mine in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSurface miners {{made their}} debut in Indian surface mining {{industry}} in 1996 on a limestone deposit. The application of surface miner was extended for coal mining {{in the year}} 1999. Presently, more than 100 surface miners are working in Indian surface mines owing to its higher productivity and environment-friendliness. Presently, surface miner is also experimented for excavation of different deposits, namely, bauxite, hematite, sandstone, shale etc. Initially, the surface miners were being deployed largely on trial and error basis or {{on the basis of}} in-field experimental runs. Manufacturers evaluated the applicability of surface miners based on compressive strength of rock. Recently, a <b>cuttability</b> index has been developed to predict the applicability and performance of surface miners for different application condition. This enables the user to select a suitable machine as per their requirement. Surface miner completely eliminates drilling blasting and primary crushing unit and thus reduces their associated environmental hazards. Apart from this, the sized excavated material increases the transport/conveying efficiency and thus saves the energy requirement in transportation. Application of surface miner with proper planning yields better efficiency. The planning can be categorized into two parts, namely, short term and long term planning. Short term planning is within the control of field engineer and is carried out to achieve the steady production rate and quality control. Short term planning is carried out to select the operating mode, place of operation etc. Surface miner can allow a steep slope angle. As the blasting (short term stress) is eliminated the factor of safety for the pit slope can be kept low. This reduces the stripping ratio and increases the overall productivity of the mine. These are the essential consideration for long term planning with surface miner. This present paper would discuss the Indian experience of surface miner operation on the above issues. The benefits of the deployment and the challenges faced during operation have been discussed in this paper. The recent research and development carried out in this area is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{optimize}} different operational parameters, such as the nozzle diameter, traverse velocity, standoff distance, and pump pressure, with reference to cutting efficiency parameters, namely, depth and width of cut, in the cutting operation using a pure water jet on Sardinian basalt samples. Width of cut, which has not been previously mentioned in literature, was used as the second cutting efficiency parameter in this study. Also, 37 water jet cutting tests on Sardinian basalt samples were carried out based on the factorial design of the experiment at two levels and with the four operational parameters given above using Design Expert 7. 0. In addition to these cutting tests, control and repetition tests were also performed and in total, 72 cutting operations were made in this study. The two-factor interaction (2 FI) model was developed utilizing experimental measurements for the depth and width of cut after performing 37 cutting operations. The adequacy of the predicted regression model equations was tested using the very well-known method of analysis of variance. These model equations were used to optimize the operational parameters for the desired depth and width of cut. <b>Cuttability</b> charts indicating the optimum working point with respect to the depth and width of cut for Sardinian basalt samples were developed and presented in this study. These charts could be of help in the natural stone industry in terms of a more efficient usage of the water jet cutting machine. As a result of this study, the optimum values of working parameters for Sardinian basalt stone samples were found to be 0. 8 mm for the nozzle diameter, 90 MPa for the pressure, 5 mm for the standoff distance, and 4 m/min for the traverse velocity for the pure water jet cutting system. In these optimum cutting conditions, a depth of 7. 694 mm and a width of 1. 986 mm were predicted to be the cutting values. These values go well with the measurements...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{prediction}} {{models for}} partial face mechanical excavators, when developed in laboratory conditions, depend on relating {{the results of}} a set of rock property tests and indices to specific cutting energy (SE) for various rock types. There exist some studies in the literature aiming to correlate the geotechnical properties of intact rocks with the SE, especially for massive and widely jointed rock environments. However, those including direct and/or indirect measures of rock fracture parameters such as rock brittleness and fracture toughness, along with the other rock parameters expressing different aspects of rock behavior under drag tools (picks), are rather limited. With this study, it was aimed to investigate the relationships between the indirect measures of rock brittleness and fracture toughness and the SE depending on {{the results of a}} new and two previous linear rock cutting programmes. Relationships between the SE, rock strength parameters, and the rock index tests have also been investigated in this study. Sandstone samples taken from the different fields around Ankara, Turkey were used in the new testing programme. Detailed mineralogical analyses, petrographic studies, and rock mechanics and rock cutting tests were performed on these selected sandstone specimens. The assessment of rock <b>cuttability</b> was based on the SE. Three different brittleness indices (B 1, B 2, and B 4) were calculated for sandstones samples, whereas a toughness index (T-i), being developed by Atkinson et al. (1), was employed to represent the indirect rock fracture toughness. The relationships between the SE and the large amounts of new data obtained from the mineralogical analyses, petrographic studies, rock mechanics, and linear rock cutting tests were evaluated by using bivariate correlation and curve fitting techniques, variance analysis, and Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test. Rock cutting and rock property testing data that came from well-known studies of McFeat-Smith and Fowell(2) and Roxborough and Philips(3) have also been employed in statistical analyses together with the new data. Laboratory tests and subsequent analyses revealed that there were close correlations between the SE and B 4 whereas no statistically significant correlation has been found between the SE and T-i. Uniaxial compressive and Brazilian tensile strengths and Shore scleroscope hardness of sandstones also exhibited strong relationships with the SE. NCB cone indenter test had the greatest influence on the SE among the other engineering properties of rocks, confirming the previous studies in rock cutting and mechanical excavation. Therefore, it was recommended to employ easy-to-use index tests of NCB cone indenter and Shore scleroscope in the estimation of laboratory SE of sandstones ranging from very low to high strengths {{in the absence of a}} rock cutting rig to measure it until the easy-to-use universal measures of the rock brittleness and especially the rock fracture toughness, being an intrinsic rock property, are developed...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{machining}} processes for cutting {{of ceramic materials}} due to the material are very time consuming and expensive, while {{some of them have}} limited geometrical flexibility. Laser beam cutting offers itself as an alternative, while the ND:YAG laser, contrary to CO_ 2 lasers, warrants expectations of reduced thermal impact and hence improved machining qualities. Similarly foreseeable are advantages for the cutting of light metals and super alloys using the Nd:YAG laser, which among others are due to their wavelengths and high pulse powers. Only little experience with regard to solid state laser cutting is available for the above materials. The objective of this project is to develop fundamental knowledge concerning the suitability of various Nd:YAG laser systems for the cutting of light metals, super alloys and ceramics, and concerning their influence on process efficiency and machining quality. For this purpose, extensive cutting tests were carried out using representative materials, and the results were assessed with regard to the objectives stated. Improved absorption of the Nd:YAG radiation for TiAl 6 V 4 and various aluminum alloys of small sheet thicknesses observed during laser beam cutting using Nd:YAG lasers was due to the shorter wavelength as compared to the CO_ 2 laser. With an optimized ratio of the Rayleigh length to the sheet thickness and with an identical cutting gap width, the Nd:YAG laser produces high cutting speeds in the sheet thickness range up to 2 mm. The stated cutting method produces lower cutting surface roughnesses in the cw mode than it does in the pulsed mode. The cutting efficiency, i. e. the maximum achievable cutting speed as a function of mean laser power, can be optimized by adaptation of the laser/optical fiber system. The applicable variation ranges of process parameters were determined for the ceramics under investigation. Purposeful adaptation of these parameters permits a sufficient cutting quality for almost all engineering ceramics in pulsed mode of operation under the condition that fixed lens systems are used for beam guidance. The degraded beam quality {{associated with the use of}} optical fibers having a core diameter of 600 #mu#m limits the <b>cuttability</b> to tough ceramics such as Si_ 3 N_ 4. Similarly, the high thermal load during cw operation limits the range of cuttable materials. Laser induced crack damage can be reduced by appropriate adjustment of the pulse parameters. The results with regard to industrial application show the capabilities and limitations of Nd:YAG laser cutting with different beam guidance systems for the materials under investigation. (orig.)
