5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} the {{cyclic behaviour}} of an external diaphragm connection between steel I-beam and circular hollow section column. The proposed joint includes two diaphragm plates welded {{to the outer}} circumference of the column and bolted to the beam flanges with two tapered <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> were integrated in the connection to act as replaceable links after seismic actions. A series of full-scale laboratory experiments of the joint was conducted to investigate its energy dissipation and hysteretic response. The <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> used in the experimental work had the same geometry but differed from each other on steel grade, bolt-holes size, use of stiffeners and bolts’ preloading force.

2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E
50|$|The MAE {{consisted}} of a small gallium-arsenide solar cell mounted underneath a removable glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> As the mission progressed, atmospheric dust would settle on the glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate,</b> blocking increasingly more sunlight from striking the solar cell, causing it to produce less power.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} has been conducted to study the behavior of a new type of GFRP-to-steel bolted joint. Two types of GFRP-to-steel bolted joints were investigated in this paper including ordinary GFRP-to-steel bolted joint (specimen JO) which only use bolts and washers and stiffer GFRP-to-steel bolted joint (specimen JS) reinforced with epoxy and steel <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> The observed failure modes of the two types of connections were always the failure of the pultruded GFRP profiles. The data of applied load and displacement of representative specimens were obtained during the tests. Test results indicated that specimen JS exhibited an increase of 422 % in the mean initial stiffness, 61. 9 % in the average joint strength and 12. 6 % in the mean joint efficiency, respectively, over specimen JO, therefore it can be stated that the behavior of specimen JS is superior to the performance of specimen JO. Meanwhile, it is also found that the performance of the interface between GFRP shape and <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> {{is one of the key}} factors that affects the behavior of specimen JS due to the fact that the ultimate failure took place as soon as debonding occurred between GFRP element and <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> Furthermore, the influence of the slip factor on the slip load was also studied...|$|R
50|$|The {{mouth was}} {{located at the}} summit of the theca. Radiating like flower petals from the center were five food grooves, or ambulacra. Each ambulacrum had many long, thin, fine {{structures}} called brachioles, which were used to trap food particles and bring them to the mouth. Brachioles were delicate structures, and in fossils are not usually preserved in place. A series of five spiracle plates surrounded the star-shaped mouth, which included the anus, mouth and entrances to a set of five complex, folded respiratory organs known as hydrospires. These spiracles prevented mixing of the various fluids. Waste elimination was through the anispiracle, an opening formed by the fusing of anus and adjacent spiracles.Like crinoids, blastoids were high-level, stalked suspension feeders (feeding mainly on planktonic organisms) that inhabited clear-to-silty, moderately agitated ocean waters from shelf to basin. The food gathering system of blastoids consisted of several types of ambulacra. Food entered the brachiolar ambulacra, was transferred to the side ambulacra through the brachiolar pit, then transferred to the main (median) ambulacra, and finally entered the mouth. Each of these ambulacra was roofed by <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> of the brachiolar groove were movable and could open, allowing food to enter, or close as needed. Other <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> may also have been movable.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThe {{study of}} {{three-dimensional}} open cavity flow {{with and without}} <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> {{at the edges of}} the cavity at freestream Mach number of 0. 85 was performed. Such open cavities find their application in landing gear wells, bomb bay of an airplane and sunroof or window of an automobile. The aerodynamic noise and the flow field together in the above mentioned cavities lead to self-sustaining flow oscillations. These self-sustaining flow oscillations results in the structural failure in the surrounding of the cavity due to resonance phenomenon in the aircrafts and lead to loud and unbearable noise both in aircrafts and automobiles. Understanding this aeroacoustic phenomenon helps us in reducing the noise, increase the component stability and passenger comfort. Therefore, this problem has become an important topic of research for several decades in aerospace and automobile fields. In this thesis an effort was made to investigate the fully developed turbulent flow over an open cavity and to evaluate the effect of <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> numerically using the detached eddy simulation (DES) formulation. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics approach was utilized on the M 219 cavity at Mach 0. 85 using DES with the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) turbulence model. Two cavity cases were modeled. The test case 1 is a three-dimensional open cavity without <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> and the test case 2 is a three-dimensional open cavity with <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> {{at the edges of the}} cavity. Furthermore, three variants of DES were considered for the test case 2 cavity namely Spalart- Allmaras, k-ω-SST and realizable k-ε model, whereas for the test case 1 cavity only the DES S-A model was employed...|$|R
