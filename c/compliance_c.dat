50|$|Marston was {{a lawyer}} and a psychologist; he {{also contributed to the}} first {{polygraph}} test, authored self-help books and created the character Wonder Woman. His major contribution to psychology came when he generated the DISC characteristics of emotions and behavior of normal people. Marston, after conducting research on human emotions, published his findings in his 1928 book called Emotions of Normal People in which he explained that people illustrate their emotions using four behavior types: Dominance (D), Inducement (I), Submission (S), and <b>Compliance</b> (<b>C).</b> Also, he argued that these behavioral types came from people's sense of self and their interaction with the environment. He included two dimensions that influenced people's emotional behavior. The first dimension is whether a person views his environment as favorable or unfavorable. The second dimension is whether a person perceives himself as having control or lack of control over his environment. His work was the foundation of the DISC assessment that has been used by more than 50 million people since it was first introduced in 1972.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the quality of practice offered by nurses to patients who underwent surgical incision into the abdomen (post-laparotomy) at tertiary hospitals (Kamuzu, Mzuzu, Queen Elizabeth and Zomba) in Malawi. The study design was descriptively cross sectional and utilized a quantitative data collection and analysis method. All available 48 registered nurses in the surgical ward of four central hospitals and 100 patients that were admitted in the ward during the time of study were recruited. A 3 -point scale rating consisting of <b>compliance</b> (<b>C</b> = 1), partial <b>compliance</b> (<b>C</b> 1. 0 - 0. 5) and non <b>compliance</b> (<b>C</b> 0. 5 - 0. 0) was used to describe the nurse midwives compliance with the process standards of care. Results show that nurses in all the 4 central hospitals partially complied with assessment and planning standards. During assessment, the nurses assessed the physical aspects of care but did not assess the psychological, spiritual and cultural aspects of care. At planning the nurses assigned and delegated tasks based on the knowledge and skills of the provider selected but did not comply with factors related to safety, effectiveness and cost of care. All the facilities fully complied with implementation standard because they implemented care in a safe and appropriate manner and communicated with patients/ significant others and other health care providers. However, regarding systematic and ongoing evaluation of patients’ condition only Mzuzu Central hospital partially complied while the rest of the facilities were not compliant.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the in vitro {{mechanical}} properties of the equine trachea submitted to the compressive pressures observed in vivo, the pressure-volume relationship was determined in intra- and extra-thoracic tracheal segments taken post mortem from 29 healthy horses (one to 15 years old; 352 to 651 kg). At the same time, the cross-sectional lumen area (X-SA) at the mid-point of the segment was measured using a slit-lamp transillumination and photographic measurement by endoscopy. The tracheal specific <b>compliance</b> (<b>Cs)</b> {{as well as the}} relative changes in X-SA and in the sagittal and transverse diameters, for intraluminal pressures from 5 to - 5 kPa, were calculated. The extrathoracic tracheal Cs was 0. 060 +/- 0. 002 kPa- 1 and, at an intraluminal pressure of - 5 kPa, X-SA was reduced to about 73 per cent of its resting value. The intrathoracic segments were more compliant and, at similar compressive pressure, their X-SA was more reduced. These data show that the equine tracheal compliance is high and suggest that the increase in pulmonary resistance observed during strenuous exercise may be partly explained by a partial tracheal collapse.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{response}} of driving pressure/flow ration on an abrupt change in heart rate was analysed. The difference between the response obtained with constant pressure and constant flow perfusion was also studied. The responses show a fast initial reversed phase followed by a slow phase caused by regulation. To test whether the initial phase could {{be the result of}} mechanical changes in the coronary circulation, a model for regulation was extended by the addition of four different mechanical models originating from the literature. These extended models were able to explain the fast initial phase. However, the mechanical model consisting of an intramyocardial <b>compliance</b> (<b>C</b> = 0. 08 ml mm Hg- 1 100 g- 1) with a variable venous resistance, and the model consisting of a waterfall and a small <b>compliance</b> (<b>C</b> = 0. 007 ml mm Hg- 1 100 g- 1) both explained these responses best.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{determine}} whether arterial compliance {{of patients with}} type 1 diabetes is reduced before the development of clinically apparent diabetes complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Pulse-wave {{analysis was used to}} compare vascular compliance between patients with type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic control subjects. Analysis of covariance was used to determine {{differences between the two groups}} with adjust-ment for age if needed. RESULTS — A total of 59 patients with type 1 diabetes were studied; age ranged from 17 – 61 years. Of the 59 patients, 32 had no evidence of diabetes complications and 27 had microvas-cular complications. The control group consisted of 57 healthy subjects ranging in age from 23 – 79 years.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} whether the Penh index, measured using whoie body barometric piethysmography, {{can be used as}} a screening parameter to evaluate the airway reactivity and the intensity of the pulmonary response to endotoxins. Penh was firstly recorded in non-sedated freeiy moving piglets exposed (1) to a nebulized acetylchoiine (Ach) pre-treated or not with cienbuterol, or (2) to endotoxin challenge. To measure Penh simultaneously with total pulmonary resistance (RL), dynamic <b>compliance</b> (<b>cd</b> 1) and intrapleural pressure changes (MaxPpl), an oesophageal balloon catheter technique was used and the piglets were anaesthetised. The recordings were performed during (1) an intravenous metacholine (Mch) challenge and (2) in endotoxin-exposed animais. In freely moving animais, Ach induced a significant dose-dependent increase in Penh, which was significantly blocked by clenbuterol. Endotoxin instillation aiso resulted in a significant rise in Penh while the corresponding response measured under anaesthesia was signiflcantly and positively correlated with RL and MaxzPpi. Similar results were obtained during Mch challenge but the Penh was negatively correlated with Cd.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for the inverse kinetostatic analysis of compliant four-bar linkages with flexible circular joints and pseudo-rigid bodies. The theory of curved beams {{has been applied to}} the flexible parts and a novel closed form symbolic expression is presented for the <b>compliance</b> matrix <b>C,</b> which maps the generalized forces and relative displacements for the free section of the curved beam with respect to the framed one. This matrix has been checked by using commonly use Finite Element Analysis package, with good agreement. Then, the theory of planar displacement matrices has been applied in order to solve the static balance of the whole system. The method could be applied also to different mechanisms with different topologies and different flexural pivots, providing that the <b>compliance</b> matrix <b>C</b> and the whole system balance equations are properly modified. Results presented herein are believed to be useful for two reasons: firstly, because it is possible to determine quickly the values of the whole sets of externally applied forces for a given pose, under quasi-static condition; secondly, because such a fast method allows analyzing several series of adjacent poses. In the paper, how this opportunity has been sized in order to achieve new knowledge about the modeling of a compliant four-bar linkages via pseudo-rigid-body model approximation has been described.

40|$|A high {{resolution}} echo-tracking system permits {{the calculation of}} cross-sectional compliance considering vessel diameter variations alone, and assumes that longitudinal movement of the vessel wall due to pulse pressure is negligible. However, using piezoelectric crystals sutured on the adventitia of the vessel wall we demonstrated that arterial length changes up to 5 % (mean 2. 7 %) {{as a function of}} pulse pressure. Therefore, cross-sectional compliance seems to provide a limited approximation of the real phenomenon because it neglects axial vessel movement. Axial vessel movement is taken into account when the vessel compliance is calculated according to the principle of continuity of the mass: [equation: see text]. To verify this hypothesis we measured the blood flow gradient through 10 cm long segments of 10 pig carotid arteries (Qin - Qout) and divided it for the derivative of blood pressure over a given time (deltaP/deltat). For the same vessels, we calculated the cross-sectional compliance (CC) using the echo-tracking system (NIUS 02). We found a CC of (5. 91 +/- 0. 4) x 10 (- 7) micro m(2) /mm Hg and a segmental carotid compliance or dynamic <b>compliance</b> (<b>C(d))</b> of (6. 21 +/- 0. 2) x 10 (- 8) micro m(3) /mm Hg.

Fifteen patients received CPT (vibration, percussion, or palm-cup percussion) in addition to the routine CPT in a randomized order. Another 15 patients, contraindicated for the percussion technique, received routine CPT including manual hyperinflation and position change, and were observed as a comparative group. The effects of CPT were evaluated by measuring the volume of aspirated secretions and the dynamic lung <b>compliance</b> (<b>Cd)</b> over time. For the adverse effects, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) was recorded. Cd and SpO 2 were recorded at the baseline period, immediately after the physiotherapy treatment, and at 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes posttreatment. ResultsThe volume of collected secretions did not differ significantly when compared between the groups (p =. 838). Cd increased significantly over time in the manual percussion (p =. 042) and palm-cup percussion (p =. 046) group, where Cd in the latter remained elevated twice longer than in the former.
