5000|$|In later literature, a {{character}} sketch became {{a short story}} or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as {{the purpose of the}} writing is solely to present {{a character}} at his or her typical. Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of [...] "Big John" [...] or [...] "the country rube" [...] or [...] "the wise Squire").

50|$|Schumpeter’s {{concept is}} a {{synthesis}} of three different notions of the entrepreneur: risk bearer, innovator and a coordinator cum manager. He assigned the role of innovator to the entrepreneur, driving economic growth {{through a process of}} creative destruction, and not to the capitalist. Capitalists supply capital while entrepreneurs innovate. He stated that ’whatever the type, everyone is an entrepreneur only when he actually carries out a new combination and loses that character as soon as he has built up his business, when he settles to running it as other people run their business’. The focus here is not on a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>person,</b> but on a function. He was perhaps influenced by his family history.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn narratology, the {{grammatical}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> {{remains to}} be studied {{from the perspective of}} the reader. This article focuses on a particular type of first-person narrative, a type of " interior monologue " in the present tense, via Arthur Schnitzler's short stories Leutnant Gustl (1901) and Fräulein Else (1924). This type of monologue denies the reader's existence within the text (the reader is un-ratified, a reader-voyeur) yet forces the participation of the real reader (who becomes a reader-actor, the only vehicle that brings the silent " voice " of the protagonist to life). I propose to replace the notion of " cooperative reader " (Eco 1979) by that of " unratified/complicit reader ". The simulated immediacy of the deictic I functions as a powerful conveyor of projection and identification of the reader with the protagonist...|$|E

40|$|In this essay, {{we notice}} that the {{priority}} of persons, the unbridgeable political gap between persons and mere things, corresponds to a special sort of moral and legal treatment for persons, namely, as irreplaceable individuals. Normative language that conflates the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> with fungible kinds of being can thus appear to justify destroying and replacing human beings, just as we do with things. Lethal consequences may result, for example, from a common but improper extension of the word “value” to persons. The attitude and act called “respect” brings forth much more adequately than “value” the distinctively individual priority of persons, allowing our common humanity to be a reason for each person’s separate significance. Unless {{we focus on the}} respect-worthiness of human life rather than on its value, {{we will not be able}} to argue coherently against those who think its destruction permissible...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} the dissymmetry between deictic expression and denoting expression under {{the frame of}} Markedness Theory, in terms of which the opposition between marked term and unmarked term is motivated by cognitive and pragmatic factors. The paper first distinguishes deictic expression from denoting expression, and then defines the dissymmetry between deictic expression and denoting expression in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> deixis. Finally, the paper explores the pragmatic and cognitive motivations for the dissymmetry under the frame of Markedness Theory. Examples in this paper reveal that, {{in the course of}} people’s cognition, participants take themselves as reference points to achieve referring, and the dissymmetry of the use of person deixis is determined by its accessibility in speakers’ mind; from the pragmatic angle, observing pragmatic principles is another reason for the dissymmetry between deictic expression and denoting expression in person deixis...|$|E
40|$|Since all {{languages}} have ways {{of referring}} to the person speaking and the person being addressed, some have been misled into thinking that the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> works {{in the same manner}} in all languages. Recognition that pronouns work differently in some East Asian languages is usually limited to observations about the number of different words used to refer to the speaker and addressee. This paper looks at the ways that Vietnamese speakers use words to refer to themselves and their addressees. The system that emerges is complex and dynamic. It makes use of both transreferential deictic words (that refer to participants in the speech act) as well as non-deictic words that only refer to individuals in terms of characteristics of the conversational participants such as age, sex and social role and the relationship between interlocutors...|$|E
