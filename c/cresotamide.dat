40|$|A novel concept, 2 ̆ 01 cdrug {{evolution}} 2 ̆ 01 d, {{is proposed}} to develop chemical libraries {{that have a}} high probability of finding drugs or drug candidates. It converts biological evolution into chemical evolution. In this paper, we present 2 ̆ 01 chybridization 2 ̆ 01 d drug evolution, which {{is the equivalent of}} sexual recombination of parental genomes in biological evolution. The hybridization essentially shuffles the building blocks of the parent drugs and ought to drug(s); no drug evolution can otherwise occur. We hybridized two drugs, benzocaine and metoclopramide and generated 16 molecules that include the parent drugs, four known drugs, and two molecules whose therapeutic activities are reported. The unusually high number of drugs and drug candidates in the library encourages high expectations of finding new drug(s) or drug candidate(s) within the remaining eight compounds. Interestingly, the therapeutic applications of the eight drugs or drug candidates in the library are fairly diverse as 38 therapeutic applications and 25 molecular targets are counted. Therefore, the library fits as a general chemical library for unspecified therapeutic activities. The hybridization of other two drugs, aspirin and <b>cresotamide,</b> is also described to demonstrate the generality of the method. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
