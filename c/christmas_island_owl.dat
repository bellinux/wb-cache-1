40|$|Non-native {{species are}} invading foreign {{ecosystems}} {{at a rate}} that has never been seen before, and they cause significant damage to these ecosystems. In order to preserve species diversity, these invasive organisms are often eradicated. Typically, conservation biologists run a cost-benefit analysis to determine what action they should take. In this project, I identify the need to also conduct ethical analyses. I chose three scenarios in which invasive species are eradicated: yellow crazy ants on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island,</b> barred <b>owls</b> in the Pacific Northwest, and leafy spurge in the central United States. Each of these scenarios was analyzed using two ethical theories: utilitarianism and biophilia. Ultimately, {{whether or not it is}} permissible to eradicate invasive species depends on the specific details of the situation. In most cases, it is permissible to use lethal control measures when it is the most cost-efficient option, or the fastest way to prevent future suffering. Additionally, lethal control is permissible when it is necessary to do so in order to preserve the biodiversity found within the ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{composition}} of the <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> (Indian Ocean) ant fauna is reviewed, leading to the recognition of 52 species in 24 genera and 7 subfamilies. This account amalgamates previously published records and recent extensive surveys of <b>Christmas</b> <b>Islands</b> ant fauna. Eight species represent new records for Christmas Island: Technomyrmex vitiensis, Camponotus sp. (novaehollandiae group), Cardiocondyla kagutsuchi, Monomorium orientale, M. cf. subcoecum, Tetramorium cf. simillimum, T. smithi and T. walshi. Although some of these new species records represent recent taxonomic advances rather than new introductions, we consider four species to be true new records to <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> These include Camponotus sp. (novaehollandiae group), M. orientale, T. smithi and T. walshi. None of the 52 species reported here are considered endemic. In general, the <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> ant fauna is composed of species that are regarded as worldwide tramps, or that are widespread in the Indo-Australian region. However, <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> may fall within the native range {{of some of these}} species. We provide a key to the ant species of <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> (based on the worker caste), supplemented by comprehensive distribution maps of these ants on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> and a short synopsis of each species in relation to their ecology and world-wide distribution. Because of the large number of world-wide tramp ants on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island,</b> this key may also prove applicable for introduced species resident on other oceanic islands...|$|R
