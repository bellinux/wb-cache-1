40|$|Recently, it {{was found}} that if either the TATA binding protein or RNA {{polymerase}} II holoenzyme is artificially tethered to a promoter, transcription is activated. This finding provided presumptive evidence that upstream activating proteins function by recruiting <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preinitiation complex (PIC) to the promoter. To date, however, there have been no studies demonstrating that upstream factors actually recruit <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PIC to the promoter in vivo. Therefore, we have studied <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> action of two disparate transactivating domains. We present a series of in vivo functional assays that demonstrate that each of these proteins targets different <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PIC for recruitment. We show that, by targeting different <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PIC for recruitment, these activating domains can cooperate with each other to activate transcription synergistically and that, even within one protein, two different activating subdomains can activate transcription synergistically by cooperating to recruit different <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PIC. Finally, considering our work together with previous studies, we propose that certain transcription factors both recruit <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PIC and facilitate steps in transcriptional activation that occur subsequent to recruitment...|$|R
