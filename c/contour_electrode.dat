OBJECTIVE: The aim of these studies was to investigate the insertion properties and safety of a new intracochlear perimodiolar electrode array design (Contour). BACKGROUND: An electrode array positioned close to the neural elements could be expected to reduce stimulation thresholds and might potentially reduce channel interaction. METHODS: Two sequential studies were conducted. In study 1, the <b>Contour</b> <b>electrode</b> array was inserted in 12 human temporal bones. After cochlear surface preparation, the position of the array was noted and the basilar membrane was examined for insertion damage. On the basis of the outcome of this temporal bone study, study 2 investigated the Contour array, mounted on a Nucleus CI- 24 M device and implanted in three adult patients. RESULTS: Study I showed that in 10 temporal bones, the Contour array was positioned close to the modiolus, and the basilar membrane was intact. In the two remaining bones, the arrays had pierced the basilar membrane and were positioned in the scala vestibuli apical to the penetration. Statistical analysis showed an equivalent probability of insertion-induced damage of the two array designs. In study 2, image analysis indicated that the Contour electrodes were positioned closer to the modiolus than the standard Nucleus straight array. Lower T and C levels, but higher impedance values, were recorded from electrodes close to the modiolus. Initial speech perception data showed that all patients gained useful open-set speech perception, two patients achieving scores of 100 % on sentence material 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal bone studies showed the <b>Contour</b> <b>electrode</b> array to be generally positioned closer to the modiolus than the standard Nucleus straight array, and to have an equivalent probability of causing insertion-induced damage.

OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} mechanisms {{and nature of}} intracochlear damage associated with cochlear implant electrode array insertion, in particular, the various perimodiolar electrode designs. Make recommendations regarding surgical techniques for the Nucleus <b>Contour</b> <b>electrode</b> to ensure correct position and minimal insertion trauma. BACKGROUND: The potential advantages of increased modiolar proximity of intracochlear multichannel electrode arrays are a reduction in stimulation thresholds, an increase in dynamic range and more localized neural excitation. This may improve speech perception and reduce power consumption. These advantages may be negated if increased intracochlear damage results from the method used to position the electrodes close to the modiolus. METHOD: A review of the University of Melbourne Department of Otolaryngology experience with temporal bone safety studies using the Nucleus standard straight electrode array {{and a variety of}} perimodiolar electrode array designs; comparison with temporal bone insertion studies from other centres and postmortem histopathology studies reported in the literature. Review of our initial clinical experience using the Nucleus <b>Contour</b> <b>electrode</b> array. RESULTS: The nature of intracochlear damage resulting from electrode insertion trauma ranges from minor, localized, spiral ligament tear to diffuse organ of Corti disruption and osseous spiral lamina fracture. The type of damage depends on the mechanical characteristics of the electrode array, the stiffness, curvature and size of the electrode in relation to the scala, and the surgical technique. The narrow, flexible, straight arrays are the least traumatic. Pre-curved or stiffer arrays are associated with an incidence of basilar membrane perforation. The cochleostomy must be correctly sited in relation to the round window to ensure scala tympani insertion. A cochleostomy anterior to the round window rather than inferior may lead to scala media or scala vestibuli insertion. CONCLUSION: Proximity of electrodes to the modiolus can be achieved without intracochlear damage provided the electrode array is a free fit within the scala, of appropriate size and shape, and accurate scala tympani insertion is performed.

40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Otology & Neurotology 2001. This version is reproduced with permission of Lippincott Wilkins & Williams. Objective: This study describes the application of a new radiographic imaging modality, phase-contrast radiography, to in vitro human temporal bone imaging and investigates it use in the development of new electrode arrays for cochlear implants. Background: The development of perimodiolar electrode arrays for cochlear implants requires detailed information from postoperative radiologic assessment on the position of the array in relation to the cochlear structures. Current standard radiographic techniques provide only limited details. Materials and Methods: Nucleus standard electrode arrays and perimodiolar <b>Contour</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays were implanted into the scala tympani of 11 human temporal bones. Both conventional and phase-contrast radiographs were taken of each temporal bone for comparative purposes. Results: Phase-contrast imaging provides better visulization of anatomic details of the inner ear and {{of the structure of the}} intracochlear electrode array, and better definition of electrode location in relation to cochlear walls. Conclusion: Phase-contrast radiography offers significant improvement over conventional radiography in images of in vitro human temporal bones. It seems to be a valuable tool in the development of intracochlear electrode arrays and cochlear implant research. However, this new radiographic technique still requires certain computational and physics challenges to be addressed before its clinical use can be established. Open Acces...|$|E

Improvement in surgeon technique can reduce the chances of excessive force application and lead to optimal placement of the electrode array.

The stiffness properties of electrode arrays, which were determined by three-point flexural bending and buckling tests, are reported in this paper. To date there has been limited publication on mechanical properties of these electrode arrays. Previous studies mainly focused on characterizing the stiffness of {{the tip of the}} Nucleus straight array with little emphasis on characterizing the stiffness of its whole length. In this study, stiffnesses of the Nucleus straight and <b>contour</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays have been determined along their length. Young’s modulus of elasticity of the Nucleus straight array has been found to increase from the tip (182 MPa) to the rear end (491 MPa), whereas the stiffness of the contour array is greatest near the tip (480 MPa) and is fairly uniform in the middle and rear sections of the electrode array (380 - 400 MPa). Buckling experiments have shown that the contour array has much higher critical buckling load (about four times) than the Nucleus straight array. The results from three-point flexural bending and buckling experiments provide significant data for the development of electrode arrays, from which new array designs with improved flexibility can be developed. The results of stiffness properties are also important input for use in finite element models to predict the trajectories during insertion and to help evaluate the effects of different electrode array designs on damage sustained during insertion.

Silicon Carbide (SiC) has a bulk dielectric strength of 3000 kV/cm, thermal conductivity of 4. 9 W/(cm-K), and high tensile strength. It is considered the most promising photo-switching material that can enable the fielding of the most compact pulse power systems. The SiC photoswitch as an advantage over other high power switches when it is operated at a high blocking electric field. Presently, the field blocking performance of the SiC photo-switch has fallen short of the theoretical expectations. Breakdown occurs prematurely at an applied electric field of ̃ 300 kV/cm not at the expected 3000 kV/cm. Breakdown is not due to the SiC bulk material but to electric field enhancement caused by the switch packaging. No packaging method exists to effectively address electric field crowding {{at the point where the}} electrode leaves the SiC bulk. At this triple point junction, the induced electric field exceeds the bulk dielectric strength of the SiC. Without an improved package, the potential of the SiC photo-switch may not be realized. Reported in this paper is a novel concept of inserting <b>contoured</b> <b>electrodes</b> into the SiC bulk to minimize field crowding in order to improve the breakdown characteristics. The concept is simulated, a fabrication process is designed, and the first steps to the fabrication process are tested...|$|R

In 14 anesthetized open chest dogs with large <b>contoured</b> defibrillation <b>electrodes,</b> the effect on defibrillation efficacy of varying the duration of the two phases of biphasic waveforms was studied. All combinations of 0, 1, 3. 5, 6 and 8. 5 ms duration were used for both the first and the second phase except for the meaningless case in which both durations were 0 ms. The 3. 5 - 2 waveform (3. 5 ms first phase and 2 ms second phase) was also tested. All the hearts were defibrillated with ⪯ 5 joules using any of the 25 waveforms. However, biphasic waveforms with the second phase shorter than or equal to the first had significantly lower defibrillation thresholds than did those with the second phase longer than the first or than did monophasic waveforms of approximately the same total duration. A plot of defibrillation threshold current strength versus second phase duration for all biphasic waveforms with a 3. 5 ms first phase did not produce a hyperbolic strength-duration curve as seen with monophasic waveforms. To verify these findings, defibrillation dose-response curves were obtained for the 3. 5 - 2, 6 - 6 and 3. 5 – 8. 5 biphasic waveforms in another six dogs. The 50 and 80 % successful voltage doses of the 3. 5 – 8. 5 waveforms were significantly higher than those of the other two waveforms, which were not different from one another. In conclusion: 1) phasic durations of biphasic waveforms are important determinants of defibrillation efficacy and biphasic waveforms with the second phase shorter than the first are more effective than are those with the reverse sequence; 2) the strength-duration relation for the defibrillation threshold is different for biphasic and monophasic waveforms; 3) defibrillation of the canine heart can be achieved with low energy with use of large <b>contoured</b> pericardial <b>electrodes</b> and suitable biphasic waveforms...|$|R
40|$|The {{preservation}} of residual hearing {{is becoming a}} high priority in cochlear implant surgery. It allows better speech understanding and ensures long-lasting and stable performance; it also allows the possibility, in selected cases, of combining electro-acoustic stimulation in the same ear.

The study aimed to evaluate which approach allowed greater {{preservation of}} residual hearing. The best residual hearing preservation results (i. e. preservation in 81. 8 per cent of patients) were achieved with the <b>Contour</b> Advance <b>electrode</b> array, using the Advance Off-Stylet technique and performing a modiﬁed anterior inferior cochleostomy; this combination enabled reduced trauma to the lateral wall of the cochlea during electrode insertion...|$|R
40|$|CONCLUSIONS: Hearing may be conserved {{in adults}} after {{implantation}} with the Nucleus <b>Contour</b> Advance perimodiolar <b>electrode</b> array. The degree of hearing preservation and the maximum insertion {{depth of the}} electrode array can vary considerably despite a defined surgical protocol. Residual hearing combined with electrical stimulation in the same ear can provide additional benefits even for conventional candidates for cochlear implantation. OBJECTIVES: We present preliminary results from a prospective multicentre study investigating the conservation of residual hearing after implantation with a standard-length Nucleus <b>Contour</b> Advance perimodiolar <b>electrode</b> array {{and the benefits of}} combined electrical and acoustic stimulation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects were 12 adult candidates for cochlear implantation recruited according to national selection criteria. A "soft" surgery protocol was defined, as follows: 1 - 1. 2 -mm cochleostomy hole anterior and inferior to the round window; Nucleus <b>Contour</b> Advance <b>electrode</b> array inserted using the "Advance-off-stylet" technique; and insertion depth controlled by means of three square marker ribs left outside the cochleostomy hole. These procedures had been shown to reduce insertion forces in temporal bone preparations. Variations in surgical techniques were monitored using a questionnaire. Pure-tone thresholds were measured pre- and postoperatively. Patients who still retained thresholds < 90 dB HL for frequencies up to 500 Hz were re-fitted with an in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid. Word recognition was tested in quiet and sentence perception in noise for the cochlear implant alone and in combination with an ipsilateral hearing aid. RESULTS: Hearing threshold level data were available for 12 patients recruited from 6 of the centres. Median increases in hearing threshold levels were 23, 27 and 33 dB for the frequencies 125, 250 and 500 Hz, respectively. These median increases include the data for two patients who had total loss of residual hearing due to difficulties encountered during surgery. "Cochlear view" X-ray images indicated that the depth of insertion varied between 300 and 430 degrees, despite modest variations in the length of the electrode inserted (17 - 19 mm). The insertion angle had some influence on the preservation of residual hearing at frequencies of 250 - 500 Hz. Six of the 12 patients retained sufficient hearing for effective use of an ipsilateral ITE hearing aid (< or = 80 dB HL at 125 and 250 Hz; < or = 90 dB HL at 500 Hz). Word recognition scores in quiet were improved from 10 % to 30 % with the cochlear implant plus ipsilateral hearing aid in 3 patients who had at least 3 months postoperative experience. Signal:noise ratio thresholds for sentence recognition were improved by up to 3 dB. Patients reported that they experienced greatly improved sound quality and preferred to use the two devices together...|$|R

Catheter ablation using DC energy to electrodes straddling the ostium of the coronary sinus, when used clinically, has been reported to result in cardiac tamponade in as many as 16 % of patients. A new system of energ delivery maximizes voltage while decreasing the undesirable effects caused by barotrauma. This system includes 1) a low-energy ablation power supply with a brief time-constant capacitive discharge that delivers up to 40 J and 3, 000 V and 2) a low-energy ablation catheter with a <b>contoured</b> distal <b>electrode.</b> We performed in vitro and in vivo studies of this new system and compared arcing shocks with nonarcing shocks. Ablations were performed using unipolar distal shocks (D) and unipolar shocks to both electrodes made electrically common (P-D). In vitro studies were done in a large tank filled with physiological saline while recording voltage, current, and pressure. High-speed cinematography (32, 000 frames/sec) of shocks of 10 - 40 J permitted detailed analysis of the vapor globe. Anodal shocks of less than 20 J showed no arcing or only minimal vapor globe formation. For D and P-D anodal shocks of 40 J, the diameters of the vapor globe were 31 and 22 mm, respectively, corresponding to pressure recordings of 11 and 4. 9 atm. The pressure ris...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{theoretical model}} based on first principles {{has been developed}} to predict the characteristics of mass, momentum, energy, and electrostatic potential transport in high-pressure mercury arcs confined in a quartz arctube. The model is utilized to systematically investigate the impact of convection on the transport process by including and excluding the gravity effect. Strong three-dimensional convection flows with multiple contrarotating vortices have been identified. These vortices substantially change the energy balance within the arc, causing highly nonuniform gas temperature distribution and lowering the maximum gas temperature. Geometrical modifications of the arctube such as wall <b>contour</b> curvature and <b>electrode</b> offsets do not change the strength of convection but can produce better overall temperature uniformity within the arctube by accommodating the upward-moving tendency of temperature contours caused by convection. In agreement with the experimental measurement, the model predicts that the arctube curvature can cause large differences of wall temperature profiles, including shape, level, and locations of peak values...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrodes}} of today's lithium-ion {{cells are}} produced as a compound made of copper or aluminium foil several micrometres thick. This film {{functions as a}} conductor and is coated {{on both sides with}} an active material with the capacity to store energy. In battery production, shaping by shear cutting of these planar electrodes is an essential stage in the process chain. However, advanced techniques established in mass production, such as laser cutting and water jet cutting, are not always suitable for the manufacturing process particularly in case of avoiding thermal and chemical impact on the composite material. Conventional shear cutting (fine shear cutting) is also problematic, since the very thin film makes for very tight clearances. One way to circumvent the problems in shear cutting described above results from superposing the punch with vibrations. In the example described in the paper, frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz at vibration amplitudes greater than 3 ?m were used.

40|$|Background and Aims: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are {{performed}} routinely after permanent pacemaker implantation to identify pacemaker lead position and exclude pneumothorax. We assessed the clinical value {{and need for}} this procedure. Design: Retrospective analysis of pacemaker data and CXRs following permanent pacemaker insertion between December 2002 and February 2004. Materials and Methods: Post-procedural CXRs were available in 125 / 126 consecutive patients after either first endocardial pacemaker implantation or insertion {{of at least one}} new lead. Subclavian vein puncture was used for venous access in all cases. CXRs were examined to establish the incidence of pneumothorax and assess pacing lead positions. The clinical records were examined in all patients who had subsequent CXRs or a further pacemaker procedure to identify the indication for these and to establish whether CXR had influenced patient management. Results: In total, 192 post-procedural CXRs were performed, either postero-anterior (PA) and/or lateral views. Ventricular and/or atrial pacing lead <b>contour</b> and <b>electrode</b> position was considered radiographically appropriate in 86 &#x 0025; CXRs. Fourteen per cent of post-procedural radiographs were considered to have radiologically sub-optimal pacemaker lead positioning. None of the patients with these "abnormal" radiographs experienced subsequent pacemaker complications or had further radiographs recorded at a later date. Later repeat CXRs were performed in 16 patients (13 &#x 0025;) but only 3 patients (2 &#x 0025;) had pacing abnormalities as the primary indication. All three had satisfactory pacing lead position on initial post-implantation and later radiographs, but required further procedures for lead re-positioning. Iatrogenic pneumothorax occurred in one patient (incidence 0. 8 &#x 0025;) in our series. CXR confirmed the clinical diagnosis and allowed an assessment of size to guide treatment.

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{technique for}} the fabrication of disposable electrochemical microcells containing working, reference and auxiliary electrodes {{on a single}} device is reported. The procedure is based on thermal-transfer of toner masks onto CD-R (recordable compact discs) gold surfaces to define {{the layout of the}} <b>electrodes</b> (<b>contour).</b> In a subsequent step, the layout is manually painted with a permanent marker pen. The unprotected gold surface is conveniently etched (chemical corrosion) and the ink is then easily removed with ethanol, generating gold surfaces without contamination.

Silver epoxy is deposited on one of the gold bands which is the satisfactorily used as reference electrode. These microcells were electrochemically characterized by cyclic, linear, and square wave voltammetry, and several electroactive species were used as model systems. The area reproducibility of the electrodes for different microcells was studied and a relative standard deviation better than 1, 0 % (n = 10) was obtained.
