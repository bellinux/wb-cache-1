5000|$|The {{struggle}} did {{not have}} the backing of any mainstream political parties. [...] The mainstream society of Kerala either ignores this struggle or pretends that nothing seriously happen except for a bit of law and order problem. Some even perceive this as a violent and militant struggle, thereby indirectly even indicating that they are supported by “Naxals”, the communist guerilla. However, great personalities from different fields visited the place during the struggle. Prominent socio-political leaders, including Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy, Govindacharaya, and V.M. Sudheeran, were among those who had visited Chengara extending solidarity with the families. “Somehow, the ruling class seems to be reluctant to consider indigenous people as citizens of this country,” complained Sukumaran, a Dalit agitating in Chengara. “In 2009, the then LDF Government had offered land to some of us but what they were given were rocky waste lands. Still, there is no word about the rest of us,” he said. The Left Democratic Front (LDF), led by the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>India-Marxist</b> (CPIM), sees the agitation as illegal, but emphasized that the government is going ahead with its program to allot land to the landless in the state. LDF convener Vaikom Viswan said, “The struggle in the Harrisons Malayalam Ltd. estate is to be seen as an encroachment and the talks with the agitators will help expose them. The government will do all it can to evict the people from the estate, though it will do all it can to allot land to the landless.” [...] <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>India-Marxist</b> actually found itself in an awkward position, as it claimed to be the spokesperson of both social groups. On one side were the Dalits and Adivasis on the other side the plantation workers and trade-unions.|$|E

He was subsequently refused re-entry into the Congress party, the party leadership stating that the disparaging comments he had made about the party leadership whilst in opposition were too big a barrier to his re-joining. Muraleedharan pledged that he would [...] "wait {{for any length of}} time" [...] for the party to change its mind and readmit him, while his father Karunakaran stated that he would take up the matter with the national leadership of the Congress party, if necessary.

Chatterjee, however, appeared unwilling to follow the party line {{to vote against the}} government in a crucial July 2008 confidence vote, as voting against the government would mean voting alongside the right-wing opposition BJP. Ignoring the party's instructions, he decided to stay on in his post as Speaker of the House, acting in this capacity during the confidence vote. Following the vote, which the government survived, on 23 July 2008, the CPI (M) expelled him from the party for violation of party discipline.
