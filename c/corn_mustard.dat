40|$|Two {{pairs of}} domesticated Eurasian Collared Dove Streptopelia decaocto reared at {{eighteen}} months for its breeding performance in intensive system. One pair was homozygous albino al//al x al//al and another pair was one wild type +//al and another albino al//al. Another experimented four pairs of doves were produced {{from these two}} pairs. Out of six pairs total 114 squabs were produced during the research period. Total three albino pairs produced 100 % albino squab and different coloured male and female produced different colours which were 50 % each. Sex ratio {{of male and female}} were observed 1 : 1. Experimental doves were reared in cages measures 23 x 20 x 16 and 25 x 22 x 18 inches and feed were supplied all day long with wheat, <b>corn,</b> <b>mustard,</b> broken rice and burnt soil. Intake feed were 15 gram per dove in a day. During the time of this observation only hypervitaminosis and worm infestations were observed and the mortality rate was few. Only in one pair (rosy ? x wild type ?) produced 11 male (46 %) and 13 female (54 %) out of 24 squabs; this was slightly exceptional. In total 114 squabs from six pairs only one rosy male and pied rosy female were found. Breeding record of this research suggests that the colour patterns are first wild type then rosy and finally albino gradually.

50|$|The first {{windmill}} at Formerum {{was built}} in 1502. Koffiemolen was originally built in 1838 on the Dellewall in west Terschelling for Hendrik Stobbe. At one time, the mill was a <b>corn</b> and <b>mustard</b> mill. In 1876, it was moved to its present location by P S Bos. In September 1935, one pair of sails was streamlined on the Fok System and one pair of Bilau sails was fitted. In 1946, the Friese Molencommissie (English: Frisian Mills Commission) estimated that the mill would cost ƒ5,000 to restore. By this time the mill had lost a pair of sails. The mill was sold by Jaap Bos to Jan van Dieren in 1964. He used {{the ground floor of}} the mill as a coffee house, but left the machinery in the mill intact. The former engine house was converted to a kitchen and toilet. A further restoration was undertaken in 1980-81. The sails were replaced after a twenty-year absence. A further restoration was undertaken in 2002-03. Koffiemolen is the only windmill on Terschelling.|$|R
5000|$|Purbasthali {{region is}} located in the flood plains two major rivers Damodar and the Ganga. The wetland with the river course form a half moon shape between Nabadwip and Purbasthali [...] Topographic {{configuration}} is the typical monotonously low dipping Gangetic plain of West Bengal with an average height of 14 metres above mean sea level. During monsoon river gets flooded, with the water level within the wetland getting higher and under heavy rains the enclosed islands get submerged. The area is extremely rich in alluvial soil content. Hence an intense agriculture is practiced {{on both sides of the}} river. Main crops Rice, maize, <b>corn,</b> jute, <b>mustard,</b> potato and all sorts of vegetables are the main produce. There are a number of fruit orchards and horticulture gardens flank the river course. Even on the riverine isle and sandy river banks cultivation goes on during the post monsoon period from September till June. Banks of the channel and river course is dotted with villages under dense tree cover while paddy fields and grass lands border the wetland.|$|R

An advertisement in the Leeuwarder Courant of 12 July 1775 asked for tenders to repair the corn mill at Woudsend. In January 1837, the mill was bought by M A Tromp. He modernised the mill, and it was offered for sale under the name t Lam in 1839 for ƒ4,200.25. The mill was then a <b>corn,</b> malt, <b>mustard,</b> pearl barley, and rye mill. The mill was again advertised for sale in 1840 for ƒ2,600. After being offered for sale in 1848 for ƒ2,525, the mill was bought from Wietse Hettema in 1849 by Carl Johan Albert Siegert for ƒ4,500. The mill passed to his son Carl J W Siegert and was advertised for sale for ƒ2,526 following his death in 1870. It was not sold, and was run by Carl Ernest Hugo Siegert until his death in 1915, passing to his son Foeke Siegert. A pair of sails broke in that year. New sails were fitted, as was a replacement windshaft. The windshaft had previously been used in Windlust, Sneek, Friesland, which had burnt down in 1914. The work was carried out by millwright Jan Piers Oly of Sneek.|$|R

50|$|The {{people of}} Mithila {{traditionally}} subsisted on farming, irrigation {{is one of}} the most important aspects of the community. Maithils in Eastern Nepal built canals that irrigate thousands of hectares of land. They plant rice, <b>mustard,</b> <b>corn</b> and lentils, but also collect forest products such as wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants and materials to build their houses; hunt deer, rabbit and wild boar, and go fishing in the rivers and oxbow lakes. Hundreds of years ago, without using any sophisticated tools, they built hundreds of kilometers of irrigation canals in the Jhapa and Morang districts of Nepal. An irrigation canal could be used by several villages. Its water and diversion works need to be managed fairly. As a token of respect, the community members may also help them in farming for a day free of cost.|$|R
40|$|The {{positive}} role of protective forest plantings {{in maintaining the}} stability of biotic communities and ensuring stabilization of a phytosanitary situation in the agricultural and woodland landscape of steppe and semiarid zones of Lower Volga region is established. The analysis of long-term data testifies that in general, the number of a harmful complex on fields of winter wheat (Triticum) and brown mustard (Brassica juncea) in the system of forest strips is lower than in opened agrocoenosis in average by 20, 6 % and 16, 2 %, respectively. The regularities of distribution of harmful and useful insects in <b>corn</b> and <b>mustard</b> agrocoenosis are noted. The obtained data on distribution of harmful insects and their concentration in a forested field gives the grounds to include regional processings of agrocoenosis of agricultural and woodland landscape in the system of protective measures. It is established {{that the existence of}} fields afforestation in Volgograd region creates the favorable conditions for development and accumulation of entomophages in fields. It leads to restriction of mass reproduction of harmful insects and to the decrease in their injuriousness. The essential distinctions in distribution and development of diseases in the agrocoenosis protected by forest plantings and the treeless fields are revealed. The maximal values of development of a complex of diseases on winter wheat are observed in zones, adjacent to forest strips (I and III), minimum – {{in the middle of a}} field. The estimated values of development of diseases in forested field is less, and in certain cases it slightly differs from the data obtained in a treeless field...|$|R
40|$|In European Union {{countries}} up to 80 % {{of sewage}} sludge is used in agriculture and forestry, whereas in Poland only 11 % is used as fertilizer. The principal environmental concern is the inevitable presence of heavy metals when using sewage sludge as fertilizer. The main objective {{of this study is}} to assess the effectiveness of the phytoextraction process in removing heavy metals from sludges. A method of whole plant (with roots) harvesting was developed since plants initially accumulate heavy metals in roots. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) was used as a chelating agent in the experiment. Results of the control treatment (without EDTA) showed that the concentration of heavy metals (Pb, Cd and Zn) in <b>corn</b> and white <b>mustard</b> roots was 2 – 6 fold higher than in shoots. In treatments with EDTA this effect was not observed. The method of whole plant harvesting was most effective in removing Cd from sewage sludge in experiments with corn and with EDTA; however, this effect was not detected with white mustard. It was shown that the new harvesting method could be effective in removing heavy metals from municipal sewage sludge...|$|R
40|$|An {{immunoglobulin}} Mk monoclonal (F 8 IVE 9) antibody raised against oat (Avena sativa cv Garry) root homogenate {{has been}} produced and characterized. The predominant target bound by this antibody is a 62 -kilodalton protein (p 62) that {{is expressed in}} both oat root and oat shoot cells. Treatment of the oat antigen with periodate, or with recombinant N-glycanase, affects the F 8 IVE 9 binding to the antigen, suggesting that the specific epitope for this monoclonal antibody involves a carbohydrate determinant. Levels of p 62 present in cells of the oat root increase approximately twofold as the root tissue matures during the first 11 days postgermination. In contrast, levels of expression in shoot tissue remain relatively constant during the same period. The p 62 antigen {{has been shown to}} be expressed at the plasma membrane by immunohistochemical means, by immunofluorescent labeling of protoplasts, and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of purified plasma membrane. The F 8 IVE 9 antigenic target appears to be uniformly distributed through root tissue but is differentially expressed in specific sections of the shoot. F 8 IVE 9 antibody also binds to antigens expressed in a number of other species, including clover, <b>corn,</b> pea, broccoli, <b>mustard,</b> and bean, and has been shown to bind to Samanea protoplast plasma membranes. This monoclonal antibody may prove to be useful for a variety of investigations, including an analysis of the specific patterns of cellular differentiation that occur during early morphogenesis, and the characterization of plasma membrane-associated elements in plants...|$|R
40|$|We {{have found}} major {{evolutionary}} {{changes in the}} types of transcripts produced by specific chloroplast genes, in particular those encoding the large subunit (LS) of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase and a photosystem II polypeptide (PII). Two distinct patterns of LS gene transcripts are revealed by hybridizing an LS gene probe to electrophoretically separated RNA from 19 angiosperms. Most species, including pea, contain the single transcript of approximately 1. 6 kb previously observed in <b>corn,</b> spinach and <b>mustard.</b> However, in mung bean {{and other members of the}} legume genera Vigna and Phaseolus, the 1. 6 kb transcript represents only a minor fraction of LS transcripts, and instead, two larger LS transcripts of approximately 2. 4 and 2. 6 kb predominate. The PII gene produces a single transcript in pea and most other species examined, while members of the related legume genera Vigna, Phaseolus and Glycine contain two additional transcripts which are smaller in size and probably represent specific RNA breakdown products. A single species, sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus), contains a second PII transcript which is 0. 2 kb larger than the approximately 1. 2 kb transcript found in all species. The LS and PII genes map to the same 5 kb region in both pea and mung bean and are transcribed off the same DNA strand. In contrast, published studies indicate that the two genes are approximately 50 kb apart and are transcribed off opposite DNA strands in five other chloroplast genomes. These differences are probably the consequence of an approximately 50 kb inversion which distinguishes the pea and mung bean genomes from those of most other angiosperms (1) ...|$|R
