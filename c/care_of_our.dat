We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
25|$|Ceres, as the Goddess who has {{control over}} nature's {{resources}} and cycles, may astrologically {{be considered the}} planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, {{for which he was}} punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering our collective consciousness as a need to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.|$|E

2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just because we want to take better <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E

2500|$|Born in Cluj (Kolozsvár), Lívia Rusz {{was from}} a Hungarian-Romanian family. She {{grew up in a}} mixed environment, among local Hungarians and Romanians, and, {{according}} to her own recollection: [...] "My road was opened by a school with exceptional spirituality, where I was taught to respect and maintain traditions, to treasure the eternal cultural values, to preserve and take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> identity so as not to offend the others". Her father, Liviu, was a Romanian Railways employee, amateur artist and calligrapher, who had undergone formal training with painter Sándor Szopos. Rusz was herself avid to train in visual art, copying his paintings, learning how to use watercolors, and entering a class run by Szopos. After graduating from primary school, Rusz continued her education at a high school in her native city, where her talents brought her to the attention of painter and academic Zoltán Kovács. On Kovács' personal recommendation, she applied for the Cluj Art Institute upon passing her baccalaureate examination, and completed her training in 1955. She declared herself [...] "lucky" [...] to have been taught by Kovács, [...] "an artist with virtues recognized even by those who undermined him". As a result of this training and influence, she came to define herself as a [...] "conservative", who did not [...] "renew [...] whenever the fashion changes." [...] Rusz was Assistant at the Institute for the following three years, losing her post to an administrative restructuring.|$|E
