5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> in sea-run, {{resident}} {{stream and}} lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> (or Snake River <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout)</b> is {{the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only {{subspecies}} of <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> and the Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout,</b> though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E
5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E
50|$|The Dodge Reservoir {{has been}} {{historically}} stocked by the California Department of Fish and Game with fishes like the Rainbow, Eagle Lake, brown, and Lahontan <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trouts.</b> Fishing is best {{during the spring}} and early summer.|$|R
5000|$|Coho, king, steelhead, <b>cutthroat,</b> rainbow <b>trout,</b> chum, sockeye {{and pink}} {{including}} {{a number of}} threatened species, and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Crowsnest River is {{a highly}} {{productive}} river with a substantial insect population that fuels a world-class sport fishery for rainbow, westslope <b>cutthroat,</b> bull, hybrid <b>trout</b> ("cutbow" [...] <b>cutthroat</b> and rainbow <b>trout</b> crosses), and brown trout (below Lundbreck Falls), mountain whitefish, and various species of suckers.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout,</b> {{northern}} pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently. Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{species of}} fish live in Yellowstone, {{including}} the core range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout—a fish highly sought by anglers. The Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of lake trout, an invasive species which consume the smaller <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout.</b> Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. The <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> has also faced an ongoing drought, {{as well as the}} accidental introduction of a parasite—whirling disease—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles, such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake, and four species of amphibians, including the Boreal Chorus Frog.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the park, the {{free-flowing}} reaches of Balch Creek support a population of resident <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout.</b> Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout,</b> coho salmon, and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{accomplishment of}} the center was its instrumental role in getting the greenback <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout's</b> rating under the Endangered Species Act changed from extinct to threatened. In August 2004 a new 16500 sq ft laboratory and administrative building known as the Robert G. Piper Building was opened, {{named in honor of}} a former director {{of the center}}. The Bozeman Fish Technology Center currently studies aquatic species culture, aquatic species nutrition, fishery evaluation, and aquatic species health in the states of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Utah, Colorado, and Kansas.|$|R
50|$|Fish species include walleye, yellow perch, {{northern}} pike, brook, brown, westslope <b>cutthroat</b> and rainbow <b>trout,</b> burbot, common carp, white sucker, and shorthead redhorse.|$|R

5|$|The <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> is {{the state}} fish of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, while {{particular}} subspecies of cutthroat are the state fish of Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park was {{established}} in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> fishery in the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are {{periodically}} replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> can be found the Klickitat and <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E
50|$|The {{fishing in}} the Elk River {{is known to be}} some of the best fly-fishing in North America, with large, wild <b>cutthroat</b> and bull <b>trout</b> aplenty.|$|R
50|$|Many {{rivers and}} alpine lakes within the Wheeler Peak {{wilderness}} are stocked with <b>cutthroat</b> and/or rainbow <b>trout</b> {{every few years}} by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.|$|R
5000|$|The park offers {{multiple}} campgrounds, boat launches, and {{a privately}} operated marina. Game fish {{found in the}} reservoir include walleye, sauger, perch, crappie, ling, rainbow, <b>cutthroat,</b> and brown <b>trout.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although heavily polluted, {{the creek}} {{supports}} aquatic life, including coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> (leopard spotted) in its upper reaches. Watershed councils {{such as the}} Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in riparian zones.|$|E
5|$|Large {{populations of}} salmon {{inhabited}} the creek before urban construction altered the watershed and the stream channel, {{and in the}} 21stcentury, the creek and its tributaries still provide habitat for smaller numbers of chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, and coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout.</b> Steelhead populations in Johnson Creek are within the Lower Columbia River steelhead distinct population segment and listed as threatened (2011). Chinook and coho salmon are listed as threatened {{as part of the}} Lower Columbia River Evolutionary Significant Unit (2011).|$|E
5|$|The Austin Heights area {{contains}} Como Lake, {{a renowned}} urban fishing and recreation area, and headwaters for the Como watershed. The watershed {{represents one of}} the last urban watersheds in the Tri-Cities that supports wild stocks of coho salmon as well as other species at risk such as coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> (both sea-run and resident) and bird species such as the great blue heron and green heron. It also contains Mundy Park, one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} an {{excellent}} source for fly fishing for brook, rainbow, <b>cutthroat</b> and brown <b>trout.</b> The state ranks the Salt River Class 2 (red) - Very good trout waters - fisheries of statewide importance.|$|R
50|$|The Stillaguamish River and {{its tributaries}} {{are known for their}} salmon runs. Eight salmonid species use the streams for spawning, {{including}} chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye salmon, steelhead <b>trout,</b> sea-run <b>cutthroat,</b> and bull <b>trout.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{large body}} of water, Boysen Reservoir, lies {{approximately}} 17 miles south of Thermopolis and is inhabited by many native species of fish including rainbow, <b>cutthroat</b> and brown <b>trout,</b> walleye, perch and northern pike among others.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout,</b> and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mountainous}} and forested {{sections}} of the drainage basin lie protected under national forest lands. There are several campgrounds overseen by the U.S. Forest Service in {{the headwaters of the}} Potlatch River watershed. Fishing is also good in the Potlatch River and many of its tributaries. Anglers are only permitted to catch brook trout, <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout,</b> and rainbow and steelhead trout. The Department of Fish and Game annually stocks fish in the river. Fishing is permitted on the Potlatch from its mouth upstream to where Moose Creek joins the river near Bovill, {{as well as on the}} East Fork.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
50|$|Piute State Park is a Utah state park. It {{is located}} {{just north of}} Junction. This park is a {{primitive}} area; there are no facilities. Piute offers camping, swimming, boating, and fishing for rainbow, <b>cutthroat,</b> and brown <b>trout.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal <b>cutthroat</b> and rainbow <b>trout.</b> Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, <b>cutthroat,</b> and brook <b>trout.</b> Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Plagued by chronic leakage {{problems}} at the dam, the reservoir was hurriedly emptied in 1965 and 1986 amid concerns about dam failure. The reservoir has facilities for recreation, with boat launching ramps and campgrounds. Fishing is available for brown, <b>cutthroat</b> and rainbow <b>trout.</b>|$|R
5|$|Water-based {{recreation}} {{is available}} near the pass as well, {{particularly on the}} Roaring Fork side. At the Grottos climbing cliffs eight miles (14.4km) {{to the west of}} the pass, a short trail leads to an area along the river known as the Devil's Punchbowl, with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls. It is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters. The river is popular with anglers casting for trout as well, and some even make the hike from the pass up to Blue Lake for its lake and <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> stocks.|$|E
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout</b> resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern spotted owl {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal <b>cutthroat</b> <b>trout,</b> Pacific lamprey, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. Roosevelt elk, American black bear, coyote, cougar, black-tailed deer, North American river otter, American mink, and North American beaver are among the mammals found in the watershed.|$|E
50|$|DePuy Spring Creek is a {{three mile}} long trout fishery located between the Absaroka and Gallatin {{mountain}} ranges in Paradise Valley, south of Livingston, Montana. The creek {{is a small}} tributary of the Yellowstone River. This fishery supports a population of brown, Yellowstone <b>cutthroat</b> and rainbow <b>trout.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cutthroat</b> and rainbow <b>trout</b> {{differ in}} that cutthroats have basibranchial (hyoid) teeth in their throat between the gill arches {{and behind the}} tongue. [...] They also {{typically}} have longer heads and jaws than the rainbow and often can be distinguished from the rainbow by their larger spots.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} it creates, Currant Creek Reservoir, has a {{water surface}} of 300 acres {{and has a}} capacity of [...] [...] The reservoir shoreline is 85% owned by the Uinta National Forest. Recreation includes fishing (for rainbow, <b>cutthroat,</b> and brook <b>trout,</b> etc.), boating, camping, and hiking.|$|R
