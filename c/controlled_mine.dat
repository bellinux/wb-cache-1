China first decided to establish dedicated factories for naval mines in 1954, and in 1958, several programs of naval mines were launched simultaneously by Fengxi Machinery Factory. The first of these, Moored-1 (Mao-1), a large sized moored mine entered mass production in 1962 after being tested multiple times and {{evaluated by the}} navy.

During the First World War fortified searchlight positions {{were part of the}} coastal forts. The main line of defence had larger two [...] searchlights at Rys√§kari and Kuivasaari and an additional six smaller [...] searchlights beside them and on the other islands. Miessaari 150cm searchlight position was not completed during the war. In the second line 150cm searchlights were used on Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari, while other forts had [...] or [...] searchlights. Diesel generators provided the necessary electrical power to operate the searchlights. Searchlights were used in disappearing positions, where the searchlight was normally in a shelter and only exposed when needed for illumination. The disappearing positions had two types: either the searchlight was raised from the shelter by a lifting mechanism, or it was moved by rails from the shelter to position.|$|E

2500|$|Naval mines {{were also}} used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid {{approximately}} [...] outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated <b>controlled</b> <b>mines</b> were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with [...] separation between rows and [...] between mines in a row. <b>Controlled</b> <b>mines</b> required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the <b>mine</b> <b>control</b> network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.|$|R
5000|$|Frequently used in {{combination}} with coastal artillery and hydrophones, <b>controlled</b> <b>mines</b> (or command detonation mines) can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into [...] "normal" [...] mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the controlling station and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by Robert Fulton. The first remotely <b>controlled</b> <b>mines</b> were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore. They were considered superior to contact mines {{because they did not}} put friendly shipping at risk.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} sinking of a submarine by depth charge was U-68, sunk by Q-ship [...] off Kerry, Ireland 22 March 1916. By early 1917, the Royal Navy had also developed indicator loops {{which consisted of}} long lengths of cables lain on the seabed to detect the magnetic field of submarines as they passed overhead. At this stage they were {{used in conjunction with}} <b>controlled</b> <b>mines</b> which could be detonated from a shore station once a 'swing' had been detected on the indicator loop galvanometer. Indicator loops used with <b>controlled</b> <b>mining</b> were known as 'guard loops'. By July 1917, depth charges had developed to the extent that settings of between 50 - 200 ft were possible. This design would remain mainly unchanged through the end of World War II. While dipping hydrophones appeared before war's end, the trials were abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|From December 16, Corregidor {{lighthouse}} {{was used}} by the Navy to facilitate the entrance of submarines carrying supplies and ammunition for the troops on the island as authorized by General Douglas MacArthur. The light was shown the first ten minutes of each one-half hour on a secret schedule furnished by the Navy for each entry. Only white light was shown and on a fixed specified azimuth. As the submarine passes through the <b>controlled</b> <b>mine</b> fields, the Inshore Patrol coordinating with the Harbor Defense put the mines on [...] "safe" [...] and the marking buoys were illuminated by searchlights.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike naval mines {{that are}} {{dispersed}} at sea, the <b>controlled</b> <b>mine</b> field location is chosen {{so that it}} could be under observation. The exact location of the mines was required so that they could be fired from the mine casemate when a target vessel was plotted by observers to be within the mine's effective range. For this reason the mines were [...] "planted" [...] in predetermined locations with electrical connection through cables to the firing location. The complex of mines, cables and junction boxes required maintenance. Specialized vessels to undertake the hazards of planting mines and maintaining the electrical cables were used.|$|E
5000|$|In 1943 he {{was awarded}} the George Cross [...] "for great bravery and undaunted devotion to duty". [...] He had carried out {{nineteen}} mine-recovery operations. The most important was in November 1942 at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where he defused a new mine known as a Type T. He had to hang upside down in a mudhole and endure painful electric shocks while insulating the wires for the detonator. His George Cross made him the most decorated member of the Royal Australian Navy at that time. He returned to Australia in 1943 and set up a mine disposal unit at HMAS Cerberus. However the unit was not used operationally, as the United States Navy <b>controlled</b> <b>mine</b> clearance operations in the Pacific area.|$|E
