40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the methods of expressing deontic {{modality}} in statutory instruments. The author analyzes three pure meanings that is to say; (i) obligation, (ii) prohibition and (iii) permission. Within those three meanings three sub-meanings are distinguished. Within the meaning of obligation, the author distinguishes the following sub-meanings: (i) unlimited duty, (ii) conditional duty, and (iii) external duty. Within the meaning of prohibition the following three sub-meanings may be distinguished: (i) unlimited prohibition, (ii) <b>conditional</b> <b>prohibition,</b> and (iii) external prohibition. Within the meaning of permission we have distinguished three sub-meanings: (i) unlimited permission, (ii) conditional permission, and (iii) external permission. The exponents of deontic modality are presented in the tables and compared {{in order to show}} potential translation equivalents...|$|E
50|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} broaden its base. The Party {{leadership}} became anti-Catholic (especially attacking the bishops) and its inherent anti-Semitism became more virulent. To counter this, the bishops adopted a <b>conditional</b> ban or <b>prohibition</b> {{in regard to}} Catholic membership in the Party, which later (as Nazism spread throughout Germany) varied from diocese to diocese.|$|R
40|$|To {{adequately}} {{deal with}} the unpredictable and dynamic environments normative frameworks are typically deployed in, mechanisms for modifying the norms at runtime are crucial. We present the syntax and operational semantics of generic programming constructs to facilitate runtime norm modification, allowing a programmer to specify when and how the norms may be changed by external agents or by the normative framework. The norms take on the form of <b>conditional</b> obligations and <b>prohibitions,</b> which instantiate detached obligations and prohibitions (instances). We present rule-based constructs for runtime modification of the norms and their instances, and a mechanism for automatically updating the instances when their underlying norms change...|$|R

The {{specification}} {{and monitoring}} of <b>conditional</b> obligations and <b>prohibitions</b> with starting points and deadlines {{is a crucial}} aspect {{in the design of}} open interaction systems. In this paper we regard such obligations and prohibitions as cases of social commitment, and propose to model them in OWL, the logical language recommended by the W 3 C for Semantic Web applications. In particular we propose an application-independent ontology of the notions of social commitment, temporal proposition, event, agent, role and norms {{that can be used in}} the specification of any open interaction system. We then delineate a hybrid solution that uses the ontology, SWRL rules, and a Java program to dynamically monitor or simulate the temporal evolution of social commitments, due to the elapsing of time and to the actions performed by the agents interacting within the system. ...|$|R

Its present scope {{is determined by}} the Imperial [...] " [...] Patent [...] " [...] of 1859, and all industrial labour is included except mining, transport, fisheries, forestry, agriculture and domestic industries. Factories are defined as including industries in which a [...] " [...] manufacturing process is carried on in an enclosed place by the aid of not less than twenty workers working with machines, with subdivision of labour, and under an employer who does not himself manually assist in the work." [...] In smaller handicraft industries the compulsory gild system of organization still applies. In every industrial establishment, large or small, the sanitary and safety provisions, general requirement of Sunday rest, and annual holidays (with <b>conditional</b> exceptions), <b>prohibition</b> of truck and limitation of the ages of child labour apply. Night work for women, 8 P.M. to 5 A.M., is prohibited only in factory industries; for young workers it is prohibited in any industry. Pauses in work are required in all industries; one hour at least must be given at midday, and if the morning and afternoon spells exceed 5 hours each, another half-hour's rest at least must be given. Children may not be employed in industrial work before 12 years, and then only 8 hours a day at work that is not injurious and if educational requirements are observed. The age of employment is raised to 14 for [...] " [...] factories," [...] and the work must be such as will not hinder physical development. Women may not be employed in regular industrial occupation within one month after childbirth.|$|R
40|$|The South African Competition Commissionâ€™s merger {{decisions}} {{for fiscal year}} (FY) 2002 through FY 2009 are analysed to empirically identify the factors historically influencing <b>prohibition,</b> <b>conditional</b> approval and unconditional approval, {{as well as the}} factors historically influencing whether merger applications are deemed non-complex, complex or very complex. The focus of the analysis is on whether or not the historical process has remained consistent through time, and whether or not that process can be obviously linked to the provisions of the 1998 Competition Act. Initial results point to behaviour that is not consistent over the time period considered; however, those inconsistencies are removed, once additional measures of market contestibility, associated with the 1998 Competition Act are included in the analysis. The final results suggest that the commission is less likely to approve mergers that they link to markets that are less contestable. In addition to protecting competition, the commission is simultaneously protecting other public interests. Therefore, our research supports the hypothesis that the commission consistently applies its legislative remit. [URL]...|$|R
