50|$|The {{psychological}} <b>coping</b> {{mechanisms are}} commonly termed <b>coping</b> strategies or <b>coping</b> skills. The term <b>coping</b> generally refers to adaptive (constructive) <b>coping</b> strategies. That is strategies which reduce stress. In contrast, other <b>coping</b> strategies may be coined as maladaptive, if they increase stress. Maladaptive <b>coping</b> is therefore also described, {{when looking at}} the outcome, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term <b>coping</b> generally refers to reactive <b>coping,</b> i.e. the <b>coping</b> response which follows the stressor. This differs from proactive <b>coping,</b> in which a <b>coping</b> response aims to neutralize a future stressor. Subconscious or non-conscious strategies (e.g. defense mechanisms) are generally excluded from the area of <b>coping.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship among}} global <b>coping</b> self-efficacy, <b>coping,</b> and <b>coping</b> effectiveness within athletes. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} a positive association between <b>coping</b> self-efficacy and <b>coping</b> effectiveness, which would be mediated by <b>coping.</b> It was also predicted that <b>coping</b> strategies within the task-oriented <b>coping</b> dimension would be positively associated with <b>coping</b> effectiveness, whereas strategies from the disengagement- and distraction-oriented <b>coping</b> dimensions would be negatively associated with <b>coping</b> effectiveness. Participants were 353 athletes between the ages of 18 and 29 years, who completed a measure of <b>coping</b> self-efficacy the night before they competed, in addition to a measure of the athletes' use of <b>coping</b> strategies and their perceived <b>coping</b> effectiveness, which was completed immediately after the competitive event. Results revealed that higher global <b>coping</b> self-efficacy scores were significantly (r =. 33, p <. 01) associated with <b>coping</b> effectiveness. Furthermore, task-oriented and disengagement-oriented <b>coping</b> partially mediated this relationship, but distraction-oriented <b>coping</b> was not a significant partial mediator of the relationship between global <b>coping</b> self-efficacy and <b>coping</b> effectiveness. © 2010 American Psychological Association...|$|R

Results showed that <b>coping</b> self-efficacy and <b>coping</b> style affected <b>coping</b> behavior, and that, in turn, <b>coping</b> behavior affected performance. The {{findings of a}} post hoc analysis suggested that metacognitive awareness had an indirect relationship with <b>coping</b> behavior, through task-focused <b>coping</b> style and <b>coping</b> self-efficacy, instead of a predicted direct relationship.

5|$|Tennessee {{was ranked}} No. 13 in the Associated Press preseason poll {{at the start}} of the season, but won just one game in its first four of the season, causing the Volunteers to drop out of the top 25 for the first time since 1989, {{breaking}} a streak of 84 consecutive weeks in the poll. To make matters worse, Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss to Mississippi State.

40|$|Meta-analytic {{methods were}} used to empirically {{determine}} the association between dyadic <b>coping</b> and relationship satisfaction. Dyadic <b>coping</b> is a systemic conceptualization of the processes partners use to <b>cope</b> with stressors, such as stress communication, individual strategies to assist the other partner <b>cope</b> with stress, and partners' strategies to <b>cope</b> together. A total of 72 independent samples from 57 reports with a combined sum of 17, 856 participants were included. The aggregated standardized zero-order correlation (r) for total dyadic <b>coping</b> with relationship satisfaction was. 45 (p=. 000). Total dyadic <b>coping</b> strongly predicted relationship satisfaction regardless of gender, age, relationship length, education level, and nationality. Perceptions of overall dyadic <b>coping</b> by partner and by both partners together were stronger predictors of relationship satisfaction than perceptions of overall dyadic <b>coping</b> by self. Aggregated positive forms of dyadic <b>coping</b> were a stronger predictor of relationship satisfaction than aggregated negative forms of dyadic <b>coping.</b> Comparisons among dyadic <b>coping</b> dimensions indicated that collaborative common <b>coping,</b> supportive <b>coping,</b> and hostile/ambivalent <b>coping</b> were stronger predictors of relationship satisfaction than stress communication, delegated <b>coping,</b> protective buffering <b>coping,</b> and overprotection <b>coping.</b> Clinical implications and recommendations for future research are provided...|$|R

Specifically, {{it is expected that}} more perceived stress, avoidance <b>coping,</b> and religious <b>coping</b> would predict greater negative affect, while more social support, Canadian acculturation, heritage acculturation, collective <b>coping</b> and engagement <b>coping</b> would predict less negative affect in the present student sample.|$|R
5000|$|Coping, {{as a form}} of {{response}} to stressors, describes how individuals handle stressful events. It is very close to one dimension of adaptive performance by definition (i.e., the Handling Work Stress dimension), and <b>coping</b> has been suggested to be another form of adaptation. [...] However, they are still different constructions. Stress <b>coping</b> could be divided into several styles and strategies based on several theories. One general idea is to divide <b>coping</b> as active <b>coping</b> and avoidant <b>coping.</b> [...] Active <b>coping</b> means to proactively address and resolve stressful events, like quitting a stressful job and changing into a less overwhelming one. Avoidant <b>coping</b> means to reduce stress by ignoring it, like involving in problematic drinking. Another set of <b>coping</b> strategy types includes problem-focused <b>coping</b> and emotion-focused <b>coping.</b> [...] Problem-focused <b>coping</b> involves using skills and knowledge to deal with the cause of their problems. Emotion-focused <b>coping</b> involves releasing negative emotions by ways like distracting or disclaiming.Adaptive performance involves a mixture of different <b>coping</b> strategies. Because adaptive performance concerns positive aspects of behaviors, it is more closely related to <b>coping</b> strategies that have positive effects, such as active <b>coping</b> and problem-focused <b>coping.</b> [...] Therefore, adaptive performance is more likely to contain such behaviors in stressful situations.|$|R
5|$|John Marshall was {{the captain}} of the Van Diemen's Land team and William Philpott led the Port Phillip team, which batted first. The Victorian team found the home bowling {{difficult}} to face, on account of its unusually slow pace; in their first innings, they scored 82. Van Diemen's Land replied with 104, assisted by a large number of extras. The batsmen <b>coped</b> better than expected with the overarm bowling, although Thomas Antill took three wickets in four balls in returning figures of seven wickets for 33 runs. Batting again, the Victorian team scored 57, leaving the Tasmanian team needing 36 to win. When the first day's play ended due to bad light, Van Diemen's Land had scored 15 runs and lost six wickets. The next morning, the home team scored the required runs for the loss of one more wicket, recording a three-wicket victory. The match, which had been keenly anticipated, was a great attraction and was followed closely in the press in Melbourne. Additionally, there were many social events for the visiting team.|$|E
5|$|With Fate and Other Worlds launched, Palmer {{began to}} plan for a new magazine, to be called Imagination. Material {{for the first two}} issues had been {{assembled}} by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left paralyzed from the waist down. While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both Other Worlds and Imagination was done by Mahaffey, who <b>coped</b> well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the slush pile and help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted William Hamling, {{who did not want to}} relocate and suggested that Hamling take over Imagination. Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became Imaginations editor and publisher.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test, Jardine scored 35 and 65 not out. His first innings began with England in an {{uncertain}} position, having lost three wickets for 108 {{on a very}} good batting wicket. His innings led England to a stronger position. He played very cautiously, being troubled by Clarrie Grimmett and Bert Ironmonger, the Australian spinners. Jardine believed that Ironmonger threw the ball, and this bowler gave him considerable trouble throughout his career. Thanks to the bowling of Harold Larwood, England took a huge first innings lead. In his second innings, although he played well in his 65, Jardine was not under much pressure. He scored {{a large number of}} singles, giving his partners most of the bowling and building up the lead to the point where England achieved a massive victory by 675 runs. This victory surprised and troubled the Australian cricketing public. Jardine played a similar role in the second Test, batting with Wally Hammond to retrieve a poor start for England in his only innings as they won by eight wickets. Jardine scored 62 in the third Test, supporting Hammond who made a double century. However, when Australia batted a second time, they built up a big lead and left England needing 332 to win on an exceptionally bad wicket which had been damaged by rain. Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe, in one of their most famous partnerships, put on 105. Hobbs sent a message to the team that Jardine should be the next batsmen to come in, even though he usually batted later on, as he was the batsman most likely to survive in the conditions. When Hobbs was dismissed, Jardine came in to bat. He survived, although finding batting exceptionally difficult, until the day's play ended. Percy Fender believed that Jardine was the only batsman in the side who could have <b>coped</b> with the difficult conditions. He went on to make 33 next day, and England won by three wickets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a {{substantial}} re-conceptualization of <b>coping.</b> The strong focus on emotional distress as the marker of <b>coping</b> efforts has masked {{the importance of social}} functions, processes and outcomes in <b>coping</b> with life stress, particularly the role of communal <b>coping.</b> Communal <b>coping</b> is a cooperative problem-solving process salient in <b>coping</b> with both individual and collective stressors. It involves the appraisal of a stressor as `our' issue and cooperative action to address it. Beyond its important role in <b>coping,</b> communal <b>coping</b> is endemic to notions of social integration, interdependence and close relationships, and may underlie the resilience of families and other social units dealing with stressful life events. The authors present a framework that distinguishes communal <b>coping</b> from other individual and social <b>coping</b> processes.
