40|$|Loan Loss Provisioning (LLP) is {{an amount}} of reserve that banks "put aside" to cover loss in case that loan goes in default, meaning that clients do not repay it. It is a safety buffer for {{preserving}} banks liquidity and capital adequacy. On the other hand, the Loan Loss Provisioning is a cost. In the Profit and Lost statement of banks, LLP decreases profit. It is a good tool/mechanism for risk management, but also expensive one, {{and that is why}} it is important for banks to optimize it in every possible way. The aim of optimization is to distribute collateral value to the <b>connected</b> <b>loans,</b> in a way to minimize amount of LLP.

500|$|In September 2015, FinMkt {{launched}} Marketplace Lending Gateway, a “centralized {{technology platform}} that <b>connects</b> <b>loan</b> applicants from banks and retailers to alternative funding sources through a real-time matching and allocation engine.” The platform allows consumers and small businesses, previously {{turned down for}} loans, to receive multiple loan offers in minutes. “There is a tremendous supply-demand imbalance between borrowers and lenders,” Luan Cox said on announcing the launch. “Gateway provides the much-needed connection between those needing capital and those looking to invest. Through the platform, banks can provide an added service to their clients by connecting those seeking capital through alternate routes to lenders and institutional investors." [...] The Marketplace Lending Gateway also permits brands to offer loan alternatives to their constituencies. Partners may refer customer loan applications into the system and utilize selection parameters to match prospective borrowers with alternative lenders. At {{the time of the}} launch, FinMkt also announced related partnerships with several marketplace-lending platforms and several hundred banks.|$|R

Thisimplies that banks may need to watch their borrowers』 corporate governance while makinglending decisions. A cross-country study conducted by Bae and Goyal (2003) examining theeffects of corporate governance on lending behavior lacked the loan transaction data inTaiwan. This research is the first study on connected lending between firms and banks inTaiwan. We refer to Yeh and Woidtke』s (2002) work of board composition for the measuresof corporate governance in Taiwan, and add in other connected lending variables. Theprimary {{purposes of this study}} are to (1) investigate the effects of the independence of boardand the degree of ownership diverge at borrowing firms on lending behavior; (2) comparethe borrowing terms between firms with and without <b>connected</b> <b>loans,</b> and further analyzewhether the connections influence the lending behavior; and (3) examine the validity ofbenefit looting hypothesis in Taiwanese banks. La Porta et al. （ 1998 ）指出一個公司治理制度能夠說明各公司之間的道德危險、代理問題、資訊揭露及監督管理的差異性，這意味著銀行進行企業授信時，應考慮企業的公司治理情形；而目前公司治理制度對銀行授信行為影響的唯一跨國比較研究（Bae andGoyal 2003 ）中尚缺乏台灣地區的結果。本研究為國內首次探討臺灣地區企業與銀行之連結性關係放款（connected lending）的研究，我們在公司治理構面的設計上將參考Yehand Woidtke （ 2002 ）探討臺灣地區董監事會組成份子的方法，並在模型中加入企業與銀行關連性變數。主要研究目的如下：（ 1 ）探討借款企業的董事會獨立性及公司股權偏離程度對放款授信行為的影響，分別由價格項目與非價格項目為之。（ 2 ）依據本文定義的連結性指標I、Ⅱ將樣本區分為連結性關係與無連結性關係兩個樣本群，並比較連結性關係與無連結性關係的放款契約在銀行各授信項目上是否存有差異。此外，在進一步控制放款銀行特性及企業財務與公司治理特性後，我們以OLS 及Probit 迴歸分析探討銀行與企業的連結性關係是否會影響銀行的授信行為。（ 3 ）檢測利益搶奪（benefitlooting）假說在台灣地區銀行授信行為上是否成立...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{whether the}} political connections of listed {{firms in the}} United States affect the cost and terms of loan contracts. Using a hand-collected data set of the political connections of S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 companies over the 2003 – 2008 time period, {{we find that the}} cost of bank loans is significantly lower for companies that have board members with political ties. We consider two possible explanations for these findings: a Borrower Channel in which lenders charge lower rates because they recognize that connections enhance the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s credit worthiness and a Bank Channel in which banks assign greater value to <b>connected</b> <b>loans</b> to enhance their own relationships with key politicians. After employing a series of tests to distinguish between these two channels, we find strong support for the Borrower Channel but no direct evidence supporting the Bank Channel. Finally, we demonstrate that political connections reduce the likelihood of a capital expenditure restriction or liquidity requirement commanded by banks at the origination of the loan. Taken together, our results suggest that political connections increase the value of U. S. companies and reduce monitoring costs and credit risk faced by banks, which, in turn, reduces the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s cost of debt...|$|R

40|$|High-value {{transactions}} between Australian {{banks are}} {{settled in the}} Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) administered by the Reserve Bank of Australia. RITS operates on a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) basis and settles payments sourced from the SWIFT, the Austraclear, and the interbank transactions entered directly into RITS. In this paper, we analyse a dataset received from the Reserve Bank of Australia that includes all interbank transactions settled in RITS on an RTGS basis during five consecutive weekdays from 19 February 2007 inclusive, a week of relatively quiescent market conditions. The source, destination, and value of each transaction are known, which allows us to separate overnight loans from other transactions (nonloans) and reconstruct monetary flows between banks for every day in our sample. We conduct a novel analysis of the flow stability and examine the connection between loan and nonloan flows. Our aim is to understand the underlying causal mechanism <b>connecting</b> <b>loan</b> and nonloan flows. We find that the imbalances in the banks' exchange settlement funds resulting from the daily flows of nonloan transactions are almost exactly counterbalanced by the flows of overnight loans. The correlation coefficient between loan and nonloan imbalances is about - 0. 9 on most days. Some flows that persist over two consecutive days can be highly variable, but overall the flows are moderately stable in value. The nonloan network is characterised by a large fraction of persistent flows, whereas {{only half of the}} flows persist over any two consecutive days in the loan network. Moreover, we observe an unusual degree of coherence between persistent loan flow values on Tuesday and Wednesday. We probe static topological properties of the Australian interbank network and find them consistent with those observed in other countries. ...|$|R

Panel data for {{a large number of}} banks over the period 1994 - 2003, and dynamic panel estimation techniques are employed. Looking at the experience of individual countries, there is evidence of a bank lending channel in all countries, though the strength of it varies across countries.

30|$|Financial innovations, {{particularly}} those in the products category, create and operate through complex and often multi-layer networks that, in turn, {{give rise to a}} high degree of correlation and interdependence (Allen and Babus, 2008). There are different possible sources of interconnection between financial innovations. For instance, banks are directly <b>connected</b> through interbank <b>loans</b> and other balance sheet holdings with financial institutions. Similarly, holding similar assets or sharing the same portfolio or the same depositors can create indirect linkages between financial institutions. Tumminello et al. (2010) show that financial markets present networks of correlation and hierarchies that express dependence among similar assets. This implies that the event of the failure of one or more troubled financial institutions could trigger a contagious collapse of otherwise healthy firms and the entire financial system. This feature of financial innovation renders the assessment of the social consequences of financial innovation a challenging task (Lerner and Tufano, 2011).|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the recent}} {{concerns}} on financial inclusion have emanated {{from the results of}} the All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002. Over a period of 40 years, the share of non-institutional sources of credit in sources of credit for cultivator households had declined sharply from about 93 per cent in 1951 to about 30 per cent in 1991, with the share of money lenders having declined from 69.7 per cent to 17.5 per cent. In 2002, the AIDIS revealed, however, that the share of money lenders had again increased to 27 per cent, while that of non-institutional sources overall rose to 39 per cent. In other words, notwithstanding the outreach of banking, the formal credit system {{has not been able to}} adequately penetrate the informal financial markets; rather it seems to have shrunk in some respects in recent years. Coincidentally, it is also true that the rate of agricultural growth during the last decade has slowed down and it is particularly striking in respect of foodgrains production. Since the green revolution, banks have been mainly focused on financing crop <b>loans</b> <b>connected</b> largely with food grains. There is, therefore, reason to believe that financial exclusion may actually have increased in the rural areas over the last 10-15 years.|$|R

While the latter agreements are formally [...] "voluntary," [...] in light of the desperate economic dependence of many developing states, they are to all intents and purposes [...] "imposed." [...] Moreover, the beneficiaries of these agreements-sometimes intentionally so, often unintentionally-turn out to be the rich countries. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), it has been argued, turned the WTO into a [...] "royalty collection agency" [...] for the rich countries. The Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) <b>connected</b> to IMF <b>loans</b> have proven singularly disastrous for the poor countries but provide huge interest payments to the rich. In both cases, the [...] "voluntary" [...] signatures of poor states do not signify consent to the details of the agreement, but need. Obviously, trade—with liberal or nonliberal states—is not a moral obligation, yet conditional aid, like IMF and WTO policies, aims at changing the cultural, economic, and political constitution of a target state clearly without its consent.|$|R
40|$|Since {{difficulties}} during {{business are}} an integral part of entrepreneurship, the Croatian legislative offers several restructuring models for companies who have business issues. The pre-bankruptcy agreement is available in cases when the debtor is threatened by insolvency and during this procedure, the business of the company is still managed by the existing management board. However, it is necessary that the pre-bankruptcy procedure is finished within a short deadline. The bankruptcy procedure is commenced on grounds of over-indebtedness and when in a state of incapacity to make payments, Future business is managed by the insolvency practitioner. The extraordinary administration procedure in companies of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia is initiated in cases where large enterprises are faced with bankruptcy or pre-bankruptcy reasons. During this procedure, the business of the parent-company is conducted by the extraordinary trustee. Each of the aforementioned procedures (models) has its specifications and legal consequences for all stakeholders involved (debtor, management board and creditors). This paper will use the comparative legal research methodology to analyze the differences between them: the grounds for commencing the procedures, continuing company 2 ̆ 019 s business operations, deadlines and the aftermaths for the creditors and shareholders of the company. The focus of the paper will be to demonstrate that each procedure can preserve financially positive business of the companies in problems. Several legal models should enable timely restructuring of companies, which can secure the safety of sustainable businesses and help create and maintain employment, while also can reduce the risk in the finance sector <b>connected</b> with converting <b>loans</b> to poor credits. However, the success of the negotiations with relevant stakeholders, namely creditors, and the percentage of creditor 2 ̆ 019 s payment returns largely depend on early detection of business problems and prompt opening of appropriate proceedings...|$|R

We are happy to find that the Nabob, sensible of the great embarrassments, both to his own and the Company's affairs, which the enormous amount of their private claims have occasioned, is willing to engage not to incur any new debts with individuals, and we think little difficulty will be found in persuading his Highness into a positive stipulation for that purpose. And though the legislature has thus humanely interfered in behalf of such individuals as might otherwise have been reduced to great distress by the past transactions, we hereby, in the most pointed and positive terms, repeat our prohibition upon this subject, and direct that no person, being a servant of the Company, or being under our protection, shall, on any pretence whatever, be concerned in any loan or other money transaction with any of the country powers, unless with the knowledge and express permission of our respective governments. And if any of our servants, or others, being under our protection, shall be discovered in any respect counteracting these orders, we strictly enjoin you to take the first opportunity of sending them home to England, to be punished as guilty of disobedience of orders, and no protection or assistance of the Company shall be given for the recovery of any <b>loans</b> <b>connected</b> with such transactions. Your particular attention to this subject is strictly enjoined; and any connivance on your parts to a breach of our orders upon it will incur our highest displeasure.

We therefore direct that all persons who shall offend against the letter and spirit of this necessary order, whether in the Company's service or under their protection, be forthwith sent to England.|$|R
