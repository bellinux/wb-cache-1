5|$|The player begins {{inside a}} space station called Starport {{orbiting}} the planet Arth. Here they buy and sell minerals, Endurium (fuel), and artifacts, recruit and train crew members, and upgrade parts of the ship. The player hires a crew from five species to man the ship's six posts: navigator, science officer, engineer, <b>communications</b> <b>officer,</b> doctor, and captain. A crewman's proficiency {{is determined by the}} relevant skill: a science officer with a high science skill can determine more of a planet's properties and detect aliens at a greater range, for example. Skills are increased through training, which must be purchased. One crewman can man multiple posts, but different species have different maximum skill levels. The ship is initially equipped only with engines and a limited supply of Endurium, a type of crystal used as fuel. The ship can be modified and upgraded through the purchase of weapons, armor, and shields.|$|E

40|$|Interest {{in social}} media and its wide use in Sweden awaken the need toexamine how social media are used by public organisations. This thesisdescribes the use and {{perceptions}} of social media as a researchcommunication channel {{in the public sector}} focussed on health care,health, and social care. Nine <b>communications</b> <b>officers</b> with professional experience usingsocial media for research communication within these fields wereinterviewed; the interviews were qualitatively analysed. Three research questions guided the study: How are social mediaused in research communication? Why does communications officersselect social media as communications channels for researchcommunication? What opportunities and challenges are linked to theuse of social media for research communication?The theoretical framework is primarily based theories from theTechnology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Diffusion of Innovation(DOI) about factors influencing use of new technologies as well as ontheories about social media's potential as a tool for more symmetricalcommunication. Results provide insight into how social media are used for researchcommunication by <b>communications</b> <b>officers</b> of public organisations inhealth care, health, and social care related to how social media and itsresponses are valued in comparison to other channels. Opportunities in using social media for research communicationseem to exceed challenges; organisations' seeming lack of interactionbetween research and <b>communications</b> <b>officers</b> related to social mediais one challenge. A wider range of professions needs the opportunity towork actively with research content for it to truly become social, givingrise to more symmetrical research communication...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Marine Corps (USMC) will be fielding the SINCGARS frequency-hopping radio system {{during the next}} 5 years. There will be units within the Corps during the transition period in which both the conventional fixed-frequency radio and the SINCGARS radio will be employed {{in the same area}} at the same time. The Marine Corps Communications Architecture Analysis Model (MCCAAM) presented in this thesis will give Marine Corps decision makers, analysts, and <b>communications</b> <b>officers</b> the ability to quantify the effectiveness of alternative tactical radio system configurations within a given Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) environment. Using a unique traffic workload paradigm to generate realistic message traffic, this object-oriented simulation model assesses the overall performance of a given architecture with a specified mix of fixed-frequency and frequency-hopping radios through a penalty accrual process or through aggregating traditional communications MOEs. USMC decision makers and <b>communications</b> <b>officers</b> can use the results of the system performance rankings and associated sensitivity trade-off analysis to determine where best to allocate the new frequency hopping radios, as they become available, in order to maximize the overall FM communications performance of a given MAGTF.
