Basically {{it is a very}} simple type of cooler which is widely applied as {{cryocooler}} or as the (final stage) of liquefactors. It can easily be miniaturized, but it is also used on a very large scale in the liquefaction of natural gas. A schematic diagram of a JT liquefier is given in fig. 8. It consists of a compressor, a <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> a JT valve, and a reservoir. In fig. 8, the pressures and temperatures refer to the case of a nitrogen liquefier. At the inlet of the compressor the gas is at room temperature (300 K) and a pressure of 1 bar (point a). The compression heat is removed by cooling water. After compression the gas temperature is ambient temperature (300 K) and the pressure is 200 bar (point b). Next it enters the warm (high-pressure) side of the <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> where it is precooled. It leaves the exchanger at point c. After the JT expansion, point d, it has a temperature of 77.36 K and a pressure of 1 bar. The liquid fraction is x. The liquid leaves the system {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir (point e) and the gas (fraction 1 − x) flows into the cold (low-pressure) side of the <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (point f).

30|$|The ammonia is dissociated endothermically by {{absorbing}} the solar energy at the solar reactor in the cavity receiver during the daytime to hydrogen and nitrogen according to Eq. (1); the hot reactants will {{pass through the}} reactor’s catalyst bed toward the vessel after exchanging their thermal energy in a <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the liquid ammonia. The temperature inside the vessel is above the ambient temperature saturation pressure of ammonia, and therefore, the ammonia will be condensed {{in the bottom of}} the vessel and the nitrogen and hydrogen stay at the top. The nitrogen and hydrogen mixture leave the vessel and react exothermically at standard ammonia synthesis to produce ammonia providing thermal energy for superheated steam production. As the case in the dissociation loop, the reactants in the formation loop must be heated up at a <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the formed ammonia before them getting to the synthesis.

Since the 3 He and 4 He components are circulated (the 4 He by a fountain-effect pump operating at about 2 K, the 3 He by a compressor at room temperature) rather than ejected into space, the lifetime of a closed-cycle refrigerator is not limited by the quantity of 3 He and 4 He available. In this work, we concentrate on the design and performance of the cold end (<b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and mixing chamber) of the refrigerator.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} and computer modelling {{studies have been}} made on the refrigerant-water counterflow condenser section of a small air to water heat pump. The main object of the investigation was a comparative study between the computer modelling predictions and the experimental observations {{for a range of}} operating conditions but other characteristics of a <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> are also discussed. The counterflow condenser consisted of 15 metres of a thermally coupled pair of copper pipes, one containing the R 12 working fluid and the other water flowing in the opposite direction. This condenser was mounted horizontally and folded into 0. 5 metre straight sections. Thermocouples were inserted in both pipes at one metre intervals and transducers for pressure and flow measurement were also included. Data acquisition, storage and analysis was carried out by a micro-computer suitably interfaced with the transducers and thermocouples. Many sets of readings were taken under a variety of conditions, with air temperature ranging from 18 to 26 degrees Celsius, water inlet from 13. 5 to 21. 7 degrees, R 12 inlet temperature from 61. 2 to 81. 7 degrees and water mass flow rate from 6. 7 to 32. 9 grammes per second. A Fortran computer model of the condenser (originally prepared by Carrington[1]) has been modified to match the information available from experimental work. This program uses iterative segmental integration over the desuperheating, mixed phase and subcooled regions for the R 12 working fluid, the water always being in the liquid phase. Methods of estimating the inlet and exit fluid conditions from the available experimental data have been developed for application to the model. Temperature profiles and other parameters have been predicted and compared with experimental values for the condenser for a range of evaporator conditions and have shown that the model gives a satisfactory prediction of the physical behaviour of a simple <b>counterflow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in both single phase and two phase regions...|$|E

In the classic dilution refrigerator (known as a wet dilution refrigerator), the 3He is precooled and purified by liquid nitrogen at 77 K and a 4He bath at 4.2 K. Next, the 3He enters a vacuum chamber where it is further cooled to a temperature of 1.2-1.5 K by the 1 K bath, a vacuum-pumped 4He bath (as decreasing the pressure of the helium reservoir depresses its boiling point). The 1 K bath liquefies the 3He gas and removes the heat of condensation. The 3He then enters the main impedance, a capillary with a large flow resistance. It is cooled by the still (described below) to a temperature 500-700 mK.
