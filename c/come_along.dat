5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to <b>come</b> <b>along,</b> but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds.

When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

5|$|The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre. Her {{estate was}} sold and Olga {{purchased}} Knudsminde, {{a farm in}} Ballerup about 15miles (24km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds. They kept horses, in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, chickens, geese, dogs and cats. For transport they had a small car and a sledge. Tihon and Guri (age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they moved to Knudsminde) {{grew up on the}} farm. Olga ran the household {{with the help of her}} elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka"), who had <b>come</b> <b>along</b> with her from Russia. The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity working in the fields, doing household chores and painting.|$|E
5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which <b>come</b> <b>along</b> with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may <b>come</b> <b>along</b> and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Powers, the Wizard of Social Services, {{is about}} to retire and takes his {{apprentice}} to Mount Magic to complete the initiation ceremony. For a wizard to retire, they must hatch their apprentice from an egg and train them for fifty years. However, Leonard abandoned his apprentice, the Harry Potter-like Lionel, in Chinatown and did not contact him until the ceremony. Later, it is revealed that to become a wizard, the apprentices must be circumcised. Meanwhile, the demons—the wizard's enemies—are ready to attack Mount Magic, but a force field is keeping them out. Since Leonard still needs to sign his retirement forms, demons Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone decide to use Mark Lilly to lead them to Leonard. To get Mark to <b>come</b> <b>along,</b> they elect him as the camp leader for a summer camp (originally a mining camp) that they build nearby. Mark brings his students from the Department of Integration to the camp, and the devil, Aldermach, brings several demons to act like the camp's visitors. The department's police officer, Frank Grimes, also comes along, but runs away to live with bears as he thinks the camp is infested by vermin. Mark's students and his roommate, the zombie Randall, begin to mine in an old silver mine. However, they get trapped inside, but Doug the koala begins to dig them out.|$|E

One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home.
