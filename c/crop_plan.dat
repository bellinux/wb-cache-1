40|$|Graduation date: 1968 This study uses {{a dynamic}} linear program to {{determine}} the optimum cropping pattern which should {{be followed by a}} specific San Joaquin Valley, California, farm in order to maximize returns to fixed factors of production. The study combines as much pertinent information as could be gained from personal interviews with the specific Case Farm's managers. The study also draws on previous production and cost analysis data of California conditions in order to build a complete linear program model. The Case Farm's linear program activities are confined mainly to field crops; cotton, barley, milo, alfalfa, safflower, and sugar beets and some related activities such as fallow land and double cropping. The linear program restrictions directly include availability of land of various degrees of fertility, the availability of irrigation water and federal cotton allotment programs. The availability of equipment at critical times of the crop season is also considered. The dynamic aspect of the linear program occurs because the Case Farm's rotational policy is included. The program selects an optimum <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> for three years based on the crops being grown in the initial year. The optimum <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> selected by the dynamic linear program appears to be consistent with known data and capable of being operational as far as the managers of the Case Farm are concerned. There is also evidence that the economic benefits gained from making future crop plans with the aid of this dynamic linear program will outweigh the cost of developing and executing the linear program model...|$|E

40|$|Farmers must yearly {{allocate}} {{fields to}} different crops and choose crop management options. Far from being obvious, these decisions are critical because they modify farm productivity and profitability {{in the short}} and long run. To support farmers and efficiently allocate scarce resources, decision support models are developed. Decision support models are mainly based on two concepts, the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and the <b>crop</b> rotation decisions. These decisions concern crop choice, crop spatial distribution within the farmland and crop temporal successions over years. Decisions are {{at the core of}} the farm management. Decisions have strong impacts on resource use efficiency and on environmental processes at both farm and landscape scales. We review here more than 120 references where <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and <b>crop</b> rotation decision concepts were incorporated into models. Our aim is to review how these two concepts have been formalised and used in agronomic, economic and land-use studies. We found that <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> decisions selection and design have been done using many approaches based on different objectives and handled at very different scales. The main results show that (1) <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> design decisions have mainly been tackled as a static concept, i. e. as if they were a single decision made only once a year or once a rotation; (2) modelling the achievement of a suitable <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> is often based on a single monetary criterion optimization procedure instead of a multi-criteria assessment; and (3) when considered, uncertainty of information is defined as stochastic factors or probability of occurrence, but this probability is kept static whatever the knowledge of the dynamic evolution of various constraints. We argue that <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and <b>crop</b> rotation decisions are on the contrary dynamic processes incorporated into a succession of other planned and adaptive decisions made at annual and long-term horizons. For supporting farmers in their decisions, new <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> decision models will require new modelling paradigm. A promising improvement could be reached by including explicitly the simulation of the farmers' decision-making processes, based on the simulation of the decision-making processes rather than on single normative approaches...|$|R

A multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 400 rural households from the State. The household survey involves an interview of 594 children, 400 household heads and a focus group discussion section in four locations. The data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics {{in line with the}} study objectives. The linear programming model was used to develop an optimal arable crop farm that maximizes economic returns to the farmers while simultaneously allowing for maximum school attendance and involvement. The optimal farm model revealed that a restructuring of the crop enterprise plan could increase the annual farm income by about 15. 3 percent, {{while at the same time}} minimizing the child farm labour involvement in the State. The study recommends that reducing child labour, will require facilitating access to credit to the resources-poor rural households.

In the present study we consider an optimization model based on linear programming for determining optimal <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> for command area of Pamba-Achankovil-Vaippar (PAV) link project, Kerala, India. The crop planning model considers various resource constraints (land area, seeds, manure, fertilizers etc.) availability etc. adaptive to national conditions, with the objective to maximize net irrigation benefits. For crop planning, the extent of quantity available for fertilizers, manure and seeds as inputs were unknown.

Crops are planted without perfect knowledge of weather or markets, unpredictable economic or political events may occur. This article studied on <b>cropping</b> <b>planning</b> under price uncertainty, connected with diversification of cropping with the upland irrigation developing project in southernarea of the Osumi Peninsula of Kagoshima Prefecture in Japan. {{in this area}} main type of farming is mixed farming of rice, vegitable and beefcalf production, and each farm scale is very small, and farmers are very old.

The primary data obtained from the project, â€œComprehensive scheme to study the cost of cultivation of principal crops in Punjabâ€ for the year 2002 - 03 pertain to 170 farmers selected through three-stage stratified random sampling technique. As the period of transplantation of paddy has a significant bearing on the amount of groundwater used and its sustainability, the paddy crop has been further classified into Paddy 1 (transplanted before 10 th June); Paddy 2 (transplanted during 11 th June to 20 th June) and Paddy 3 (transplanted after 20 th June). At the existing level of water availability, the optimal <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> has not revealed any significant changes in the production pattern.

In grapevine (Vitis vinifera) numerous changes have occurred {{as a result of}} human selection, including the emergence of hermaphroditism and greatly increased variation in berry color. This report examines the effect of human selection on variable skin color by examining the variation present in the gene VvmybA 1, a transcriptional regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. In over 200 accessions of V. vinifera, the insertion of the retroelement Gret 1 in the promoter region of VvmybA 1 was in strong association with the white-fruited phenotype. This retroelement was inserted at the same location for each individual in which it was present. Additional polymorphisms in the VvmybA 1 gene were also strongly associated with red or pink fruited accessions, including variation that was generated by the excision of Gret 1 from the promoter of VvmybA 1. Differences in nucleotide diversity were observed between the white and pigmented alleles of VvmybA 1, suggesting that the white allele arose only once or a limited number of times. Rarely, association of Gret 1 with the white fruited phenotype was not observed, suggesting that the white phenotype can also be obtained through mutation in additional genes.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a major concern {{regarding}} agri-environmental issues. Farmers are viewed not only as food suppliers but also as the custodians of the countryside. This role of farmers has been officially acknowledged in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) through a number of regulations that enforce agri-environment schemes and cross-compliance. However, under some circumstances these regulations have proved to be ineffective. Organic farming can play an important role for agri-environment schemes. The main aim {{of this study is to}} show the relevance of the assessment of the environmental performance of conventional and organic farming systems for the development of efficient agri-environment schemes. An holistically designed ecological-economic model was applied under current EU regulations and different policy scenarios. The model is based on a standard linear programming farm model extended with emission and evaluation figures retrieved from ecological models. Spatial aspects, such as pedo-climatic conditions, were included in the model. The approach was implemented for the case of northern Tuscany. Results indicated that organic farming systems (OFSs) were environmentally more beneficial than conventional farming systems (CFSs) and that current CAP market and income support schemes gave cause for an intensification of farm production and for an increase of environmental harm. They also showed that conventional farmers willing to produce environmental performances comparable to those of organic agriculture or to comply with environmental sustainability thresholds (ESTs) incur opportunity costs due to the need of application of organic crop management and/or extensification of the <b>crop</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions were drawn on the environmental performances of OFSs and CFSs, the impact of EU policies on sustainability of agriculture, opportunity costs of environmental benefits and on the practical use of the modelling framework for policy design.

40|$|Efficient and {{sustainable}} utilization of resources, particularly {{land and water}} resources for agriculture have occupied the centre stage in the economic agenda of a nation. The regional resource availability and the biotic, abiotic and socio-economic constraints are largely varied in the any crop production system of that region. The integration of sustainable resource use with the production programs and income as objectives of farming thus, leads to a multiple objective-planning framework. Attaining sustainable increase in agriculture production by considering the biophysical variability of the region without affecting the natural resources base is therefore very important to achieve food security for the growing population in a developing country situation. The current study is to develop appropriate land use pattern in crop agriculture for sustainable land and water use to the agricultural development in the Bavani Basin of western zone of Tamil Nadu state in southern India, using a multiple goal linear programming approach. Bhavani basin in the western zone of Tamil Nadu - {{one of the most}} diversified in bio physical features, was evaluated in this study. The land use model employed in the study following the bio-economic model by Shiferaw and Holden, (2003) who incorporated the important variations in the biophysical system (land and soils) and market characteristics. This study traced the alternative cropping pattern which would maximizes the farm net income at a relatively lower water requirement, lower land requirement (hectare days to ensure relatively more fallow period to lower land exhaustion rate) and that would lower the environment damage in-terms of lower Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) with the given land and ground water availability of each identified ten homogeneous land units beside the length of growing period determined on the basis of quantum and distribution of rainfall and temperature. The major biophysical factors considered beside the land availability, ground and surface water availability were; crop suitability for the particular soil type, crop sequence and climatic variations and these factors were specified as constraints in the land use model. The input data for the model were collected from the sample respondents in the delineated homogeneous land units. The actual water availability for each standard week (t) was estimated after adjusting the effective rainfall received during the period of crop stand from the total water requirement of each crop activity. The land use model estimates revealed the possibility of increasing the crop income from the current level of INR 6. 14 billion to INR 8. 25 billion annually.

Finally, contrary to the expectations, previous year's profit margins are negatively correlated with the R&D over the sales ratio of the following year.

40|$|This study {{presents}} four {{strategies of}} a novel evolutionary algorithm, multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (MDEA). The four strategies namely, MDEA 1, MDEA 2, MDEA 3 and MDEA 4 are adapted to solve the multi-objective <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> model with multiple constraints in a farmland in the Vaalharts irrigation scheme (VIS) in South Africa. The three objectives of the model are to minimize the total irrigation water (m 2) and to maximize both the total net income in South African Rand (ZAR) from farming and the total agricultural output in tons. The total area of the farm is 771, 000 m 2 and supplied with 704, 694 m 2 of irrigation water annually. Numerical results produce non-dominated solutions which converge to Pareto optimal fronts. MDEA 1 and MDEA 2 strategies with binomial crossover method are better for solving the <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem presented than MDEA 3 and MDEA 4 strategies with exponential crossover method. MDEA 1 found a solution with the highest total net income of ZAR 1, 304, 600 with the corresponding total agricultural output, total irrigation water and total planting areas of 316. 26 tons, 702, 000 m 3 and 725, 000 m 2, respectively. The planting areas for the crops in the solution are 73, 463 m 2 for maize, 551, 660 m 2 for groundnut, 50, 000 m 2 for Lucerne and 50, 000 m 2 for Peacan nut. It can be concluded that MDEA is a good algorithm for solving <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem especially in water deficient areas like South Africa.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{dry land}} {{agricultural}} systems, single-, double- and triple-cropped lands play different roles on ecological function, economic function and social function. In Sichuan province of China, the land area for various cropping patterns for three land types is in {{large proportion of}} Sichuan’s cultivated land. It is extraor-dinarily important to obtain an optimal crop planting scheme based {{on the character of}} Sichuan province. In this kind of situation, this paper presents how multi-objective programming can be efficiently used for mod-eling and solving <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problems for optimal production of several seasonal <b>crops</b> in a <b>planning</b> year based on the scientific principle of circular economy and the character of Sichuan province dry land agricul-ture. The <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem in agriculture is usually formulated as a single objective linear programming model. The objective is either the maximization of net revenue from cultivated land or the minimization of cost of cultivation. According to the national policies that ensure the stable growth of grain yield, this paper considers grain yield as an objective, use ε- constraint method and converts the multi-objective programming to a linear programming. The paper takes the Sichuan province of China into account as an illustrative case example and obtain some significative results by using RCGA...|$|R

40|$|In the October 1969 {{issue of}} Management Science, Professor Warren Hausman {{presented}} {{a framework for}} analysis of sequential decision problems of a recurring nature ("Sequential Decision Problems: A Model to Exploit Existing Forecasters," pp. B 93 -B 111). His system consists of a dynamic programming decision model based upon successively revised forecasts of a key unknown variable and on the probability distribution of forecast changes. The decision system is illustrated with an application to a specific <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem faced by a vegetable processor. We focus, in this comment, on the specific crop supply problem used by Hausman to illustrate the applicability of his general framework. Hausman's assumption that crop adjustment costs are quadratic allows the following simplifications to be demonstrated: (a) No grid search and no numerical integration is needed to solve the stated <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem; a closed-form analytical solution is possible in this case. (b) The closed-form solution {{does not depend on}} the form of the probability density function for forecast revisions, but only on its first two moments. ...|$|R
