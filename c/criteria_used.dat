5|$|An implant {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to {{determine}} if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the <b>criteria</b> <b>used</b> to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5mm.|$|E
5|$|The factors used in {{determining}} how an individual aerodrome is categorised by the GASAR study are based broadly on size and facilities. The six types of aerodrome are described, in size order, as: regional airports (e.g. East Midlands); major GA airports (e.g. Oxford); developed GA airfields (e.g. Andrewsfield); basic GA airfields (e.g. Rufforth); developed airstrips (e.g. Tilstock); and basic airstrips (e.g. Chilbolton in Hampshire). The actual <b>criteria</b> <b>used</b> to categorise aerodromes were complex, using 28 different parameters, backed up with a peer review by experienced GA pilots.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the <b>criteria</b> <b>used</b> were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The <b>criteria</b> <b>used,</b> and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More specific definitions have been published, but none of these have been widely accepted. The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article.|$|E
