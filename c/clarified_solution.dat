40|$|Lowering the {{processing}} cost of liquid-liquid extraction {{by eliminating the}} clarification process, requires {{an understanding of the}} hydrodynamics and the operating regions of pulsed column when treating unclarified solutions. In order to achieve such an objective, an investigation has been carried out to measure and compare the total hold-up of clarified solutions and solvent in pulp operation for two potential commercial operations, uranium and gold tailings. Preliminary bench scale separation tests were carried out in order to evaluate phase separation characteristics and assist in the selection of the extractant phase with a minimum of emulsion formation. The results of these tests indicated good phase separation for the uranium aqueous tailings system. However, for the gold tailings system slight crud formation was noticed for the system chosen. Based on these bench scale tests, total hold-up measurements were made for eight systems using a pulsed sieve plate extraction column. The systems included both <b>clarified</b> <b>solution</b> (five) and solvent in pulp processing (three). Results of the clarified solutions test showed that, the hold-up increased with an increase in the amplitude of pulsing, dispersed phase flow rate and pH of the aqueous phase; while, hold-up is unaffected by the variation in the continuous phase flow rate. An increase in the pulse frequency decreased the hold-up in the mixer-settler region till it reached a minimum at the dispersion region. Then, in the emulsion region the hold-up increased with a further increase in pulse frequency. These results were in agreement with results obtained by Koren, Sehmel and Babb. Maintaining the operating conditions the same as in the <b>clarified</b> <b>solution</b> test; when spent uranium tailings were added to the aqueous phase, the column operated in the transition region between the mixer-settler and the emulsion region. The column remained in this region of operation till the pulse frequency or the pulse amplitude or both were increased. Stable emulsions obtained in gold tailings system prevented reliable hold-up measurements and suggested that this system can not be studied unless the crud formation is eliminated. A fractional factorial design was carried out during the experiments in order to minimize the number of runs and avoid erosion to the tailings pump. The experimental data of each system were fitted to a second order model as proposed by Bell and Babb in order to correlate the hold-up data. No common form of these equation models for predicting hold-up was noticed, each model had its unique identity. Different equations obtained from literature were used to predict the hold-up. In the case of uranium tailings system, The models suggested by Sato et al was found to be the best when uranium concentration was 10 % by weight, while, Arthayukti's model gave better agreement for 25 % uranium tailings...|$|E

Cotton seed oil is important agricultural product; it primarily consists of triacylglycerols in which three fatty acids are attached to glycerol backbone. Growth experiments with cotton seed oil are difficult to conduct in quantitative manner due to heterogeneity of the two phase medium. To overcome this obstacle a new culture method was developed with a newly designed medium. This medium was emulsified using the plant gum or resins as the emulsifying agent. Ralstonia spp was grown on the emulsified medium and PHA production was measured over time by cell dry weight method. The medium used in this study was minimal salt medium lacking nitrogen source designed to stimulate PHA accumulation by Ralstonia spp, and it contains fructose, cotton seed oil and water <b>clarified</b> <b>solution</b> of plant gum or resins in different concentration and trace elements and antibiotic was added.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} religion and state in G. W. F. Hegel's thought. There is an agreement in Hegel literature that Hegel affirms both separability and inseperability of religion and state. This seemingly contradictory affirmation constitutes the main problematic which this work attempts to provide a <b>clarified</b> <b>solution.</b> To understand {{the true nature of}} the problem, Hegel's Early Theological Writings has been analyzed first. In these works, Hegel identifies the basic principle of Christianity to be freedom but takes state as a coercive institution. To overcome this opposition which is also alienating, Hegel later posits a theory of modern state which is based on freedom. Indeed, this thesis argues that including the earliest writings on religion, Hegel has always argued for separation of religion and state at institutional level, but objected to their opposite conceptions in his later thought. Hegel attempts to resolve this opposition by positing unity of religion and state at historical and metaphysical levels. Historically, modern state is realization of freedom which emerges first in Christianity and shares the same content of truth and same principle of freedom with religion at metaphysical level but has a different form of expression. For Hegel, not their unity of content but different forms should be institutionalized as a political principle. In conclusion, Hegel's state is secular at institutional level but at the level of thought, his understanding of secularity, by providing a common basis to state/religion, reason/faith antitheses, is distinguished from Enlightenment which can not overcome these dichotomies...|$|E

High throughput techniques like simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography, which operate in simulated counter-current mode, offer advantages like product enrichment, increase in productivity and decrease in eluent consumption compared to the batch chromatography. Investigation of SMB chromatography for downstream processing of recombinant proteins will be useful to demonstrate the potential of SMBC as an industrial tool to cope with higher production titers. In this work, streptokinase (SK) was over expressed as soluble intracellular protein in E. coli. The complex protein mixture containing recombinant streptokinase was chosen as a case study for protein purification using SMBC. HIC matrices were chosen for the SMBC process, based on a screening strategy which included evaluation of selectivity and column regeneration. Model-based design saves time and material during the multivariable process development. Model based design and optimisation of the simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatographic process requires accurate estimation of adsorption isotherm parameters in the range of elution conditions. Adsorption isotherm parameters for streptokinase (SK) were determined based on isocratic elution techniques with purified recombinant streptokinase on a buffer equilibrated column. The linearity of the isotherms were validated by perturbation techniques on a column saturated with crude cell lysate. The Henry's constants for streptokinase were found to exhibit a linear dependence on the salt concentration range of 100 - 200 mM in the mobile phase. Adsorption isotherm parameters determined were used to design a three-zone open-loop simulated moving bed-hydrophobic interaction chromatography (SMB-HIC) process. The fourth zone was used for independent regeneration and pre-equilibration of the columns. Theoretical studies were carried out based on the equilibrium model and the equilibrium stage model, to find the suitable operating parameters. Two-step salt gradient conditions were simulated by choosing two different salt concentrations in the feed and desorbent streams. Experiments were conducted and the theoretical model predicting the separation zone was validated. Continuous separation was demonstrated for streptokinase from contaminants present in a <b>clarified</b> <b>solution</b> of E. coli cell lysate. Although simulation results predicting more ideal separation behavior were at variance with experimental results, the trends from the experiments for product purity were in agreement with the theoretical trends. The effect of various parameters such as desorbent flow rate and switch times was investigated on the target product concentration. This work demonstrates the potential of the SMB process for the recombinant protein purification. It also demonstrates the efficiency and limitations of a design-based approach based on knowledge of isotherm parameters for the product and impurities. Future studies would need to incorporate more complex models, such as those incorporating adsorption-desorption kinetics and non-linear isotherms...|$|E

At present, the Chinese National Standards(CNS) method for determining the content of heavy metals in organic fertilizers used by Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection(BSMI) are distributed in different sections and chapters. In addition, there are different digestion methods for different heavy metals cited in CNS standards. The analysis methods used by Taiwan Agriculture Research Institude(TARI) and Soil Survey and Testing Center(SSTC) are also different from that used by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection(BSMI). Therefore, {{it is easy to}} result in confusion and argument about data between inspectors and fertilizer manufactures. The purposes of this study are to compare the results obtained by three organizations(BSMI, TARI and SSTC) for the contents of heavy metal in ten organic fertilizers, and to compare the effectiveness and suitability of CNS, acid digestion(HNO 3 -HClO 4 -HCl) and dry ash methods to determine the content of Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb for five animal composts and two other composts using Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). In addition, the effects of matrix in samples on the analysis method were evaluated by spike addition with standard heavy metal solution. For development a suitable test method on determination of heavy metal contents, a factor experimental designs using acid digestion method was conducted, including four amounts of sample(0. 1 g, 0. 2 g, 0. 4 g, and 0. 6 g), two concentrations of HCl(2 N and 3 N), three mixture of acids of HNO 3 -HClO 4 (5 : 1, 5 : 2, and 7 : 1) and two digestion times (8 hour and clarification condition). Result showed that different test values of heavy metals of the same ten organic fertilizers were found even using acid digestion, obtained from the result of the three organizations. The method of acid digestion was found to be the most suitable and correct method to measure the heavy metal contents in organic fertilizers due to higher percentage of recovery in spiking test and more <b>clarified</b> <b>solution</b> were obtained, however, the amount of sample used was less than other methods. After evaluation, the acid digestion method using ICP-AES determination was recommended to be used to measure the contents of heavy metal in organic fertilizers, and four analysis conditions were suggested as follows: (1) sample size is 0. 4 g, (2) the ratio of acid is HNO 3 :HClO 4 = 5 : 1, (3) the concentration of HCl is 2 N and (4) the digestion time is heat required to sample until almost clarification. 適宜之有機質肥料的利用，具有改善土壤物理、化學及生物性質的功效，亦可達到資源再生利用的效果，惟部份有機質肥料中含重金屬，若含量過高則恐有降低土壤和作物品質之虞。目前中國國家標準檢驗局(CNS) 的有機質肥料中各種重金屬的檢測方法分散於各章節中，且不同重金屬的分解方法又有不同，而國內另兩個主要檢驗單位(農委會農業試驗所及中興大學土壤調查中心) 所用的方法又與CNS法有異。由於有機質肥料中重金屬的分析方法不一，常造成數值間的落差，而造成抽驗者與肥料製造廠商間的困擾與爭執。 本研究將經相同前處理的十種有機質肥料分送至國內三處檢測單位 (國立中興大學土調中心、行政院農委會農業試驗所和標準檢驗局花蓮分局) 檢測，並彙整檢測結果，以評估及比較三個主要執行有機質肥料品質檢測單位，所使用的方法之優缺點及測值之正確性。另針對五種禽畜糞堆肥及二種雜項堆肥，以(1) CNS法(2) 三酸分解法及(3) 乾燒灰化法加以處理，再以感應耦合電漿原子放射光譜儀(ICP-AES) 檢測其所含之六種重金屬(Cu、Zn、Cd、Cr、Ni和Pb) 的含量，並利用添加重金屬標準液的方式，由測得的回收率高低評估基質對分析方法的影響。進一步的針對三酸分解法，分別設計稱取樣品的重量(0. 1 g、 0. 2 g、 0. 4 g和 0. 6 g) 、追加稀鹽酸的濃度(2 N和 3 N) 、分解液混酸的比例(HNO 3 ：HClO 4 = 5 : 1 、 5 : 2 和 7 : 1) 和分解的時間(8 小時和呈澄清狀為止) 等條件予以測試，以期建立一個適用的有機質肥料中重金屬含量的分析方法。 結果顯示，國內各檢測單位之分析結果間確有落差，且不同單位在使用相同消化法的測值也不盡相同。若就樣品分解完整與否的評估，三酸分解法可得較清澈的分解液，且回收率較高，較適合作為標準分析方法，惟其取樣量比其他兩種方法少。以三酸分解法為基準，進行條件之測試後，經整體結果的評估，建議有機質肥料中重金屬含量的分析方法可採修正之三酸(HClO 4 -HNO 3 -HCl) 分解法，以ICP作為檢測儀器，該分析方法的條件可定為：樣品用量為 0. 4 g，分解液的混酸比例為HNO 3 ：HClO 4 = 5 ： 1 及追加稀鹽酸的濃度為 2 N，而分解時間為分解直至樣品澄清為止為最佳。中文摘要 [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要 [...] Ⅲ 目錄 [...] Ⅴ 圖次 [...] Ⅶ 表次 [...] Ⅸ 附表次 [...] ⅩⅠ 壹、前言 [...] 1 貳、前人研究 [...] 3 一、國內有機質肥料中重金屬含量的現況與規範 [...] 3 二、有機質肥料中的重金屬特性 [...] 6 三、環境中的重金屬含量的分析 [...] 11 (一) 樣品之前處理(消化方式) [...] 11 (二) 分析儀器之比較 [...] 13 參、材料與方法 [...] 17 試驗一、主要檢驗單位之有機質肥料中重金屬含量檢測結果 的比較 [...] 17 試驗二、有機質肥料中重金屬檢測方法適宜性之評估 [...] 23 一、三種檢測方法的比較 [...] - 23 二、添加標準品之回收率試驗 [...] - 25 試驗三、三酸分解法分析條件之建立 [...] 31 肆、結果與討論 [...] 33 一、國內主要檢驗單位之有機質肥料中重金屬含量檢測 結果的比較 [...] 33 二、三種有機質肥料中重金屬含量方法之適宜性評估 [...] 47 (一) CNS法、三酸分解法和乾灰化法的比較 [...] - 47 (二) 標準液添加試驗 [...] 54 三、三酸法在分析有機質肥料中重金屬含量的較佳分析條件 之評估 [...] 65 伍、結論 [...] 92 陸、參考文獻 [...] 94 附錄 [...] 10...|$|E

Since Vygotsky (1978) described the importance of mediation to situated learning, researchers have been examining the interplay among agents, tools, and activities (Cole, 1996; Engeström, 1999). Because tools play such an important role in sociocultural theories of learning, our research question focuses on how tools mediate collaborative learning in a higher educatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of superconductivity phase in thick stack of Josephson junctions with strong inductive coupling, {{such as the}} one realized in layered high-T_c cuprates and possibly the recently discovered FeAs-based superconductors, is investigated under a c-axis bias voltage {{and in the absence of}} an external magnetic field. The kink state found previously by the present authors is extended to three dimensions for both rectangular and cylindrical geometries. The IV characteristics are calculated and the distributions of electromagnetic field inside the samples are <b>clarified.</b> The <b>solution</b> for a cylindrical mesa exhibits a higher resonating frequency than that of a square mesa with the same linear size by a factor of ∼ 2. 4. More importantly, from the radius dependence of the resonance frequency for the cylinder geometry it is possible to confirm directly the kink state, and thus to reveal the mechanism of the strong radiation discovered in recent experiments.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{asymptotic}} {{profile of the}} solution for a σ-evolution equation with a time-dependent structural damping. We introduce a classification of the damping term, which <b>clarifies</b> whether the <b>solution</b> behaves like the solution to an anomalous diffusion problem. We call this damping effective, whereas we say that the damping is noneffective when the solution shows oscillations in its asymptotic profile that cannot be neglected. Our classification shows a completely new interplay between {{the strength of the}} damping and the long time behavior of its coefficient. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Nordic Product Registers {{has since}} 2003 {{been working on}} harmonizing the {{reporting}} process for companies in the Nordic countries. The objective of this report is to <b>clarify</b> the technical <b>solution</b> needed to accommodate the harmonization. This report describes a software model for implementing a joint reporting tool for the Nordic Product Registers. There exist various methods for implementing a solution to afford this, but the conclusion in this report is that a new client based on the fat-client paradigm should be developed. The report also contains cost estimates for the development and proposes two development plans for implementation...|$|R
