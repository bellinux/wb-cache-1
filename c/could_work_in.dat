5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|Representatives enthusiastically {{described}} {{a language that}} <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide variety of}} environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this <b>could</b> <b>work.</b> <b>In</b> reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It would {{have been one of the}} first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 2001, during the original {{run of the}} Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A {{major part of the}} graphical design was adjusting the characters so they <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework was done with the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} idents {{used when}} the station launched were slides {{with the words}} BBC Television Service written in a stylised way. These slides also featured waved lines in different shades {{and a number of}} circles in the centre, suggesting that this slide <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the same way as a Testcard. Slides of the BBC Coat of Arms were also shown.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} four trailers {{were received}} in 1908 followed in 1923 by two more motor cars and in 1925 a new five-car train. To allow {{the introduction of}} 6-car train in 1936 ten trailers units were ordered. The later cars {{did not have a}} clerestory roof, but any car <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> multiple with any other car.|$|E
25|$|Grace {{took this}} concept, {{imported}} from overseas, {{and made it}} work in his community. Physicians with defibrillators rushing through the city to reach a non-breathing, unconscious person whose heart had stopped were quite unusual by 1968 standards. However, the program was limited in vision, and although it <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> some communities, it was not nationally applicable. An evolution in prehospital emergency care was needed.|$|E
25|$|There {{followed}} {{discussions with}} impresario Natale Fabbrici about employing a Venetian librettist, Pietro Beltrame. However, {{not only did}} the composer prefer to work with a librettist known to him and with whom he <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> close proximity, but he had already begun working with Cammarano who was revising - to the composer's satisfaction - an earlier version of Belisario which the librettist had submitted to the Teatro San Carlo management in 1832.|$|E

25|$|Many of his larger {{churches are}} among Blacket's best known buildings. The designs are {{extremely}} varied; Blacket <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> {{any of the}} medieval styles, and built larger churches in all of them, while the forms of the buildings range from the aisleless hall of St Mary's, Waverley; to the aisleless cruciform church of St Paul's, Burwood; to the triple-gabled church of St Paul's, Redfern, the aisled church of St Michael's, Surry Hills and the clerestoried church of St Stephen's, Newtown.|$|E
25|$|The women's {{contribution}} {{to the war effort}} challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.|$|E
25|$|To {{convince}} Hitchcock {{that the}} scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting {{of the final}} shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh’s stand-in Marli Renfro to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene <b>could</b> <b>work.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray {{of blood on the}} chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.|$|E

25|$|By {{preferentially}} modifying hemimethylated DNA, DNMT1 transfers {{patterns of}} methylation to a newly synthesized strand after DNA replication, and therefore {{is often referred}} to as the ‘maintenance' methyltransferase. DNMT1 is essential for proper embryonic development, imprinting and X-inactivation. To emphasize the difference of this molecular mechanism of inheritance from the canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing mechanism of transmission of genetic information, the term 'Epigenetic templating' was introduced. Furthermore, in addition to the maintenance and transmission of methylated DNA states, the same principle <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the maintenance and transmission of histone modifications and even cytoplasmic (structural) heritable states.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} {{when the family}} is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has {{recovered}} from the scarlet fever which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Uncle Henry’s railroad camp at very good wages for that era. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa {{to look for a}} homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel so {{the rest of the family}} follows later by train.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century {{ideas of}} natural {{selection}} by Darwin and Mendelian genetics were put together with population genetics, early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed {{the relationship between the}} broad-scale changes of macroevolution seen by palaeontologists and the small-scale microevolution of local populations of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966 and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates in their definitions, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher's 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, were already starting to show how Mendelian genetics <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> evolution in 1902.|$|E

25|$|The {{court was}} set up like a magistrate's court, with a {{barrister}} presiding as a judge and another barrister acting as a permanent prosecutor. The judge would hold temporary military rank, and would normally act as the sole decider of both fact and sentence; if the potential sentence was more than two years, up to five other officers would also sit as judges. The defendant could be represented by any legal counsel, British or German, and the court <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> both the English and German languages. The court heard 4,295 cases between 1919 and 1925, with possible sentences for minor offences including fines and prison sentences of between seven and fourteen days, normally served in a standard German prison. Most cases were about possessing weapons illegally, straying onto British property, occupying carriages in trains reserved for British officers, reckless driving and possessing British Government property. The courts were well attended by German civilians, and German lawyers also attended to make a study of British legal procedure.|$|E
