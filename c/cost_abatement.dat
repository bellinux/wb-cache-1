At a regional level, manure disposal {{can be regarded as}} a problem of distributing the manure from farms with a surplus to farms with a shortage or to disposal alternatives. Total disposal costs will depend on the amount of manure surplus and on the location dependent disposal cost per unit. Disposal costs are an economic incentive for structural changes and <b>cost</b> <b>abatement</b> investments at farm level which will, in turn, influence the regional disposal. In order to simulate these interactions, an integrated system of models describing the regional manure disposal coordination system is developed, composed of a farm level component, an aggregation module and a regional disposal model. The possibilities for disposal <b>cost</b> <b>abatement</b> at farm level are analysed through LP modelling of representative farms. Incentives for structural change are derived from the shadow prices of the housing and land constraints in the model.

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol assigns {{limits for}} the {{aggregate}} emissions of six greenhouse gases, but most economic analyses focus on CO 2 abatement. What are the potential gains if policy makers exploit the flexibility in a multi-gas abatement strategy? We extend the EDGE model to include sinks and non-CO 2 gases {{and show that}} a multigas strategy reduces costs by 20 - 35 % in the Western Annex B countries. Marginal abatement costs decrease around 30 %, and the cost-effective abatement mix involves relatively more abatement of the non-CO 2 gases, which offers many low costs abatement options. Lower marginal abatement costs decrease domestic action by reducing the costs of emissions imports, whereas more low <b>cost</b> <b>abatement</b> options increases domestic action. The low <b>cost</b> <b>abatement</b> options increase domestic action, whereas lower marginal abatement costs reduces domestic action by making imports of emissions cheaper. The net effect of a multi-gas strategy on domestic action is therefore not given a priori. We show that a multi-gas strategy reduces domestic action around 2 % in the United States and increases domestic action by around 8 % in the European Union. Our sensitivity analyses finally show that the relatively weak growth in non-CO 2 baseline emissions accounts for {{a large share of}} the savings associated with a multi-gas strategy.

40|$|The optimal {{pollution}} permit trading system is examined when the regulator, faced with incomplete information on firms' <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and delivery coefficients, seeks to minimize expected total <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> {{to meet an}} ex ante pollution target. Intuitively, {{we find that the}} optimal trading ratio and permit cap are set such that there will be more pollution when <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> are high and less pollution when <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> are low. Surprisingly however, even when the delivery coefficients are known with certainty, the optimal trading ratio will not necessarily equal the delivery coefficient, nor will it be optimal for the total permit quantity to equal the given pollution target. Instead, the trading ratio will tend to be larger when there is negative correlation between firms' <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and/or there is positive correlation between <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and the delivery coefficient. The result that the optimal permit trading system under these circumstances depends on the regulator's information on firm's <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> contrasts sharply with a previously well-established attribute of permit trading systems: no information on firms' <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> is needed in order to design an optimal policy and achieve the least cost of reaching a pollution target (ex post).

The net electric efficiency of the two plants is evaluated {{as a function of the}} hydrogen recovery factor (HRF) and the membrane feed pressure in order to minimize the membrane surface area. 90 % HRF and 54 bar feed pressure are the best operating parameters which correspond to a net electric efficiency of 39 % both for N 2 and CO 2 feeding system. The cost of CO 2 avoided is calculated as a function of a parameter named MI which represents the membrane development in terms of performances and costs.

The production of passenger cars {{is expected to}} grow, whereas growth prospects for electrified powertrains remain uncertain. Meanwhile manufacturers seek to maximize the utilization of their production capacities for electric and conventional efficiency-improving technologies. Thus, a competition for production capacities between fuel-saving technologies arises. Technology assessment has {{a major influence on}} the stakeholders´ decision making process on which technology to produce and where to deploy it. The commonly used greenhouse gas abatement cost curve (ACC) provides a methodology to evaluate the cost-benefit potential of new technologies.

40|$|The {{upcoming}} European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) {{is one of}} {{the more}} controversial climate policy instruments. Predictions about its likely impact and its performance can at present only be made to a certain degree. As long as the National Allocations Plans are not finally settled the overall supply of allowances is not determined. In this paper, we will identify key features and key impacts of the EU ETS by scanning the range of likely allocation plans using the simulation model DART. The analysis of the simulation results highlights a number of interesting details in terms of allowance trade flows between Member States, of allowance prices, and in terms of the role of the accession countries in the ETS. An important finding about the impact of the new ETS with respect to achieving emission reductions more efficiently, i. e. at lower cost, is that savings can only be realized if the cap on emissions is distributed between the ETS sector and the rest of the economy in such a way that the different abatement costs are taken into account. This would imply a relatively small allocation of emissions to the ETS sector. The second important result concerns the role of the accession countries. Even if they do not supply their hot-air in the ETS market, they contribute substantially to the cost savings of the ETS by offering low <b>cost</b> <b>abatement</b> options.

40|$|Large {{overloads}} {{of nutrients}} {{are one of}} many stresses on coastal and marine ecosystems {{and there is a}} need for policies that reduce nutrient emissions. This thesis contributes to the knowledge about policy design for marine pollutants. All applications are made to nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea, but the concepts and issues are likely to be relevant also for the management of other regional seas. Three of the included studies analyze cost-effective policies for reduced eutrophication. In the fourth study, game theory is used to analyze countries' choice of abatement level when abatement costs are uncertain. Two major messages emerge from the thesis. The first message concerns the current de facto policy in the Baltic Sea region, where uniform reduction rates are applied for nutrients and countries. Abandoning these uniform reduction rates can save costs. If uniform reductions for countries or nutrients are replaced by cost-effective reductions, then, in either case, more abatement is called for in the countries in transition. This, in turn, might require international institutions that can distribute the costs of abatement among all countries in Baltic Sea region. The second message is that uncertainty is of importance for policy design. Firstly, nutrient loads to coastal waters are stochastic and if peak loads cause high environmental damage, then, in order to reduce total abatement <b>cost,</b> <b>abatement</b> efforts should be particularly high at sources and in regions where abatement leads to large reductions in load variations. Secondly, unilateral abatement, that is undertaken in one country with a purpose to reduce uncertainty about abatement costs and thereby encourage another country to follow, might lead to larger emissions in total and lower utility in both countries...|$|E

It will be shown that regional differences both in marginal <b>costs</b> of <b>abatement</b> and in marginal productivity of capital are driven by market imperfection. With restrictions on international trade, the industrialized countries of the North exhibit higher marginal <b>costs</b> of <b>abatement</b> and a lower marginal productivity of capital than the developing nations of the South. Free trade not only in carbon emission rights but also in capital increases conventional welfare but stimulates carbon dioxide emissions to grow, - an effect that is not completely offset by efficiency gains in abatement. Nevertheless, depending upon the choice of the discount rate some kind of an insensitivity result is observed.
