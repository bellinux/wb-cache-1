50|$|In papyrus {{rolls and}} manuscripts, a reclamans (plural: reclamantes) is a <b>catchline</b> {{included}} {{at the end}} of a section of text showing the first line or sentence of the subsequent roll or codex, thus ensuring that the reader could quickly determine the proper order in which the particular work was to be read. The practice is well-attested in Homeric papyri, but it appears to have fallen into disuse in these texts around the 1st century AD. It seems very likely that the increased popularity of inscribing each roll with a book title precipitated the obsolescence of the reclamans. In the case of prose works, however, the practice continued to be used, and several medieval manuscripts of works like Herodotus' Histories and the Hippocratic Corpus include reclamantes.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by {{the song}} lyric's media-critical subtext, the clip {{ironically}} features the quintet as overall-dressed printers of an all-fictional tabloid newspaper called Daily Express.

Although slightly autobiographical, Lucy Diakovska has denied that the headlines were inspired by real-life events. [...] "The video is not about certain events," [...] Jessica Wahls added, [...] "but it's about how we've felt the past year, about what happened to of us and the band." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{recommended}} fishing [...] "angle" [...] {{offered by}} Boxoffice to attract even fishing enthusiasts to The Southerner relates to {{scenes in the}} film involving a catfish so large that it has [...] "chin whiskers like lead pencils". Later in the story, when Sam Tucker actually catches [...] "Lead Pencil", its huge size proves that Finley's earlier description or suspected [...] "whopper" [...] about the fish was no exaggeration. Boxoffice also gave theater owners [...] "catchlines" [...] or promotional phrases to use on their marquees and to send to newspapers and local radio stations to publicize The Southerner. In addition to [...] "There Were Two Loves in His Tucker's Life—His Family and His Farm", one other <b>catchline</b> given by Boxoffice to exploit the fishing angle, though misleading, was [...] "Things Went From Bad to Pieces [...] [...] [...] Until Fisherman's Luck Changed an Enemy Into a Friend".|$|E
