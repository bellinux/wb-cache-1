2500|$|Due {{to their}} speed (14.8 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second),</b> {{immunity}} to clashing typebars, trouble-free paper path, high quality printed output, and reliability, Selectric-based mechanisms were also widely used as terminals for computers, replacing both Teletypes and older typebar-based output devices.

These featured electronically interfaced typing mechanisms and keyboards and a magnetic storage device (either tape in a cartridge, or a magnetic-coated card the same size as an 80-column punched card) for recording, editing, and replaying typed material at ca. 12–15 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{solid state}} digital computer, the M. 3, has been designed, {{constructed}} and partially tested. The computer logic {{is based on the}} M. 2 computer constructed by A. D. Booth in 1956, but with fundamental changes to the logic associated with the store and the arithmetic section. The M. 3 is a serial, fixed point computer which uses 32 bit words and two address instructions. The 150 Kc/s clock frequency permits addition or subtraction in 250 microseconds. Division requires 8000 microseconds and multiplication requires 250 to 8000 microseconds. A drum store provides 8192 word storage with an average random access time of 8500 microseconds.

2500|$|In the 1980s IBM {{introduced}} a Selectric III {{and several other}} Selectric models, some of them word processors or typesetters instead of typewriters, but by {{then the rest of}} the industry had caught up with the trend, and IBM's new models did not dominate the market the way the first Selectric had. This was to be expected, as by the late 1970s the Selectric typewriter's dominance was under assault from both 35-45 character per second proportional-spacing electronic typewriters with inbuilt memory (e.g. the 800 from Xerox based on Diablo's [...] "daisywheels" [...] and from OEMs of Qume who had a similar printwheel technology) and CRT-based systems from AES, Lexitron, Vydek, Wang and Xerox (see the Word Processor article for further details of these brands). In addition, IBM had already (c. 1977) brought to market the CRT-based Office System/6 (from Office Products Division) and 5520 [...] (from IBM General Systems Division (GSD)) both of which used the new 6640 inkjet printer capable of 96 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> with two paper trays and sophisticated envelope handling, and was about to introduce Qume-based printers for the existing System/6 range and the new Displaywriter launched in June 1980 and described by IBM as [...] "not your father's Selectric." ...|$|E

It was located {{at the top of}} the stairs leading to Leopold's Records in Berkeley, right next to a busy conventional bulletin board. The Teletype machine was noisy, so it was encased in a cardboard box, with a transparent plastic top so what was being printed out could be seen, and with holes for one's hands while typing. This was the first time many individuals who were not studying a scientific subject had the opportunity to be able to use a computer.|$|R

Traditionally, imagined movement is used to create control in an EEG-based BCI system. Usually, these are thoughts about left and right hand movements. The Hex-o-Spell application from the Berlin BCI group was modified in the current study by adding a third thought (imagination) to the CSP-based classification.

50|$|The {{machines}} {{printed a}} series of ticker symbols (usually shortened forms of a company's name), followed by brief information {{about the price of}} that company's stock; the thin strip of paper on which they were printed was called ticker tape. The word ticker comes from the distinct tapping (or ticking) noise the machines made while printing. Pulses on the telegraph line made a letter wheel turn step by step until the correct symbol was reached and then printed. A typical 32-symbol letter wheel had to turn on average 15 steps until the next letter could be printed resulting in a very slow printing speed of one <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> In 1883, ticker transmitter keyboards resembled the keyboard of a piano with black keys indicating letters and the white keys indicating numbers and fractions, corresponding to two rotating type wheels in the connected ticker tape printers.|$|R

50|$|Portability was {{problematic}} with Hollerith Constants. First, word sizes varied {{on different}} computer systems, so {{the number of}} characters that could be placed in each data item likewise varied. Implementations varied from as few as two {{to as many as}} ten <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> word. <b>Second,</b> it was difficult to manipulate individual characters within a word in a portable fashion. This led to a great deal of shifting and masking code using non-standard, vendor-specific, features. The fact that character sets varied between machines also complicated the issue.|$|R
50|$|Although telegraphic {{printing}} {{systems were}} first invented by Royal Earl House in 1846, early models were fragile, required hand-cranked power, frequently {{went out of}} synchronization between sender and receiver, and did not become popular in widespread commercial use. David E. Hughes improved the printing telegraph design with clockwork weight power in 1856, and his design was further improved and became viable for commercial use when George M. Phelps devised a resynchronization system in 1858. The first stock price ticker system using a telegraphic printer was invented by Edward A. Calahan in 1863; he unveiled his device in New York City on November 15, 1867. Early versions of stock tickers provided the first mechanical means of conveying stock prices ("quotes"), over a long distance over telegraph wiring. In its infancy, the ticker used the same symbols as Morse code as a medium for conveying messages. One of the earliest practical stock ticker machines, the Universal Stock Ticker developed by Thomas Edison in 1869, used alphanumeric characters with a printing speed of approximately one <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
40|$|In October 1975, {{after an}} {{official}} silence lasting thirty-two years, the British Government made {{a set of}} captioned photographs of COLOSSUS available at the Public Record Office, These confirm that a series of programmable electronic digital computers was built in Britain during World War II, the first being operational in 1943. It is stated that COLOSSUS incorporated 1500 valves, and operated in parallel arithmetic mode at 5000 pulses <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> A number of its features are disclosed, {{including the fact that}} it had 5000 <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> punched paper tape inputs, electronic circuits for counting, binary arithmetic and Boolean logic operations, "electronic storage registers changeable by an automatically controlled. sequence of operations", "conditional (branching) logic", "logic functions pre-set by patch-panels or switches, or conditionally selected by telephone relays", and typewriter output. Professor M. H. A. Newman is named as being responsible for formulating the requirement for COLOSSUS, and Mr. T. H. Flowers as leading the team which developed the machine. An indication is given that the design of COLOSSUS was influenced by the prewar work on computability by Alan Turing, who was employed in the same department of the British Government as Newman. The partial relaxation of the official secrecy surrounding COLOSSUS has made it possible to obtain interviews with a number of people involved in the project. The present paper is, in the main, based on these interviews, but supplemented by material already in the public domain. It attempts to document as fully as is presently permissible the story of the development of COLOSSUS. Particular attention is paid to interactions between the COLOSSUS project and other work carried out elsewhere on digital techniques and c [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simplified printed Thai character recognition system using multiple feature extraction and character classification. Three relevant information extracted from {{a set of}} training character images are the direction of each character’s contour, the density of character body and character peripheral information. This set of features is used as reference for classifying unknown input characters. Based on Euclidean space model, the category of the reference vector yielding the minimum distance is assigned to the input character pattern. From the experiments, the recognizing speed is 5 <b>character</b> images <b>per</b> <b>second</b> with 97. 44 % correctness. The performance of recognition can be improved gradually in strengthening the robustness and lowering the error recognition rate by simply training and maintaining the knowledge by users.

50|$|OpenBSD's spamd is {{an example}} of a greylisting daemon that {{implements}} tarpitting, which is the practice of responding very slowly (by default a <b>character</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> to greylisted and blacklisted hosts. This practice can be combined with spamtrapping, which is the practice of purposefully feeding blacklisted recipient email addresses to spammers for the purpose of wasting their resources. Once caught sending to these illegitimate email addresses, spammers' IP addresses can be blacklisted and shared, preventing them from sending to legitimate addresses even if they have not been caught by other blacklisting methods yet. Blacklisted spammers have been known to be connected to spamd for many hours at a time. The idea is that this will have little effect on legitimate email services, but make it more difficult for spammers to generate profit. Tarpitting or stuttering also increases the chances of spam sending worms' long standing connections to be noticed and found by network administrators, due to worms or trojans being small programs that often use very simple SMTP implementations. This antispam weapon, however, also affects large email providers that do not retry from the same IP or only retry once immediately, rather than waiting for a short period and retrying from the same sender IP address. This practice potentially results in each email costing many connections lasting more than twenty seconds each for days, before finally producing a failure notice. If the connection progresses far enough that spamd is informed of the sender and recipient addresses - as is often, but not always, the case - then the intended receiver and/or administrators may get a report of the failed attempt as well, potentially providing a mechanism to whitelist the sender using spf records or another method. Yahoo {{is an example}} of one large email provider that eventually gets through greylisting without requiring whitelisting, but many large providers do not. Even Yahoo needs to make improvements if they are to accommodate the useful practice of greylisting and also avoid wasting resources.|$|R

The dependent variables were number of <b>characters</b> entered <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and mean response time. Subjects responded to eight different experimental questionnaires, answering 40 short answer items and 20 long answer items.
