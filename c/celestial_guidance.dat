2500|$|The NORAD Manual Air Defense Control Center for 58th Air Division interceptors was at Wright-Patterson AFB by 1958, and Brookfield Air Force Station {{near the}} Pennsylvania state line became {{operational}} as an April 1952-January 1963 sub-base of WPAFB. The 1954-79 [...] "Wright-Patterson Communications Facility #4" [...] was at Yellow Springs, Ohio (which {{also had the}} 1965-77 <b>Celestial</b> <b>Guidance</b> Research Site.) WPAFB also had an Army Air Defense Command Post for nearby Project Nike surface-to-air missile sites of the Cincinnati-Dayton Defense Area were at Wilmington (CD-27, [...] ); Felicity (CD-46, [...] ); Dillsboro (CD-63), and Oxford (CD-78, [...] ). The AADCP activated {{in the spring of}} 1960 and moved to Wilmington—with BIRDIE CCCS—by 1965 (closed March 1971). [...] was a 1961-8 Air Defense Command station of Wright-Patt, and Gentile Air Force Station (later the Gentile Defense Electronics Supply Center) was assigned to the base on 1 July 1962.|$|E
40|$|The present conference {{discusses}} {{topics in}} orbit determination, tethered satellite systems, <b>celestial</b> mechanics, <b>guidance</b> optimization, flexible body dynamics and control, attitude dynamics and control, Mars mission analyses, earth-orbiting mission analysis/debris, space probe mission analyses, and orbital computation numerical analyses. Attention {{is given to}} electrodynamic forces for control of tethered satellite systems, orbiting debris threats to asteroid flyby missions, launch velocity requirements for interceptors of short range ballistic missiles, transfers between libration-point orbits in the elliptic restricted problem, minimum fuel spacecraft reorientation, orbital guidance for hitting a fixed point at maximum speed, efficient computation of satellite visibility periods, orbit decay and reentry prediction for space debris, and the determination of satellite close approaches...|$|R
