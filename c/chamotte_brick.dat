40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the test of a heat storage filled with <b>chamotte</b> <b>brick.</b> The air parameters were used as the basis for determining the heat stream represented by a working medium, which was then compared with the stream accumulated in the material filling the deposit. Additionally, heat streams were shown for individual segments of the deposit. The efficiency of heat accumulation was determined for each of them. They showed that the efficiency of accumulation process was highest in the deposit’s first segments and the lowest in the last segments, where the air was the coldest. The dynamics of the efficiency’s shift was different for each of the observed segments. In the area closest to the inlet of hot air, the dynamics of the process of heat accumulation decreased the fastest and after one hour only a slight increase of efficiency was visible in the function of time. In the accumulation material placed closest to the outlet, the process of absorbing heat was very fast, starting from the 20 th minute before the tests were completed. The smallest changes in the process’ character, throughout the whole time of testing, were recorded in the middle layer...|$|E

These projects compare two {{companies on the}} same basic skills, for example number of employees, measure of productionand consumption volume. It is also very important distance from company to seller due to the costs which depend on distance from claypit to company, from company to seller and finally to costumer...|$|R
5000|$|Humans {{have used}} fire for melting and heat {{treating}} metals {{for thousands of}} years. To ensure safe working with the fire, for melting and working metals (bronze, iron), special refractory materials were needed to enable the handling of liquid or hot metals [...] To {{meet the needs of}} the wide-ranging applications, a large number of shaped, dense materials (refractory <b>bricks,</b> <b>chamotte),</b> shaped heat-insulating materials (lightweight refractory bricks) and unshaped refractory materials (heavy- and lightweight ramming mixes) have been developed, which are used for special high temperature applications. For decades, however, other manmade materials have been used for thermal insulation, glass wool and rock wool being used in the low-temperature range (around 200 °C to maximum 500 °C).|$|R
40|$|Implementing {{renewable}} fuels {{in steel}} reheating furnaces can reduce {{carbon dioxide emissions}} from fossil fuels, so the steel industry is interested in finding the optimal method of implementation. The relatively low cost of solid biofuels from forest products make them an attractive candidate, {{but there is a}} risk of reaction between pellets ash and furnace brick. Therefore a test was conducted with wood pellets ash on a furnace brick to test the sensitivity to pellets ash. One problem is the formation of a glassy phase due to the interaction of furnace refractories with pellets ash. The risk for the formation of a glassy phase depends on the composition of the refractory, composition of the ash and the furnace conditions, for example, a glassy phase was found to form on a <b>chamotte</b> refractory furnace <b>brick</b> when a pellets ash and the brick were heated to 1200 °C. One method to analyze the risk for volatile and low melting point compounds from solid biofuels is to use a tertiary phase diagram to divide various components in the ash. Oxides and compounds rich in the alkali metals (Na and K) tend to form volatile compounds. These alkali metal oxides together with silica can give low melting point phases for compositions near the bottom of this diagram. Ash compositions {{near the top of the}} diagram which are rich in CaO and MgO tend to have higher melting points. The wood pellets ash investigated was analysed and found to contain a large percentage of Ca, Si and Mg, expressed as CaO (44. 4 %), SiO 2 (14. 6 %) and MgO (10. 1 %) and relatively modest amounts of the alkali metals Na and K expressed as Na 2 O (3. 5 %) and K 2 O (6. 2 %). This mostly stem wood pellets ash could give concern with the formation of a glassy phase, so biofuels with more twigs, leaves and bark with a higher concentration of alkali metals could give even greater concerns. Therefore alternatives like gasification should be considered. Gasification of solid biofuels is one way to avoid ash-forming compounds in reheating furnaces. A survey was performed to evaluate different gasification technologies, as well as existing applications of syngas in other high-temperature industries. QC 20140107 Förnybar...|$|R
