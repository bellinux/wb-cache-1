40|$|SummarySurgical {{treatment}} of thoracolumbar spine fractures aims to achieve bony union and restore spinal anatomy. It may associate, as needed, decompression, reduction, graft and/or internal fixation, using a posterior, anterior or combined approach. Indications for an anterior approach weigh {{the pros and}} cons as well as the type of osteo-ligamentous lesion, degree of instability and patient's neurological status. The main interest of an anterior approach is to enable medullary decompression by <b>corporectomy</b> while allowing reconstruction of the anterior spine. The technique was less frequently used mainly due to its associated morbidity risk; but the development of videoscopy tools now allows less invasive surgery, compared to conventional thoracophrenolombotomy. Given also the mechanical drawbacks of posterior assembly in certain types of fracture, a video-assisted anterior approach is becoming more common. A conjunction of a staged anterior followed by a posterior approach has progressively developed, {{to address the needs of}} spinal trauma: this encompasses posterior surgical reduction-internal fixation, sometimes performed in emergency, with or without laminectomy followed by <b>corporectomy,</b> then anterior spinal reconstruction by graft with or without osteosynthesis to improve medullary decompression and avoid secondary correction loss and non-union. Adapting vertebroplasty techniques to spinal traumatology should gradually limit indications for an anterior approach for purely mechanical purposes; this later will, however, logically remain indicated when anterior spinal cord compression is present with associated neurological deficit, whether or not persisting after posterior reduction-osteosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Vertebral chordomas {{are rather}} rare tumours, {{especially}} in the lower cervical region. We present a patient with a C 7 vertebral body chordoma and a discussion of pertinent literature is given. Only three C 7 chordomas have been reported previously. Diagnosis is sometimes difficult to establish {{and is based on}} radiological examinations. Once the histological diagnosis is available, one should aim at a total resection. If this is not possible, adjuvant radiotherapy should be given. For limited cervical lesions, we advise a <b>corporectomy</b> with fusion by an iliac crest graft and osteosynthetic plate stabilisation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{prognosis}} of vertebral {{alveolar echinococcosis}} (AE) is poor. We {{report on the}} unique outcome of a patient with preexisting liver cirrhosis, in whom a diagnosis of vertebral AE was established on vertebral histopathology (D 4 <b>corporectomy</b> in 2010 for paraplegia). Therapeutic drug monitoring of albendazole (ABZ) showed that a low dosage was appropriate. The patient recovered and ABZ withdrawal was decided in 2014, with no relapse 18  months later. In this patient, infection was purely or mainly localized in the dorsal spine, and {{this may have been}} favored by liver cirrhosis. A longer follow-up is, however, needed to confirm cure...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: The authors {{provide their}} results in {{performing}} multilevel oblique corpectomy for degenerative spondylotic myelopathy in 48 patients. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy {{and safety of}} the multilevel oblique corpectomy when applied in selected cases. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The technique of multilevel oblique <b>corporectomies</b> for treatment of cervical spondylogenetic myeloradiculopathies allows anterolateral access to the cervical spine so that the spinal canal and conjugate foramen can be widened at more than one level, {{without the need for}} vertebral stabilization. METHODS: During a 7 -year period, multilevel oblique corpectomy was performed in 48 consecutive patients for degenerative spondylotic myelopathy. The outcomes were analyzed according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association classification modified to Western customs, and according to Nurick's scale 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. Spinal stability was evaluated in all patients by plain radiograph films of the cervical spine, lateral views in flexion and extension, on discharge, 1 month and 1 year after operation. RESULTS: Significant clinical improvement occurred in 29 patients with a complete functional recovery in 22; moderate improvement was achieved in 12 patients; neurological status remained stable in 5, and it worsened in 2. All patients showed spinal stability. CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel oblique corpectomy was found to be a safe technique that guarantees good results in terms of both regression of clinical symptoms and long-term spinal stability...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{anterior}} {{approach to}} the thoraco-lumbar junction of the spine allows therapeutic interventions on post-traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic vertebral lesions from T 11 to L 2 combining spinal cord decompression, <b>corporectomy,</b> and vertebral body fusion. However, this approach also {{has a reputation for}} damaging the intervening anatomic structures (lungs, peritoneum, and diaphragm). The objective {{of this study was to}} show that both nervous structure decompression and anterior vertebral reconstruction can be achieved via an anterior minimally invasive extrapleural retroperitoneal (AMIER) approach. MaterialWe describe each of the steps of the AMIER {{approach to the}} thoraco-lumbar junction of the spine. ResultsThe AMIER approach ensures excellent exposure that allows full decompression and satisfactory anterior anatomic reconstruction. The main difficulties and complications relate to the lungs, and a painstaking and rigorous technique limits the complications compared to conventional thoraco-phreno-lumbotomy...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increase}} of the immunocompromised population, mucosal and systemic infections caused by Candida glabrata, formerly known as Torulopsis glabrata, have shown a recent significant increase. We present a case of C. glabrata vertebral osteomyelitis which required repeated surgical therapy, a complete L 2 and L 3 <b>corporectomy</b> {{and more than one}} year of hospitalisation to complete healing. We compare this case to eight previously reported cases outlining the features of C. glabrata spinal osteomyelitis, including symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, evolution and outcome. According to the case presented and in review of the literature, we believe that in the absence of abscess and neurologic symptoms, medical treatment should be initiated with close clinical, laboratory and radiologic follow-up. An unfavorable evolution of these parameters should be an indication for aggressive and, if necessary, repeated surgical intervention in association with an antifungal treatment...|$|E
40|$|English title: Expandable cages: biomechanical {{comparison}} of different cages for ventral spondylodesis in the thoracolumbar spineDue {{to a recent}} increase in the commercial availability of expandable cages for vertebral body replacement, {{this study was designed}} to gain more information about their biomechanical properties. All three expandable cages evaluated in this study are approved for clinical use, but little knowledge about their biomechanical properties exists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human thoracolumbar spines (T 11 to L 3) (n= 32) were tested in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending with a nondestructive stiffness method. Three-dimensional displacement was measured using an optical measurement system. All motion segments were tested intact. After L 1 <b>corporectomy,</b> cages were implanted and the following groups (n= 8 each) were tested: (1) meshed titanium cage (nonexpandable cage, DePuy Acromed), (2) X-tenz (expandable cage, DePuy Acromed), (3) Synex (expandable Cage, Synthes), and (4) VBR (expandable cage, Ulrich). Finally, posterior stabilization and posterior-anterior stabilization, both using USS (Synthes), and anterior plating (LCDCP, Synthes) was applied. The mean apparent stiffness values, ranges of motion, and neutral and elastic zones were calculated from the corresponding load/displacement curves. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the in vitro biomechanical properties of expandable and nonexpandable cages. Compared to the intact motion segment, isolated anterior stabilization using cages and anterior plating significantly decreased stiffness and increased range of motion in all directions. Additional posterior stabilization significantly increased stiffness and decreased range of motion in all directions compared to the intact motion segment. Combined anterior-posterior stabilization demonstrated the greatest stiffness results. CONCLUSION: Design variations of expandable cages for vertebral body replacement do not show any significant effect on the biomechanical results. There was no significant difference found, between the biomechanical properties of expandable and non-expandable cages. After <b>corporectomy,</b> isolated implantation of expandable cages plus anterior plating was not able to restore normal stability of the motion segment. As a consequence, isolated anterior stabilization using cages plus LCDCP should not be used for vertebral body replacement in the thoraco-lumbar spine. C. Khodadadyan-Klostermann, J. Schaefer, P. H.

40|$|A primary Echinococcus granulosus {{infection}} of the spine involving the vertebrae T 8 and T 9 of a 6 -year-old child was treated elsewhere by thoracotomy, partial <b>corporectomy,</b> multiple laminectomies and uninstrumented fusion. Owing to inappropriate stabilization, severe deformity developed secondary to these surgeries. X-rays, CT and MRI scans of the spine revealed a severe thoracic kyphoscoliosis of more than 100 ° (Fig.   1) and recurrence of Echinococcus granulosus infection. The intraspinal cyst formation was located between the stretched dural sac and the vertebral bodies of the kyphotic apex causing significant compression of the cord (Figs.   2, 3, 4). A progressive neurologic deficit was reported by the patient. At the time of referral, the patient was wheelchair bound and unable to walk by herself (Frankel Grade C). Standard antiinfectious therapy of Echinococcus granulosus requires a minimum treatment period of 3  months. This should be done before any surgical intervention because {{in case of a}} rupture of an active cyst, the delivered lipoprotein antigens of the parasite may cause a potentially lethal anaphylactic shock. Owing to the critical neurological status, we decided to perform surgery without full length preoperative antiinfectious therapy. Surgical treatment consisted in posterior vertebral column resection technique with an extensive bilateral costotransversectomy over three levels, re-decompression with cyst excision around the apex and multilevel <b>corporectomy</b> of the apex of the deformity. Stabilisation and correction of the spinal deformity were done by insertion of a vertebral body replacement cage anteriorly and posterior shortening by compression and by a multisegmental pedicle screw construct. After the surgery, antihelminthic therapy was continued. The patients neurological deficits resolved quickly: 4 weeks after surgery, the patient had Frankel Grade D and was ambulatory without any assistance. After an 18 -month follow-up, the patient is free of recurrence of infection and free of neurologically deficits (Frankel E). This case demonstrates that inappropriate treatment—partial resection of the cyst, inappropriate anterior stabilization and posterior multilevel laminectomies without posterior stabilization—may lead to severe progressive kyphoscoliotic deformity and recurrence of infection, both leading to significant neurological injury presenting as a very difficult to treat pathology.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Paget disease, {{localized}} on thoracal vertebrae, {{presents a}} significant challenge in diagnostics and treatment. Presenting with progressive neurological symptoms, {{it has a}} broad differential diagnostic spectrum and requires additional radiological, neurological and endocrinological evaluation. Besides drug therapy, an operative decompression of nerve elements is performed when indicated. CASE OUTLINE We present a case of an older male patient complaining of chronic progressive pain localized at fourth and fifth thoracal vertebrae, with slight but progressive hypertonus and hyperreflection of leg muscles, including no plantar response. Vertebral biopsy indicated parathyreoid disturbance, excluded by further endocrinological analyses. At that point a <b>corporectomy</b> of fourth and fifth vertebrae and titanium cage spondylodesis of adjacent levels was performed, with pathological findings suggesting Paget disease. Postoperatively, there was initial significant neurological improvement; unfortunately, 2. 5 years after the operation a relapse of the disease developed with gibbus deformity. Further treatment was surgical in two stages (first by decompression, and later by broad laminectomy), resulting in partial neurological recovery. CONCLUSION Spinal localization of Paget disease as a monoostotic form {{must be considered in}} all cases of progressive neurological impairment accompanied by biochemical disturbances in blood and urine, and with radiologically evident deformity, pathological fracture or neoplastic destruction of vertebra. A combination of medicamentous and surgical treatment should significantly improve neurological condition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report the}} case of an osseous {{hemangioma}} located in the seventh cervical vertebra with reactive osteoid formation and non-typical findings in the radiological and the histopathological examination, mimicking metastasis of a malignant tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first description of such a case in the literature. Case presentation A 44 -year-old otherwise healthy Caucasian German woman presented with a discrete sensorimotor loss of both upper limbs. Radiologically, an osteolysis in the seventh cervical vertebra suggestive of metastasis of a malignant neoplasm was diagnosed. After performing <b>corporectomy</b> and cage implantation of C 7 on the patient, the histopathological examination was complicated by marked osteoid formation obscuring the true diagnosis of an osseous hemangioma with reactive osteoid formation. Conclusion Though hemangioma of the bone is a rare tumorous lesion in the cervical spine, it has to be taken into consideration as a reason for neck pain and sensomotoric loss of the upper limbs. Atypical radiological and histopathological presentations may hinder determination of the correct diagnosis. The treatment of such lesions must follow clinical guidelines but may be difficult to define in some cases when the correct diagnosis is not known at the time when therapy starts. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Kyphoplasty {{represents}} an established minimal-invasive method for correction and augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Reliable data on perioperative and postoperative complications are {{lacking in the}} literature. The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the incidence and patterns of perioperative complications {{in order to determine the}} safety of this procedure for patients undergoing kyphoplasty. Patients and Methods We prospectively enrolled 102 consecutive patients (82 women and 20 men; mean age 69) with 135 operatively treated fractured vertebrae who underwent a kyphoplasty between January 2004 to June 2006. Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed for up 6 months after surgery. Results Preoperative pain levels, as determined by the visual analogous scale (VAS) were 7. 5 +/- 1. 3. Postoperative pain levels were significantly reduced at day 1 after surgery (VAS 2. 3 +/- 2. 2) and at 6 -month follow-up (VAS 1. 4 +/- 0. 9). Fresh vertebral fractures at adjacent levels were detected radiographically in 8 patients within 6 months. Two patients had a loss of reduction with subsequent sintering of the operated vertebrae and secondary spinal stenosis. Accidental cement extravasation was detected in 7 patients in the intraoperative radiographs. One patient developed a postoperative infected spondylitis at the operated level, which was treated by anterior <b>corporectomy</b> and 360 degrees fusion. Another patient developed a superficial wound infection which required surgical revision. Postoperative bleeding resulting in a subcutaneous haematoma evacuation was seen in one patient. Conclusion The data from the present study imply that percutaneous kyphoplasty can be associated with severe intra- and postoperative complications. This minimal-invasive surgical procedure should therefore be performed exclusively by spine surgeons who have the capability of managing perioperative complications. </p...|$|E
