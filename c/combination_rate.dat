In order to investigate the effect of bio-organic fertilizer (plant booster) on the growth performance of paddy (Oryza sativa), an experiment was conducted as complete randomized design (CRD) with five replication and five treatments in rain shelter at UiTM Jasin in 2014. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the best <b>combination</b> <b>rate</b> of bio-organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer for rice production and also to determine yield performance of paddy by using different <b>combination</b> <b>rate</b> of bioorganic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer. Treatment included T 1 = 100 % bio-organic fertilizer, T 2 = 50 % bio-organic fertilizer + 50 % inorganic fertilizer, T 3 = 70 % bioorganic fertilizer + 30 % inorganic fertilizer, T 4 = 30 % bio-organic fertilizer + 70 % inorganic fertilizer, T 5 = 100 % inorganic fertilizer. The result indicted that the effect of bio-organic fertilizer (plant booster) when applied with the inorganic fertilizer showed significant influenced on number of panicle, plant height, yield of paddy, number of tillers and weight of 1000 grain. The result showed that treatment four exceeded all other treatment in number of tillers, number of panicle, weight of 1000 grain, paddy yield and plat height. The use of inorganic fertilizer along with bio-organic fertilizer was found better than applied inorganic fertilizer alone. This study suggests that use 30 % of bio-organic fertilizer and 70 % inorganic fertilizer should be used for maximizing the rice productivity, reducing input of chemical fertilizer and to sustaining the environmenta...|$|E

This intermediate is structurally very similar to the five-coordinate nitrosyl heme derivative of guanylate cyclase and is presumably responsible for the observed 4 -fold activation of guanylate cyclase by CO.

Along this direction, Schottky-contacts to cadmium sulphide nanowires were thoroughly stud-ied using scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM).

40|$|The {{reaction}} of tri-tert-butyl phosphite with tert-butoxy radicals yields the phosphate and a tert-butyl radical via an intermediate tetra-tert-butoxyphosphoranyl radical. Using EPR spectroscopy and deuterium labeling, {{it has been}} shown that, at temperatures from 78 to - 1000, this reaction occurs without any "memory" as to which tert-butoxy attacked the phosphite. However, the 3 ̆b 2 scission of the phosphoranyl to phosphate and tert-butoxy exhibits a significant secondary 3 ̆b 2 -deuterium isotope effect. After correction for the isotope effect involved in the disproportionation of tert-butyls (kd(CH 3) 3 C/ kd(CD 3) 3 C = 1. 4 1 02 from 80 to - 200, it being assumed that the <b>combination</b> <b>rate</b> constants kc(CH 3) 3 C and kc(CD) 3 C are equal), the isotope effect per deuterium for decay of the phosphoranyl can be represented by log (k 3 ̆b 2 H/k 3 ̆b 2 D) = - 0. 029 + 0. 063 / 3 ̆b 8 where 3 ̆b 8 = 2. 3 RT kcal/mol.

30|$|Fluences {{higher than}} the {{threshold}} (~ 2  J cm− 2) usually lead to nanosecond laser ablation, so that the plasma is always created above the target surface. Plasma self-regulating absorption via inverse Bremsstrahlung (IB) {{is the reason for}} the laser ablation process. At higher laser irradiation, highly dense ionized plasma mediates the laser–target interactions. Via the IB process, free electrons absorb photons by which energy is gained from the laser beam during collisions with neutral and ionized atoms. Thus due to electron collisions with the excited and ground-state neutrals, vapor ionization and excitation take place. In the IR laser ablation process, vaporization creates primary electrons which have laser photon absorption ability at low electron density. Due to the high absorption of infrared radiation, its result is strong electron heating and breakdown ionization at very low laser intensities. On the other hand, in UV laser ablation, the photon energies are almost near the typical ionization energies of the excited atoms. Moreover, due to higher temperature of the electronic gas, plasma etching with UV irradiation might be possible. The higher density and temperature of the UV-induced plume lead to a large number of excited atoms, which could be photo-ionized by the several photon impacts. The presence of the highly excited fluorine ions in plume significantly increases the fragment <b>combination</b> <b>rate</b> to produce new clusters and molecules after UV photoablation. The effect of laser wavelengths causes different photoablation regimes, i.e., UV photoablation and plasma-induced ablation for excimer and Nd:YAG lasers, respectively.|$|E

The morphological changes of the liver were observed by light and electron microscopy.

40|$|The {{dissociation}} and association {{reactions of}} the d 1 -heme, the prosthetic group characteristic of cd 1 nitrite reductases (NiRs), have been investigated to assess {{the stability of the}} native enzyme. At pH 5. 0 and 37 °C, the rate constant for the dissociation of the ferric d 1 -heme from native NiR purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is 4. 7 ± 1. 4 × 10 − 4 s− 1. However, when the d 1 -heme is in the ferrous state no dissociation is observed, consistent with the shortening and strengthening of the proximal bond upon reduction of the iron. Recombinant wild-type protein and two single point mutants (Y 10 N and Y 10 F), which are expressed as semi-apo proteins and were reconstituted with synthetic d 1 -heme, display the same slow dissociation rate as the native enzyme. Therefore the stability of the d 1 -heme bound in the crevice provided by the eight-bladed ß propeller domain is not altered by the act of reconstitution or by these two point mutations. The association reaction between the ferric d 1 -heme and semi-apo NiR is second-order and governed by an apparent rate constant of 3. 3 × 106 M− 1 s− 1 at neutral pH and 25 °C. Interestingly, the <b>combination</b> <b>rate</b> constant is an order of magnitude slower than that reported for iron protoporphyrin IX and apomyoglobins or apohemoglobins. This difference appears to be a property of the d 1 -heme and not of the protein since association rate constants of CO-protoheme-Fe(II) and dicyanoprotoheme-Fe(III) with semi-apo NiR are 5 × 107 M− 1 s− 1 and 6 × 107 M− 1 s− 1, respectively.

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy and safety of GMDZ, either alone or as co-therapy, for depression. Materials and methods We systematically searched key databases (9 Chinese and 7 English) up until May 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes were effective rate and self-rated or clinician-rated severity of depression. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of adverse events. Methodological quality of the RCTs was assessed by the Cochranes risk of bias assessment. Results Ten RCTs were included. All were written in Chinese and the methodological quality was generally low. Pooled analysis of 5 studies which compared GMDZ with antidepressants showed that GMDZ was significantly more efficacious than antidepressants in effective rate (risk ratio: 1. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 02 to 1. 27, P= 0. 02, I 2 = 0 %), but comparable in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score (mean difference: - 2. 10, 95 % CI: - 4. 62 to - 0. 41, P= 0. 10, I 2 = 92 %). With regard to the other 5 studies which compared GMDZ plus antidepressants with antidepressants alone, there was no significant difference in effective rate (risk ratio: 1. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 99 to 1. 55, P= 0. 07, I 2 = 93 %), but the end-point HDRS score was significantly lower in GMDZ antidepressants combination (mean difference: - 4. 25, 95 % CI: - 6. 50 to - 2. 00, P= 0. 0002, I 2 = 96 %). Adverse events were more common with antidepressants than GMDZ (rate ratio: 0. 52, 95 % CI: 0. 32 to 0. 82, P= 0. 005, I 2 = 37 %) and in antidepressants alone compared to GMDZ antidepressants <b>combination</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio: 0. 23, 95 % CI: 0. 08 to 0. 68, P= 0. 08, I 2 = 0 %). Conclusion The overall results suggest that GMDZ has few side effects and the potential as an antidepressant. Adding GMDZ to antidepressants reduces side effects and enhances efficacy of antidepressants. However, due to the small number of studies and their limitations, further studies with better methodological quality and more comprehensive safety assessment are needed to determine the benefits and risks of GMDZ in the treatment of depression. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
