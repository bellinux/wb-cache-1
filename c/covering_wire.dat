The particular case of a MHT of order 1 is described, <b>covering</b> <b>wire</b> samples from macro to nano sizes. Electric and thermal conductivities are obtained. As the size decreases towards the nanometric scale, the MHT of order 1 produces results that in some cases greatly differ from those of the usual hydro-thermodynamics.

I {{have already}} had {{occasion}} to refer to an experiment (265. 309.) made by Dr. Wollaston, which is insisted upon too much, both by those who oppose and those who agree with the accuracy of his views respecting the identity of voltaic and ordinary electricity.

But Dr. Wollaston himself points out that the effect is {{different from that of the}} voltaic pile, inasmuch as both oxygen and hydrogen are evolved from each pole; he calls it [...] "a very close imitation of the galvanic phenomena," [...] but adds that [...] "in fact the resemblance is not complete," [...] and does not trust to it to establish the principles correctly laid down in his paper.|$|R

In this work, individual parts of Au and self catalyzed nanowires are examined through microphotoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy. The {{focus of the}} work was to find the spatial origin of the various emission energies reported for GaAs nanowires. Parts of wires were selected by sputtering with a focused ion beam, selective deposition of Pt by a focused electron beam and probing sections with the laser beam in photoluminescence experiments. The Au catalyzed wires examined are predominantly of wurtzite crystal phase and of two structurally separable types, short and uniform or long with segments with a high density of stacking faults. The self catalyzed wires have a lower part with zinc blende crystal phase and an upper part with a high density of stacking faults, twinning and small segments of wurtzite phase. The emission from the wires have different spatial and structural origin relating to the varying morphology of the wires. It is found that the emission from the Au catalyzed wires comes from bound excitons and axial AlGaAs. The emission from self catalyzed wires comes from bound excitons or spatially indirect type II transitions relating to stacking faults and twins.
