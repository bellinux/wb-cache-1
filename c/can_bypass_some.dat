5000|$|In this process, {{known as}} the [...] "Taylor-wire" [...] or [...] "microwire process" [...] or [...] "Taylor-Ulitovski process", the metal to be {{produced}} in microwire form is held in a glass tube, typically a borosilicate composition, which is closed at one end. This end of the tube is then heated in order to soften the glass to a temperature at which the metal part is in liquid state and the glass can be drawn down to produce a fine glass capillary containing a metal core. In recent years the process was converted to continuous one by continuously feeding the metal drop with new material. Although this process is simple enough it {{requires a lot of}} factors to be met at the same time. The continuous flow of metal that is being coated by the glass has to be melted at the same temperature as the glass otherwise there may be consistency problems which could lead to a change in the properties of the wire. This means that metals that have a high melting temperature can not be used because it may prove difficult to match the high melting point of the metal to a high melting point in a glass. The rate at which the metal wire is pulled also has to be monitored {{due to the fact that}} a fluctuation in the speed of pulling may cause a difference of width in the wire. Not only does the wire need to be pulled at the same rate but it also needs to be cooled in a stable environment, which is normally conducted by moving the wire through a stream of cooled water or oil. However. there are some apparatuses that <b>can</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> of these problems by heating the glass and the metal in separate chambers which allows for the use of metals with high melting points. Around the 1950s the Taylor-Ulitovski process was changed to a continuous feeding process of the materials in order to make these wires on a mass production scale.|$|E

40|$|Several low-fidelity DNA polymerases have {{recently}} been discovered {{that are able to}} bypass DNA lesions during DNA synthesis in vitro. The efficiency and accuracy of lesion bypass is, however, both polymerase and lesion specific. For example, in vitro studies revealed that human DNA polymerase κ (Polκ) is unable to insert a base opposite a cis-syn thymine-thymine dimer or cisplatin adduct, yet <b>can</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> DNA lesions such as abasic site and acetylaminofluorene-adducted guanine in an error-prone manner. More importantly, Polκ is able to bypass benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) -adducted guanine accurately and efficiently. To investigate the biological function of Polκ, we have generated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient in the Polk gene encoding the enzyme. Polk-deficient ES cells grow normally and their sensitivities to UV and x-ray radiation are only slightly affected. In contrast, the mutant cells are highly sensitive to both killing and mutagenesis induced by B[a]P. Furthermore, the spectrum of mutations recovered in the Polk-deficient cells is different from that in the wild-type cells. Thus, our results indicate that Polκ {{plays an important role in}} suppressing mutations at DNA lesions generated by B[a]P...|$|E
40|$|Iron is {{essential}} for life, yet excessive iron can damage tissues and organs. To prevent iron deficiency and overload, iron balance is regulated by the hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin levels increase in response to iron sufficiency, decreasing intestinal iron absorption and inhibiting release of iron from stores and macrophages. Iron deficiency lowers hepcidin, leading to enhanced iron absorption and mobilization of iron from stores. Hepcidin is also increased by inflammation, and has {{a major role in}} the anemia of chronic disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased hepcidin levels, and this likely contributes to the incidence and severity of anemia, and resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Elevated hepcidin contributes to the dysregulation of iron homeostasis in CKD. In patients with CKD, although parenteral iron in CKD <b>can</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> of the iron-blocking effects of hepcidin, free iron and iron stores increase, anemia is only partially corrected, and ESA dose requirements remain significantly higher than physiological replacement. Agents that lower hepcidin or inhibit its actions may be effective strategies to restore normal iron homeostasis, and overcome anemia of chronic kidney disease. We review the regulation of hepcidin, its role in CKD-related anemia, and discuss the potential for hepcidin as a clinical marker, and several investigational methods to lower hepcidin for treatment of anemia in CKD...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{understand}} another person’s action and, if needed, to imitate that action, is a core component of human social behaviour. Imitation skills have attracted particular attention {{in the search for}} the underlying causes of the social difficulties that characterize autism. In recent years, {{it has been reported that}} people with autism <b>can</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> of their social deficits by interacting with robots. However, the robot preference in terms of imitation has yet to be proved. Here we provide empirical evidence that interaction with robots can trigger imitative behaviour in children with autism. We compared a group of high functioning children with autism with a group of typically developing children in a visuomotor priming experiment. Participants were requested to observe either a human or a robotic arm model performing a reach-to-grasp action towards a spherical object. Subsequently, the observers were asked to perform the same action towards the same object. Two ‘control’ conditions in which participants performed the movement in the presence of either the static human or robot model were also included. Kinematic analysis was conducted on the reach-to-grasp action performed by the observer. Our results show that children with autism were facilitated – as revealed by a faster movement duration and an anticipated peak velocity – when primed by a robotic but not by a human arm movement. The opposite pattern was found for normal children. The present results show that interaction with robots has an effect on visuomotor priming processes. These findings suggest that in children with autism the neural mechanism underlying the coding of observed actions might be tailored to process socially simpler stimuli...|$|E
30|$|Filopodia {{have been}} shown to play an {{important}} role in cell migration: these thin actin protrusions can probe the extracellular environment and guide cell migration toward sites of interest. They can also be involved in other cellular processes such as wound healing, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, guidance toward chemoattractants, and neuronal growth-cone pathfinding[28]. Filopodia are linked to the enhancement of directed cell migration, because they are essential components, with lamellipodia, for cell motility. This correlates with the role of filopodia in sensing the cell's surroundings and acting as sites for signal transduction[29]. We showed in this study that porous surface had a strong impact on filopodia formation, as lateral actin protrusions were observed only on pSi and not on flat Si. Previous studies enlightened the influence of pSi nanoscale textured micropatterns on mesenchymal stem cell adhesion and migration, with cells migrating toward the porous areas[39]. According to the pattern size, cellular filopodia <b>can</b> even <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> unfavorable areas to reach some more suitable surfaces[40]. The mechanisms underlying cell-topography interactions remain elusive but have a major impact on cell spreading and migration. These interactions concern not only porous structure but also various surface topographies. Similar results have recently been presented on microsphere array patterns promoting MSC adhesion and spreading through filopodia formation and conversion of filopodia into lamellipodia[27].|$|R

We provide unambiguous proof of the ‘‘misGvA’ ’ approach concept and extend the applicability of the method for the studies of variants of Pol i in the yeast model system with different cation cofactors. We produced human Pol i in baker’s yeast, which do not have a POLI ortholog. The ‘‘misGvA’ ’ activity is absent in cell extracts containing an empty vector, or producing catalytically dead Pol i, or Pol i lacking exon 2, but is robust in the strain producing wild-type Pol i or its catalytic core, or protein with the active center L 62 I mutant. The signature pattern of primer extension products resulting from inaccurate DNA synthesis by extracts of cells producing either Pol i or human Pol g is different. The DNA sequence of the template is critical for the detection of the infidelity of DNA synthesis attributed to DNA Pol i. The primer/template and composition of the exogenous DNA precursor pool can be adapted to monitor replication fidelity in cell extracts expressing various error-prone Pols or mutator variants of accurate Pols. Finally, we demonstrate that the mutation rates in yeast strains producing human DNA Pols i and g are not elevated over the control strain, despite highly inaccurate DNA synthesis b...|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil borne {{phytopathogen}} {{that causes}} crown gall tumors on plants. The process of tumor formation involves the transfer {{and integration of}} a specific DNA segment (T-DNA) from the bacterium into the plant chromosome. VirD 2 is an Agrobacterium protein involved in T-DNA processing and transfer into plants. VirD 2 protein covalently attaches to the T-DNA and enters into the plant cell. A C-terminal region of VirD 2 called ω is involved in T-DNA integration but not T-DNA transfer. A bacterium containing a particular VirD 2 ω mutation will transiently transform cells but tumors will not result. My experiments investigated the role of this ω region in T-DNA integration into the plant chromosome. I used an ω mutant Agrobacterium strain and showed that, unlike the situation with the wild-type bacterium, with this particular mutant there was little T-DNA integrated into the plant chromosome. Plant factors are postulated {{to be involved in}} T-DNA transfer and integration. To isolate plant genes that are involved in T-DNA transfer and integration, I identified several Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA tagged mutants that are deficient in forming crown gall tumors after infection with Agrobacterium. In one of the mutants, I identified a disrupted gene that is involved in the tumorigenesis deficiency phenotype. The mutant gene encodes histone H 2 A. Complementation analysis indicates that histone H 2 A is involved in T-DNA transformation, most likely in the T-DNA integration step. I characterized the histone H 2 A genes in Arabidopsis. There are at least six variants of Arabidopsis histone H 2 A genes. During the process of complementation I discovered that germ-line transformation of Arabidopsis <b>can</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> of the steps involved in conventional Agrobacterium root transformation. Using different avirulent Agrobacterium mutants and Arabidopsis ecotypes and/or mutants that are resistant to Agrobacterium root transformation, I showed that germ-line transformation required Agrobacterium vir genes but not several plant genes required for Agrobacterium binding to or T-DNA integration in root tissue. Finally, I developed a potential new strategy to control crown gall disease. By using Arabidopsis as a model plant, I expressed Agrobacterium VirD 2 protein in Arabidopsis and showed that transgenic plants expressing VirD 2 protein are resistant to Agrobacterium root transformation. ...|$|E

Pyruvate dehydrogen-ase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP) were all present in extracts of cells grown on DL-lactate, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase and pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase were undetectable in extracts of cells grown on either DL-lactate, DL-malate or acetate. Malate-grown cells and acetate-grown cells contained {{lower levels of}} pyruvate carboxylase {{and higher levels of}} pyruvate kinase than did lactate-grown cells, and malate-grown cells also contained lower levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was undetectable in extracts of acetate-grown cells. Two mutant strains, which were unable to grow on pyruvate, lactate or any other compound metabolized via pyruvate, were found to be deficient in pyruvate carboxylase activity, indicating that this anaplerotic enzyme is essential for growth on pyruvate or related compounds as sole added carbon source. This requirement for pyruvate carboxylase <b>can</b> be <b>bypassed</b> to <b>some</b> extent, however, since the mutants grew on acetate, albeit more slowly than the wild-type and after a long lag period. The key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, were present at high levels in extracts of acetate-grown cells, both of the mutants and of several wild-type strains tested, whereas isocitrate lyase activity was undetectable in three different strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. This is consistent with previous suggestions that acetate is assimilated via the glyoxylate cycle in R. capsulatus but not in R. sphaeroides...|$|R

40|$|Effective, {{real-time}} {{training of}} health care professionals in Invasive procedures is a challenging task. Furthermore, assessing in practice the acquisition of the dexterity and skills required to safely perform such operations is particularly difficult to perform objectively and reliably. The development of virtual reality (VR) simulators offers great potential toward these objectives, and <b>can</b> help <b>bypass</b> <b>some</b> of the difficulties associated with classical surgical training and assessment procedures. In this context, we have developed a prototype VR simulator platform for training {{in a class of}} invasive procedures, such as accessing central vessels. This paper focuses more particularly on a pilot study treating the specific application case of subclavian vein paracentesis. The simulation incorporates 3 D models of all the human anatomy structures involved In this procedure, where collision detection and response algorithms are implemented to simulate most of the potential complications in accordance with the situations encountered in real clinical practice. Furthermore, haptic display Is integrated using a typical force feedback device providing the user with a sense of touch during the simulated operations. Our main objective In this study was to obtain quantitative evaluation results regarding the effect of haptic display on performance. Two user groups participated in the study: (I) novice users and (II) experienced surgeons. The system automatically provides quantitative assessment scores of users' performance, applying a set of objective measures that also involve the optimally of the needle insertion path and indicators of maneuvering errors. Training and skill assessment performance of the system is evaluated In a twofold manner, regarding respectively: (a) the learning curve of novice users, and (b) the correlation of the system-generated scores with the actual surgical experience of the user. These performance indicators are assessed with respect to the activation of the haptic display and to whether this has any beneficial effect (or not). The experimental findings of this first pilot study provide quantitative evidence about the significance of haptic display, not only as a means to enhance the realism of the surgical simulation, but especially as an irreplaceable component for achieving objective and reliable skill assessment. Further larger-scale and long-term clinical studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of such platforms for actual training and dexterity enhancement, particularly when more complex sensorimotor skills are Involved. © 2008 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R
