25|$|In some nations, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and New Zealand, {{imported}} alien crayfish are {{a danger}} to local rivers. The three species commonly imported to Europe from the Americas are Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish may spread into different bodies of water because specimens captured for pets in one river are often released into a different catchment. There is a potential for ecological damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water (e.g., <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> in Europe).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{crayfish}} {{suffer from}} a disease called <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> caused by the North American water mould Aphanomyces astaci which was transmitted to Europe when North American species of crayfish were introduced there. Species of the genus Astacus are particularly susceptible to infection, allowing the [...] plague-coevolved signal crayfish to invade parts of Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Fish species {{native to}} the lake include {{northern}} pike, perch, roach, and, to some degree, rudd. [...] There are many introduced species such as rainbow trout, North American brook trout, trout, and the hybrid species splake making the lake well-attended by anglers during both summers and winters. [...] <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> eliminated the population of noble crayfish in 1987, but some 1.200 signal crayfishs were introduced in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Lough Lene had {{a notable}} {{population}} {{of fresh water}} crayfish, a species that is listed on Annex II of the E.U. Habitats Directive. This species disappeared from Lough Lene in 1987 following an outbreak of <b>crayfish</b> fungus <b>plague.</b> The species was re-introduced and breeding was recorded in 1995. Since then, a further outbreak of the <b>crayfish</b> fungus <b>plague</b> has once again led to {{the disappearance of the}} species from Lough Lene.|$|R
50|$|The creek's {{watershed}} includes extensive forested and shrub wetlands, most {{of which}} are listed as potentially restorable and 28 acre of which have been restored. An infestation of rusty <b>crayfish</b> has <b>plagued</b> the creek's entire length for some years, and another noted aquatic invasive is reed canary grass along much of the watershed's wetlands. Its entire course is also listed as impaired due to nonpoint sources and destabilization of the creek's banks, leading to contamination by sediment and suspended solids. This signifies that the water quality does not allow the creek to meet its designated use, necessitating a water quality improvement plan. The creek's total maximum daily load planning is still in development.|$|R
40|$|The noble {{crayfish}} (Astacus astacus) {{is one of}} two native species of crayfish living in this country who are all over our country strictly protecte, because they are identified as critically endangered species. In Europe it is one of five native species of crayfish, reported by IUCN as an endangered species that needs protection management. Its population was dramatically reduced due to <b>crayfish</b> <b>plagues,</b> which carry non-native crayfish species from North America, who were introduced in the past in Europe and later to the Czech Republic. In the past, have been isolated and described microsatellite markers for crayfish (Koiv et al., 2008 a). As part of this work was tested using the eight microsatellite markers on samples obtained from the czech population of crayfish. Testing was performed on 53 samples from six populations of crayfish. Test samples were subjected to isolation of DNA from tissues of the third walking legs using DNA Lego Kit. Then test isolate DNA electrophoresis on agarose gel. Testing the temperature cycle of PCR amplification based on the original publication Koiv et al., (2008 a), followed by PCR cycles were adjusted according to the quality of PCR products obtained in our laboratory. Primer annealing temperature 60 °C was chosen as the best for six tested loci i. e. Aas 3666, Aas 3115, Aas 790, Aas 1198, Aas 3950 and Aas 766, for two other loci Aas 2489 and Aas 3040 was chosen 55 °C annealing temperature. The resulting PCR products were tested on agarose gel and subsequently fragment analysis on an automatic sequencer Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000 determining the lenght of PCR products in multiplex consisting of several loci. In the individual loci were in our 53 samples found from 1 to 13 alleles ? one of the loci was monomorphic in all samples analyzed. The moravian population in the Boskovice tank showed the greatest variability, the average number of alleles per locus 3. 86, then the north bohemian population from Jaroměř 3. 43 alleles per locus. Zelenohorská population of 3 alleles at a locus and Světlohorská population of 2. 57 alleles per locus. The lowest average number of alleles per locus had a population from Landštejn 2. 43. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to develop a literature search of methods use in molecular biology studies of crayfish and also validate the use of eight microsatellite markers have described for the {{noble crayfish}}. In laboratory conditions were succesfully optimized using seven microsatellite markers from the eight described. These microsatellite markers should be used for population studies, or for determining parentage (paternity) in breeding experiments. The verification of the applicability of microsatellite markers have been evaluate and some fundamental characteristics of the population, usability testing and optimization of microsatellite markers, however, was done only on {{a very small number of}} samples, because these characteristics have only a very limited explanatory power...|$|R
2500|$|The {{burrowing}} {{activities of}} P. clarkii {{can lead to}} damage to water courses and to crops, particularly rice, and its feeding can disrupt native ecosystems. It may out-compete the native crayfish species, and is a vector for the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> fungus Aphanomyces astaci, for crayfish virus vibriosis, {{and a number of}} worms parasitic on vertebrates. [...] Their burrowing activities may also be a threat to civil infrastructure such as storm ponds and levees.|$|E
50|$|From 1907, <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} water mould Aphanomyces astaci, damaged stocks of the native European crayfish Astacus astacus. Since the signal crayfish occupied a similar ecological niche in its native range, it was imported in the 1960s to Sweden and Finland to allow recreational and commercial crayfish capture. It was not realised {{at the time that}} the signal crayfish was a carrier of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague.</b> All American species carry the infection, but it is only lethal to individuals that are already stressed; to European species, the infection is rapidly fatal.|$|E
50|$|Beside {{naturally}} occurring threats, A. torrentium has also {{suffered from the}} introduction of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> Asphanomyces astaci, carried by invasive crayfish species from North America, and from the release of detergents into streams while washing laundry.|$|E
50|$|Due to the American <b>{{crayfish}}</b> <b>plague,</b> crayfish of this genus {{have been}} almost wiped out in Europe and have in many European countries {{been replaced by the}} North American signal crayfish, which is often more resistant to the plague.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unusual}} in that it lives in silty streams, rather than the clear water usually {{preferred}} by crayfish. Like Pacifastacus leniusculus, another invasive North American crayfish, O. limosus carries <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> and {{is a threat to}} native European crayfish.|$|E
50|$|The river {{has been}} invaded by the American signal crayfish, which is {{affecting}} the native protected white-clawed crayfish. Not {{only do the}} invading species fight for food resources but they also carry <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> which the native species has no immunity to.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> Aphanomyces astaci, is a water mold that infects crayfish, {{most notably}} the European Astacus which dies {{within a few weeks}} of being infected. When {{experimentally}} tested, species from Australia, New Guinea and Japan were also found to be susceptible to the infection.|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{a natural}} habitat for {{northern}} pike, perch, roach, rudd, tench, and crucian carp. More than 100 individual mirror carps and scale carps were introduced in 1993. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> struck the lake in 1979, but since then the signal crayfish has been introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Disease: Some {{introduced}} species carry diseases to which native species are susceptible. The grey squirrel is a carrier of the squirrel pox virus which kills red squirrels but not grey squirrels. [...] The European crayfish {{is susceptible to}} <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> which is spread by the introduced signal crayfish.|$|E
50|$|Astacus astacus {{was once}} {{abundant}} in Europe, {{although it was}} expensive to buy, and {{is considered to be}} the finest edible crayfish. It is, however, susceptible to the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> carried by the invasive American species signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), and is therefore listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

50|$|The Allen had {{the strongest}} {{population}} of white clawed crayfish in Dorset and {{measures such as}} tree planting and slowing {{the flow of the}} river down were implemented to help the species. However, an outbreak of <b>Crayfish</b> <b>Plague</b> was discovered on the river in 2014 with at least 100 of the native species found dead in the river.|$|E
50|$|Vårbyfjärden {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{maritime}} environments in Sweden to suffer <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> which hit the lake in 1907. The plague was introduced in Lake Mälaren by affected animals thrown into the water at Kornhamnstorg in central Stockholm, from where ships carrying crayfishes spread the disease further inland. Since then signal crayfish has been introduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> {{first arrived}} in Europe in Italy in 1859, either with {{imported}} crayfish from North America, or in ballast water. After its original introduction in Italy in 1860, it spread quickly through Europe and was discovered in Sweden in 1907, in Spain in 1972, in Norway in 1971, in Great Britain in 1981, in Turkey in 1984 and in Ireland in 1987.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for this decline is the {{introduction}} of the invasive North American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The signal crayfish is a carrier of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> an infectious disease to which it has resistance while the native crayfish have none. The British species is also sensitive to many kinds of pollution, such as insecticides.|$|E
50|$|The river {{has been}} noted as being {{important}} for Bullhead and Lamphrey. It was previously a bastion for White Clawed Crayfish, {{but most of the}} species in this river were killed off with <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> in 2008. Crayfish have been noted in the tributaries of the Manifold and it is hoped that re-colonisation can be achieved by the surviving upstream crayfish.|$|E
50|$|The signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, is a North American {{species of}} crayfish. It was {{introduced}} to Europe in the 1960s to supplement the Scandinavian Astacus astacus fisheries, which were being damaged by <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> but the imports {{turned out to be}} a carrier of that disease. The signal crayfish is now considered an invasive species across Europe and Japan, ousting native species there.|$|E
50|$|Fish species {{native to}} the lake include {{northern}} pike, perch, roach, and, to some degree, rudd. There are many introduced species such as rainbow trout, North American brook trout, trout, and the hybrid species splake making the lake well-attended by anglers during both summers and winters. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> eliminated the population of noble crayfish in 1987, but some 1.200 signal crayfishs were introduced in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of the fauna in 1997 documented some 55 species, which was considered a relatively high diversity. Most prevalent was freshwater gastropods, caddisflies, leeches, and beetles. Common fishes are perch, silver bream, roach, and zander; but burbot, European smelt, and eel have also been reported. Zander, grass carp, and trout have been introduced. Angling is thus popular in the lake. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> struck the lake in 1978 but signal crayfish were reintroduced in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|Although these water {{features}} {{have been}} artificially created, rare {{flora and fauna}} have evolved in and around many of the Upper Harz ponds. The water is low in nutrients and rather cool. The crayfish, which has died out in most European waterbodies due to <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> {{has been able to}} survive in many Upper Harz Ponds thanks to their isolated locations. Pond operators and fishing leaseholders have worked successfully to increase their numbers.|$|E
50|$|Fishes {{natural to}} Långsjön include perch, {{northern}} pike, roach, rudd, carp bream, crucian carp, tench, and ruffe; extraneous species are common carp and mirror carp. Pike and zander are planted-out carnivorous species while roach and crucian carp have been decimated by trawling. Sample catches in 1999 showed {{the number of}} perch, roach, and carp had increased far beyond expected levels. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> hit the lake in 1984, but the signal crayfish was reintroduced within a few years.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline of}} European {{crayfish}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a factor in}} the drop in mink numbers, as minks are notably absent in {{the eastern side of the}} Urals, where crayfish are also absent. The decline in mink numbers has also been linked to the destruction of crayfish in Finland during the 1920s-1940s, when the crustaceans were infected with <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague.</b> The failure of the European mink to expand west to Scandinavia coincides with the gap in crayfish distribution.|$|E
50|$|The Environmental Agency (now Ministry of Environment) of Japan added it as a {{vulnerable}} species (IUCN category) to the Red Data List in 2000. It {{is thought that}} the causes of its decrease are corruption of water quality {{and the spread of}} the American crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, which was imported in the 20th century and has steadily proliferated in northern Japan. Some suspect that this American crayfish carries some disease, such as the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> known in Europe, that eliminates endemic crayfish.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the lakes}} {{upstream}} and downstream suffered of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> in the late 1970s, which makes it likely Ågestasjön was affected too. As signal crayfish {{was introduced in the}} neighbouring lakes recently, it is assumed they are also present in Ågestasjön. Amphibians are represented by moor frog, common frog, true toad, and smooth newt. There are several bats present by the lake: northern bat, Daubenton's bat, common noctule, and whiskered bat. Otters were present in the lake until the 1960s and were spotted nearby in 2003.|$|E

50|$|The {{river is}} unusual in that it {{supports}} a population of native White clawed crayfish in the upper reaches, which is an endangered species in the UK. In 2013, <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> was discovered in the lower parts of the river; the fungal plague is carried by the non-native American signal crayfish and is deadly to the native white clawed species. Efforts are being made to restrict {{the spread of the}} disease in order that the crayfish in the headwaters and in nearby ponds are not infected.|$|E
50|$|The same {{inventory}} reported 45 species/taxa in the lake-bed fauna, {{which includes}} all common species, dominated by Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, freshwater gastropods, and leeches. perch, roach, northern pike, tench, silver bream, ruffe, and crucian carp {{have been documented}} in the lake, sample catches typically exceeding excepted levels. Zander {{was introduced in the}} late 1990s. <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> caused a population of European crayfish to disappear in 1984, subsequently replaced by signal crayfish introduced throughout the 1990s. In 1993 the population of amphibians included moor frog and common toad, of which only the later was found by 1996.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} notable species in the stream is the rare stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) {{attracted}} by the strong current and stony bottom of the stream. During dry periods sections of Igelbäcken dry up {{which is the most}} important threat to the fish. While its presence in the stream is still considered as threatened, the numbers of individuals increased during the period 1999-2001. Other fishes in the stream include perch, northern pike, roach, tench, crucian carp, and, more rarely, trout. European crayfish were observed in 1989 and signal crayfish, illegally introduced during the 1990s, is feared to threaten the population of stone loach and to bring <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> into the stream.|$|E
50|$|A less {{positive}} {{story is}} that of the native white-clawed crayfish, which has suffered at the hands of another American import, the signal crayfish. Originally imported by the aquaculture industry, the signal crayfish was seen as a way for trout farms to diversify and exploit new markets. However, due to their expert, escapologist nature, signal crayfish soon escaped into surrounding river systems and quickly spread throughout the majority of the UK's southern river system. Signal crayfish have carried <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> to which they are resistant, but the native white-clawed crayfish is not. The result has been the gradual eradication of native crayfish from the UK's rivers. In the case of the Chess, white-clawed crayfish have been extinct since the mid-1990s.The Chess is also home to a number of invasive alien plant species including Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and Orange balsam.|$|E
