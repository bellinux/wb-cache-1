40|$|A small {{fraction}} of T cells expresses killer-cell Ig-like receptors (KIR), a family of MHC class I-specific receptors that can modulate TCR-dependent activation of effector functions. Although KIR(+) cells are enriched within Ag-experienced T cell subsets, the precise relationships between KIR(+) and KIR(-) T cells and the stage of KIR induction on these lymphocytes remain unclear. In this study, we compared KIR(-) and KIR(+) alphabeta T cell <b>clones,</b> <b>sorted</b> {{by means of the}} CD 158 b (KIR 2 DL 2 /KIR 2 DL 3 /KIR 2 DS 2) specific mAb GL 183. We isolated several pairs of CD 158 b(+) and CD 158 b(-) alphabeta T cell clones sharing identical productive and nonproductive TCR transcripts. We showed that expression of functional KIR on T cells is regulated after termination of TCR rearrangements. Transcriptional regulation of KIR genes was documented in multiple T cell clones generated from the same donor, and the presence of KIR transcripts was also detected in KIR(-) T cells. These results document a complex regulation of KIR expression in T cells at both pre and posttranscriptional levels, under the control of yet undefined signals provided in vivo...|$|R
40|$|We {{generated}} transgenic mice expressing chimeric receptors, which comprise extracellular {{domains of}} the human granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) receptor and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. In suspension cultures of lineage-negative (Lin−), 5 -fluorouracil-resistant bone marrow cells of the transgenic mice, a combination of hGM-CSF and stem cell factor (SCF) induced exponential expansions of mixed colony-forming unit. The combination of hGM-CSF and SCF was effective on enriched, Lin−Sca- 1 +c-kit+ progenitors and increased either mixed colony-forming unit or cobblestone area–forming cells. In case of stimulation with hGM-CSF and SCF, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and SCF, or IL- 11 and SCF, the most efficient expansion was achieved with hGM-CSF and SCF. When Lin−Sca- 1 +c-kit+CD 34 − further enriched progenitors were <b>clone</b> <b>sorted</b> and individually incubated {{in the presence of}} SCF, hGM-CSF stimulated a larger number of cells than did IL- 6, IL- 6 and soluble IL- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R), or IL- 11. These data suggest the presence of IL- 6 Rα-, IL- 11 Rα-, and gp 130 -low to -negative primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Such primitive progenitors are equipped with signal transduction molecules and can expand when these chimeric receptors are genetically introduced into the cells and stimulated with hGM-CSF in the presence of SCF...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the dominant microbial taxa present in suspension within the rumen fluid from slaughtered one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) in Algeria was carried out using culture-independent molecular techniques. The rumen fluid of freshly eviscerated animals was sampled by a syringe and filtered through 0. 22 µm filters in sterile conditions. Lyophilized filters were subsequently used as starting material for bacterial lysis and total DNA extraction procedures using DNA purification kits and suitably adapted protocols. The gene corresponding to the small subunit of ribosomal RNA (16 S rDNA) was PCR-amplified from the bulk of DNA using eubacterial primers, and the pool of amplicons was ligated to plasmids and cloned in Escherichia coli, generating a clone bank of several hundred individuals representative of the rumen bacterial community. A preliminary {{analysis of}} 86 <b>clones,</b> <b>sorted</b> by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), and sequenced by Applied Biosystems automated sequencing using fluorescent terminators yielded the following results. The most abundant amplicon belonged to the Pseudomonas genus encompassing over 65 % of the clones. Pseudomonas lutea appeared the most frequent homology hit in a BLAST GenBank comparison. The remaining flora featured taxa include (in order of deceasing abundance) : Synechococcus sp., Moraxella osloensis, Sphingomonas sp., Diaphorobacter nitroreducens, Acinetobacter sp., Ruminococcus albus, Propionibacterium acnes and Comamonas sp.

They form various microbial communities in response to environmental factors, including soil texture and chemical components. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the microbial community structure of soil. In vineyard soils, the overall microbial community structure has yet to be unraveled. To understand the microbial community in vineyard soil, we surveyed comprehensively microbial communities in Japanese vineyard soils by using a culture-independent molecular approach. We identified 681 fungal clone sequences and 1076 bacterial clone sequences in soil samples collected from nine independent Japanese vineyards, and the results suggested that Ascomycota is the dominant group in the fungal community, whereas Proteobacterium and Acidobacterium are the dominant groups in the bacterial community. DNA was directly extracted from the soil samples, and the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region or the bacterial 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The recovered fungal <b>clones</b> were <b>sorted</b> into 225 operational taxonomic units and the majority of the clone sequences were assigned to Ascomycota. Meanwhile, the recovered bacterial <b>clones</b> were <b>sorted</b> into 17 phyla, and the abundant phyla were Proteobacterium and Acidobacterium. These results differed from the reported fungal and bacterial community structures in forest and agricultural soils. Moreover, we preliminarily generated a catalog of Japanese vineyard soils. The microbial community structures in the vineyard soils were extremely complex, suggesting that the microbial community structure in each vineyard soil has individual characteristics. Our study comprehensively showed for the first time fungal and bacterial community structures in Japanese vineyard soils, and is most likely to provide a clue to understand the nature of Japanese vineyard soils.

We used a previously undescribed approach to create unbiased panels of CD 8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones specific for {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2, a pathogen with a complex genome encoding at least 85 polypeptides. Circulating herpes simplex virus type 2 -specific cells were enriched and <b>cloned</b> after <b>sorting</b> for expression of the skin homing-associated receptor, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, bypassing restimulation with antigen. The specificity of the resultant cytotoxic clones was determined. Clonal frequencies were compared {{with each other and}} with the total number of cytotoxic clones. For each subject within the homing receptor-positive compartment, the CD 8 cytotoxic response was dominated by T cells specific for only a few peptides. Previously undescribed antigens and epitopes in viral tegument, capsid, or scaffold proteins were immunodominant in some subjects. Clone enumeration analyses were confirmed in some subjects with dominance studies by using herpes simplex mutants, vaccinia recombinants, and/or enzyme-linked immune spots. We conclude that among circulating cells expressing a homing-associated receptor, during chronic herpes type 2 infection, the CD 8 T cell response becomes quite focused despite the presence of many potential antigenic peptides...|$|R

A robust functional calcium cell line was developed that contained both the human truncated GABA B(1 b) and human truncated GABA B(2) receptors. The cell line was analyzed and sorted using Β-lactamase as a reporter. Single cell <b>clones</b> were <b>sorted</b> and isolated using flow cytometry based on high Β-lactamase expression. The single cell clones were further tested in a 384 -well calcium mobilization assay using the Fluo- 4 AM calcium indicator on the fluorescent imaging plate reader system (FLIPR).

40|$|SummaryThe {{most common}} {{inherited}} form of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) known stems from Progranulin (GRN) mutation and exhibits TDP- 43 plus ubiquitin aggregates. Despite the causative role of GRN haploinsufficiency in FTLD-TDP, the neurobiology of this secreted glycoprotein is unclear. Here, we examined PGRN binding {{to the cell}} surface. PGRN binds to cortical neurons via its C terminus, and unbiased expression <b>cloning</b> identifies Sortilin (<b>Sort</b> 1) as a binding site. Sort 1 −/− neurons exhibit reduced PGRN binding. In the CNS, Sortilin is expressed by neurons and PGRN is most strongly expressed by activated microglial cells after injury. Sortilin rapidly endocytoses and delivers PGRN to lysosomes. Mice lacking Sortilin have elevations in brain and serum PGRN levels of 2. 5 - to 5 -fold. The 50 % PGRN decrease causative in FTLD-TDP cases is mimicked in GRN+/− mice, and is fully normalized by Sort 1 ablation.

40|$|Abstract Background The genetic {{diversity}} of many protists is unknown. The differences {{that result from}} this diversity can be important in interactions among individuals. The social amoeba Polysphondylium violaceum, which {{is a member of}} the Dictyostelia, has a social stage where individual amoebae aggregate together to form a multicellular fruiting body with dead stalk cells and live spores. Individuals can either cooperate with amoebae from the same <b>clone,</b> or <b>sort</b> to form clonal fruiting bodies. In this study we look at {{genetic diversity}} in P. violaceum and at how this diversity impacts social behavior. Results The phylogeny of the ribosomal DNA sequence (17 S to 5. 8 S region) shows that P. violaceum is made up of at least two groups. Mating compatibility is more common between clones from the same phylogenetic group, though matings between clones from different phylogenetic groups sometimes occurred. P. violaceum clones are more likely to form clonal fruiting bodies when they are mixed with clones from a different group than when they are mixed with a clone of the same group. Conclusion Both the phylogenetic and mating analyses suggest the possibility of cryptic species in P. violaceum. The level of divergence found within P. violaceum is comparable to the divergence between sibling species in other dictyostelids. Both major groups A/B and C/D/E/F show kin discrimination, which elevates relatedness within fruiting bodies but not to the level of clonality. The diminished cooperation in mixes between groups suggests that the level of genetic variation between individuals influences the extent of their cooperation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to clone PPARγ 1 cDNA in an {{appropriate}} mammalian expression vector, with a chimeric cDNA form, encompassing PPARγ with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA. This recombinant plasmid will be used for further analyses to investigate the molecular mechanism of PPARγ 1 for neural differentiation process. Moreover, the nuclear localization of the PPARγ 1 protein linked to EGFP marker was chased by using transient transfection of a constructed plasmid into bovine fibroblast cells. Materials and Methods: Total RNA was extracted from the fatty tissue of an adult mouse. Using specific pair primers, PPARγ 1 cDNA was synthesized and amplified to produce the entire length of ORF. RT-PCR products containing PPARγ 1 cDNA were treated by enzymatic digestion and inserted into the pEGFP-C 1 downstream from EGFP cDNA. The constructed vector was used for transformation into bacterial competent cells. Positive colonies which showed inserted PPARγ 1 cDNA were selected for plasmid preparations and additional analysis was performed to ensure that PPARγ 1 cDNA was inserted properly. Finally, to confirm the intracellular localization of EGFP-PPARγ 1, bovine fibroblast cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid. Results: Our results from enzymatic digestion and sequencing confirmed, as expected, that PPARγ 1 cDNA was amplified and cloned correctly. This cDNA gene encompassed 1428 bp. The related product was entered into the nucleus of bovine fibroblasts after transfection of its cDNA.

The separation of virgin mouse mammary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting, their growth at clonal density, and the phenotyping of the clones obtained with cell-type specific markers are described in this paper. Epithelial cells were isolated by collagenase digestion followed by trypsinization, and the luminal and myoepithelial cells were flow-sorted with the rat monoclonal antibodies 33 A 10 and JB 6, respectively. <b>Sorted</b> cells were <b>cloned</b> under, using low oxygen conditions (< 5 % vol/vol), in medium containing cholera toxin and insulin, with an irradiated feeder layer of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells.

Whereas sorted myoepithelial cells gave a single <b>clone</b> type, <b>sorted</b> luminal cells gave three morphological clone types, two of which grew rapidly. All myoepithelially derived clones showed a limited proliferative capacity in vitro, in contrast to their rat and human counterparts, as shown in previous studies.

40|$|Recent {{applications}} of culture-independent, molecular methods have revealed unexpectedly high diversity {{in a variety}} of functional and phylogenetic groups of microorganisms in the ocean. However, none of the existing research tools are free from significant limitations, such as PCR and cloning biases, low phylogenetic resolution and others. Here, we employed novel, single-cell sequencing techniques to assess the composition of small (< 10 [*]μm diameter), heterotrophic protists from the Gulf of Maine. Single cells were isolated by flow cytometry, their genomes amplified, and 18 S rRNA marker genes were amplified and sequenced. We compared the results to traditional environmental PCR <b>cloning</b> of <b>sorted</b> cells. The diversity of heterotrophic protists was significantly higher in the library of single amplified genomes (SAGs) than in environmental PCR clone libraries of the 18 S rRNA gene, obtained from the same coastal sample. Libraries of SAGs, but not clones contained several recently discovered, uncultured groups, including picobiliphytes and novel marine stramenopiles. Clone, but not SAG, libraries contained several large clusters of identical and nearly identical sequences of Dinophyceae, Cercozoa and Stramenopiles. Similar results were obtained using two alternative primer sets, suggesting that PCR biases may not be the only explanation for the observed patterns. Instead, differences in the number of 18 S rRNA gene copies among the various protist taxa probably had a significant role in determining the PCR clone composition. These results show that single-cell sequencing has the potential to more accurately assess protistan community composition than previously established methods. In addition, the creation of SAG libraries opens opportunities for the analysis of multiple genes or entire genomes of the uncultured protist groups...|$|R

To {{identify}} markers {{associated with}} the chondrogenic capacity of expanded human articular chondrocytes and to use these markers for sorting of more highly chondrogenic subpopulations. Methods. The chondrogenic capacity of chondrocyte populations derived from different donors (n = 21) or different clonal strains from the same cartilage biopsy specimen (n = 21) was defined based on the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content of tissues generated using a pellet culture model. Selected cell populations were analyzed by microarray and flow cytometry. In some experiments, cells were sorted using antibodies against molecules {{found to be associated}} with differential chondrogenic capacity and again assessed in pellet cultures. Results. Significance Analysis of Microarrays indicated that chondrocytes with low chondrogenic capacity expressed higher levels of insulin-like growth factor I and of catabolic genes (e. g., matrix metalloproteinase 2, aggrecanase 2), while chondrocytes with high chondrogenic capacity expressed higher levels of genes involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions (e. g., CD 49 c, CD 49 f). Flow cytometry analysis showed that CD 44, CD 151, and CD 49 c were expressed at significantly higher levels in chondrocytes with higher chondrogenic capacity. Flow cytometry analysis of clonal chondrocyte strains indicated that CD 44 and CD 151 could also identify more chondrogenic <b>clones.</b> Chondrocytes <b>sorted</b> for brighter CD 49 c or CD 44 signal expression produced tissues with higher levels of GAG per DNA (up to 1. 4 -fold) and type 11 collagen messenger RNA (up to 3. 4 -fold) than did unsorted cells. Conclusion. We identified markers that allow characterization of the capacity of monolayer-expanded chondrocytes to form in vitro cartilaginous tissue and enable enrichment for subpopulations with higher chondrogenic capacity. These markers might be used as a means to predict and possibly improve the outcome of cell-based cartilage repair techniques...|$|R

Soil samples were taken at different depths from four horizons of a podzol profile. A basidiomycete-specific primer pair (ITS 1 F-ITS 4 B) {{was used to}} amplify fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences from total DNA extracts of the soil horizons. Amplified basidiomycete DNA was cloned and sequenced, and a selection of the obtained clones was analyzed phylogenetically. Based on sequence similarity, the fungal <b>clone</b> sequences were <b>sorted</b> into 25 different fungal groups, or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Out of 25 basidiomycete OTUs, 7 OTUs showed high nucleotide homology (≥ 99 %) with known EM fungal sequences and 16 were found exclusively in the mineral soil. The taxonomic positions of six OTUs remained unclear. OTU sequences were compared to sequences from morphotyped EM root tips collected from the same sites. Of the 25 OTUs, 10 OTUs had ≥ 98 % sequence similarity with these EM root tip sequences. The present study demonstrates the use of molecular techniques to identify EM hyphae in various soil types.

In contrast to IgG- and IgA-producing clones, multiple isotype expression appears to be both frequent and stable in cells committed to IgE production.

To estimate the importance of the DNE of TP 53 mutations, we analysed the percentage of cancer cases showing a single heterozygous mutation of TP 53 and searched for a cell line with a single heterozygous mutation of this gene. This approach was based on the knowledge that genes with evident DNE, such as EGFR and IDH 1, represent nearly 100 % of single heterozygous mutations in tumour specimens and cell lines. Methods: Genetic analyses (LOH and sequencing) performed for early and late passages of several cell lines originally described as showing single heterozygous TP 53 mutations (H- 318, G- 16, PF- 382, MOLT- 13, ST- 486 and LS- 123). Statistical analysis of IARC TP 53 and SANGER databases. Genetic analyses of N-RAS, FBXW 7, PTEN and STR markers to test cross-contamination and cell line identity.

Results: A database study revealed TP 53 single heterozygous mutations in 35 % of in vivo (surgical and biopsy) samples and only 10 % of cultured cells (in vitro), although those numbers appeared to be overestimated. We deem that published in vivo TP 53 mutation analyses are not as rigorous as studies in vitro, and we did not find any cell line showing a stable, single heterozygous mutation.

40|$|AbstractNext {{generation}} sequencing (NGS) is revolutionizing genomics and {{is providing}} novel insights into genome organization, evolution and function. The number of plant genomes targeted for sequencing is rising. For the moment, however, {{the acquisition of}} full genome sequences in large genome species remains difficult, largely because the short reads produced by NGS platforms are inadequate to cope with repeat-rich DNA, which forms {{a large part of}} these genomes. The problem of sequence redundancy is compounded in polyploids, which dominate the plant kingdom. An approach to overcoming some of these difficulties is to reduce the full nuclear genome to its individual chromosomes using flow-sorting. The DNA acquired in this way has proven to be suitable for many applications, including PCR-based physical mapping, in situ hybridization, forming DNA arrays, the development of DNA markers, the construction of BAC libraries and positional <b>cloning.</b> Coupling chromosome <b>sorting</b> with NGS offers opportunities for the study of genome organization at the single chromosomal level, for comparative analyses between related species and for the validation of whole genome assemblies. Apart from the primary aim of reducing the complexity of the template, taking a chromosome-based approach enables independent teams to work in parallel, each tasked with the analysis of a different chromosome(s). Given that the number of plant species tractable for chromosome sorting is increasing, the likelihood is that chromosome genomics – the marriage of cytology and genomics – will make a significant contribution to the field of plant genetics...|$|R

To date, however, no studies {{have addressed the}} TCR profile in different tumor sites and the peripheral blood from the same patient. We compared the TCR usage of Melan-A-specific T cells from different compartments of a single melanoma patient to evaluate possible clonotype expansion or preferential homing over a 4 -mo follow-up period. Using HLA-A 2 peptide tetramers, CD 8 (+) T cells recognizing the modified Melan-A immunodominant ELAGIGILTV peptide were isolated from four metastatic lesions resected from a single melanoma patient, and their TCR repertoire was studied. A panel of T cell clones was generated by cell cloning of tetramer-positive cells. Analysis of the TCR beta-chain V segment and the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR 3) length and sequence revealed a large diversity in the TCR repertoire, with {{only some of the}} clones showing a partial conservation in the CDR 3. A similar degree of diversity was found by analyzing a number of T cell <b>clones</b> obtained after <b>sorting</b> a Melan-A-specific population derived from PBLs of the same patient after in vitro culture with the immunodominant epitope. Moreover, clonotypes found at one site were not present in another, suggesting the lack of expansion and circulation of one or more clonotypes.

To reveal the denitrification ability of this organism, we first concentrated this organism by flow cytometric sorting following fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific probes for this organism. The purity of the target cells was about 97 % of total cell count in the sorted sample. The PCR amplification of the nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS) from unsorted and sorted cells was performed. Although nirK and nirS were amplified from unsorted cells, only nirS was detected from sorted cells, indicating that “Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis” has nirS. Furthermore, nirS fragments were cloned from unsorted (Ba <b>clone</b> library) and <b>sorted</b> (Bd <b>clone</b> library) cells and classified by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The most dominant clone in clone library Ba, which represented 62 % {{of the total number of}} clones, was not found in clone library Bd. In contrast, the most dominant clone in clone library Bd, which represented 59 % of the total number of clones, represented only 2 % of the total number of clones in clone library Ba, indicating that this clone could be that of “Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis. ” The sequence of this nirS clone exhibited less than 90 % similarity to the sequences of known denitrifying bacteria in the database. The recovery of the nirS genes makes it likely that “Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis” behaves as a denitrifying PAO capable of utilizing nitrite instead of oxygen as an electron acceptor for phosphorus uptake...|$|R
40|$|Psoriasis ist eine komplexe entzündliche Erkrankung der Haut. Charakteristisch ist eine dichte Infiltration von T-Lymphozyten und eine Hyperproliferation der Epithelschicht. Heutzutage belegen die Ergebnisse vieler experimteller Studien, daß Psoriasis eine T-Zell-induzierte Erkrankung ist. Die Spezifität der T-Zell-stimulierenden Antigene ist noch unbekannt. Voraussetzung für die Charakterisierung psoriatischer T-Zellen ist die Isolation von T-Zell-Klonen aus psoriatischen Plaques, deren Restimulation {{in vitro}} qualitativ und quantitativ erfaßbar ist. Hierfür haben wir einen hochsensiblen gamma-Interferon Elispot-Assay etabiert, der die Aktivität der T-Zellen aus Hautplaques erfaßt. Zudem zeigen wir, daß man aktivierte T-Zell-Klone mittels CD 25 -Markierung isolieren und anschließend klonieren kann. Unsere Ergebnisse können als eine Grundlage für weitere Versuche dienen, die die Spezifität von T-Zell-Klonen aus psoriatischen Plaques charakterisieren sollen. Psoriasis {{is a complex}} {{inflammatory}} disease of the skin characterized by a dense infiltration of T-lymphocytes and a hyperproliferation of the epithelial layer. A host of experimental and clinical data suggest that psoriasis is a T cell mediated disorder. The nature of T-cell-stimulating antigens is still unknown. One way to identify putative antigen(s) {{is the definition of}} T-cell-receptor specifities using randomized combinatorial peptide libraries. This requires the isolation and expansion of T cell clones from psoriatic plaques in vitro. Therefore we established a gamma-interferon Elispot-assay which allows quantification of the frequency of activated plaque-derived T cells in vitro. In addition, we show that activated T cell <b>clones</b> can be <b>sorted</b> via CD 25 and cloned. The expanded clones can also be restimulated by autologous cells. Our results should be useful in the design of experiments aiming at a systematic analysis of the specifity of T cell clones present in psoriatic plaques...|$|R
40|$|The {{malignant}} B {{cells in}} {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) typically express low-density membrane IgM or IgM/IgD. In vitro experiments {{have shown that the}} CLL cells can be induced to differentiate into cells that secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) and can occasionally undergo heavy (H) chain class switching. We now show that the CLL cells also undergo isotype-switching in vivo, since gamma and/or alpha H chain transcripts with identical FW 3 /CDR 3 /FW 4 regions as the mu CLL transcripts were detected in all of the 13 investigated patients with IgM+ CLL. In most cases switching had occurred to alpha 1 and gamma 3, but CLL transcripts corresponding to the other gamma chain isotypes were also detected. In one case both the productively and nonproductively rearranged allele were found to undergo H chain class switching. CLL gamma transcripts were also present in surface IgG+ sorted B cells, demonstrating that a small subset of the CLL cells express membrane IgG. In addition, transcripts encoding secretary gamma 2 and gamma 3 H chains were detected in two cases, which suggests that some serum IgG could be produced by the leukemic <b>clone.</b> Analysis of <b>sorted</b> PBL showed that isotype-switching occurs in CLL cells that express the CD 5 antigen. Finally, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the mu, alpha, and gamma CLL transcripts are identical, demonstrating that the CLL cells do not accumulate somatic mutations in their variable region genes after the H chain class switching. These data provide in vivo evidence that isotype-switching is a frequent phenomenon in CLL, and indicate that a subset of the CLL lymphocytes progress to later stages of B cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria are organelles {{that have}} their own DNA; serve as the powerhouses of {{eukaryotic}} cells; play important roles in stress responses, programmed cell death, and ageing; and {{in the vast majority}} of eukaryotes, are maternally transmitted. Strict maternal transmission of mitochondria makes it difficult to select for better-performing mitochondria, or against deleterious mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Cucumber is a useful plant for organellar genetics because its mitochondria are paternally transmitted and it possesses one of the largest mitochondrial genomes among all eukaryotes. Recombination among repetitive motifs in the cucumber mitochondrial DNA produces rearrangements associated with strongly mosaic (MSC) phenotypes. We previously reported nuclear control of sorting among paternally transmitted mitochondrial DNAs. The goal of this project was to map paternal sorting of mitochondria as a step towards its eventual cloning. We crossed single plants from plant introduction (PI) 401734 and Cucumis sativus var. hardwickii and produced an F 2 family. A total of 425 F 2 plants were genotyped for molecular markers and testcrossed as the female with MSC 16. Testcross families were scored for frequencies of wild-type versus MSC progenies. Discrete segregations for percent wild-type progenies were not observed and paternal sorting of mitochondria was therefore analyzed as a quantitative trait. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL; LOD 3 ̆e 23) was mapped between two simple sequence repeats encompassing a 459 -kb region on chromosome 3. Nuclear genes previously shown to affect the prevalence of mitochondrial DNAs (MSH 1, OSB 1, and RECA homologs) were not located near this major QTL on chromosome 3. Sequencing of this region from PI 401734, together with improved annotation of the cucumber genome, should result in the eventual <b>cloning</b> of paternal <b>sorting</b> of mitochondria and provide insights about nuclear control of organellar-DNA sorting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Heterozygosity of TP 53 {{missense}} mutations {{is related}} to the phenomenon of the dominant-negative effect (DNE). To estimate the importance of the DNE of TP 53 mutations, we analysed the percentage of cancer cases showing a single heterozygous mutation of TP 53 and searched for a cell line with a single heterozygous mutation of this gene. This approach was based on the knowledge that genes with evident DNE, such as EGFR and IDH 1, represent nearly 100 % of single heterozygous mutations in tumour specimens and cell lines. Methods Genetic analyses (LOH and sequencing) performed for early and late passages of several cell lines originally described as showing single heterozygous TP 53 mutations (H- 318, G- 16, PF- 382, MOLT- 13, ST- 486 and LS- 123). Statistical analysis of IARC TP 53 and SANGER databases. Genetic analyses of N-RAS, FBXW 7, PTEN and STR markers to test cross-contamination and cell line identity. Cell <b>cloning,</b> fluorescence-activated cell <b>sorting</b> and SSCP performed for the PF- 382 cell line. Results A database study revealed TP 53 single heterozygous mutations in 35 % of in vivo (surgical and biopsy) samples and only 10 % of cultured cells (in vitro), although those numbers appeared to be overestimated. We deem that published in vivo TP 53 mutation analyses are not as rigorous as studies in vitro, and we did not find any cell line showing a stable, single heterozygous mutation. G 16, PF- 382 and MOLT- 13 cells harboured single heterozygous mutations temporarily. ST- 486, H- 318 and LS- 123 cell lines were misclassified. Specific mutations, such as R 175 H, R 273 H, R 273 L or R 273 P, which are reported in the literature to exert a DNE, showed the lowest percentage of single heterozygous mutations in vitro (about 5 %). Conclusion We suggest that the currently reported percentage of TP 53 single heterozygous mutations in tumour samples and cancer cell lines is overestimated. Thus, the magnitude of the DNE of TP 53 mutations is questionable. This scepticism is supported by database investigations showing that retention of the wild-type allele occurs with the same frequency as either nonsense or missense TP 53 mutations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A useful {{application}} of flow cytometry is {{the investigation of}} cell receptor-ligand interactions. However such analyses are often compromised due to problems interpreting changes in ligand binding where the receptor expression is not constant. Commonly, problems are encountered due to cell treatments resulting in altered receptor expression levels, or when cell lines expressing a transfected receptor with variable expression are being compared. To overcome this limitation we have developed a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that aims to automatically and effectively simplify flow cytometric data and perform statistical tests {{in order to provide}} a clearer graphical representation of results. Results To demonstrate the use and advantages of this new spreadsheet method we have investigated the binding of the transmembrane adhesion receptor CD 44 to its ligand hyaluronan. In the first example, phorbol ester treatment of cells results in both increased CD 44 expression and increased hyaluronan binding. By applying the spreadsheet method we effectively demonstrate that this increased ligand binding results from receptor activation. In the second example we have compared AKR 1 cells transfected either with wild type CD 44 (WT CD 44) or a mutant with a truncated cytoplasmic domain (CD 44 -T). These two populations do not have equivalent receptor expression levels but by using the spreadsheet method hyaluronan binding could be compared without the need to generate single cell <b>clones</b> or FACS <b>sorting</b> the cells for matching CD 44 expression. By this method it was demonstrated that hyaluronan binding requires a threshold expression of CD 44 and that this threshold is higher for CD 44 -T. However, at high CD 44 -T expression, binding was equivalent to WT CD 44 indicating that the cytoplasmic domain has a role in presenting the receptor at the cell surface in a form required for efficient hyaluronan binding rather than modulating receptor activity. Conclusion Using the attached spreadsheets and instructions, a simple post-acquisition method for analysing bivariate flow cytometry data is provided. This method constitutes a straightforward improvement over the standard graphical output of flow cytometric data and has the significant advantage that ligand binding can be compared between cell populations irrespective of receptor expression levels. </p...|$|R
