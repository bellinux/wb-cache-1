5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species of}} catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin. It reaches lengths of , with sharks in the Atlantic growing larger than those in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth {{catshark}} {{is one of}} the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle <b>continental</b> <b>slope.</b> It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the {{blackmouth catshark}} include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E
25|$|Submarine {{landslides}} are turbidity {{currents and}} consist of water saturated sediments flowing downslope. An example {{occurred during the}} 1929 Grand Banks earthquake that struck the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland. Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, farther and farther downslope, away from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600km) down the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.|$|E

25|$|Both Figaro {{species are}} endemic to Australian waters, F. boardmani {{in the south}} and F. striatus in the northeast. They are {{deepwater}} species found on or near the sea floor, inhabiting the outer continental shelf and upper <b>continental</b> <b>slope.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blue whiting {{are found}} in the open ocean and above the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> at depths between 100 and 1000 meters. They follow {{vertical}} migrations of the zooplankton they feed on to the bottom during daytime and to the surface at night time.|$|E
25|$|Native {{aluminium}} {{has been}} reported also in cold seeps in the northeastern <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> of the South China Sea and Chen et al. (2011) have proposed a theory of its origin as resulting by reduction from tetrahydroxoaluminate Al(OH)4− to metallic aluminium by bacteria.|$|E
50|$|The Blackfin sorcerer {{is known}} to live in holes on the bottoms of <b>continental</b> <b>slopes.</b> Its natural predators include cod-like fish such as the European Hake, whilst its prey include small {{crustaceans}} and small fish. Its small size and location {{at the bottom of}} <b>continental</b> <b>slopes</b> make it of no danger to humans and is also of no use to fisheries due to the abundance of other eels which are easier to locate and catch.|$|R

40|$|Submarine gullies are small-scale, {{confined}} channels on {{the order}} of tens of metres depth that form {{one of the most common}} morphological features of high-latitude <b>continental</b> <b>slopes.</b> Gully morphology varies in width, incision depth, length, sinuosity, branching order, shelf-incision, cross-sectional shape and gully spacing, with six distinct gully signatures recognized on high-latitude <b>continental</b> <b>slopes</b> (Gales et al. 2013 a, b). Here we analyse the morphology of slope gullies off Halley and Filchner troughs in the southern Weddell Sea (Fig. 1 a–f) ...|$|R
25|$|Barkley Canyon {{extends from}} the {{continental}} shelf edge at 400 m down the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> to the canyon axis at 985 m water depth. Located {{at the leading edge}} of the Cascadia subduction zone, this site supports the study of the accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are just right for exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. Gas hydrates have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within “cages” of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor.|$|E
25|$|During the Palaeozoic era {{at least}} a few {{thousand}} kilometres of ocean floor were subducted, taking of the order of a hundred million years. Sediments were deposited in the ocean floor in the form of fans formed by turbidity currents off the side of a <b>continental</b> <b>slope.</b> The flow was in the northerly direction, indicating that the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> was to the south. These deposits occurred during the Ordovician period. The ocean floor was distant from the continental source of the sediment. Towards the end of this period there were isolated parts where no turbidity currents reached and only fine clay and animal organic and silica debris were deposited into oxygen-depleted deep water. This ocean basin has been called the Monaro Basin. To the north west was a volcanic chain of islands, the Macquarie arc, with an associated submarine trench.|$|E
25|$|Demersal fish live on or {{near the}} bottom of the sea. Demersal fish are found by the {{seafloor}} in coastal areas on the continental shelf, and in the open ocean they are found along the outer continental margin on the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> and the continental rise. They are not generally found at abyssopelagic or hadopelagic depths or on the abyssal plain. They occupy a range of seafloors consisting of mud, sand, gravel or rocks.|$|E

50|$|The oreos are a family, the Oreosomatidae, {{of marine}} fish. Most species {{are found in}} the Southern Hemisphere, inhabiting <b>continental</b> <b>slopes</b> down to about 1000 m deep.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 1,100 mud volcanoes {{have been}} {{identified}} on land and in shallow water. It {{has been estimated that}} well over 10,000 may exist on <b>continental</b> <b>slopes</b> and abyssal plains.|$|R
25|$|The {{geologic}} {{boundaries of}} the coast range formation extend from southwest Washington state in the north to around the Coquille River in the south where the older and taller Klamath Mountains begin. In the east the mountains begin as foothills forming {{the western edge of}} the Willamette Valley and continue west to the coastline and beyond where the basalt formation tapers off into the continental shelf and ends at the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> with several banks and basins off shore.|$|E
25|$|Density {{contrasts}} {{can also}} cause small-scale faulting, even while sedimentation progresses (synchronous-sedimentary faulting). Such faulting can also occur when large masses of non-lithified sediment are deposited on a slope, such as at the front side of a delta or the <b>continental</b> <b>slope.</b> Instabilities in such sediments can result in the deposited material to slump, producing fissures and folding. The resulting structures in the rock are syn-sedimentary folds and faults, which {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from folds and faults formed by tectonic forces acting on lithified rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} {{influenced}} by a major ocean current system. Off the coast, the west wind drift current splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the California current system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large submarine canyon acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> to the deep-sea.|$|E

5000|$|The swollen-headed conger eel, Bassanago bulbiceps, is a conger of {{the family}} Congridae, found on <b>continental</b> <b>slopes</b> around {{southern}} Australia and New Zealand. Its length is between 40 and 60 cm.|$|R
25|$|Demersal fish {{live and}} feed {{on or near}} the bottom of seas or lakes (the {{demersal}} zone). They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found {{on or near the}} continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word demersal comes from the Latin demergere, which means to sink.|$|E
25|$|Benthic fishes {{are likely}} to be found, and are more diverse, on the <b>continental</b> <b>slope,</b> where there is habitat {{diversity}} and often food supplies. About 40% of the ocean floor consists of abyssal plains, but these flat, featureless regions are covered with sediment and largely devoid of benthic life (benthos). Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a dead fish {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from the inside out. Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E

25|$|On the <b>continental</b> <b>slope,</b> {{demersal}} fishes are common. They are more diverse than coastal demersal fish, {{since there is}} more habitat diversity. Further out are the abyssal plains. These flat, featureless regions occupy about 40 percent of the ocean floor. They are covered with sediment but largely devoid of benthic life (benthos). Deep sea benthic fishes {{are more likely to}} associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} greenback stingaree (U. viridis), the sandyback stingaree {{contributes}} substantially to the stingaree bycatch of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) operating off New South Wales; {{it may also}} be caught incidentally by the Oceanic Prawn Trawl Fishery and other fisheries in the area. It faces less fishing pressure in the Bass Strait and off western Tasmania. This ray is edible but not marketed, and may be persecuted by fishery workers as its sting makes it hard to handle. Though specific data is lacking, trawl surveys have shown that stingaree catches from the New South Wales upper <b>continental</b> <b>slope</b> declined over 65% between 197677 and 199677. Given that SESSF activity within its range remains high, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sandyback stingaree as Vulnerable. This species would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the term contourite has varied throughout the decades. Originally, Heezen et al. (1966) defined the concept, without using the actual word, as a sedimentary deposit on the continental rise derived from thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents that flow parallel to bathymetric contours. They did this to emphasize the difference between these deposits and turbidites in order to explain the ubiquitous smoothness and lack of irregularities of the continental rise in the Blake-Bahama Basin. Before this, it was thought that only turbidity flows were capable of depositing and reworking sediment at depths greater than the <b>continental</b> <b>slope.</b> Hollister and Heezen (1972) adopted the name contourite for these deposits and provided a list of characteristics that described their sediments. Faugères and Stow (1993) note that as research on the subject developed, the term contourite was used to describe various forms of sedimentary deposits from bottom-currents including those at much shallower depths and even in lacustrine settings. They suggested going back to the original {{definition of}} a contourite, that is for deposits at depths greater than 500 m derived from stable thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents (i.e. deepwater bottom-currents), in order to avoid using the same name when describing sedimentary deposits formed by different processes. They also suggest the umbrella term bottom-current deposit, which includes contourites and deposits generated by other bottom-currents.|$|E
