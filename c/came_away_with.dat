5|$|Despite much {{speculation}} that Henry {{would lose the}} All Black coaching job to coach Robbie Deans, he was retained on a contract {{for the next two}} years, later extended to include the 2011 World Cup. He immediately stated that he would retain McCaw as his captain. Robbie Deans instead signed with the Australian Rugby Union, becoming head coach of Australia. In Deans' last season (2008) as Crusaders coach they won the Super Rugby title for the seventh time. Ireland and England toured to New Zealand in June 2008 and the All Blacks <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a hard-fought win against Ireland, and two comfortable victories against England. McCaw tore a ligament in his ankle against England and missed the start of the TriNations.|$|E

5|$|Ruing their {{semifinal}} exit in 2004, São Paulo made {{an outstanding}} comeback in 2005 {{to contest the}} final with Atlético Paranaense. This became the first ever Copa Libertadores finals to feature two teams from the same football association; The Tricolor won their third crown after thrashing Atlético Paranaense in the final leg. The 2006 final was also an all-Brazilian affair, with defending champions São Paulo lining up against Internacional. Led by team captain Fernandão, the Colorados beat São Paulo 2–1 at Estádio do Morumbi and held the defending champions at a 2–2 draw at home in Porto Alegre as Internacional won their first ever title. Internacional's arch-rivals, Grêmio, surprised many by reaching the 2007 final with a relatively young squad. However, {{it was not to}} be as Boca Juniors, reinforced by aging but still-capable players, <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the trophy to win their sixth title.|$|E
5|$|The {{road race}} {{stages in the}} Netherlands were both marred by {{repeated}} crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13minutes against {{the remainder of the}} field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22teams, as 17 of them <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.|$|E
5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E

5|$|McLaughlin {{split the}} 1978 season between {{the major leagues}} and minors. McLaughlin made his season debut with Seattle on April 25, against the California Angels. In that game, which also marked his first MLB start, McLaughlin gave up three runs (all earned) and struck out 10 in six innings pitched. He <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the loss, which was his first MLB decision. In late June the Mariners sent {{him down to the}} minor leagues. With the San Jose Missions, who were the Mariners Triple-A {{affiliate}} at the time, he went 5–2 with a 3.50 ERA, and 52 strikeouts in eight games, all starts. Two of those starts were complete games. McLaughlin was called back up to the majors in July after pitcher John Montague was placed on the disabled list. McLaughlin's first major league win came on August 16, against the Baltimore Orioles. In the majors that season, McLaughlin went 4–8 with a 4.37 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 20 games, 17 starts. Four of his starts were complete games. After the 1978 season, McLaughlin pitched in the Mexican Pacific League, where he led all pitchers with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Pressure high up {{the pitch}} from Barcelona kept Manchester United {{in their own}} half, forcing them into {{attempting}} long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments {{in and around the}} centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had put his hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez {{on the edge of the}} Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.|$|E
5|$|John Carver, {{right-hand}} man to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United, arrived as the club's new assistant manager on 17 December 2009, but the club suffered another 1–0 defeat at home, against Coventry City, two days later. Argyle travelled to Cardiff on Boxing Day to play Cardiff City at their new stadium, and <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> an important three points {{thanks to a}} late goal from Sawyer. They recorded their biggest win of the season two days later against Reading. A brace from Judge, and first goals of the season for Kári Árnason and Ashley Barnes secured a 4–1 win at Home Park and six points from their two games over the Christmas period. Argyle returned to league action after their FA Cup ties on 16 January, looking for another three points against Crystal Palace but an early goal from young striker Victor Moses won the game for the visitors. Another must-win home game followed against Derby County and a fifth goal of the season from Jamie Mackie boosted their survival bid. A defeat by fellow struggler's Sheffield Wednesday, coupled with other results going against them, left Argyle five points from safety, with a tough match to come against West Bromwich Albion a week later. A single goal from striker Simon Cox kept Albion in touch {{at the top of}} the table and left Argyle deep in relegation trouble again, six points from safety.|$|E

5|$|Pre-season for Plymouth Argyle {{began on}} 1 July 2009 {{when the first}} team squad {{returned}} to Harpers Park. A week of intense training followed, before the club's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City. In a match which featured trialist Kári Árnason, Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win. A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth {{the next day to}} take on Plymouth Parkway. The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly, including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason. The first team were in action again the next day, against Torquay United. The visitors went behind twice but looked like leaving Plainmoor with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute. The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland, and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009. Argyle <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a 2–0 win after scoring a goal in each half. A picturesque setting greeted the squad as they took to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009. An 81st-minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn't enough to save Argyle from their first defeat of the season.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, and after achieving a first down, Christian Hackenberg threw a 68-yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown, the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had {{allowed in the}} previous eight quarters. Wisconsin failed to respond, going three-and-out, and punting on their subsequent drive. Penn State, though they began with poor field position, converted a few third downs, gained 52 yards on a bubble screen to Allen Robinson, and ultimately {{was faced with a}} fourth down and inches in the red zone, but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit. The field goal was blocked, continuing Penn State's special teams woes, however their defense remained stout, forcing another punt, however on the Lions' ensuing drive, Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day, forcing a punt. In the waning minutes of the first quarter, the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game. At the end of the quarter, they trailed 7–0, but were threatening, and a few minutes later, tied the game via a 4-yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak. Later in the quarter, Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation, and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth. On their next drive, Penn State was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized, and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3-yard pass to Geno Lewis. Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play, and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout, it was not granted, and the play stood. At the half, the score was tied at 14. After Wisconsin's opening drive stalled, the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put Penn State on top 21–14. On the ensuing Wisconsin drive, Penn State freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory. Penn State earned points, with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28-yard field goal to put Penn State up by 10 points. On the next two drives, each team went three-and-out. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal; at the end of the quarter, Penn State led 24–14. On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter, Trevor Williams intercepted Stave's pass, ending a scoring threat, and furthering the Nittany Lions' momentum. Penn State started their drive at their own 28-yard line, and had a third down and short, but a false start backed them up to a third and long; Hackenberg was unfazed, however, as he threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis, putting Penn State up by three possessions, 31–14. Down three scores, Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown, and tried to convert a fourth down and 23, but Penn State recorded a sack, and subsequently got the ball with 9:49 to play. They failed to execute, and about a minute later, punted the ball away. Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10, 31–21, on a Wozniak reception, his second touchdown catch of the day. Penn State got the ball off an onside kick with good field position, and faced a third down and three, but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day, and Penn State had to throw the ball, and the pass was incomplete. Penn State's subsequent punt was blocked. On the ensuing drive, Jack Russell kicked a career long 48-yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points. Penn State started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20-yard line. Penn State got some decent yardage on first down, but committed another false start, backing them up. Zwinak came through for the Lions, however, rushing on third-and-nine for 61 yards, his longest run of the season. From there, Penn State's drive stalled, and with 35 seconds left, Ficken attempted a 31-yard field goal, but missed, and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown, and they did get into Penn State territory, but ultimately, with nine seconds left, Stave threw the ball into the end zone, and Penn State safety Ryan Keiser <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the interception for a touchback. Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game, and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset, winning 31–24.|$|E
