PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} cataract in lens-backscatter metrics {{derived from}} Pentacam Scheimpflug photographs {{and determine the}} most predictive metrics for lens grading and visual performance measures. SETTING: Large tertiary referral hospital in South Australia. DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology. METHODS: In patients attending a cataract clinic between 2005 and 2008, standardized clinical assessments were performed and Scheimpflug photographs taken. Thirteen measures of cataract backscatter were drawn from the images of nuclear and <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract,</b> including new metrics for <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract.</b> The relationships between lens-scatter metrics, visual performance, and lens grades were determined with stepwise multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The study enrolled 342 eyes (177 patients). The Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) nuclear opalescence was best predicted by the average backscatter in the anterior half of the nucleus and the whole nucleus average (r(2) = 0. 59).

40|$|Importance: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms {{have been}} shown to {{influence}} homocysteine levels; homocysteine has been implicated as a cataractogenic stressor. Objective: To investigate the associations of MTHFR polymorphisms and serum homocysteine levels with incident <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> in an older population. Design, Setting, and Participants: From 1992 to 1994, a population-based cohort study, the Blue Mountains Eye Study, was conducted with 3654 residents (82. 4 % of eligible participants) of the Blue Mountains region aged 49 years and older. At the second (1997 - 1999, 5 -year follow-up) and third (2002 - 2004, 10 -year follow-up) surveys, 2334 (75. 8 % of survivors) and 1952 (76. 7 % of survivors) were examined, respectively. For this report, the second survey serves as baseline when homocysteine levels were assessed, and 5 -year incidence of cataract refers to incidence estimated from the second to the third survey. After excluding participants with no follow-up data or DNA or who had previous <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> or cataract surgery, 757 participants were included in gene and environment analyses. This current project on associations with cataract was designed initially March 19, 2013, and completed April 14, 2014. Cataract was assessed using the Wisconsin Cataract Grading system. Two MTHFR polymorphisms, C 677 T (rs 1801133) and A 1298 C (rs 1801131), were included. Serum homocysteine levels were assessed following standard methods. Main Outcomes and Measures: Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals for incident <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract,</b> after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, education, and myopia. Path analysis was performed to explore a possible pathway of MTHFR polymorphisms via homocysteine levels to <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract.</b> Results: The mean (SD) age of the 1726 participants in the Blue Mountains Eye Study 2 cohort with normal homocysteine levels was 68. 3 (8. 1) years and 73. 2 (8. 5) years for those with elevated homocysteine levels. Both the C 677 T polymorphism (CT/TT vs CC: OR[*]=[*] 1. 50; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 01 - 2. 23) and elevated homocysteine levels (> 15 µmol/L: OR[*]=[*] 2. 24; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 38 - 3. 63) were independently associated with increased risk of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract.</b> Path analysis showed that the genetic effect on <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> was partially mediated via homocysteine levels. Combined CT/TT genotypes and elevated homocysteine levels were associated with a 3 -fold risk of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> (OR[*]=[*] 3. 74; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 79 - 7. 80). The synergy index of both exposures was 1. 34 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 44 - 4. 01). Conclusions and Relevance: MTHFR polymorphism and elevated homocysteine levels contributed separately and jointly to increased risk of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract.</b> If these findings are confirmed, homocysteine levels may be a therapeutic target to reduce risk of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> in persons carrying genetic risk...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} {{the effect of}} main morphological types and grades of age-related cataracts on refractive error. MethodsWe measured 276 subjects with optical compensation prior to the development of cataract. We evaluated 224 eyes with nuclear cataract, 125 with <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract,</b> and 103 with posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract classified with LOCSIII. We measured visual acuity (VA) with their spectacles and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with chart in decimal scale to obtain the optimal compensation with cataract. We evaluated the differences between compensations. ResultsA significant myopic shift was observed in nuclear cataract from low to mild grade (p= 0. 031), the same as for PSC cataract from mild to advanced grade (p= 0. 025). No significant changes were found for <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> (p= 0. 462). Regarding astigmatism, we observed power changes in <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> from low to mild grade (p= 0. 03) and axis changes in PSC from low to mild grade (p= 0. 02) and in nuclear cataract from mild to advanced grade (p= 0. 02).

40|$|To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between outdoor activity and risk of age-related cataract (ARC) in a rural population of Taizhou Eye Study (phrase 1 report). A population-based, cross-sectional study of 2006 eligible rural adults (≥ 45 years old) from Taizhou Eye Study was conducted from Jul. to Sep. 2012. Participants underwent detailed ophthalmologic examinations including uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp and fundus examinations as well as questionnaires about previous outdoor activity and sunlight protection methods. ARC was recorded by LOCSⅢ classification system. The prevalence of cortical, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract were assessed separately for the risk factors and its association with outdoor activity. Of all 2006 eligible participants, 883 (44. 0 %) adults were diagnosed with ARC. The prevalence rates of cortical, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract per person were 41. 4 %, 30. 4 % and 1. 5 %, respectively. Women had a higher tendency of nuclear and <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> than men (OR = 1. 559, 95 % CI 1. 204 - 2. 019 and OR = 1. 862, 95 % CI 1. 456 - 2. 380, respectively). Adults with high myopia had a higher prevalence of nuclear cataract than adults without that (OR = 2. 528, 95 % CI 1. 055 - 6. 062). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that age was risk factor of nuclear (OR = 1. 190, 95 % CI 1. 167 - 1. 213) and cortical (OR = 1. 203, 95 % CI 1. 181 - 1. 226) cataract; eyes with fundus diseases was risk factor of posterior subcapsular cataract (OR = 6. 529, 95 % CI 2. 512 - 16. 970). Outdoor activity was an independent risk factor of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> (OR = 1. 043, 95 % CI 1. 004 - 1. 083).

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{directed}} to assess the DNA damage and DNA repair response to X-ray inflicted lens oxidative damage and to investigate the subsequent changes in lens epithelial cell (LEC) behavior in vivo that led to long delayed but then rapidly developing cataracts. Methods: Two-month-old C 57 Bl/ 6 female mice received 11 Grays (Gy) of soft x-irradiation to the head only. The animals’ eyes were examined for cataract status in 30 day intervals by slit lamp over an 11 month period post-irradiation. LEC migration, DNA fragment, free DNA retention, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) presence were established in the living lenses with fluorescent dyes using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The extent and removal of initial LEC DNA damage were determined by comet assay.

METHODS. Individuals who had right eyes with an area of cortical opacity less than 20 % of the pupil when dilated 7 mm or more were selected as subjects. This included 197 subjects from the Reykjavík Eye Study, 231 from the Vitamin E, Cataract, and Age-Related Maculopathy (VECAT) study in Melbourne, and 92 from the Singapore-Japan Cooperative Cataract Study, all showing early-stage cataract in pupils dilated to 7 mm or more. Scheimpflug and retroilluminated photographs were used to locate opacities. Localization of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> was determined by dividing the retroillumination image into seven concentric circles with diameters of 1 through 7 mm, and eight sections of 45 degrees radial octants.

40|$|Age-related {{cataract}} is a {{major cause}} of blindness worldwide, and <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> is the second most prevalent type of age-related cataract. Although a significant fraction of age-related cataract is heritable, the genetic basis remains to be elucidated. We report that homozygous deletion of Epha 2 in two independent strains of mice developed progressive <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract.</b> Retroillumination revealed development of cortical vacuoles at one month of age; visible cataract appeared around three months, which progressed to mature cataract by six months. EPHA 2 protein expression in the lens is spatially and temporally regulated. It is low in anterior epithelial cells, upregulated as the cells enter differentiation at the equator, strongly expressed in the cortical fiber cells, but absent in the nuclei. Deletion of Epha 2 caused {{a significant increase in the}} expression of HSP 25 (murine homologue of human HSP 27) before the onset of cataract.

Results: Seven prospective cohort studies involving a total of 119, 706 participants were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that there is no substantial overall increased risk of ARC due to heavy alcohol consumption. The estimated RRs comparing heavy drinkers versus non-drinkers were 1. 25 (95 % CI: 1. 00, 1. 56) for cataract sugery, 1. 06 (95 % CI: 0. 63, 1. 81) for <b>cortical</b> <b>cataracts,</b> 1. 26 (95 % CI: 0. 93, 1. 73) for nuclear cataracts, and 0. 91 (95 % CI: 0. 32, 2. 61) for posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs), respectively. No significant associations between moderate alcohol consumption and cataracts were observed. The pooled RRs comparing moderate drinkers versus non-drinkers were 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 64, 1. 26) for cataract surgery, 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 75, 1. 25) for <b>cortical</b> <b>cataracts,</b> 0. 91 (95 % CI: 0. 76, 1. 08) for nuclear cataracts, and 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 49, 1. 91) for PSCs, respectively.

Methods: Glutathione S-transferase M 1 (GSTM 1) and glutathione S-transferase T 1 (GSTT 1) gene polymorphisms were genotyped in 422 Han Chinese patients with age-related <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract,</b> and in 312 age, sex, and ethnically matched healthy controls, using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: The results showed that the GSTM 1 positive genotype had an increased risk of developing cortical ARC (p= 0. 0002, odds ratio [OR] 1. 74, 95 % CI 1. 30 to 2. 34). There was a statistically significant association between the GSTM 1 positive genotype and the risk of cataract development in both female and male groups (p= 0. 026, OR 1. 58, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 36; p= 0. 002, OR 1. 97, 95 % CI 1. 27 to 3. 04, respectively). A combination of GSTM 1 positive and GSTT 1 null genotypes was associated with the risk of developing age-related <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> (p= 0. 002, OR 2. 19, 95 % CI 1. 33 to 3. 60). The results revealed that the GSTM 1 positive genotype was significantly higher in the smoker patients group as compared to the non-smoker patients group (p= 0. 016, OR 1. 62, 95 % CI 1. 09 to 2. 39). Logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking may be a risk factor for the development of ARC (r= 0. 120, p= 0. 013). Conclusions: Our study suggests that the GSTM 1 positive genotype and a combination of GSTM 1 positive and GSTT 1 null genotypes may be associated with a susceptibility to age-related <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> in the Han Chinese population.

40|$|Purpose. : We used sheep with an {{autosomal}} dominant gene for <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> as an animal model to evaluate novel macrocyclic calpain inhibitors with {{potential for the}} medical treatment of human cataract. Methods. : The macrocyclic aldehyde, CAT 811, identified previously as a calpain inhibitor that prevents calcium-induced opacification in cultured sheep lenses, was tested {{for its ability to}} protect cytoskeletal proteins from calpain proteolysis. CAT 811 and its alcohol analogue, CAT 505, were formulated separately into ointments, and each was applied twice daily to the right eye of sheep with early cataracts for five months. Progress of cataracts in the sheep was determined by ophthalmologic examination and comparison with a matched sample of sheep treated similarly with ointment that did not contain the active ingredient. Results. : The novel macrocyclic aldehyde, CAT 811, was able to inhibit calpain proteolysis of lens cytoskeletal proteins at micromolar concentrations. When applied topically to the eyes of sheep, CAT 811 was able to slow cataract development by 27 % in the initial three months of treatment (P < 0. 05). Its alcohol analogue, CAT 505, was not able to slow cataractogenesis significantly. Conclusions. : The inherited sheep cataract provides a reproducible model of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> over a time scale of several months. The data reported here, using this model, demonstrated the potential of the macrocyclic calpain inhibitor, CAT 811, to act as a therapeutic for treatment of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract...</b>|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a convenient, {{clinically}} applicable test of glare disability which can be used in the preoperative evaluation of patients with cataract. In this study, contrast sensitivity (using the Pelli-Robson letter chart), near vision, and visual acuity were compared, with and without the introduction of a glare source in 70 patients with cataract, 15 with intraocular lenses, and 19 controls. A disposable pen torch was shone at the pupillary margin to induce glare. Contrast sensitivity demonstrated the most marked reduction during glare testing. <b>Cortical</b> <b>cataracts</b> were most affected followed by posterior subcapsular opacities. The glare disability was significantly less in pseudophakic patients and was absent from patients with non-cataractous phakic eyes.

Data on the dose-response relation between ocular exposure to ultraviolet B radiation and <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> {{were derived from}} a population-based study (the Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project, Salisbury, Maryland) in which extensive data on cataract and ultraviolet radiation were collected in persons aged 65 – 84 years. Exposure estimates for the US population were derived using estimated ultraviolet radiation fluxes {{as a function of}} wavelength. US Census data were used to obtain the age, ethnicity, and sex distribution of the population. Predicted probabilities of cataract were derived from the age-, sex-, and ethnicity-specific ocular ultraviolet exposure data and were modeled under conditions of 5 – 20 % ozone depletion. The analysis indicated that by 2050, the prevalence of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> will increase above expected levels by 1. 3 – 6. 9 %. The authors estimate that with 5 – 20 % ozone depletion, there will be 167, 000 – 830, 000 additional cases of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> by 2050. Because of the high prevalence of cataract in older persons, at a 2003 cost of $ 3, 370 per cataract operation, this increase could represent an excess cost of $ 563 million to $ 2. 8 billion. cataract; ozone; radiation; ultraviolet rays Abbreviations: SEE, Salisbury Eye Evaluation; UVB, ultraviolet B.

40|$|PURPOSE: This thesis {{explores the}} idea that light energy, {{especially}} ultraviolet light, contributes to the unequal distribution of cataract {{around the world and}} to the development of cortical opacities. METHODS: In the first section, the thesis reviews historical concepts of the function of the lens and the nature of cataract, epidemiologic data on the global distribution of cataract, and clinical observations of the predominant location of cortical opacification. Second, computer ray tracings and geometric optics demonstrate the passage of light of varying angle of incidence within the lens. Third, two models of the human eye are used to study the refraction of light by the cornea and lens and illustrate the concentration of energy at the equatorial plane of the lens. RESULTS: Cataract prevalence increases with proximity to the earth's equator, and <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> is most common in the inferior and inferonasal lens. Theoretical studies and the eye models both demonstrate that the concentration of light within the lens increases with angle of incidence, and the eye models suggest that the inferior and inferonasal lens receives significantly more energy than other sections of the lens. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cataract and exposure to ultraviolet energy both increase with decreasing latitude. The most common location of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> in the inferonasal lens is consistent with the greater dose of light energy received by this portion of the lens. These studies suggest that the global distribution of cataract and the development of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataract</b> are at least in part dependent on the dose of ultraviolet light received by the lens...|$|E

40|$|A {{decline in}} ocular lens {{transparency}} known as cataract afflicts 90 % of individuals {{by the age}} 70. Chronic deterioration of lens tissue occurs as a pathophysiological consequence of defective water and nutrient circulation through channel and transporter proteins. A key component is the aquaporin- 0 (AQP 0) water channel whose permeability is tightly regulated in healthy lenses. Using a variety of cellular and biochemical approaches we have discovered that products of the A-kinase anchoring protein 2 gene (AKAP 2 /AKAP-KL) form a stable complex with AQP 0 to sequester protein kinase A (PKA) with the channel. This permits PKA phosphorylation of serine 235 within a calmodulin (CaM) -binding domain of AQP 0. The additional negative charge introduced by phosphoserine 235 perturbs electrostatic interactions between AQP 0 and CaM to favour water influx through the channel. In isolated mouse lenses, displacement of PKA from the AKAP 2 –AQP 0 channel complex promotes <b>cortical</b> <b>cataracts</b> as characterized by severe opacities and cellular damage. Thus, anchored PKA modulation of AQP 0 is a homeostatic mechanism that must be physically intact to preserve lens transparency...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} cataract type and severity in eyes with pure types of age-related lens opacities on visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity in the presence and absence of glare conditions. Methods: Sixty patients with senile cataracts aged 40 years or older with no other ocular pathologies were evaluated for VA and contrast sensitivity with and without glare. Lens opacities were classified according to the Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS) III. VA was measured using the Snellen chart. Contrast sensitivity was measured with the Vector Vision CSV- 1000 E chart in the presence and absence of glare by calculating the area under log contrast sensitivity (log CS) function (AULCSF). Results: Cataracts were posterior subcapsular in 26 eyes, cortical in 19 eyes and nuclear in 15 eyes. VA significantly decreased with increasing cataract severity and there was significant loss of contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequencies with increasing cataract severity. AULCSF significantly decreased with increasing cataract severity in the presence and absence of glare conditions.

40|$|Our studies {{focus on}} the cell and {{molecular}} basis of lens transparency. Loss of transparency (cataract) {{is the most common}} cause of blindness in the world. A particularly interesting feature of lens development is the programmed elimination of cytoplasmic organelles from cells in the light path. We are investigating the events that trigger organelle loss and aim to determine the molecular identity of the proteases and nucleases that facilitate removal of organelles. The lens grows throughout life prompting many investigators to speculate that the tissue contains a contingent of stem cells. We are using in vivo lineage tracking strategies to investigate this hypothesis and model the growth of the lens. Preliminary data suggest a link between clonal growth of lens cells and the development in later life of <b>cortical</b> <b>cataracts.</b> Fiber cells, the terminally differentiated cells that account for most of the volume of the lens, persist throughout life.
