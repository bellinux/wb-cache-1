50|$|Laminated {{magnetic}} cores {{are made}} of stacks of thin iron sheets coated with an insulating layer, lying {{as much as possible}} parallel with the lines of flux. The layers of insulation serve as a barrier to eddy currents, so eddy currents can only flow in narrow loops within the thickness of each single lamination. Since the current in an eddy current loop is proportional to the area of the loop, this prevents most of the current from flowing, reducing eddy currents to a very small level. Since power dissipated is proportional to the square of the <b>current,</b> <b>breaking</b> a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically. From this, {{it can be seen that}} the thinner the laminations, the lower the eddy current losses.|$|E

For dead-tank breaker, the tests for the insulating properties of phase-to-enclosure are recommended as a non-mandatory testing item. However, IEC MT 36 has proposed the change of standard to specify as a mandatory in its next version planned in 2016. The peak of recovery voltages, occurring just after interrupting the some type of capacitive currents, arrives at different values on supply and load sides.

In this paper, multibody dynamic model of a circuit breaker including switch mechanism was developed including the electromagnetic actuator system. Since the opening mechanism operates sequentially, optimization of the switch mechanism was carried out to improve the <b>current</b> <b>breaking</b> time. In the optimization process, design parameters were selected from length and shape of each latch, which changes pivot points of bearings to shorten the breaking time. To validate optimization results, computational results were compared to physical tests with a high speed camera.

MVDC circuit breakers are a critical technology to directly manage faults in multi-terminal DC (MTDC) networks. However, DC <b>current</b> <b>breaking</b> is much more challenging than in AC systems {{because there is no}} natural zero-crossing of the current waveform to aid fault isolation. This paper reviews existing MVDC circuit breaker technologies and also discusses their advantages and disadvantages.

The paper illustrates that a hybrid DC circuit breaker with aided commutation can clear a fault within 2 - 5 msecs with low losses, this shows great potential for future MVDC applications.
