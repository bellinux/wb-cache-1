5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a <b>clinch</b> early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief flurry of punches and landing a knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw a flurry of punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai <b>Clinch</b> before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle. Jackson scrambled out of the <b>clinch</b> and scored a takedown {{with a combination of}} a leg trip and a headlock. Jackson attacked with ground and pound, but to limited damage, while Silva attempted submissions unsuccessfully. The referee then stood the fighters up due to inactivity.|$|E

5|$|The firm {{expanded}} {{throughout the}} 1880s {{by creating an}} agency network, establishing sixteen offices in nearby settlements, and offering free trade discounts on their beer of 20 percent or higher. By 1889, the brewery was producing 150,000 barrels annually. In 1889, the company's first scientifically-trained head brewer was appointed, Percy <b>Clinch,</b> son of Charles <b>Clinch</b> of the Eagle Brewery in Witney. In 1892, the partnership became a limited company called John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited, with Henry Herbert Riley-Smith as chairman.

40|$|Abstract. Adopting {{experimental}} method to examine <b>clinching</b> {{is able to}} apply to the joining of similar and dissimilar titanium alloy in this study. Also, to use tensile-shear test to figure out mechanical properties of <b>clinched</b> joints to TA 1 -TA 1 <b>clinched</b> joints and Al 5052 - TA 1 <b>clinched</b> joints. The results show that average load of TA 1 - Al 5052 <b>clinched</b> joints is largely lower than the average load of TA 1 -TA 1 <b>clinched</b> joints. Average load of TA 1 -TA 1 is around 4427. 58, equal to 3. 85 times to Al 5052 -TA 1. The two types of fractured joints are all neck shear fracture of the upper sheets. Therefore, the strength of joints is dependant to the material of the upper sheet. The formability of TA 1 -TA 1 <b>clinched</b> joints are superior to Al 5052 -TA 1, and average displacement of TA 1 -TA 1 <b>clinched</b> joints is about 1. 23 times to Al 5052 -TA 1 <b>clinched</b> joints...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Clinching</b> is a {{high-speed}} mechanical fastening technique for point joining of sheet material. In order {{to investigate the}} influence of material property on the mechanical property and failure mode of <b>clinched</b> joints, three types of <b>clinched</b> joints in aluminum alloy sheet were tested under tension-shear loading with MTS landmark, separately. Results showed that {{the property of the}} substrate had effective on the performance of <b>clinched</b> joints. <b>Clinched</b> joints had higher strength and good energy absorption capacity when the strength of the substrate was higher. The strength and energy absorption capacity of the <b>clinched</b> joints were evaluated via load-displacement curves. While the failure modes of <b>clinched</b> joints were all the same: neck facture failure...|$|R
