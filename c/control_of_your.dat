40|$|Change. These are {{discussed}} in the following paragraphs. By letter dated April 21, 1980 you proposed changes to the Technical Specifi cations to allow Niagara Mohawk to conduct future refuelings without prior NRC approval. The changes enclosed allow such licensee action in consonance with the conditions delineated in 10 CFR 50. 59. Please note that you are required to maintain the appropriate documentation on site in accordance with Technical Specification Section 6. 10. Several modifications to your original refueling submittal were made. The more salient of these include an allowance for exposure dependent minimum critical power ratio (MCPR) and a maximum average planar heat generation rate (MAPLHGR) reduction for fuel exposures above 30, 000 MWD/STU. Members <b>of</b> <b>your</b> staff have agreed to these changes. In 1974, the NRC requested that all power reactor licensees submit standard administrative <b>controls.</b> One <b>of</b> the requirements called for the direct supervision of core alterations by a licensed Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) who had no concurrent duties. By letter dated July 6, 1980, you were requested to provide Technical Specifications to adopt the required wording. As agreed to by members <b>of</b> <b>your</b> staff the changes to Section 6. 0, Adminis trative <b>Controls,</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Technical Specifications reflect this NRC requirement. ...|$|R

[...] This met with swift criticism from various sources, accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of lacking the expertise to recommend weight loss products. Facing a Federal Trade Commission investigation into Shape Up's claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products declared an intent to file a class action lawsuit against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not stimulate weight loss.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} computer simulation games by game creator Sid Meier, Railroad Tycoon (1990), was critically hailed as [...] "one of the best computer games of the year". The game {{is set in the}} era of early and mid-term rail usage and development, with four geographic segments: Western United States, Northeast United States, Great Britain, or Continental Europe. The player constructs different types of stations, lays out railways (paying attention to grades and the capabilities of the available locomotives, which improve steadily as the game progresses) and scheduling and distributing trains between different resources (mail, passengers, coal, etc.) and sinks for the same resources. Also in effect are some elements of the stock market, leading to you acquiring other railways and competing with noted historical figures (Vanderbilt, Brunel, etc.) for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own railway. The game also encourages the user to become familiar with the type, carrying capacity and wheel layout of different classic locomotives.|$|E

At least that used to be true, until the mind-reading wizards arrived. Now something resembling telepathy is becoming a reliable reality. Being poker-faced will not help you any more.

40|$|My primary aim is {{to defend}} a nonreductive {{solution}} to the problem of action. I argue that when you are performing an overt bodily action, you are playing an irreducible causal role in bringing about, sustaining, and <b>controlling</b> the movements <b>of</b> <b>your</b> body, a causal role best understood as an instance of agent causation. Thus, the solution that I defend employs a notion of agent causation, though emphatically not in defence of an account of free will, as most theories of agent causation are. Rather, I argue that the notion of agent causation introduced here best explains how it is that you are making your body move during an action, thereby providing a satisfactory {{solution to the problem}} of action...|$|R
