40|$|The 16 ” Dunbar Pipeline, {{operated}} by TOTAL E&P UK PLC, transports raw multi-phase fluids 22 km from the Dunbar platform to the North Alwyn Bravo platform in the North Sea. The pipeline was commissioned in 1994 and a metal loss inspection with an intelligent pig was successfully completed in 1997. Video inspections {{of the pipeline}} conducted in recent years indicated a significant deposition of scale in the topside and riser pipework at the Dunbar platform. Initial attempts to assess {{the extent of the}} scale build-up in the risers and pipeline were only partially successful, and by the summer of 2003 the deposition was estimated to have restricted the remaining internal diameter {{at the top of the}} riser to less than 10 ”. By late 2003 TOTAL required that a further metal loss inspection be conducted in 2004. To enable an intelligent pig inspection of the pipeline, it was necessary that it be cleaned of scale. To enable the formulation of a cleaning methodology that minimised the risk of blocking the pipeline during cleaning, it was critical that further details be established as to the quantity and distribution of the scale within the pipeline. Following a review of available inspection techniques, TOTAL contracted Weatherford’s Pipeline & Specialty Services (P&SS) to develop a multi-diameter, multi-channel <b>caliper</b> <b>pig</b> for the Dunbar pipeline. Weatherford P&SS provide pipeline inspection services to the international oil and gas industry with their SAAM ® smart utility pig and range of caliper tools. This paper, jointly presented by Weatherford and TOTAL, describes the development work undertaken, as well as summarising the results of the inspection runs carried out with both SAAM and the <b>caliper</b> <b>pig</b> during 2004. 2...|$|E
40|$|Pipe in-line {{inspection}} by "intelligent" pigs {{is a fundamental}} {{oil and gas industry}} practice but still considered as an exceptional operation. In fact, the instrumented pigs used for such purpose are expensive and delicate tools with non-negligible risks of sticking inside the pipeline, thus making their deployment rather rare. In Part A of this paper we presented a novel smart foam pig, with sensing capabilities analogous to those of a multi-channel <b>caliper</b> <b>pig,</b> but characterized by very low operating risks due to its high capability to negotiate restrictions and its very low likelihood of creating obstructions, hence encouraging more frequent pipeline inspection campaigns. The present Part B discusses the results of the pig field tests. The processing and visualization for interpretation of acquired raw data are carried out through a dedicated software. A comprehensive analysis of the data acquired on two test campaigns on an 8 km pipeline in Italy is reported and the comparison with information gathered adopting a commercial In-line Inspection (ILI) pig is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Pipeline pigging for in-line {{inspection}} {{is a fundamental}} practice in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Yet, the so-called "smart pigs" used for this purpose are expensive and delicate and the risk related to their possible blocking inside the pipeline is non-negligible, hence their deployment is rather infrequent (generally, just once in several years). In this paper, we present a new, low-cost and low-risk foam pig with inspection capabilities similar to those of a multi-channel <b>caliper</b> <b>pig</b> (i. e. able to detect, locate and size inner diameter changes and deformations) together with additional features that allow to detect internal roughness changes (e. g. due to corrosion) and perform some pH/salinity determinations, also useful for corrosion assessment purposes. One implementation of the new tool makes use of a foam pig "carrier", providing the required push with a good capability to surpass restrictions, equipped with specialized sensors and modules for data acquisition and storage. Another implementation, called "skeleton caliper pig" and suitable to prevent the massive displacement of condensates from gas lines, deploys the light plastic system without any foam pig carrier, pushed by the gas velocity alone. In the paper we will discuss the design, construction and field testing of this new low-risk inspection pig...|$|E

5000|$|The {{technology}} used varies by the service required {{and the design}} of the pig, each pigging service provider may have unique and proprietary technologies to accomplish the service. Surface pitting and corrosion, as well as cracks and weld defects in steel/ferrous pipelines are often detected using magnetic flux leakage (MFL) pigs. Other [...] "smart" [...] pigs use electromagnetic acoustic transducers to detect pipe defects. <b>Caliper</b> <b>pigs</b> can measure the roundness of the pipeline to determine areas of crushing or other deformations. Some smart pigs use a combination of technologies, such as providing MFL and caliper functions in a single tool. Trials of pigs using acoustic resonance technology have been reported.|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} no in-line inspection technology for quantitative evaluation of gouged dents other than geometry (<b>caliper)</b> <b>pigs.</b> Southwest Research Institute (SwRI ®), under {{sponsorship of the}} U. S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is evaluating the nonlinear harmonic method to provide severity ranking for gouged dents; even dents that have been re-rounded by internal pressure. This paper describes experiments with four pressure chambers made from 12 -inch line pipe. Internal scanner hardware, driven from the outside under computer control, deploys nonlinear harmonics probes against the pipe inner surface. Data collected represents residual strain patterns on the pipe surface and can be analyzed to indicate the length, width, and depth of the outside gouge. The chambers, each containing several mechanical damage defects, are being cyclically loaded until all defects fail. BACKGROUND The statistics of pipeline incidents are well known, {{including the fact that}} mechanical damage is a major cause of reported incidents. This significance of the outside force cause of incidents has prompted funding agencies to make investment in R&D for detection and characterization of that type of defect. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that detection of outside force defects by in-line means will not prevent the 70 to 80 percent of such defects that fail immediately upon their initiation. So the target for in-line detection of outside force defects is the 10 percent or so of delayed failures. Even though this target is a small fraction of the total pipeline incidents, it can nevertheless hav...|$|R
