Enzymes are efficient biological catalysts and can operate under mild conditions of pH and temperature. The fact that enzymes are biodegradable makes them environmentally acceptable. Oxidoreductases such as peroxidases (Husain et al. 2010; Karim et al. 2012) and laccases (Chivukula and Renganathan 1995; Vijaykumar et al. 2006) are of special importance in wastewater treatment.

30|$|Proteolytic enzymes such as proteases are {{required}} for removal of proteins during chitin extraction from seafood waste. Plants, animals and microbes are the main sources of proteolytic enzymes. Various proteases like papain, trypsin, pepsin, devolvase, alcalase and pancreatin may be employed to remove proteins from shells and minimize the depolymerization and deacetylation during isolation of chitin. Accessibility for the enzymes can be modified by performing the deproteination either before or after demineralization step. In deproteination step, both crude and purified extracted enzymes can be used. However, purified enzymes are expensive in comparison to <b>crude</b> <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> are mostly obtained from fish viscera and bacteria. Among these, bacterial proteases are more common.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to two value-added products, microbial biomass protein (MBP) and ethanol, was studied. Bagasse (BAG) was hydrolyzed by Phanarochaete chtysosporium. Excess sugars were utilized by a diazotrophic bacteria, Azotobacter vinelandii resulting in 15 % crude protein (CP, dry substrate basis) for AFEX-treated BAG, a 300 % increase over untreated, Pchrysosporium inoculated, BAG (5 % CP). AFEX-treated BAG was also hydrolyzed by commercial enzymes followed by A. vine/andii fermentation resulting in 20 % CP (dry substrate basis), a 2000 % increase over untreated BAG (1 % CP). Fermentations with high solids ratios and no agitation provided the most economically attractive MBP production method. Essential amino acid profiles of the final products satisfied FAO/WHO requirements except for lysine. Ethanol fermentations were conducted with (AFEX-treated and untreated) switchgrass (SWG), coastal bermudagrass (CBG), and BAG. Hydrolysis was conducted with commercial <b>enzymes,</b> and a <b>crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> lysate from cultures of three microorganisms. A genetically-engineered Klebsiella oxytoca fermented sugars to ethanol. Glucose was rapidly fermented to ethanol. Xylose utilization was slower and incomplete with greater inefficiencies at higher sugar concentrations. For commercial enzymes hydrolysis and Koxytoca fermentation, based on experimental yields, about 220 L ethanol could be produced per ton AFEX treated SWG, versus 90 L ethanol per ton untreated SWG. Protein extraction did not hinder ethanol fermentation. About 250 L, 205 L, and 1 08 L ethanol could be produced per ton protein-extracted (AFEX) CBG, non-extracted (AFEX) CBG and untreated CBG respectively. Ethanol yields from BAG corresponded to production of 222 L ethanol per ton BAG. With <b>crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> hydrolysis and Koxytoca fermentation, experimental yields could lead to ethanol production of 240 L, 207 L and 153 L per ton of SWG, CBG and BAG respectively. <b>Crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> activity was 11. 4 IU/ml corresponding to an enzyme loading of 11. 4 IU/g substrate compared to 5 IU/g substrate for commercial <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> compared favorably with commercial enzymes in terms of reducing sugars and ethanol yields.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{extract from}} a fungus, Gliomastix murorum, {{could be used}} in the {{synthesis}} of oligosaccharides that are essential to the food and drug industries. This extract may contaminate such products and lead to serious health problems. An investigation on the possible toxicity and mutagenic effect of the extract from this fungal isolate was carried out in Swiss Albino mice. One hundred and 50 % of the <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> extract were injected intraperitoneally into the mice every 2 days for 30 days. Normal saline (0. 9 %), cultivation medium, and cyclophosphamide (80 mg/kg body weight) were given to the control groups. The results indicated that the white blood cell count, serum creatinine, and uric acid of the treated mice were significantly higher than those of the controls (p< 0. 05), whereas the serum urea-N was lower. For the micronucleus test, mice treated with the extract, especially the group received 100 % <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> extract, showed a higher number of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes, as compared to controls. Nevertheless, the micronucleus values were not as high as those found in mice treated with cyclophosphamide, the mutagenic agent. It can be concluded from the results that <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> extract had minor toxic effects on various organ systems tested; more extensive investigation on the safe use of this extract is therefore necessary. 1990). Mutagenic testing by the micronucleus method was also conducted...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the enzyme transformation of PBDEs and to track the key enzymes involved in PBDE degradation in plants, in vivo exposure of plants of ryegrass, pumpkin and maize and in vitro exposure of their root <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> extracts to PBDEs were conducted. Degradation of PBDEs in the root <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> solutions fit well with the first order kinetics (R- 2 = 0. 52 - 0. 97, P < 0. 05), and higher PBDEs degraded faster than the lower ones. PBDEs could be transformed to lower brominated PBDEs and hydroxylated-PBDEs by the root <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> extracts with debromination as the main pathway which contributed over 90 % of PBDE depletion. In vitro and in vivo exposure to PBDEs produced similar responses in root enzyme activities of which the nitroreductase (NaR) and glutathione-transferase (GST) activities decreased significantly, while the peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P- 450 activities had no significant changes. Furthermore, higher enzyme concentrations of NaR and GST led to higher PBDE debromination rates, and the time-dependent activities of NaR and GST in the root <b>crude</b> <b>enzyme</b> extracts were similar to the trends of PBDE depletion. All {{these results suggest that}} NaR and GST were the key enzymes responsible for PBDE degradation. This conclusion was further confirmed by the in vitro debromination of PBDEs with the commercial pure NaR and GST. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|For the {{reaction}} system involving the <b>crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> of CR 2 and GDH, the desired product (S)-DHTP with optical purity over 99.9 % e.e. and yield of 90.43 % {{was obtained from}} 10  g L− 1 DKTP at 30  °C and pH 8.0, {{in the presence of}} 120  g L− 1 glucose. When the substrate concentration was increased up to 20  g L− 1, however, the yield of (S)-DHTP decreased significantly to 47.25 %, which would be probably attributed to cofactor deficiency, besides the nature of substrate inhibition towards the functional enzyme.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{reported}} that oil pam trunk (OPT) {{can be used}} as an alternative fermentation feedstock for lignocellulolytic enzyme production and carbon source for bioethanol production. Xylanase production from OPT by locally isolated fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus SK 1, under solid-state fermentation (SSF), was optimized using central composite design (CCD). Under optimized conditions, a maximum xylanase activity of 1792. 43 U/g was produced, which was 4. 28 -fold higher than before optimization. Significant amounts of CMCase (56. 19 U/g), FPase (3. 47 U/g), and ß-glucosidase (1. 55 U/g) were also found concomitantly with xylanase. Subsequently, the effect of solid loading, Tween- 80 concentration, and incubation temperature on the saccharification of OPT by the <b>crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> were optimized to enhance the total reducing sugar production. A total of 13. 148 g/L of reducing sugar was reported under optimized conditions. Comparisons of physiochemical characteristics between native and hydrolyzed OPT via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed strong degradation capacity of the <b>crude</b> <b>enzymes</b> toward cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Alcoholic fermentation of the hydrolysate by Candida tropicalis RETL-Crl produced 3. 067 g/L of ethanol. Higher ethanol production at 0. 322 g/g with a theoretical ethanol yield of 68. 05 % indicates that Candida tropicalis RETL-Crl has a greater potential to be used in ethanol fermentation process.
