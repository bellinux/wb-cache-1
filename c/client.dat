Folding@home was launched on October1, 2000, {{and was the}} first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first <b>client</b> was a screensaver, which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with David P. Anderson to test a supplemental <b>client</b> on the open-source BOINC framework. This <b>client</b> was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.|$|E

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs a <b>client</b> {{program on}} their personal computer. The user interacts with the <b>client,</b> which manages the other software components in the background. Through the <b>client,</b> the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via <b>client</b> settings. The <b>client</b> connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E

Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the <b>client,</b> only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the <b>client,</b> he calls Robert and offers him the <b>client</b> if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy. This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured. This piques David's interest, who allows Andy to come into his home and talk to him about his business proposal.|$|E

They dispose of the body, then meet the <b>client</b> and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the <b>client</b> to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the <b>client</b> is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the <b>client</b> but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E

40|$|On a {{snapshot}} day in 2010 there were 46, 078 <b>clients</b> who received pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence, of which almost two in three were male. This report presents {{data from the}} 2010 National Opioid Pharmacotherapy Statistics Annual Data (NOPSAD) collection, which includes information at both the national level and state and territory level. Specifically, it highlights the pharmacotherapy type (or prescribed drug type) that <b>clients</b> in Australia took to help manage opioid dependence. Characteristics of the <b>clients,</b> prescribers and dosing point sites where the pharmacotherapy drugs are dispensed are also presented. The data {{are based on a}} ‘snapshot’ period—usually a day—in June 2010. Increased use of pharmacotherapy by opioid dependent <b>clients</b> On {{a snapshot}} day in 2010 there were 46, 078 <b>clients</b> who received pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence, of which almost two in three were male. This was an overall increase of just over 2, 600 <b>clients</b> since 2009. Between 2006 and 2010 the mean age group of <b>clients</b> receiving pharmacotherapy has increased. The proportion of <b>clients</b> aged 29 years and younger decreased from about one in four <b>clients</b> in 2006 to about one in six in 2010. In the same timeframe, the proportion of <b>clients</b> aged 30 years and over increased from just over seven in 10 <b>clients</b> in 2006 to just over eight in 10 <b>clients</b> in 2010. Methadone was the most common pharmacotherapy type Consistent with previous years, in 2010 methadone accounted for close to seven in 10 clients’ pharmacotherapy type, with the remaining three in 10 <b>clients</b> receiving either buprenorphine or buprenorphine–naloxone. The proportion of <b>clients</b> receiving methadone was highest among those aged less than 40 years (55 % compared with 45 % for <b>clients</b> 40 years and over). Increase in prescribers There was a {{rise in the number of}} prescribers from 1, 435 in 2009 to 1, 449 in 2010, with the majority of prescribers in 2010 being private prescribers (80 %). Across Australia, the client-to-prescriber ratio has remained relatively stable since 2005 (in the range of 30 to 33 <b>clients</b> per prescriber). In 2010, this ratio was 32 <b>clients</b> per prescriber. The ratio of <b>clients</b> per prescriber varied depending on the prescriber type. In 2010, public prescribers had the highest ratio (64 <b>clients</b> per prescriber), followed by correctional facility prescribers (57 <b>clients</b> per prescriber) and private prescribers (25 <b>clients</b> per prescriber). Most opioid pharmacotherapy dosing point sites were located in pharmacies In 2010, there were 2, 200 dosing point sites in Australia, a rise from 2, 157 in 2009. Of these 2, 200, 86 % were located in pharmacies. The ratio of <b>clients</b> per dosing point site across Australia has been increasing slowly since this information was first collected in 2006. In 2006, there was a ratio of 19 <b>clients</b> per dosing point, increasing to a ratio of 21 <b>clients</b> per dosing point in 2010...|$|R

5|$|The PS3 <b>client</b> was {{developed}} in a collaborative effort between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone <b>client</b> on March23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September18 of the following year, the PS3 <b>client</b> became a channel of Life with PlayStation on its launch. In the types of calculations it can perform, {{at the time of}} its introduction, the <b>client</b> fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made technical support easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.|$|E

Internal beta testing of the Linux <b>client</b> started in October 2012; external beta testing occurred in early November the same year.

From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions. Linux games are also eligible for SteamPlay availability. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October 2013.
