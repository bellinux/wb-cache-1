Since 2006, Veterans Affairs Canada returned $1.13 billion in unspent funding back to the federal treasury. Nine Veterans Affairs offices were closed between 2012 and 2015, and 900 positions were phased out from the department since 2009. Former Minister of Veterans Affairs Erin O'Toole stated that the closures were made to modernize Veterans Affairs, by moving services online and to Service Canada locations. The Public Service Alliance of Canada union President, Robyn Benson, ran an add campaign against the closures. O'Toole responded stating [...] "Nowhere do you inform veterans and their families that 27 front-line mental health clinics have been opened or are opening shortly, nor do you mention the 31 new integrated personnel and support centres of Veterans Affairs and the Canadian Armed Forces." [...] O'Toole further explained {{that the government would}} prioritize spending to hire more <b>case</b> <b>managers,</b> adjudicators, disability benefits staff, and open new specialized mental health clinics.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the amount}} of work each <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> does and the amount of {{autonomy}} each worker has in completing their job, case management is not uniform in the way it is performed in protection and permanency. This study was designed to look at the individual components of case management to determine if they have any impact on the safety in the homes that have children returned to them. The study was a summative program evaluation using a non-experimental single group post-test design. Carts of 100 Protection and Permanency cases were reviewed to assess the progress of families based on the interventions of the <b>case</b> <b>manager.</b> Data collected showed {{a significant difference between the}} types of service to which the <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> referred the family and the risk assessment scores at the time of reunification. It also showed significant relationships between incomplete case plans, prevention plans, and higher risk assessment scores at the time of reunification. Finally, data showed a significant difference in the number of in-person contacts done by the <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> and the recidivism rate of out of home placements of children. The higher number of visits, the higher the recidivism rates. This may be due to workers having to increase their contacts with the amount of time spent in out-of-home care...|$|R

Twenty six women provided data upon completion of the nurse interventions. A low statistical relationship was found between demographic variables of age (r =. 29, p =. 10) and income (r =. 32, p =. 09) with the nurse <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> intervention. Having had a partial mastectomy (r =. 34, p =. 07) was positively related to the independent study. Having received chemotherapy (r =. 33, p =. 08) was positively related to the self-help class intervention. The information seeking style blunter subscale was found to have a negatively statistically significant relationship with the self-help class intervention (r = -. 31, p =. 10) and a positive relationship with the nurse <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> intervention (r =. 33, p =. 08). The nurse <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> intervention was found to be positively related to adult self-care (r =. 29, p =. 10).

30|$|As {{part of an}} {{activation}} approach, the <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> and Mr. X {{agree on}} activities that will help Mr. X reach interim targets. An interim target could be to get his debt and drug problem under control {{to a point where}} he at least can be employed. Activities such as consultation appointments with debt and addiction counsellors would be accepted by his <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> as steps towards the interim target. A second interim target to be pursued simultaneously could be social integration. Acitivities such as taking on voluntary work (e.g. in a soup kitchen), taking part in sporting activities (e.g. walking) and networking (e.g. family, friends, Xing groups) would be encouraged by his <b>case</b> <b>manager.</b> Activities bring structure to the day and may enhance skills, e.g. Lechner/Sari (2014) confirm positive long-run income effects of sports activities estimating dose–response relationships. The third interim target—increasing employability—can only be set once the more pressing personal problems have been solved. Soft skills training and mobile learning could also be good activities.|$|R
