5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction can be easily identified, although this is often {{not the case in}} other <b>canid</b> species. In 2014, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 <b>canid</b> species. The results suggested that the facial color pattern of <b>canid</b> species is related to their gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one <b>canid,</b> the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the <b>canid</b> giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
50|$|Pack is {{a social}} group of conspecific <b>canids.</b> Not all species of <b>canids</b> form packs; for example, small <b>canids</b> like the red fox do not. Pack size and social {{behaviour}} within packs varies across species.|$|R
40|$|I {{characterized}} three subfamilies of Canidae, including fossil species. Then I discussed {{some aspects}} and characters, which can indicate pack-hunting in <b>canids.</b> These characters {{will be used}} for the next study, focused on testing hypotheses about origin of sociality in <b>canids.</b> In this bachelor thesis, I compiled data matrix of 85 morfological characters of fossil canid´s teeth, skull and other bones. This matrix contains 81 species of fossil <b>canids...</b>|$|R
25|$|As in {{most other}} <b>canids,</b> male bush dogs lift their hind legs when urinating. However, female bush dogs use a kind of handstand posture, which is less common in other <b>canids.</b> When male bush dogs urinate, they create a spray instead of a stream.|$|R
5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One <b>canid,</b> the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Gray wolves {{typically}} dominate other <b>canid</b> {{species in}} areas where they both occur. In North America, incidents of gray wolves killing coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them. There are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them. Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between gray wolves and golden jackals, with the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities. Gray wolves {{are the most important}} predator of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them {{in the spring and summer}} periods. Wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them. In Asia, they may compete with dholes, though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} has interbred {{extensively}} with the eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves. Unlike {{the red and}} eastern wolf, the gray wolf does not readily interbreed with coyotes. Nevertheless, coyote genetic markers {{have been found in}} some wild isolated gray wolf populations in the southern United States. Gray wolf Y-chromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes. In tests performed on a Texan <b>canid</b> of ambiguous species, mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote–gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf. In 2013, a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination, making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves. At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species. Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolf-like phenotypes, {{to the point of being}} mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|E
40|$|The {{family of}} wild <b>canids</b> {{belongs to the}} order Carnivora and {{comprises}} 16 genuses that are distributed in most countries all over the world. The most important endoparasitic diseases of wild <b>canids</b> are toxocariasis, uncinariasis, capillariasis, trichinellosis, echinococcosis, cestodiasis, opisthorchiasis, and alariasis. Ectoparasites that most often exist as parasites in wild <b>canids</b> are mites, fleas, ticks and scabies. Wild <b>canids</b> have a large epizootiological-epidemiological significance since they are hosts to parasites that cause certain vector diseases, {{the most important of}} which are leishmaniasis, ehrilichiosis, babesiasis, borreliosis, dirofilariasis, bartonellosis, and hepatozoonosis. The increased frequency of interaction between domestic and wild <b>canids</b> steps up the risk of the appearance, spread, and maintaining of the disease in domestic dog populations. Observed from the aspect of the biological and ecological risk, that can be caused by zoonotic infections, the knowledge of the etiology and epizootiology of parasistic infections of wild <b>canids</b> is of particular importance for the region of the Republic of Serbia.

50|$|Family Canidae (dogs {{and other}} <b>canids)</b> {{includes}} wolves, dogs, coyotes, and foxes, {{as well as}} a number of less familiar animals. The family is currently divided into two major groups, the true dogs (tribe Canini), which includes nine genera, and the true foxes (tribe Vulpini) with two genera. In addition, two basal genera are described. About 35 species of extant <b>canids</b> are currently recognized. <b>Canids</b> are the most social of all caniforms, sometimes living in packs.

25|$|The African golden wolf (Canis anthus/Canis lupaster) {{also known}} as the golden wolf of African wolf, is a <b>canid</b> native to north and northeastern Africa. The species is common in north-west and {{north-east}} Africa, occurring from Senegal to Egypt in the east, in a range including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya in the north to Nigeria, Chad and Tanzania in the south. It is a desert-adapted <b>canid,</b> and is common in plains and steppe areas, including ones lacking abundant water. In the Atlas Mountains, the species has been sighted in elevations as high as 1,800 metres. It is primarily a predator, targeting invertebrates and mammals as large as gazelle fawns, though larger animals are sometimes taken. Other foodstuffs include animal carcasses, human refuse, and fruit. The African wolf is a monogamous and territorial animal, whose social structure includes yearling offspring remaining with the family to assist in raising their parents' younger pups.|$|E
25|$|Dhole packs may attack sloth bears, {{though they}} are not a usual prey item. When attacking them, dholes try to prevent the bear from {{retreating}} into caves. In one case, a golden jackal (a species much smaller and less powerful than a sloth bear and not generally a pack hunter as is the dhole) was seen to aggressively displace an adult bear which passively loped away from the snapping <b>canid,</b> indicating the sloth bear does not regard other carnivores as competition.|$|E

25|$|All <b>canids</b> (with the {{possible}} exception of dholes) use urine (combined with preputial gland secretions) to mark their territories. Many species of <b>canids,</b> including hoary foxes, cape foxes, and golden jackals, use a raised-leg posture when urinating. The scent of their urine is usually strongest in the winter, before the mating season.|$|R
25|$|The {{reintroduction}} {{of wolves}} in 1995 has significantly decreased the coyote population, although {{those who remain}} often scavenge from wolf kills. Throughout the restoration project, coyote research has continued, {{with an eye toward}} identifying the interactions between coyotes and wolves and on assessing the effects of wolves on coyote populations. During planning and environmental assessment of the effects of wolf restoration, biologists anticipated that coyotes would compete with the larger <b>canid,</b> perhaps resulting in disruption of packs and numerical declines.|$|E
25|$|Further doubts {{over its}} being conspecific {{with the golden}} jackal of Eurasia arose in December 2002, when a <b>canid</b> was sighted in Eritrea's Danakil Desert whose {{appearance}} didn't correspond {{to that of the}} golden jackal or the six other recognised species of the area, but strongly resembled that of the grey wolf. The area had previously been largely unexplored because of its harsh climate and embroilment in the Eritrean War of Independence and subsequent Eritrean–Ethiopian War, though local Afar tribesmen knew of the animal, and referred to it as wucharia (wolf).|$|E
25|$|The Zhokhov Island (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) <b>canid</b> haplotypes fell {{within the}} {{domestic}} dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with – or are one mutation away from – the Tibetan wolf (C. l. chanco) and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (C. l. hodophilax). This {{may indicate that}} these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from Duvanny Yar appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.|$|E

Additional or different maintenance rules and regulations may also apply. Condominium associations and owners of rental properties also commonly limit or forbid tenants' keeping of pets.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian wolf is {{restricted}} to just six isolated mountaintop areas of the Ethiopian highlands. With a total world population of approximately 400 individuals, the Ethiopian wolf is the most endangered carnivore in Africa and most endangered <b>canid</b> in the world. As a result it is legally protected in the country from any activities that may threaten its survival. Habitat loss, caused by unsustainable and rapidly expanding cattle and crop farming is the most severe underlying threat, but diseases (rabies and canine distemper) transmitted from domestic dogs are a serious immediate threat and have recently caused population crashes in the Bale Mountains.|$|E
