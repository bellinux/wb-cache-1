There are several ways of constructing synthetic DNA components and even entire synthetic genomes, but once the desired genetic code is obtained, it is integrated into a living cell {{that is expected to}} manifest the desired new capabilities or phenotypes while growing and thriving. <b>Cell</b> <b>transformation</b> is used to create biological circuits, which can be manipulated to yield desired outputs.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live {{predominantly}} saprophytic lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to <b>cell</b> <b>transformation.</b> Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground {{and study}} aimsBiliary atresia (BA) {{is the most}} common cause of chronic {{cholestasis}} in infants. The most important objective in such cases is to distinguish obstructive cholestasis from non-obstructive causes. Aim of the studyTo evaluate the hepatic histopathology for the presence of features that correlate best with the diagnosis of BA. Patients and methodsWe retrospectively study the data of 81 infants who presented with neonatal cholestatic syndrome (NCS) (58 diagnosed as BA and 23 as not BA). We evaluated 6 histopathological parameters including ductular proliferation, bile plugs, intracellular bile pigments, giant <b>cells</b> <b>transformation,</b> Portal cellular infiltration and fibrosis. ResultsThe study showed that ductular proliferation, bile plugs and intracellular bile pigments emerged as the best indicators of BA while multinucleate giant <b>cells</b> <b>transformation</b> and portal cellular infiltration were seen in NH. ConclusionIn developing countries, we therefore recommend doing prelaparotomy liver biopsy for all suspected cases of BA to decrease the frequency of negative laparotomy to achieve cost benefit with reduced morbidity...|$|R

In this paper, we identify two novel networks that collectively control the dynamic reorganization of the mitotic cortex. We demonstrate that Moesin, an actin/membrane linker, integrates these two networks to synergize the cortical forces that drive mitotic <b>cell</b> shape <b>transformations.</b> We find that the Pp 1 - 87 B phosphatase restricts high Moesin activity to early mitosis and down-regulates Moesin at the polar cortex, after anaphase onset.

40|$|The {{lack of an}} eficient {{transformation}} {{system in}} Vibrio c oler e was a handicap in the genetic manipulation of this important human pathogen. Since V. cholerae cells secrete DNases, this may interfere with the uptake of DNA. The present report describes the approaches taken for transforming V’. cholerae cells with plasmid DNA, by overcoming this DNase barrier. The partial success of transforming DNase-negative mutants confirmed the role of DNase in the nontransformability of the wild-type <b>cells.</b> Successful <b>transformation</b> was carried out following removal of DNases from the periplasmic space. This was achieved by treating the cells with Mg 2 + and Ca* + ions to allow the DNase to be released, and then holding them under conditions where the remaining DNase activity was minimized before adding DNA to the competent <b>cells.</b> <b>Transformation</b> effxciencies {{of the order of}} 10 5 per recipient cell were observed...|$|R
50|$|DVL1, {{the human}} homolog of the Drosophila dishevelled gene (dsh) encodes a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that regulates cell proliferation, {{acting as a}} {{transducer}} molecule for developmental processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. DVL1 is a candidate gene for processes involved in <b>cell</b> <b>transformations</b> involved in neuroblastoma. The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A have been mapped to the same region as DVL1. The phenotypes of these diseases may be consistent with defects which might be expected from aberrant expression of a DVL gene during development. Three transcript variants encoding three different isoforms have been found for this gene.|$|R

Whereas this process requires cell–cell communication via Notch (N) receptor, mitotic recombination that removes the N ligand Delta (Dl) or Serrate (Ser) in the SOL had mild or no effect. Removal of both Dl and Ser, however, led to <b>cell</b> fate <b>transformations</b> similar to the N phenotype. <b>Cell</b> fate <b>transformation</b> occurred even when a single SOL cell lost both Dl and Ser.

5000|$|Cancer {{epigenetic}}s is {{the study}} of epigenetic modifications to the genome of cancer cells that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic alterations are as important as genetic mutations in a <b>cell's</b> <b>transformation</b> to cancer, and their manipulation holds great promise for cancer prevention, detection, and therapy. In different types of cancer, a variety of epigenetic mechanisms can be perturbed, such as silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes by altered CpG island methylation patterns, histone modifications, and dysregulation of DNA binding proteins. Several medications which have epigenetic impact are now used in several of these diseases.|$|R

5000|$|Acute myeloid {{dendritic}} cell leukemia is an exceedingly rare form of leukemia. This form of leukemia represents only about 0.8% {{of all cases}} of acute myeloid leukemia. Dendritic cells function as antigen-presenting cells. They process antigen material and present it on the surface to other cells of the immune system. Dendritic cells develop from progenitors in the bone marrow and transform into two subtypes: the myeloid {{dendritic cell}} and the plasmacytoid dendritic <b>cell.</b> Leukemic <b>transformation</b> can occur {{in any of these}} two <b>cells,</b> but <b>transformation</b> of myeloid dendritic cell is less common and it leads to a form of leukemia known as acute myeloid dendritic cell leukemia.|$|R

40|$|Background: Galectin- 3 (Gal- 3) is an {{anti-apoptotic}} molecule {{involved in}} thyroid <b>cells</b> <b>transformation.</b> It is specifically overexpressed in thyroid tumour cells {{and is currently}} used as a preoperative diagnostic marker of thyroid malignancy. Gal- 3 expression is downregulated by wt-p 53 at the transcriptional level. In well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTCs) there is an unexplained paradoxical concomitant expression of Gal- 3 and wt-p 53. HIPK 2 is a co-regulator of different transcription factors, and modulates basic cellular processes mainly through the activation of wt-p 53. Since we demonstrated that HIPK 2 is involved in p 53 -mediated Gal- 3 downregulation, we asked whether HIPK 2 deficiency might be responsible for such paradoxical Gal- 3 overexpression in WDTC...|$|R
40|$|Anchorage {{independent}} {{growth is}} one of the hallmarks of oncogenic transformation.

Mouse and human cells which were transformed by UV-SV 40 all contained SV 40 T antigen. Infectious virus could be recovered from many more transformants than would be expected from the infectivity in African green monkey kidney cells of the irradiated virus.

40|$|The {{proteins}} of the Ets {{family are}} transcription factors involved in signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. In this study, {{we report that}} thyroid <b>cell</b> neoplastic <b>transformation</b> {{is associated with a}} dramatic increase in ETS transcriptional activity, which is dependent on the accumulation of Ets- 1, Ets- 2, and other Ets-related proteins. Inhibition of ETS transactivation activity by the Ets-dominant negative construct (Ets-Z) induced programmed cell death in human thyroid carcinoma cell lines but not in normal thyroid cells. Apoptotic cell death induced by Ets-Z was dependent on the reduction of c-MYC protein levels, because it was prevented by overexpressinn of c-myc. Taken together, these data indicate that the induction of Ets-l and Ets- 2 transcription factors plays a pivotal role in thyroid <b>cell</b> neoplastic <b>transformation...</b>|$|R
