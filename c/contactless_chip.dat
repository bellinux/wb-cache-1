50|$|ICAO standardizes {{machine-readable}} passports worldwide. Such passports have an {{area where}} some of the information otherwise written in textual form is written as strings of alphanumeric characters, printed in a manner suitable for optical character recognition. This enables border controllers and other law enforcement agents to process such passports quickly, without having to enter the information manually into a computer. ICAO publishes Document 9303 Machine Readable Travel Documents, the technical standard for machine-readable passports. A more recent standard is for biometric passports. These contain biometrics to authenticate the identity of travellers. The passport's critical information is stored on a tiny RFID computer chip, much like information stored on smartcards. Like some smartcards, the passport book design calls for an embedded <b>contactless</b> <b>chip</b> that is able to hold digital signature data to ensure the integrity of the passport and the biometric data.|$|E
50|$|The {{currently}} standardized biometrics {{used for}} this type of identification system are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including retinal scan. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9303. The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in JPEG or JPEG2000 format) of each biometric feature is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the <b>contactless</b> <b>chip,</b> it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of EEPROM storage memory, and runs on an interface in accordance with the ISO/IEC 14443 international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books.|$|E

Technologies at this level include smart chips, magnetic strips, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), <b>contactless</b> <b>chips</b> or smart chips with embedded identity and biometric data. With the right tools, L2S schemes allows the capability to capture, register and authenticate document holders' identity information and, of late, biometric identity information.

A specialized access mechanism (i.e. the reader and encoder device) is required to obtain access to the relevant data source and write data onto the embedded medium.|$|R
