However, there are few reports on the SIC stock and its spatial distribution in this region. In the current study, the SIC densities and stocks for various soil types and land use patterns were evaluated based on 495 profiles with 2470 soil samples across the CLP, which were collected from the Chinese Second National Soil Survey. The results showed that in the top 1 m of soil across the CLP, the average SIC density is 17. 04 kg/m(2), and the total SIC stock is approximately 10. 20 Pg C (1 Pg = 10 (15) g). The SIC stock of the CLP accounts for approximately 18. 4 % of the total SIC stock throughout China. The average values of the SIC stock in the 0 - 20, 20 - 50 and 50 - 100 cm depths of the CLP are 2. 39, 2. 92 and 4. 89 Pg, respectively. Under different land use patterns, the order of the average SIC density is farmland approximate to grassland > forest in all soil layers. For the various soil types, the SIC density in the 0 - 100 cm layer is the highest in alkaline soil and lowest in subalpine meadow soil, whereas the SIC stock is highest in loessial soil, eolian sandy soil and sierozem, and the lowest in subalpine meadow soil. These differences are largely a result of the area occupied by each soil type and the climate conditions.

The periodicity is correlatable {{all over the}} global ocean and hence indicative of low-frequency changes in the ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>reservoir.</b> As the same periodicity {{is also found in}} carbonate and eolian dust records in the tropical ocean, it may have been caused by such low-latitude proc-esses like monsoon. According to the Quaternary records from Site 1143 and elsewhere, major ice-sheet expansion and major transition in glacial cyclicity (such as the Mid-Brunhes Event and the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution) were all pre-ceded by reorganization in the ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>reservoir</b> ex-pressed as an episode of carbon isotope maximum (δ 13 Cmax), implying the role of carbon cycling in modulating the glacial periodicity. The Quaternary glacial cycles, therefore, should no more be ascribed to the physical response to insolation changes at the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes alone; rather, they have been driven by the “double forcing”, a combination of processes at both high and low latitudes, and of processes in both physical (ice-sheet) and biogeochemical (carbon cycling) realms. As the Earth is now passing through a new carbon isotope maximum, it is of vital impor-tance to understand the cyclic variations in the ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>reservoir</b> and its climate impact.
