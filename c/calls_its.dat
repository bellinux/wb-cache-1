China <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> {{uninterrupted}} rail link between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E

5|$|The black currawong is a {{loud and}} vocal species, {{and makes a}} variety of <b>calls.</b> <b>Its</b> main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.|$|E

500|$|The final symphony, the Ninth, was {{completed}} in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre {{than that of the}} Eighth; Grove <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> mood [...] "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not sure what to make of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.|$|E

500|$|Also {{contemporary}} is Gregory of Tours' account {{presented in}} the Historia Francorum, and echoed by the later Fredegar. Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married {{the daughter of a}} man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning him. She had previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the Historia and <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> account of Alboin's demise [...] "a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity".|$|E

Massive Dynamic's Nina Sharp directs her to Sam Weiss, a bowling alley manager, who gives her cryptic but helpful advice to overcome her amnesia. Meanwhile, the Fringe division has discovered several shapeshifters - a human/machine hybrid that bleed mercury - have crossed over, but unbeknownst to them, one {{takes the form of}} Olivia's partner, Charlie. When Sam's advice allows Olivia to recall what Bell told her, she unwittingly gives this information to the shapeshifter, who <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> agents to use the information to recover the body of Thomas Jerome Newton, an agent for some entity operating from the parallel universe. Nina provides Olivia with cautionary advice, alerting her to a [...] "great war" [...] that Bell postulated would occur between the two universes. During this time, Peter has come to forgive Walter for his past, and Walter has grown accustomed to normal life outside of the institution, but is still troubled by a secret.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} non-Nordic Viking metal bands was the German project Falkenbach. Formed in 1989 and {{primarily}} the work of front-man Vratyas Vakyas, Falkenbach performs a mixture of black metal and folk music, with lyrics drawing from Western and Northern European mythologies, religions, and folk traditions. The Dutch bands Heidevolk, Slechtvalk, and Fenris have also been labeled as Viking metal, though Heidevolk's former vocalist Joris Boghtdrincker claims that Heidevolk has never tried to [...] "play the Viking card or the Pan-Germanic card", instead choosing to write about local Dutch history. The Swiss band Eluveitie jokingly <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> music [...] "the new wave of folk metal", which vocalist Chrigel Glanzmann explains was because the [...] "whole folk metal thing was still quite new back then, and the scene and the music press was looking for new labels {{for that kind of}} music, so they came up with Forest Metal, Viking Metal, Heathen Metal, Pagan Metal, blah blah blah, and we just felt like it was really really ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|The xx's lyrics on Coexist feature broader diction {{than on the}} xx's {{first record}} and employ simple metaphors of light and darkness, and {{distance}} and time. They often express emotional stress, yearning, and passive-aggressive attitudes. Some songs feature a lyrical conceit of an emotionally elusive lover as an apparition or an illusion. Croft and Sim avoid traditional duet lyrics about declarations of love, instead employing inner monologues to depict the same situation from two different perspectives. Eric Sundermann asserts that, rather than [...] "simply" [...] being [...] "declarations", the songs serve as [...] "the thought process of {{how to deal with}} interpersonal struggles." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph perceives [...] "intimate conversations between forlorn lovers" [...] and an [...] "almost sacred eroticism in Croft and Sim's whispery vocals." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley views that the album shares its predecessor's [...] "fragility", [...] "quiet gravitas", and [...] "heavy words", but is [...] "an intensely wind-torn and wounded album that cuts even deeper than its predecessor." [...] Music journalist Luke Turner <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> subject matter more [...] "turbulent, sensual and fun" [...] than on the group's first album and states, [...] "of course not necessarily a sexual or romantic one, the feel of this second record is far more earthy, sticky, complicated, like the tension of the second or third encounters after a one night stand." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{its initial}} reception, Connotations was listed in 1979 by Billboard {{magazine}} among Copland works that {{continued to be}} programmed by orchestras, with subsequent performances by Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling received positively. Reaction to the work itself remains mixed. Ross dismisses Connotations as a [...] "barbaric yawp of a piece." [...] Morin calls it a [...] "thorny, riveting patchwork" [...] and listening to it [...] "like the unrelenting pummeling of a prizefighter at times." [...] Adams <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> style [...] "very simplistic... strident" [...] and [...] "generally unpleasant sounding" [...] and adds that [...] "the rigor [...] seemed more to cramp [...] natural spontaneity than to aid it." [...] Composer Kyle Gann calls Connotations [...] "big, unwieldy... and [...] that good... Copland's imagination seemed constrained by the technique. On a more positive note, Davis wrote after a performance of the work under Ehrling by The Juilliard Orchestra that while Connotations remains a [...] "spiky" [...] composition, Copland [...] "adopts Schoenberg's serial procedures to produce a sequence of typically pungent and exhilarating Coplandesque sonorities." [...] Desmond Shawe-Taylor called the work [...] "beautifully put together: full of energy, variety, thought" [...] after he had heard Boulez conduct the piece. Michael Andrews wrote of Copland's [...] "mammoth, anxious and angry vision" [...] and Barlett Naylor of [...] "a majesty hidden in this dark piece" [...] after both had heard de Waart's performance.|$|E
500|$|Magical Mystery Tour, {{the soundtrack}} to a {{forthcoming}} Beatles television film, {{was released in}} the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP) in early December 1967. In the United States, the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles. Unterberger says of the US Magical Mystery Tour, [...] "the psychedelic sound {{is very much in}} the vein of Sgt. Pepper, and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of 'I Am the Walrus')" [...] and he <b>calls</b> <b>its</b> five songs culled from the band's 1967 singles [...] "huge, glorious, and innovative". In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, and it is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums. First aired on Boxing Day, the Magical Mystery Tour film, largely directed by McCartney, brought the group their first major negative UK press. It was dismissed as [...] "blatant rubbish" [...] by the Daily Express; the Daily Mail called it [...] "a colossal conceit"; and The Guardian labelled the film [...] "a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience". Gould describes it as [...] "a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus". Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.|$|E
