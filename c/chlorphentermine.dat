2500|$|In the past, {{three groups}} of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive {{antimigraine}} drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, <b>chlorphentermine,</b> and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include pergolide and cabergoline, but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride. Receptors|author1=Jähnichen S |author2=Horowski R |author3=Pertz H |accessdate = 3 February 2010}} ...|$|E

50|$|Clortermine (Voranil) was {{developed}} by Ciba in the 1960s and is an anorectic drug of the amphetamine class. It is the 2-chloro analogue of the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, and is the 2-chloro positional isomer of <b>chlorphentermine.</b> Clortermine produces very low rates of self-administration in animals similarly to <b>chlorphentermine,</b> {{and as a result}} it likely does not act on dopamine. Instead, it may act as a serotonin and/or norepinephrine releasing agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorphentermine</b> (trade names Apsedon, Desopimon, Lucofen) is a serotonergic {{appetite}} suppressant of the amphetamine family. Developed in 1962, {{it is the}} 4-chloro {{derivative of}} the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, which is still in current use.|$|E
50|$|The drugs most classically {{associated}} with the condition are weight loss drugs such as fenfluramine and <b>chlorphentermine,</b> and antiparkinson drugs such as pergolide and cabergoline, which are prescribed to be taken several times a day, often for months or years at a time.|$|E
50|$|Some {{appetite}} suppressant {{drugs such}} as fenfluramine (which in combination with phentermine was marketed as Pondimin and {{commonly referred to as}} fen-phen), <b>chlorphentermine,</b> and aminorex (along with its analogue 4-Methylaminorex which has seen sporadic use as a recreational drug) induce a similar pattern of cardiac fibrosis (and pulmonary hypertension), apparently by over-stimulating 5HT2B receptors on the cardiac fibroblast cells.|$|E
50|$|Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause {{fibrosis}} {{anywhere in}} the body, particularly the syndrome of retroperitoneal fibrosis, as well as cardiac valve fibrosis.In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, <b>chlorphentermine,</b> and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include pergolide and cabergoline, but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride.|$|E
50|$|Cericlamine (INN) (developmental {{code name}} JO-1017) {{is a potent}} and {{moderately}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) of the amphetamine family (specifically, a derivative of phentermine, and closely related to <b>chlorphentermine,</b> a highly selective serotonin releasing agent) that was investigated as an antidepressant {{for the treatment of}} depression, anxiety disorders, and anorexia nervosa by Jouveinal but did not complete development and was never marketed. It reached phase III clinical trials in 1996 before development was discontinued in 1999.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorphentermine</b> acts as {{a highly}} {{selective}} serotonin releasing agent (SRA). It is not a psychostimulant and {{has little or no}} abuse potential, but is classed as a Schedule III drug in the USA due mainly to its similarity to other appetite suppressants such as diethylpropion which have been more widely abused. It is no longer used due mainly to safety concerns, as it has a serotonergic effects profile similar to other withdrawn appetite suppressants such as fenfluramine and aminorex which were found to cause pulmonary hypertension and cardiac fibrosis following prolonged use.|$|E
50|$|Amphetamines like MDMA, MDEA, MDA, and MBDB, {{among other}} {{relatives}} (see MDxx), are recreational drugs termed entactogens. They act as serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs) and also agonize serotonin receptors {{such as those}} in the 5-HT2 subfamily. Fenfluramine, <b>chlorphentermine,</b> and aminorex, which are also amphetamines and relatives, were formerly used as appetite suppressants but were discontinued due to concerns of cardiac valvulopathy. This side effect has been attributed to their additional action of potent agonism of the 5-HT2B receptor. The designer drug 4-methylaminorex, which is an SNDRA and 5-HT2B agonist, has been reported to cause this effect as well.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of <b>chlorphentermine</b> to rats {{resulted in a}} reduction of body weight compared to a normal control group. The weight of the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen was less in the treated group while {{the weight of the}} lungs was increased significantly. There was no change in the ratio of right ventricular to left ventricular weight in the rats treated with <b>chlorphentermine,</b> supporting the views that this drug does not cause pulmonary hypertension. Biochemical analysis showed that the increase in the weight of the lungs was due to the accumulation of phospholipid. All classes of phospholipid were affected, but particularly phosphatidyl choline, the tissue concentration of which increased nine times. <b>Chlorphentermine</b> also increased the proportion of palmitate present in pulmonary phosphatidyl choline. Histological examination of the lung after treatment with <b>chlorphentermine</b> showed evidence of this drug-induced lipidosis.

40|$|<b>Chlorphentermine</b> {{proves to}} be a suc-cessful anorexigenic agent in this study. When {{compared}} to a placebo, it produced a significant degree of weight loss and maintained its value for up to nine months of follow up. It has replaced all other drugs {{for the treatment of}} obese adoles-cents in this busy clinic. OBESITY is still a frequent and difficult therapeutic problem in adolescent medicine. Caloric restriction as well as improved eating habits must be adopted by the obese adoles-cent if significant weight loss is to occur. Ano-rexigenic drugs are still commonly prescribed to help achieve caloric restriction despite evi-dence of their temporary value and the recom-mendation of authorities in adolescent medi-cine that such drugs be considered the least important facet of therapy. ~’&dquo; <b>Chlorphentermine</b> hydrochloride (Pre...|$|E

Electron microscopy of {{lung tissue}} from rats treated with <b>chlorphentermine</b> shows an intense hyperplasia in the alveolar walls of granular pneumocytes which remain attached {{and do not}} migrate into the alveolar spaces. Numerous `foam cells' are found free in the alveoli and are histiocytes which have ingested osmiophilic lamellar bodies. Similar laminated inclusions are found in granular pneumocytes, membranous pneumocytes, bronchiolar Clara cells, pulmonary macrophages, and endothelial cells of pulmonary capillaries. The intra-alveolar debris is rich in osmiophilic lamellar bodies with associated phospholipid lattices. The appearances are those of a toxic alveolitis. Further studies of chronic toxicity are suggested to ascertain if this acute lesion progresses to fibrosing alveolitis...|$|E

When this drug, which is available on the British market, was administered intraperitoneally to rats in a dosage of 50 mg per kg body weight for 50 days, they all developed striking pathological changes in the lungs. Numerous large cells with foamy cytoplasm appeared in the alveolar spaces. Groups of them clumped together and disintegrated to pack the alveoli with granular eosinophilic material. The identification of these cells proved to be difficult even by electron microscopy, and this ultrastructural study is described separately in the following paper.

The {{ultrastructure}} of the bronchiolar Clara cell {{was examined}} in normal adult and neonatal rats, in similar animals {{which had been}} acutely exposed to hypoxia, and in adult rats following repeated doses of the anorexigen <b>chlorphentermine.</b> The Clara cell has all the features of a secretory cell, the product of secretion accumulating within smooth cisternae {{at the apex of}} the cell. The apical region is then extruded into the bronchiolar lumen in a process of apocrine secretion. Acute hypoxia accelerates this secretion in adult rats but has little effect upon neonatal rats. Administration of <b>chlorphentermine</b> induces a hyperplasia of Clara cells which is associated with large quantities of phospholipid free within the alveolar spaces and in macrophages. The Clara cells also contain accumulations of what appear to be phospholipid. This suggests that the Clara cell secretes the phospholipid pulmonary surfactant...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of prostaglandins (PGs) on the release of lysosomes into the extracellular space in experimentally-induced storage disease in rats. The generalized phospholipidosis was induced by oral administration of <b>chlorphentermine</b> to Wistar rats. PG-E 2 or PG-F 2 alpha (50 micrograms/ 100 g) was injected intravenously into rats with phospholipidosis. Control rats were injected with the same amount of saline. Twenty-four hours later, extracellular and intracellular lysosomes were analysed morphometrically in electromicrographs of the liver, kidney, myocardium, skeletal muscle, aorta and cervix uteri, having been stained with acid-phosphatase. The morphometric parameters used were the numerical density of lysosomes per unit volume and the volume density of lysosomes per unit volume. The results show that, in comparison with the controls, a volumetric increase of extracellular lysosomes and a volumetric decrease of intracellular lysosomes were achieved by PG-E 2 or PG-F 2 alpha administration in several organs, but not in the myocardium or skeletal muscles. The effect of PG-F 2 alpha was greater than that of PG-E 2 in the liver and kidney, while the effect of PG-E 2 was greater than that of PG-F 2 alpha in the aorta and cervix uteri. These results indicate that PGs influence the discharge of storage lysosomes in bipolar epithelial cells in the liver and kidney, and also influence the release of non-storing lysosomes in apolar mesenchymal cells in the aorta and cervix uteri...|$|E
