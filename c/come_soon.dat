25|$|I deeply regret my {{comments}} I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians. They {{do not reflect}} my heart-felt belief that peace {{will come to the}} Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day <b>come</b> <b>soon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor {{began as}} a middlebrow comic, with {{material}} far less controversial than what was to <b>come.</b> <b>Soon,</b> he began appearing regularly on television variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Merv Griffin Show, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. His popularity led to success as a comic in Las Vegas. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD , recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period.|$|E
25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and want {{to find new ways to}} do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E

25|$|Samonas's own downfall, however, would <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> after. In 907, {{in a bid}} to ingratiate {{himself with}} Leo's fourth wife, Zoe Karbonopsina, he {{presented}} her with a gift in the person of his own eunuch servant, Constantine Barbaros. As the imperial couple took an increased liking to Constantine, however, Samonas began to fear for his own influence and position. He first claimed that Constantine and the empress were having an affair. Leo initially believed the accusations, and had Constantine banished to a monastery. Soon, however, Leo began to miss his new favourite, and had him restored to his service in the palace. Samonas then resorted to another scheme: with his secretary, he produced a pamphlet, supposedly written by Constantine, which insulted the emperor, and arranged for Leo to read it. His machinations, however, were betrayed by one of his fellow conspirators, and Samonas was dismissed, tonsured, and banished to the monastery of Martinakios in summer of 908. Constantine succeeded him as imperial parakoimomenos. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E
500|$|Though modest in {{comparison}} with pink films which would <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> after, Daydream did contain female nudity. The government refused to allow one controversial shot, which gave a brief glimpse of pubic hair. Takechi fought the government's censorship of this shot, but lost. When the censors obscured the offending hair with a fuzzy white dot, Daydream became the first film in Japanese cinema to undergo [...] "fogging", a common element in Japanese erotic cinema for decades to come.|$|E
500|$|At 11:40pm on April 14, 1912, Titanic struck an iceberg. [...] Hays {{helped the}} women in his party {{into one of the}} ship's 20 lifeboats, but he, his son-in-law, and his {{secretary}} remained and perished when the ship sank, along with 1,500 other Titanic passengers and crew. Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever-faster vessels, he is said to have commented, [...] "The time will <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster." ...|$|E

2500|$|Settle {{then takes}} {{a glance at}} the loss of {{learning}} incipient in the age. In architecture, the fool triumphant is Ripley, who was making a new Admiralty building, while [...] "Jones' and Boyle's" [...] fail. Settle wishes for the day to <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> when Eton and Westminster are in permanent holiday. As with the earlier version of the poem, the book ends with Cibber excitedly waking from his dream.|$|E
2500|$|Though modest {{compared}} to pink films which would <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> after, Daydream did contain female nudity, including a brief shot of pubic hair. To the outsider, Japanese censors can seem surprisingly lenient {{in what is}} allowed on film, however the depiction of pubic hair and genitalia was strictly forbidden. Takechi fought the government's censorship of this shot, but lost. When the censors obscured the offending hair with a fuzzy white dot, Daydream became the first film in Japanese cinema to undergo [...] "fogging," [...] which {{would become one of}} the trademarks of Japanese pornography for decades.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Burke {{appeared}} on TVOntario in July 2012 {{to talk about}} You Can Play. In {{response to a question}} about whether the NHL is ready to accept gay players, he said, [...] "Before we started, we went to the NHL and said, 'Does this have your support?' and Gary Bettman was like, 'Absolutely.' He knew Brendan, and he was like, 'Absolutely, that day can't <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> enough.'" [...] On April 11, 2013, the NHL and NHLPA announced an official partnership with You Can Play, including a commitment to educate prospects on LGBT issues and provide avenues for players to seek confidential counseling related to sexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|The 1998 {{and early}} 2000s {{improvements}} to the school did not <b>come</b> <b>soon</b> enough, however. [...] The family of a handicapped student at Great Falls High School sued the school, arguing {{that the quality of}} their child's education had been impaired {{due to a lack of}} IDEA-compliant facilities. [...] In September 1998, the Montana Human Rights Commission agreed, and ordered the school district to make improvements and pay the family a monetary settlement. The school district appealed the decision on technical grounds, arguing that not all administrative remedies had been pursued. [...] On June 7, 2001, the Montana State Supreme Court held against the school district and upheld the Human Rights Commission's decision.|$|E
2500|$|French {{generally}} {{had good}} relation with Haldane, the new Secretary of State for War, but lobbied him against cutting two Guards battalions (the Liberals {{had been elected}} {{on a platform of}} retrenchment). In February 1906 French told Major General Grierson (Director of Military Operations) that he was to be Commander-in-Chief of the BEF during the next war, with Grierson as his chief of staff. He had meetings with Grierson throughout March until the Moroccan crisis was resolved. French told the Daily Mail (12 May 1906) that a force of trained volunteers would deter an enemy invasion. In June 1906 French still believed that another war scare might <b>come</b> <b>soon,</b> and in July he attended French Army manoeuvres in Champagne, by which he was impressed, although he was less impressed by the Belgian Army. On this trip he was accused of giving unauthorised interviews to the French press, after uttering what Grierson called [...] "a few platitudes" [...] to the Figaro correspondent.|$|E
