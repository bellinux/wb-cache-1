And his father and mine talked together, and mine beckoned to me, and I dismounted, and the baba put his hand into mine--eighteen--twenty-five-- twenty-seven years gone now--Kurban Sahib--my Kurban Sahib! Oh, we were great friends after that! He <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> on my sword-hilt, as the saying is. He called me Big Umr Singh--Buwwa Umwa Singh, for he could not speak plain. He stood only this high, Sahib, from the bottom of this truck, but he knew all our troopers by name--every one.... And he went to England, and he became a young man, and back he came, lilting a little in his walk, and cracking his finger-joints--back to his own regiment and to me. He had not forgotten either our speech or our customs. He was a Sikh at heart, Sahib. He was rich, open-handed, just, a friend of poor troopers, keen- eyed, jestful, and careless. I could tell tales about him in his first years. There was very little he hid from me. I was his Umr Singh, and when we were alone he called me Father, and I called him Son. Yes, that was how we spoke. We spoke freely together on everything--about war, and women, and money, and advancement, and such all.|$|E
