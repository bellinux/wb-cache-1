50|$|A liquid <b>contact</b> <b>{{indicator}}</b> (LCI) {{is a small}} {{indicator that}} turns from white into another color, typically red, after contact with water. Those indicators are small stickers that are placed on several points within electronic devices like laptops and smartphones. In case of a defective device, service personnel can check whether the device might have suffered from contact with water. After contact with water, or other liquids, the device is not covered by warranty. Liquid contact indicators are also known by other names such as water damage tape, water damage sticker, water <b>contact</b> <b>indicator</b> tape, liquid submersion indicator.|$|E
50|$|Liquid <b>contact</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are placed}} on several places in {{electronic}} devices. For example underneath the keyboard in a notebook and on several places on its mainboard. Sometimes the liquid <b>contact</b> <b>indicators</b> are placed {{in such a way}} that they can be inspected from the outside. For instance there is a LCI in the headphone connector, the dock connector, and near the SIM-card slot of an Apple iPhone. In a Samsung Galaxy smartphone there is a LCI underneath the battery cover near the battery contacts.|$|R

50|$|At this point, {{the engine}} was started again for Powered Descent Initiation. During this time the crew flew on their backs, {{depending}} on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised {{with a combination of}} engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During the braking phase altitude decreased to approximately 10000 ft, then the final approach phase went to approximately 700 ft. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.Finally the landing phase began, approximately 2000 ft uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point manual control was enabled for the Commander, and enough fuel reserve was allocated to allow approximately two minutes of hover time to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. (If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM.) Finally, 66 inch (1676 mm) long probes extending from three footpads of the lander touched the surface, activating the <b>contact</b> <b>indicator</b> light which signaled time for descent engine cutoff, allowing the LM to settle on the surface.|$|E

To assess the feasibility of prevalence estimations based on drug use surveillance systems. Methods: Serial multi-method PDU/IDU prevalence estimations based upon capture-recapture, Poisson regression, multiplier and back-calculation methods. Comparative analysis of methods and assessment of their robustness to variations of external factors. Results: National PDU and IDU prevalence rates were estimated at 6. 16 / 1, 000 (95 % CI 4. 62 / 1, 000 to 7. 81 / 1, 000) and 5. 68 / 1, 000 (95 % CI 4. 53 / 1, 000 to 6. 85 / 1, 000) inhabitants aged 15 – 64 years, respectively. Absolute prevalence and prevalence rates of PDU increased between 1997 and 2000 and declined from 2003 onwards, whereas IDU absolute prevalence and prevalence rates witnessed an increasing trend between 1997 and 2007. Conclusions: Drug use surveillance systems can be valuable instruments for the estimation and trend analysis of drug misuse prevalence given multiple methods are applied that rely on serial and representative data from different sources and different settings, control multiple counts and build upon standardized and sustained data collection routines.

40|$|In {{the period}} from September 2004 to December 2005 15 dairy farms {{with a history of}} animal health {{problems}} such as infertility, mastitis and high somatic cell counts, respiratory diseases and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and suspected involvement of Chlamydia were included in a study funded by the Ministry of Agriculture of NRW. In the present doctoral thesis, the data obtained from the study were analyzed retrospectively. On each farm, 15 animals were sampled and assigned to the following groups depending on the age of the proband: “calf”, “heifers”, “cows in 1 st lactation” and “cows in the 2 nd and higher lactation”. Four or five cattle, so called “indicator animals”, were selected on each farm that resembled clinical symptoms which have been reported with respect to Chlamydia infections in the literature, in the past. From the 225 cattle 2049 samples were collected in total. Of these samples 801 were tested for Chlamydia specific DNA sequences by PCR. Swabs were obtained from the conjunctivae as well as the nasal and vaginal mucous membranes. In case of lactating animals additional milk samples were examined for the presence of Chlamydia specific DNA. Attempts were undertaken to cultivate the organism in twelve animals, among these eleven with positive PCR results. 222 paired serum samples were examined for the presence of antibodies directed against Chlamydia antigen by ELISA technique. The PCR results demonstrated Chlamydia specific DNA sequences in material obtained from animals of all 15 farms. The herd prevalence, defined as at least one positive PCR detection per animal, ranged from one animal (6. 7 %) to 15 animals (100 %). The prevalence of all investigated 225 cattle was 45. 8 % (103 animals). Of the latter 103 animals 37 % tested positive in more than one sample. The highest recovery rate was obtained in nasal swabs (23. 6 %), followed by vaginal swabs (20. 4 %), swabs from the conjunctivae (18. 7 %) and milk samples (13. 1 %). There is only a slight difference in the proportion of animals with more than one positive result as all sets showed between 57 and 60 % positive results. This is in contradiction with an above-average contamination of a particular sampling site, such as the vaginal swabs. The significantly higher rate of Chlamydia-specific DNA in vaginal swabs in calves compared to adult cattle suggests an independent infection route without sexual <b>contact.</b> <b>Indicator</b> animals revealed a prevalence of Chlamydia specific DNA of 29. 7 %, whereas the prevalence of the total collective of age groups was higher (48. 2 %), the difference being not seen as statistically significant. In fact, the only significant lower rate in the positive results was identified in the nose swabs of the indicator animals when compared to the age group collective. 13 attempts were undertaken to cultivate the pathogen resulting in detection of Cp. pecorum in 8 animals (9 samples). 93 samples (42 %) were tested positive for antibodies in either of two samplings taking place in a three week interval, whilst 80 samples (36 %) remained negative. In the first ELISA test, the seroprevalence was 46 % (103), in the second ELISA test it was 51 % (114). The prevalence of antibody positive sera from the sampled animals ranged between 13 and 80 % on the different farms. On one farm seroconversion took place {{in the course of the}} observation period possibly due to an infection during the observation period. As expected significantly fewer samples tested positive for antibodies in the younger animals than in adults. The increase in the number of antibody positive samples with age was statistically significant in the groups of clinically healthy animals but not for the indicator animals. Comparing ELISA and PCR results in the different age groups demonstrated the following characteristics: in calves the number of animals testing positive by PCR exceeded the seropositives by 16, 7 % (p< 0. 01) whereas in adult animals a consistent increase in the number of seropositive animals with age (45, 8 %) versus PCR positive animals was observed. This finding supports the assumption that new chlamydia infections mainly take place among young stock. The findings of the present study reflect the data given in recent reports of chlamydiosis on farms with health problems in dairy cattle. The prevalence of Chlamydia- specific antibodies and DNA sequences was high on most of the farms included in the study, such that it was not possible to relate operational and environmental characteristics. The observations on farms selected for health problems were in accordance with findings of KEMMERLING et al (2009) in randomly selected farms. When comparing the farm sizes in this study with the average farm size from KEMMERLING et al. (2009), a trend emerge showing that larger herds are more prone to chlamydia infections than smaller herds. The data from the milk recordings also confirmed the findings of KEMMERLING et al. (2009), in particular, the annual milk yield and the number of lactations per year being significantly lower on farms that tested positive for Chlamydia. In conclusion, Chlamydia specific DNA and antibodies were detected on farms in NRW that were selected by the animal health service NRW due to animal health problems of unknown origin. No evidence could be demonstrated for the relationship between health problems in humans and animals and the presence of Chlamydia. As chlamydiosis has been reported to be a multifactorial disease, the improvements of farm management and housing conditions should get more attention on affected farms...|$|E

40|$|The {{injection}} of indicators {{in the blood}} stream is used for several diagnostic measure ments of the cardiovascular system functionality. An indicator is a non-toxic substance that can be detected by a specific sensor. The detection often implies a <b>contact</b> between <b>indicator</b> and sensor. As a result, the measurement is invasive, i. e. a catheter must be inserted through the {{blood vessels in the}} measurement site. The invasiveness issue can be overcome by means of contrast imaging techniques. Contrast agents are substances that enhance the signal detected by specific imaging modalities. The measurement of the contrast (or indicator) concentration versus time results in an indicator dilution curve. Several hemodynamic models can be adopted for the curve interpretation and for the estimation of the cardiovascular parameters of interest. This chapter provides an overview on the indicator dilution theory and the clinical techniques that can be adopted for the measurement of dilution curves. Both invasive and minimally invasive techniques are discussed. Particular attention is dedicated to the use of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. These methods promise to open new possibilities for minimally invasive cardiovascular diagnostics based on indicator dilution...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the performance indicators for critical INR results. Methods: This is a clinical audit conducted at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi from February to September 2010. Samples were received in the laboratory in 3. 2 % Na citrate tubes and PT/INR was performed (Sysmex ® 1500, Innovin with ISI of 1. 02). Critical value of INR was defined as more than 5. 0. All critical INRs were rechecked and if the value remained unchanged, the patient was contacted and an in house questionnaire was filled. All patients irrespective of age and gender with critical INR were included. Exclusion criterion was defined as those patients who could not be <b>contacted.</b> Performance <b>indicators</b> were also identified. Results: Total INR values that were reported are 36861. Out of these, 287 (0. 77 %) had INR above 5. 0 (or 7 / 1000 tests). There were 211 evaluable patients out of which 81 (38. 4 %) were males and 130 (61. 6 %) were females. Majority of the patients were between the ages of 60 to 80 years. Warfarin intake accounted for critical INR in 94. 3 % patients and valvuloplasty was the commonest indication (48 %). Only 7 % had bleeding on Warfarin therapy while majority (84 %) had no adverse effects. Conclusions: Critical INR should be communicated at priority basis. Performance indicators should be monitored quarterly. Females, older age group and patients with valvuloplasty are at higher risk of developing critical INR.

Methods: Data were drawn from four waves of the Northern Swedish Cohort Study, response rate 94. 3 %, N= 1001. Outcome variables were internalising and functional somatic symptoms at the ages of 21, 30 and 42. Relationship variables at age 16 were poor parental <b>contact</b> and three <b>indicators</b> of poor peer relationships. Associations were assessed in multivariate ordinal logistic regressions with adjustment for confounders and baseline health. Results: Results show that the main relationships-related predictors of adult internalising symptoms were self-rated poor peer relationships in terms of spending time alone during after-school hours and poor parental relationship. Functional somatic symptoms on the other hand were most strongly associated with poor parental contact and not being happy with classmates at age 16.

40|$|Meeting the {{challenge}} of tuberculosis (TB) elimination will require adopting new models of delivering patient-centered care customized to diverse settings and contexts. In areas of low incidence with cases spread out across jurisdictions and large geographic areas, a "virtual" model is attractive. However, whether "virtual" clinics and telemedicine deliver the same outcomes as face-to-face encounters in general and within the sphere of public health in particular, is unknown. This evidence is generated here by analyzing outcomes between the "virtual" and "outpatient" public health TB clinics in Alberta, a province of Western Canada with a large geographic area and relatively small population. In response to {{the challenge}} of delivering equitable TB services over long distances and to hard to reach communities, Alberta established three public health clinics for the delivery of its program: two outpatient serving major metropolitan areas, and one virtual serving mainly rural areas. The virtual clinic receives paper-based or electronic referrals and generates directives which are acted upon by local providers. Clinics are staffed by dedicated public health nurses and university-based TB physicians. Performance of the two types of clinics is compared between the years 2008 and 2012 using 16 case management and treatment outcome <b>indicators</b> and 12 <b>contact</b> management <b>indicators.</b> In the outpatient and virtual clinics, respectively, 691 and 150 cases and their contacts were managed.

Outpatient and virtual public health TB clinics perform equally well.

40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the critical}} conditions for detachment of an isolated, wall-bound pendant emulsion droplet acted upon by surface tension and wall-normal buoyancy forces alone. To that end, {{we present a}} simple extension of a diffuse interface model for partially miscible binary mixtures that was previously employed for simulating several two-phase flow phenomena far and near the critical point ["Phase-Field Approach to Multiphase Flow Modeling," Milan J. Math. 79, 597 (2011) ] to allow for static contact angles other than 90 °. Initially, we show that a formulation of the Cahn boundary condition based on a linear interpolation of surface tensions between the wall and each phase at equilibrium can be readily implemented in our numerical procedures by introducing a <b>contact</b> line <b>indicator</b> function and changes to our numerical algorithm that include an iterative method of enforcing inhomogeneous boundary conditions within a semi-implicit temporal scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Subsequently, the classical formulation of the Cahn boundary condition as first proposed by Jacqmin ["Contact-line dynamics of a diffuse fluid interface," J. Fluid Mech. 402, 57 (2000) ], which accommodates a cubic (Hermite) interpolation of surface tensions between the wall and each phase at equilibrium, has also been incorporated into our numerical code. We show that the resulting phase-field models can be successfully employed for simulating three-phase contact line problems in stable emulsions with nearly immiscible components. We also show the first numerical determination of critical Bond numbers {{as a function of}} static contact angle by phase-field simulation. In addition, results of 3 D simulations are compared to critical Bond numbers from a static stability analysis based on a numerical integration of the Young-Laplace equation. We argue that the discrepancy between our numerically determined static contact angle dependence of the critical Bond number and its sharp-interface counterpart is mainly due to the inability of the sharp interface analysis to describe the necking regime of drop detachment, where a sharpening of concentration gradients in the necking region produces an effective increase in (dynamic) surface tension, ultimately leading to a reduced tendency to detachment or an increase in the critical Bond number...|$|R

Compared to common IEC 61215 module tests such as damp heat or thermal cycling it is relatively fast (< 90 h), {{does not require the}} lamination of a module and allows ribbon peel testing and metallographic analysis after the test. We study the mechanical and chemical solder joint properties after isothermal cell testing compared to thermal cycling and damp heat exposure of mini-modules. In this study solder joints of encapsulated Multi-Busbar (MBB) solar cells, which provide a multitude of single joints, are investigated after accelerated ageing tests. A special demountable one-cell-module setup enables chemical and mechanical characterization of solder joints after damp heat and thermal cycling tests.

40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{community}} health service system is now established in China, the utilisation of {{the community}} health service institutions is low {{due to the lack}} of a gate-keeping role of the primary health service providers and referrals among the three-tiered health service institutions. In addition to this, patients who can afford to pay, often seek best services in big hospitals to guarantee the quality of care. Thus, the need of guiding the patients to the community health services and increasing the utilisation {{of the community}} health service institutions is becoming an urgent problem, which hinders the future development of community health services. This study focuses on the question of how to increase the utilisation of Chinese community health centres (HCs). Methods A cross-sectional Base-line Survey of Chinese City Community Health Service System Building using the multi-staged cluster sampling was conducted to collect data from all HCs in 28 key <b>contact</b> cities. Relevant <b>indicators</b> of totally 1790 HCs were analysed. The statistical methods included ANONVA and logistic regression. Results and Conclusions The analysis suggested several key factors for increasing the outpatient workload (OW) at the HCs: establishing an adequate referral system among the different levels of the health system; enhancing the qualification of health personnel and increasing the compensation by the health insurance for services provided at HCs. Other key factors with a positive effect on the OW included: the government ownership of the HCs, the scale of the institutions, the medical equipment used, the mix of health services provided, and the women in childbearing age in the residence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sport-related {{concussion}} affects between 1. 6 and 3. 8 {{million people}} annually. Incidence of concussion {{in the population}} of collegiate athletes is a public health issue because there are {{nearly half a million}} student-athletes at risk every year and physiological effects have the potential to be lifelong and severe in nature. To combat incidence and severity of concussion in college athletes, the CDC and NCAA have partnered to promote education about concussion and implementation of a concussion protocol. At the University of Pittsburgh, this protocol includes a baseline ImPACT test for each incoming student-athlete for the purpose of tracking recovery and facilitating “return to play” decisions following incidence of a concussion. This study explores the utility of the baseline ImPACT test scores in determining risk for concussion. Computerized neurocognitive assessments are developed for post-injury purposes. The analysis in this study uses the ImPACT test scores in a novel way, pre-injury, and examines novel risk factors for concussion, e. g., the composite scores, which were hypothesized to affect incidence through an effect on athletic performance. Two independent survival analyses were performed: case-wise deletion and multiple imputation by chained equations. Because the data were determined to have MAR missingness, multiple imputation models were adopted in lieu of case-wise deletion models to ensure unbiased parameter estimates. Two independent models were created: male and female. The model for female athletes included the history <b>indicator</b> and <b>contact</b> expected by sport variables. The model for male athletes included the history <b>indicator,</b> <b>contact</b> expected, processing speed composite score, and height variables. Although these results cannot be generalized with certainty, {{the results of this study}} provide an exploratory analysis of the utility of computerized neurocognitive assessments in determining risk for concussion. Four of the six composite scores (visual memory, processing speed, reaction time, and total symptom) were univariably significant (a= 0. 20) for male athletes.

These analyses were conducted in anaerobic mesophilic and thermophilic lab-scale fermenters and in a pasteurising container (70 - 90 °C). The aim was to identify an indicator organism that can be detected quickly and inexpensively by conventional techniques, and which is also highly thermoresistant and has epidemiological relevance. In thermophilic lab-scale fermenters (55 °C), the tenacity of Salmonella Senftenberg W 775, Ascaris suum, Campylobacter jejuni, ‘wild type’ coliphage, as well as coliphage T 1, and Enterococcus faecalis was investigated. Whereas Salmonella Senftenberg W 775, Ascaris suum, and Campylobacter jejuni could be inactivated within 3 hours, Enterococcus faecalis survived for more than 3 hours, and a wild type coliphage could be detected even after more than 24 hours. Tenacity experiments in mesophilic lab-scale fermenters (35 °C) showed no inactivation {{of any of the}} test organisms within 24 hours. Heating to temperatures between 70 - 90 °C showed that both Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis and Ascaris suum were eliminated within 30 minutes at 70 °C. Enterococcus faecalis, wilde type coliphage, and Salmonellae could not be detected after 1 hour of incubation at 70 °C. The coliphage T 1 could be eliminated only after 90 minutes at 70 °C. For the most part, these results were confirmed by investigations in operating fermentation plants, with the exception that, under practice conditions, wild type coliphage as well as coliphage T 1 need to be pasteurised for 1 hour at 70 °C to be inactivated. The thermophilic fermentation alone (52 – 55 °C) is not enough to inactivate coliphage T 1 within 24 hours. Coliphage T 1 presents a test organism that, with regard to its thermoresistance, should be placed above Salmonella Senftenberg W 775 and Enterococcus faecalis. Its handling is unproblematic and results can be obtained within a day. Its use as a ‘test organism’ should be discussed, especially in relation to the regulation (EC) no. 1774 / 2002 (ANONYM, 2002), for usage of category III material, whereby further research is needed in this context. In order to obtain a product, which is safe with regard to health risks, it is suggested to choose the following temperature/ time combinations for direct process control in anaerobic fermenters: -Thermophilic fermenters: 55 °C/ 22 - 24 hours -Pasteurising: 70 C/ 1 hour. However, if the coliphage T 1 will become relevant as a test organism in the future, the present results show that heating to 70 °C/ 2 hours or 80 °C/ 1 hour are required. The thermophilic processes at 55 °C and an assured retention time of 22 - 24 hours are not sufficient to eliminate coliphage T 1. With regard to thermophilic wet fermentation processes without pre- or post heating steps, which do not warrant plug flow, it is absolutely necessary to obtain data for the exact retention times (minimum retention time) of substrate particles or the liquid phase. Establishing the exact retention time of particles in a thermophilic fermentation plant offers the possibility to limit the <b>contact</b> times of <b>indicator</b> organisms to predetermined retention times of a particular fermenter during the conduct of direct process monitoring. The strict demand of the required incubation times during process monitoring of 22 - 24 hours could thus be shortened. A Bacillus globigii spore suspension was used as a biological tracer because it could previously be shown in lab-scale fermenters that this thermoresistant bacterium, which is not present in the natural flora of substrates used in anaerobic fermenters, can be optimally mixed with infeed materials, and the influences of processes in anaerobic fermenters are unable to eliminate Bacillus globigii. The use of a Bacillus globigii spore suspension was investigated in 3 selected treatment plants. Its value as a biological tracer to determine absolute retention times was, amongst other things, also seen in a large communal anaerobic fermentation plant (> 3. 000 m 3), as well as in a mixing drum for drying sewage sludge. In addition to the ‘direct process control’, the substrate from the different biogas plants, was examined for its Salmonella, enterococci and total and faecal coliforms content before and after the thermal treatment. The purpose of these assays was to ensure the efficiency of the process used in the biogas plants. According to the results of this study, thermophilic anaerobic digestion ensures better inactivation of microorganisms than anarerobic digestion at mesophilic temperatures. However, the complete inactivation of microorganisms was not possible without additional pasteurisation. It is advisable to still call for the so-called ‘direct process control’ even under an amended bio-waste regulation (BioAbfV). For it provides a definite indication that the processes in a particular plant, with its given technical set-up by using defined substrates, are principally able to yield a hygienically risk-free end product. This study was carried out in 2002. According to Regulation (EC) No. 2008 / 2006 (Anonymus, 2006 a) from February 2006, the validation of biotechnological processes in composting and biogas plants must to be carried out using two test organisms: Salmonella Senftenberg H 2 S negative and Enterococcus faecalis...|$|R
