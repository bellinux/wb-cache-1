40|$|Plant {{processes}} affect fluxes of energy, {{moisture and}} CO 2 between {{the land and}} the atmosphere. Land surface models need to correctly represent the vegetation functioning and its response to environmental conditions. Due to anthropogenic carbon emissions rising, and global warming, plant processes are being affected and in turn modulate the terrestrial carbon sink. However, models still disagree on the response of plants to changing conditions. This work analyses how vegetation is treated in two land surface models: the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) and Carbon Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CTESSEL). The aim is to analyse how environmental variables control the vegetation processes at daily and seasonal timescales at present day climate and the changes that arise in a scenario of double atmospheric CO 2 and higher temperature. The analyses are carried out at the leaf level and at the canopy level. To investigate the responses at the leaf level, the photosynthesis scheme used in each model was extracted, thereby providing a submodel that can be run in stand alone mode. The photosynthesis submodel provides a means to analyse the leaf level response of each photosynthesis model to environment variables as well as the internal model parameters that characterise each plant type. In JULES the environmental controls on photosynthesis are explicitly introduced by three limiting regimes: light, rubisco (carbon) or <b>export</b> <b>limiting</b> regime. In CTESSEL the carbon and light limitations are implicitly represented but there is no export limitation. Due to the lack of <b>export</b> <b>limiting</b> regime, CTESSEL presents higher sensitivity to CO 2 concentration resulting in a stronger CO 2 fertilization effect. The carbon and energy fluxes produced by the full land surface models were tested and compared at 10 European FLUXNET sites. The main differences between modellled carbon fluxes were found to be the treatment of soil moisture stress and the lack of <b>export</b> <b>limiting</b> regime in CTESSEL. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in models is the result of model parameters’ dependence on temperature and the combination of limiting regimes. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis was found to be a determining element in the strength and sign of the vegetation modelled feedback to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Argentinean export {{growth was}} {{impressive}} {{during the recent}} economic boom (2003 - 2007). However, decomposing export growth reveals that the extensive margin (increases in exports of existing products to existing markets) dominates, while the intensive margin (increases in exports of new products or new markets) contributes little to export growth. Argentina's trade product concentration has increased in the past 10 years, and the main export products remain overwhelmingly natural-resource intensive. The little diversification of non-primary <b>exports</b> <b>limits</b> the country’s ability to weather a decline in export commodity prices. The country has had some success finding new export markets, especially in Latin America, but should seek to develop deeper trade relationships with high GDP export destinations such as the European Union and the United States. Another challenge going forward is the relatively low sophistication of <b>exports</b> and <b>limited</b> integration into the global production chains, falling behind regional competitors such as Brazil.
