40|$|Robotic {{vehicles}} and especially autonomous robotic vehicles can be attractive targets for attacks that cross the cyber-physical divide, that is cyber attacks or sensory channel attacks affecting {{the ability to}} navigate or complete a mission. Detection of such threats is typically limited to knowledge-based and vehicle-specific methods, which are applicable to only specific known attacks, or methods that require computation power that is prohibitive for resource-constrained vehicles. Here, we present a method based on Bayesian Networks that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>tell</b> whether an autonomous vehicle is under attack, but also whether the attack has originated from the cyber or the physical domain. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on an autonomous robotic vehicle built {{in accordance with the}} Generic Vehicle Architecture specification and equipped with a variety of popular communication and sensing technologies. The results of experiments involving command injection, rogue node and magnetic interference attacks show that the approach is promising...|$|R
40|$|Reputation based and credit-exchange based {{approaches}} {{have been studied}} extensively to enforce cooperation among non-cooperative nodes in wireless ad hoc networks. Most of the existing solutions are fundamentally context-based ones, which need to accurately identify selfish behaviors, securely maintain the context, and appropriately punish the selfish nodes. These requirements are extremely difficult to satisfy if not impossible. From a completely new angle, this paper proposes a context-free protocol, COFFE, to enforce cooperation among selfish nodes, which {{has the ability to}} transmit a packet over the path successfully without the dependency on the information of other packets' transmission. Considering that every node in the network is rational, during the packet forwarding stage, if the intermediate nodes <b>can</b> <b>not</b> clearly <b>tell</b> whether the packet is destined to them or <b>not,</b> they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> simply drop the packet. Thus, in our proposed COFFEE protocol, through introducing several techniques, for any packet received by any node, the node thinks the packet could be destined to it and forwards the packet to find out the answer. Detailed analysis and performance evaluation have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol...|$|R

60|$|On {{the third}} day a change came over us. We relinquished bathing, the {{exertion}} taxing us too much. Sullenly we laid ourselves down; turned our backs to each other; and were impatient of the slightest casual touch of our persons.

I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> {{what it was that}} came over me, but I wished I was alone. I felt that so long as the calm lasted, we were without help; that neither could assist the other; and above all, that for one, the water would hold out longer than for two. I felt no remorse, not the slightest, for these thoughts. It was instinct. Like a desperado giving up the ghost, I desired to gasp by myself.|$|E
