40|$|<b>Chlordimeform</b> is a {{relatively}} new acaricide/insecticide, whose mode of action we have investigated. It appears to interfere with amine-mediated control of nervous and endocrine systems in a variety of ways. Specifically, <b>chlordimeform</b> causes a build-up of the amines 5 -hydroxytryptamine {{and to a lesser extent}} norepinephrine in the rat brain in vivo, antagonizes the in vivo action of reserpine in the rat (reserpine depletes amine stores in the CNS), inhibits monoamine oxidase from rat liver in vitro, and causes hypotension in rabbits. In the American cockroach it directly stimulates the heart in situ, acts synergistically with tryptamine in vivo, inhibits amine-N-acetyltransferase from cockroach head in vitro, causes accumulation of indolamines in cockroaches in vivo, and blocks the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by octopamine in the cockroach CNS in situ. It also inhibits tryptamine metabolism in whole mites in vitro. <b>Chlordimeform</b> is a very unusual pesticide from several standpoints. First, its effectiveness against insect and acarine pests in the field does not always come from its direct killing action. For instance, <b>chlordimeform</b> causes marked excitation in adult rice stem borers which results in abnormal egg-laying behavior. In the young larvae, <b>chlordimeform</b> causes different types of behavioral changes which may be collectively described as general sedation. Here the larvae are inactive and therefore do not find proper sites for boring. Affected larvae often do not drill holes into the stem, and, even if they enter the stem, seldom eat. <b>Chlordimeform</b> also has some repellent action, and hence some larvae have been observed to move away from the normal food source. Second, <b>chlordimeform</b> exhibits a remarkable selectivity to a few groups of arthropods, namely to lepidopterous insects and acarine species. Even within the lepidopterous insects its effectiveness is often confined to mature eggs, young larvae, and in limited instances to adults. Such a selectivity pattern has never been observed in other classes of insecticides-acaricides. Third, <b>chlordimeform</b> pauses very different symptoms i...|$|E

40|$|Adsorption of Cu and the {{cationic}} herbicide <b>chlordimeform</b> {{was carried}} out on two acidic soils (S- 48 and LM). <b>Chlordimeform</b> adsorption occurred by cationic exchange and was higher on LM soil due to its higher CEC, partly associated {{to the presence of}} vermiculite. Cu adsorption was also higher on LM soil and was related to its higher iron and manganese oxides content. The presence of the herbicide in solution always decreased Cu adsorption on S- 48 soil, but on LM soil the amount of Cu adsorbed only decreased at the highest concentrations used. This together with the lower amounts of Cu desorbed from LM soil after five successive desorptions in comparison to S- 48 soil, indicates that Cu was being mostly adsorbed on oxides which exhibit a very high affinity for the heavy metal. The maximal amount of Cu desorbed on both soils only reached up to 13 % of the amount adsorbed. <b>Chlordimeform</b> adsorption decreased in the presence of Cu {{as a result of its}} competition for the adsorption sites on both soils. Cu competition on LM soil was not so strong as on S- 48 soil due to the higher adsorption of the heavy metal on oxides, for which the herbicide's affinity is not so high.

The adsorption of Zn decreases when the <b>chlordimeform</b> concentration increases in both simultaneous and successive adsorptions, following the sequence: chlordimeform-free solutions> successive> simultaneous. In the adsorption of Cd the sequence is different: successive> chlordimeform-free solutions> simultaneous, indicating that a small amount of pesticide adsorbed favours Cd adsorption. In all cases, the apparent affinity of the metal for adsorption on montmorillonite, on the basis of distribution coefficients, Ko, is higher for lower metal surface coverage, and decreases largely with the amount of the metal adsorbed. This indicates the existence of high affinity sites on the clay, probably those of variable charge edge regions.

40|$|The {{formamidine}} pesticide <b>chlordimeform</b> (N 2 ̆ 7 -(4 -chloro-o-tolyl) -N,N-dimethylformamidine) shows moderate {{acute toxicity}} to mammals. The N-demethylation of <b>chlordimeform</b> (CDM) yields metabolites of increasing acute toxicity, but of lower {{chemical and biological}} stability. Symptoms exhibited by mice poisoned with lethal doses of CDM or one of these formamidine metabolities are similarly excitatory in nature. Surviving animals subsequently show the prolonged depressed behavior typical of the non-formamidine metabolites of CDM. ^ Pretreatment of mice with hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) inducers such as phenobarbital or inhibitors such as SKF 525 -A or piperonyl butoxide, although having predictable effects on the rate of N-demethylation of CDM in vitro, did not affect its lethality to mice. Other MFO inducers such as Aroclor 1254 and 3 -methylcholanthrene significantly decreased the lethality of CDM, although they increased the rate of N-demethylation. The same trends were observed with N-demethylchlordimeform (DCDM) and N,N-didemethylchlordimeform (DDCDM). ^ Studies of the tissue levels of CDM and its metabolites in mice after pretreatments affecting MFO activity (phenobarbital, 3 -methyl-cholanthrene, and piperonyl butoxide) indicated that the best correlation {{to account for the}} resulting variations in the toxicity of CDM is with the level of total formamidines (CDM, DCDM, and DDCDM) in the brain. It is therefore concluded that although the successive N-demethylations of CDM are potential activation steps, they are not obligatory for the overall toxicity of CDM. However, the N-demethylated metabolites probably do contribute importantly to the overall toxicity. The protective action of Aroclor 1254 and 3 -methylcholanthrene was mainly due to an induced increase in the rate of formamidine cleavage to N-formyl- 4 -chloro-o-toluidine (NFT), a metabolite of low acute toxicity produced from all three formamidines. ^ In order to examine the metabolic basis for the carcinogenic activity of the formamidine pesticides, <b>chlordimeform</b> and amitraz (1, 5 -di-(2, 4 -dimethylphenyl) - 3 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazapenta- 1, 4 -diene), the behavior of these formamidines and some of their common metabolites was investigated in Ames Salmonella mutagenecity assay. The only positive responses were shown by the bacterial tester strains TA 98 and TA 100 with 4 -chloro-o-toluidine and 2, 4 -dimethylaniline, the aniline metabolites of <b>chlordimeform</b> and amitraz respectively. Metabolic activation by liver homogenates was essential for this response. Although both rat and mouse liver homogenates were capable of activating the promutagenic anilines, rat liver had greater activity. ^ When other selected mono- and disubstituted anilines were tested on strain TA 100, it was found that ortho-para disbustitution with a methyl group in the ortho position favored mutagenic activity. Unfortunately, it is precisely this substitution pattern which favors pesticidal activity. Thus {{it may be difficult to}} develop pesticidal formamidines which are not potential mutagens and carcinogens through metabolic release of their parent anilines. ...|$|E

Their biological activity and uses are defined by their toxicity to spider mites, ticks, and certain insects, and they are particularly effective against juvenile and resistant forms of these organisms.
