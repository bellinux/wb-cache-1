40|$|In {{this brief}} overview, the world {{consumption}} of primary energy [...] oil, gas, coal, hydro and nuclear [...] is summarized in a Table {{based on the}} 2002 data of British Petrol, which provides basic data on a year-by-year basis. The Table comprises the above-cited <b>commercially</b> <b>traded</b> <b>fuels</b> only, excluding other fuel sources such as solar, wind, wood, peat or animal waste, which are important fuel sources in many countries, but are unreliably documented in terms of consumption statistics. The most recent developments are mentioned {{in the application of}} the challenging fuel of the future- hydrogen. In the Figure the "energy units "- eV, Joules, kilocalories, Watt-hours, tons of TNT, and mass of meter converted to energy by E = MC 2 - are displayed in logarithmic scale and the most important conversion factors are also illustrated. 2002 in review World consumption of primary energy increased by 2. 6 % in 2002, well ahead of the 10 -year growth trend of 1. 4 % per annum. Reported growth in energy demand of almost 20 % in China was behind much of this relative strength: energy consumption in the world, excluding China, grew by less than 1 % during the year, reflecting a second year of below-trend economic growth...|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the lumber {{industry}} in the United States spans from the precolonial period of British timber speculation, subsequent British colonization, and American development into the twenty-first century. Following the near eradication of domestic timber on the British Isles, the abundance of old-growth forests in the New World posed an attractive alternative to importing choice timber from the Baltic via the narrow straits and channels between Denmark and Sweden. The easily available timber proved an incredible resource to early settlers, with both domestic consumption and overseas <b>trade</b> <b>fueling</b> demand.

5000|$|In the Andes, altitude, {{scarcity}} of flat land, and climatic uncertainty were major factors influencing farmers. The Incas, the local {{leaders of the}} ayllus and the individual farmers decreased their risk of poor crop years {{with a variety of}} measures. The vertical archipelago was a characteristic of Andean and Incan agriculture. Different crops could only be grown in the climates associated with certain altitudes and thus the empire diversified its agricultural production by establishing colonies and reciprocity with populations living at different, usually lower, altitudes than the Inca heartland. Also, land allocated to local authorities, the ayllus, was often not contiguous, but rather scattered at different elevations and climates to produce different products. The exchange of products among the scattered lands was carried out on a reciprocal basis rather than being <b>commercially</b> <b>traded.</b>|$|R
