5000|$|Grande Année (vintage): When Bollinger {{believes}} there is an exceptional harvest, they will produce their prestige Champagne Grande Année ("great vintage") designed to express {{the character of the}} vintage. The house will select the best wines, cru by cru, to produce Grande Année. This Champagne is also available as a Rosé.

50|$|The {{crown cork}} (also {{known as a}} <b>crown</b> <b>seal,</b> crown cap or just a cap), the first form of bottle cap, was invented by William Painter in 1892 in Baltimore. The company making it was {{originally}} called the Bottle Seal Company, but it changed its name with the almost immediate success of the crown cork to the Crown Cork and Seal Company. It still informally goes by that name, but is officially Crown Holdings. Crown corks {{are similar to the}} Pilfer proof caps, as usage of both products is to seal the bottle.|$|E

5000|$|Bottled beer is sold {{with several}} types of bottle cap, but most often with crown caps, also known as <b>crown</b> <b>seals.</b> Some beers (for example Grolsch) are sold in [...] "beugel" [...] style bottles, known as [...] "flip-top" [...] or [...] "swing top" [...] in some English {{speaking}} countries. A number of beers are sold finished with a cork and muselet (or cage), similar to champagne closures. These closures were largely superseded by the crown cap {{at the end of}} the 19th century, but survive in premium markets. Many larger beers, including most forties and some growlers, use screw caps due to their resealing design.|$|R
50|$|The 1999-2000 Premier Soccer League, {{known as}} the 1999-2000 Castle Premiership for {{sponsorship}} purposes, was the fourth season of the Premier Soccer League since its establishment in 1996. The season began on 30 July 1999 and ended on 4 June 1999. Mamelodi Sundowns once again managed to secure their <b>crown,</b> <b>sealing</b> their third successive PSL title. Along with their success in the PSL's predecessor - winning three National Soccer League titles in 1988, 1990 and 1993 - this gave Mamelodi Sundowns their 6th South African championship. Sundowns tallied 75 points for the season, equalling the points record they jointly set with Kaizer Chiefs last season, but unlike the previous season in which the title was decided by goal difference, there was no close title race this season as Sundowns finished comfortably ahead of second placed Orlando Pirates with an 11-point margin.|$|R

50|$|In 1568, Carew {{embarked}} on his greatest adventure, when he laid claim to {{lands in the}} south of Ireland. He had sent ancient documents for examination by John Hooker, who became convinced - after travelling to Ireland - that the documents established Carew's hereditary entitlement to extensive properties in that country. Henry II of England (the first Lord of Ireland, a title assumed in 1172 {{at the beginning of the}} Cambro-Norman conquest) had granted half the lordship of Cork to Robert FitzStephen, and Hooker believed that Fitz-Stephen's daughter had married a Carew ancestor. Carew's claim existed by letter of the law contained in antique parchment under <b>crown</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
50|$|R.D. (vintage): This blend is {{a logical}} {{extension}} of the Grand Année blend, taken further by extending the aging on lees. R.D. spends eight years on its lees, and is also, like the Grand Année, aged under cork, not <b>crown</b> <b>seal.</b> R.D. is a registered trademark of Bollinger which stands for récemment dégorgé ("recently disgorged"). In the mid-1990s, Bollinger sold Année Rare which was an R.D. that had gone under even longer aging on the lees. The disgorgement date is given on the back label. Michael Broadbent has noted that there is variation between R.D. Champagnes {{of the same year}} with different disgorgement dates. The 1981 R.D. is unique in that there was no Grande Année produced from that vintage.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, the {{beverage}} insulator {{is called a}} [...] "stubby holder" [...] because local beer was traditionally sold in 375 mL bottles colloquially known as [...] "stubbies" [...] due to their short, squat appearance {{in comparison to the}} alternative packaging of 750 mL bottles ("king brown", [...] "tallie", or simply [...] "bottle"), and the 300 to 375 mL longneck bottles commonly used for beer imported from North America and Europe. Most Australian domestic beers have now adopted longneck bottles and/or aluminium cans ("tinnies") for their 375 mL packaging, and 750 mL bottles are now sold much less commonly than was the case historically. Victoria Bitter (VB) is notable for continuing to use the traditional stubby, albeit with a twist top replacing the traditional <b>crown</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The speed opener is a {{flat blade}} of steel {{approximately}} 4 cm wide and 16 cm long with a thumb hole {{at one end}} and a letterbox cut at the other to remove the <b>crown</b> <b>seals</b> from a bottle. They go under the names 'Speed Opener', 'Popper', 'Mamba', and most popularly 'Bar Blade'. The thumb hole may be used to pull bottles out of ice, by placing the hole over bottle neck, then lifting it. The speed opener is widely used by professional bartenders in Canada, the United States, and the UK. Carried in the pocket or against the body or on a zip string, it is both convenient and fast for the modern bartender. It is advantageous in that it is easy to open several bottles in rapid succession, and with more flair than other types of bottle opener. Consequently, 'bar blading' is often part of bar flair routines.|$|R
40|$|We present new {{observations}} from an experimental {{investigation of the}} classical problem of the <b>crown</b> splash and <b>sealing</b> phenomena observed during the impact of spheres onto quiescent liquid pools. In the experiments, a 6 m tall vacuum chamber was used to provide the required ambient conditions from atmospheric pressure down to of an atmosphere, whilst high-speed videography was exploited to focus primarily on the above-surface crown formation and ensuing dynamics, paying {{particular attention to the}} moments just prior to the surface seal. In doing so, we have observed a buckling-type azimuthal instability of the crown. This instability is characterised by vertical striations along the crown, between which thin films form that are more susceptible to the air flow and thus are drawn into the closing cavity, where they atomize to form a fine spray within the cavity. To elucidate to the primary mechanisms and forces at play, we varied the sphere diameter, liquid properties and ambient pressure. Furthermore, a comparison between the entry of room-temperature spheres, where the contact line pins around the equator, and Leidenfrost spheres (i. e. an immersed superheated sphere encompassed by a vapour layer), where there is no contact line, indicates that the buckling instability appears in all <b>crown</b> <b>sealing</b> events, but is intensified by the presence of a pinned contact line. © 2016 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with their}} competitors, Ladds used {{many kinds of}} bottles over the years, {{including}} various [...] "stonie" [...] pottery bottles, and in glass the Codd pattern (with the internal glass ball seal), Barrett or Riley pattern (with a Vulcanite [...] "screw-top" [...] threaded stopper) in the 26 imp fl oz bottle and, from around 1930, <b>crown</b> <b>seal</b> types. Bottles remained {{the property of the}} drink manufacturer, and if undamaged could be steam-cleaned and re-used over and over again. Mrs. Ladd purchased second-hand bottles from dealers ("marine store collectors") and instructed her bottle-washers and fillers to use all bottles, no matter what the brand. This was against the rules of the Aerated Waters and Cordial Makers' Employés' Union, (It was some 20 years before the manufacturers had a similar agreement) and the men refused to do so, and threatened strike action if forced to disobey Union Rules. Mrs. Ladd's motives were financial: she purchased secondhand bottles for 8d. per dozen, whereas new bottles cost 36s. per gross (3s. per dozen). In today's money that would be around $5.00 v. $22.00 per dozen.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} factors, which are {{important}} {{in the evolution of}} wines during aging in bottle. Whilst it is accepted that the interaction of limited amounts of oxygen with bottled wine (via closure ingress) will not benefit white wine, it is widely held that limited amounts of oxygen will benefit robust red wines. As consumer acceptance continues of many different forms of wine bottle closures, the need to better understand the role of oxygen during red wine aging in bottle has become paramount, particularly for red wines intended for long term maturation. We have analysed both still and sparkling red wines held in bottle for up to 20 years to determine how the maturation process evolves with varying amounts of oxygen available to the wine. From this, {{we have been able to}} demonstrate that red wine will continue to mature and develop both with and without additional oxygen being available to the wine. However, increased availability of oxygen greatly increases the rate at which a red wine will mature, and hence shortens the drinking life of the wine. In an anaerobic environment such as a bottle of red wine sealed with a screw cap or <b>crown</b> <b>seal,</b> some wines may develop reductive characteristics. In contrast, bottled red wine stored in a more aerobic environment such as with a synthetic closure, will prematurely develop oxidised characters. 1...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 'new' bottle, Grolsch uses a distinctively shaped bottle for some of its products, known as de beugel or swingtop. Bottles of this type use a flip top cap, {{eliminating the need for}} an opener. The brown domestic bottle contains 450ml, which is over one-third more than the capacity of the average Dutch beer bottle, while the green export bottle is slightly larger, at 467 ml. In 2008, the brewery introduced a slimmer design that is a consistent 450ml for both the domestic market and export. The new bottles can be opened by hand, using a lever {{at the side of the}} bottleneck. The label is applied over the lever in order to make any tampering evident. The top used to be made of porcelain, but is now made of plastic. Bottles with porcelain tops are still in circulation in the Netherlands. They are popular with home brewers, as they are very robust and can easily be sealed by hand without the expense of new <b>crown</b> <b>seals.</b> In North America, however, traditional metal-capped Grolsch bottles are becoming increasingly prevalent.|$|R
60|$|It is now 50 {{years since}} Queen Victoria, my beloved mother, and my August Predecessor {{on the throne}} of these realms, for divers weighty reasons, with the advice and consent of Parliament, took upon herself the {{government}} of the territories theretofore administered by the East India Company. I deem this a fitting anniversary on which to greet the Princes and Peoples of India, in commemoration of the exalted task then solemnly undertaken. Half a century is but a brief span in your long annals, yet this half century that ends to-day will stand amid the floods of your historic ages, a far-shining landmark. The proclamation of the direct supremacy of the <b>Crown</b> <b>sealed</b> the unity of Indian Government and opened a new era.
