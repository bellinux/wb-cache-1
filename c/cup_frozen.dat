50|$|A {{strip mall}} {{that was part}} of the mall {{property}} existed across Forest Ave and was connected with an auto and a pedestrian bridge. The most recent occupants were Chuck E. Cheese's (opened in the 80s, closed 2010, relocated at The Shoppes on IV, opened late 2011), Spa 2 (closed 2005), and ShopRite which left in 1998 when they moved to their current location on Route 4. The former Shop Rite was finally demolished in 2011 with the rest of the building now being renovated. It is confirmed that REI sport store will be located in the building of former Spa 2.. Later, a Red Robin and <b>Cups</b> <b>Frozen</b> Yogurt were built in place of the former Chuck E. Cheeses and Shop Rite sites. However, the <b>Cups</b> <b>Frozen</b> Yogurt location closed in 2015. By 2017, Kirkland's Furniture was added to the strip mall site. Also at the time, a Lowe's Hardware, Miller's Ale House, and 24 Hour Fitness were added just behind the strip mall. In fact, the 24 Hour Fitness was built on the former site of the Paramus Route 4 Tenplex which closed in 2007.|$|R

50|$|Kagoshima {{emerged as}} an artist in Tokyo, Japan in the late 1960s with his Pop-Art {{inspired}} and appropriated sculptures of paint cans and <b>cups,</b> captured in <b>frozen</b> moments of spilling. Upon his arrival in New York in 1976, Kagoshima soon found himself part of the East Village's burgeoning art scene where he began producing hyper-imaginative and erotic paintings borrowing visual elements from Picasso, Klossowski and Baldessari. His paintings, collages and sculptures soon included caricatures as kitsch grew in his art to meet explorations of art history and traditional Japanese culture, expressed through his particular brand of Pop Surrealism.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards {{started as}} a play-by-play {{announcer}} for the University of New Hampshire hockey team. [...] He {{then moved on to}} play-by-play and sports anchor positions at WGIR radio and WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire. During the early 1980s he worked as a talk radio host for WRKO in Boston, and as a weekend anchor at WJAR-TV in Providence. He then moved to a sports reporter position at WCVB-TV in Boston. While at WCVB-TV, Edwards also served as a freelance play by play announcer for ESPN. Among the events he called were the Davis <b>Cup</b> finals and <b>Frozen</b> Four. He also served as a reporter for ABC's coverage of alpine skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics.|$|R
5000|$|Amy Sciarreto of PopCrush {{gave the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars, {{comparing}} the band to Hot Chelle Rae and One Direction and praising the album's [...] "golden melodies and saccharine harmonies". However, Sciarreto said {{the album was}} the equivalent [...] "to a large <b>cup</b> of Pinkberry <b>frozen</b> yogurt", and noted that their [...] "cheesy raps" [...] often fell flat (comparing their rap verses to Karmin), and stated that Emblem3 was [...] "about as edgy as a circle". Brent Faulkner of Starpulse described the album as [...] "mediocre", praising the album's production however criticizing its songwriting and calling the album [...] "inconsistent", however noted that Nothing to Lose showed potential. Faulkner described the album's tracks as [...] "gimmicky" [...] and [...] "annoying", and noted {{the quality of the}} album plummeted during its second half, however complimented Emblem3 for making mostly [...] "catchy" [...] songs that would appeal to the youthful demographic that they were targeting, and stated that the album had decent songs but generally lacked consistency.|$|R
40|$|Traditional cancer {{diagnosis}} {{relies on}} a combination of clinical and histo-pathological data. In many cases, however, the morphology of in particular metastatic cancer is not discriminative enough for correct diagnosis. In addition, the morphology of tumor cells do not provide information on aberrant molecular pathways that may be used to specifically target the tumor like the application of Herceptin to breast cancers with amplification in the ERBB 2 gene. With the completion of the human genome project, molecular pathology has dramatically increased its arsenal of novel molecular biomarkers {{that can be used to}} determine the phenotype of tumors. Gene expression profiling using high-density microarray technology is an extremely powerful tool to comprehensively characterize the tumor phenotype. We have developed TCLASSÂ® a multi-class tumor classifier that interprets gene expression microarray data and allows the identification of the primary site of Cancers of Unknown Promary site (CUP). The classifier is implemented as a web-based tool and is an extremely simple and straightforward approach for molecular characterization of tumor samples. We are currently looking for collaborations with clinicians with access to fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>CUP</b> samples to further validate the tool in a clinical context. Alternatively, CEL files of CUP samples analyzed with Affynetrix 133 Plus 2. 0 arrays can also be directly analyzed using TCLASS. |$|R
