Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively {{in terms of}} <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects,</b> abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore {{seemed to be a}} better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{seroepidemiological study}} (a study {{investigating}} the patterns, <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> {{of a disease}} on a specific population {{on the basis of}} serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A 2013–14 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus. The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV. Another study in Saudi Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of system dynamics approach, in understanding of cause-effect relationship. The experimental design with pre-post test with control group is applied in {{this research}}. In order to assess the sub problems of the study, a valid and reliable “Cause-Effect Relationship Scale” had been developed by the researcher. Collected data were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics, paired and independent t-tests. The scale for “understanding <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship” has two sections. In the first section (causality 1), the interest and attitude of the students towards <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationships are evaluated. In the second section (causality 2) the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship commenting skills of the students in some sample cases are evaluated. In the first section the initial mean values of experimental and control groups are different whereas, their mean scores are equal in the end of the empirical study. As per second section, in the end of the empirical study, it is obvious that <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship skills of the students have been increased after system dynamics application. Statistically there is not a significant difference in <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship oriented of interest and attitude (causality 1) {{of the students in the}} end of empirical study (t= 0. 00; p>. 05). In the classes where system dynamics approach is performed, it is obvious that ideas of the students about <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship did not change. The results gained from causality 2 scale shows that there is an increase in previous and post empirical study in both groups. <b>Cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship is understood better by the students in experimental group, according to mean scores. It can be said that the system dynamic provides benefit of understanding <b>and</b> commenting of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> relationship...|$|R

50|$|According to the Theory of the Pre-existent Effect, {{there is}} no {{annihilation}} of the existence, {{nor is there any}} creation of the non-existent, which means, there cannot be anything new or the destruction of what exists; and that {{there is no}} relation between <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect.</b> With regard to the non-difference of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> the <b>effect</b> the general views are that, a) the difference (negation of non-difference) of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> is the essence (swarupa) of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> the <b>effect,</b> <b>and</b> the non-difference of them is their relation of identity; b) that difference of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> is their essential quality and that their non-difference is the negation of that difference, and c) that both difference and non-difference are essential qualities of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> are equally positive in character and colour. These views lead to the reasoning that non-difference of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> cannot be taken as absolutely different from them, non-difference is not an attribute different from <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> if difference is interpreted as constituting the essential nature of the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect,</b> with non-difference qualifying it as an attribute then a rational conception of the relation between <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> cannot be formed. It is held that the effect before its manifestation remains undifferentiated in the cause, because the causal substance is the substance of the effect as a substance therefore, the effect cannot be different from the cause, it evolves out of the cause, it exists inseparable from the <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> at the time of destruction it merges {{in the nature of the}} cause. Also, specific features that constitute the effect are not different from the cause. Thus, the entire world which prior to its manifestation is existent in an unmanifest state in the nature of Prakrti, the Primal Energy, the modification of Prakrti resulting in the perceivable world does not make it lose its identity.Existence is a manifestation of the unmanifest Brahman, and the individual souls (atman) are the reflections of Brahman and non-different from Brahman, but even then non-difference cannot become the content of awareness without reference to difference. To the Advaitins, non-difference is real and it is not known through reasoning. Brahman is then held to be knowable because it is different from empirical things.|$|R
