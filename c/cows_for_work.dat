40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out among 60 farmers who were plowing with Nguni cows in Chokwe District in Gaza, Mozambique in July 1994. The {{histories}} of 110 cows raised primarily for breeding purposes but used also for traction {{were obtained from the}} owners. Calving intervals averaged 21 months and calving occurred throughout the year but peaked in the rains. Calf mortality from birth to weaning was not recorded but there was evidence of abortions and weakened calves in two villages. These levels were equal to those obtained in the years with sufficient male animals for traction in the region and use of cows for this purpose was probably uncommon. They were also similar to those obtained in non-draft Nguni cows in better management situations on-station. Despite these positive results, using cow traction is apparently a temporary practice due to a shortage of cattle following drought and war. The main problem mentioned by farmers was the unavailability of <b>cows</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> for up to four months each year during calving...|$|E
40|$|Farming systems {{based on}} ox-cultivation is a {{millennium}} old tradition in Ethiopia. However, this farming system with its {{in high demand}} for grazing land, has come under increased pressure during the last century. Means of intensifying the mixed crop and livestock farming systems, which is predominant in the highlands, has to be found if Ethiopia shall escape the downward spiral of overexploitation, soil erosion and famine. A possible way could be to increase the livestock biodiversity by substituting the local Zebu oxen with more appropriated breeds of cows both capable of performing work, reproduce and give milk. In 1988 FARO and ILRI sat up a joint venture research programme at Holetta Research Station to test this idea. F 1 crosses of Boran x Simmental and Boran x Friesian {{were used in the}} experiment. On-station research conducted from 1988 - 1995 showed that using these breeds of crossbred dairy cows for both milk production and draught work was a feasible technology as long as the increased energy requirement was met by adequate feeding. On-farm research conducted from 1995 - 1998 with only Boran x Frisian crosses included 50 farmers stratified in three different resource endowment groups showed that short-term uptake of the dairy-draught technology was low. During the trial only 10 % of all trial land were tillage by crossbred cows and the use of crossbred <b>cows</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> halted completely shortly {{after the end of the}} trial. In terms of on-farm milk production the introduction of crossbred cows had a significant impact, increasing revenue from milk sale increased up to ten times, compared to the traditional system with only Zebu cows. Milk yields differed significantly among resource endowment groups with cows from rich farmers performing best followed by cows from medium and poor farmers, respectively. Days to first post partum oestrus and calving interval were similar for the groups, but tended to increase over time. The reasons for low uptake of draught part of the technology were numerous, the most important being: Unwillingness to use the cows for ploughing, inadequate feeding, no alternative investment opportunities, land scarcity not perceived as a prevailing problem in the area and the chosen research approach. The question also remains if heavy Boran x Friesian crosses is the right breed for small-scale farmers...|$|E

40|$|Production {{performance}} of cows {{is an important}} factor which determines whether <b>cows</b> are adopted <b>for</b> draft power. <b>Working</b> <b>cows</b> could perform at higher levels of efficiency than oxen, but only if nutrient inputs are adequate to meet their greater requirements, and milk production and reproduction are kept at levels comparable to non-working cows. ILRI (International Livestock Research Institute) and the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) have reached different aspects of the use of dairy <b>cows</b> <b>for</b> draft <b>work.</b> This paper deals with work output, milk production and reproduction of crossbred dairy <b>cows</b> used <b>for</b> draft.

The focus of the consultation is on new technologies developed by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) to help introduce multi-purpose crossbred cows into smallholder production systems, focussing on traction in addition to milk and meat production. Topics of discussion include development of cow traction technologies, social and cultural altitudes towards adoption of cow traction, extension efforts to spread the technology, draft power use in smallholder farming systems, research on the nutrition of cows, and potential and extent of use of <b>cows</b> <b>for</b> draft <b>work.</b> Countries involved in the study include Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, China and India...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{conclusions}} drawn from ILCA's work on single-ox and cow traction in Africa with those drawn from surveys and farmers' experience in South East Asia especially Thailand and Bangladesh. The ILCA work shows cow traction to be apparently more profitable than single-ox ploughing and both better than pair-ox ploughing. This paper throws some doubt on these conclusions and indicates that cow traction may cause problems by requiring larger amounts {{of high quality}} feed. Also Asian experiences show that using poorly fed <b>cows</b> <b>for</b> draught <b>work</b> results in long term declines in fertility and milk production. Thus if only poor to medium quality feed is available the single-ox option may be the better one in Africa {{despite the fact that}} more cattle have to be kept overall...|$|R
