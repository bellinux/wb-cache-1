5|$|Specter has {{received}} a 61% rating from the AFL-CIO. He voted for <b>cloture</b> on the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007. In early 2009, Specter announced {{he would not be}} voting for <b>cloture</b> on the same act in the 111th Congress. After Specter switched parties, he changed his position on the issue again, and {{wrote a letter to the}} unions indicating he supported card check legislation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Democrats' {{advantage}} in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make <b>cloture</b> easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a <b>cloture</b> vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both <b>cloture</b> motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. appealed Barkley's decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, in {{response}} to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain <b>cloture.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end {{debate on}} the bill: a <b>cloture</b> vote to end the filibuster. The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote). The bill was {{endorsed}} by the AMA and AARP.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the Senate {{voted for}} <b>cloture</b> by a 70-30 vote, thus {{overcoming}} {{the threat of}} filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill. On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77-19 vote (Democrats 47-16, Republicans 30-2); only Senators representing Southern states voted against it.|$|E
5|$|A heated {{public debate}} followed, which {{resulted}} in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a <b>cloture</b> motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.|$|E
5|$|Amid a push by Senate Democrats in July 2013 to {{eliminate}} the filibuster for all executive-branch nominees, senators struck a deal {{to pave the way}} for a final, up-or-down vote on Cordray's nomination. With that senators voted 71–29 on July 16, 2013 to invoke <b>cloture</b> on Cordray's nomination. The U.S. Senate confirmed Cordray in a 66–34 vote on July 16, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain <b>cloture.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, {{threatened}} another filibuster, {{this one}} opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures. The filibuster was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by <b>cloture,</b> in a 68–31 vote. Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election campaign. McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, {{as his own}} campaign manager. Paul's endorsement {{was seen as a}} major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, McCain won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} Senate term; he {{prevailed in}} a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform, although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain <b>cloture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} {{took place}} over House conference negotiations on the bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, the Nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the Senate went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis's attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked <b>cloture</b> over Gravel's second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel's attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel's later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken at face value in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} methods of delay {{are those that}} force the majority to invoke <b>cloture</b> multiple times on the same measure. The most common example is to filibuster the motion to proceed to a bill, then filibuster the bill itself. This forces the majority {{to go through the}} entire <b>cloture</b> process twice in a row. If, as is common, the majority seeks to pass a substitute amendment to the bill, a further <b>cloture</b> procedure is needed for the amendment.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cloture</b> vote {{succeeded in}} the Senate on November 4, 2013, with 61 voting in favor and 30 against, {{allowing}} the Senate {{to schedule a}} vote. Republican Senators Kelly Ayotte (NH), Susan Collins (ME), Orrin Hatch (UT), Dean Heller (NV), Mark Kirk (IL), Rob Portman (OH), and Pat Toomey (PA) voted for <b>cloture,</b> joining 52 of 53 Democratic senators and both independent senators. Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) supported the legislation, but were unable to attend the <b>cloture</b> vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{filibuster}} is {{a tactic}} used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely. A filibuster may entail long speeches, dilatory motions, and an extensive series of proposed amendments. The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking <b>cloture.</b> In most cases, <b>cloture</b> requires {{the support of}} three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the matter before the Senate involves changing {{the rules of the}} body– this includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster– a two-thirds majority is required. In current practice, the threat of filibuster is more important than its use; almost any motion that does not have the support of three-fifths of the Senate effectively fails. This means that 41 senators can make a filibuster happen. Historically, <b>cloture</b> has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required supermajority, so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster. However, motions for <b>cloture</b> have increased significantly in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Lugar {{voted against}} DADT repeal {{in both the}} <b>cloture</b> and final votes on December 18, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Cantwell {{voted in}} September 2010 to invoke <b>cloture</b> to begin {{debate on the}} don't ask, don't tell policy in the military.|$|E
25|$|In May and June 2007, {{regarding}} the high-profile, hotly debated {{comprehensive immigration reform}} bill known as the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton twice voted against amendments that would have derailed the bill, thus moving forward the bill's chance of passage. She introduced a failed amendment to facilitate legal immigrants bringing other family members into the country. After not announcing her position until {{a week before the}} vote, she ayed on a <b>cloture</b> motion to bring the overall bill to a vote, which failed. When the bill was again brought forward, she continued to vote in favor of <b>cloture</b> motions to consider it. In October, Clinton voted in favor of a small subset of the failed bill, the DREAM Act, but it too failed to gain <b>cloture.</b>|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 1970, the Senate {{commenced}} openly {{debating the}} proposal and {{the proposal was}} quickly filibustered. The lead objectors to the proposal were mostly Southern senators and conservatives from small states, both Democrats and Republicans, who argued abolishing the Electoral College would reduce their states' political influence. On September 17, 1970, a motion for <b>cloture,</b> which would have ended the filibuster, received 54 votes to 36 for <b>cloture,</b> failing to receive the then required a two-thirds majority of senators voting. A second motion for <b>cloture</b> on September 29, 1970, also failed, by 53 to 34. Thereafter, the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, moved to lay the proposal aside so the Senate could attend to other business. However, the proposal was never considered again and died when the 91st Congress ended on January 3, 1971.|$|E
25|$|The Senate voted 71-27 for <b>cloture</b> on Hagel's {{nomination}} on February 26, 2013. Later {{that day}} the Senate voted to make Hagel the Secretary of Defense {{by a vote of}} 58-41.|$|E
25|$|Senate Republicans {{successfully}} filibustered {{his nomination}} after a <b>cloture</b> vote failed 58-40 with one present and one not voting. This filibuster {{marked the first}} time a cabinet nominee was successfully filibustered.|$|E
25|$|Later that month, {{during the}} {{automotive}} industry crisis of 2008, Clinton {{voted in favor of}} a $14 billion emergency bailout for U.S. automakers, but it failed to gain the 60 votes needed for <b>cloture.</b>|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 2013, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Cooper {{to serve}} as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to the seat vacated by Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who took senior status on July 15, 2013. On January 16, 2014 his nomination was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. On March 13, 2014, Senator Harry Reid filed a motion to invoke <b>cloture</b> on the nomination. On March 26, 2014, <b>cloture</b> was invoked in a 56-43 vote. He was confirmed later that same day by a vote of 100-0. He received his commission two days later.|$|E
25|$|On several occasions, Nelson {{has voted}} {{to reduce or}} {{eliminate}} the estate tax, notably in June 2006, when {{he was one of}} four Democrats voting for a failed (57–41) <b>cloture</b> motion on a bill to eliminate the tax.|$|E
25|$|Following Senator Ted Cruz's 21-hour speech {{opposing}} the Affordable Care Act in 2013, Sessions joined Cruz and 17 other Senators in a failed vote against <b>cloture</b> on a comprehensive government funding {{bill that would}} have continued funding healthcare reform.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2007, Nelson {{was one of}} two Democratic Senators to {{vote against}} invoking <b>cloture</b> on a {{resolution}} aimed at withdrawing most American combat troops from Iraq in 2008. The vote, requiring 60 votes to pass, was 50 to 48 against.|$|E
25|$|The Senate's {{consideration}} of the conference report was somewhat less heated, as <b>cloture</b> on it was invoked {{by a vote of}} 70-29. However, a budget point of order raised by Tom Daschle, and voted on. As 60 votes were necessary to override it, the challenge was actually considered to have a credible chance of passing.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{previous}} position, he later stated {{his opposition to}} the Federal Marriage Amendment and argued that it was unnecessary because the states already had the power to ban gay marriages. However, when the amendment came to the Senate floor, {{he was one of the}} two Democratic senators who voted in favor of <b>cloture.</b>|$|E
25|$|If the Senate invokes <b>cloture,</b> debate {{does not}} end immediately; instead, it is limited to 2 {{additional}} hours unless increased by another three-fifths vote. The longest filibuster speech in the Senate's history was delivered by Strom Thurmond, who spoke for over 24 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to block {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1957.|$|E
25|$|The {{bill was}} {{designated}} S.J.Res.30 in the Senate {{and was immediately}} referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. When the bill became stuck in committee, Senator Allard re-introduced the Amendment in the Senate on July 7, 2004 where it was designated S.J.Res.40. The bill was subject to a filibuster: on July 9, 12, 13 and 14, the motion was made to proceed to consideration of the measure. On July 14, 2004, a <b>cloture</b> motion to force a direct vote on the FMA was defeated in the Senate {{by a margin of}} 50 nay votes to 48 yea votes. The 48 votes in support of the <b>cloture</b> motion were 12 votes short of the 60-vote supermajority (three-fifths) needed to end debate and force a vote on the Amendment itself. Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina skipped the filibuster vote. On July 15, 2004, the motion to proceed to consideration of the Amendment was withdrawn in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, during World War I, a rule {{allowing}} <b>cloture</b> of {{a debate}} {{was adopted by the}} Senate on a 76-3 roll call vote at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, after a group of 12 anti-war senators managed to kill {{a bill that would have}} allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable filibusters of the 1960s {{occurred}} when Southern Democrats attempted to block {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 by filibustering for 75 hours, including a 14 hour and 13 minute address by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. The filibuster failed when the Senate invoked <b>cloture</b> {{for only the second time}} since 1927.|$|E
25|$|Little Sark was {{synonymous with}} silver mining {{for some of}} its history; La <b>Clôture</b> du Bas, the {{southern}} part of Little Sark, in particular had a number of mines. Mining mainly occurred between 1833 and 1845, and at its height the mines employed up to 80 workers from Sark and Cornwall, the Cornish immigrants doubling the population of the area.|$|E
25|$|On December 11, 2005, Coleman {{voted in}} favor of invoking <b>cloture</b> on, thus advancing, a defense {{appropriations}} bill that included oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Critics viewed this as a contradiction of 2002 pledge to oppose such drilling. Coleman stated that he did so because although he planned to vote against the bill, he did not believe that a filibuster was warranted. His vote notwithstanding, the filibuster held, and Coleman voted to strip the ANWR provision from the bill in a subsequent vote.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2005, {{during the}} hearing on Judge John Roberts's {{nomination}} for Chief Justice of the United States, Feingold {{was one of}} three Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of sending Roberts's nomination to the floor for a full vote. He also announced that he would vote to confirm Roberts. Feingold graduated from Harvard Law School the same year as Roberts, 1979. Feingold voted against Samuel Alito in committee and voted against <b>cloture</b> of debate regarding Alito's nomination on the Senate floor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s civil rights bills were being {{introduced}} in Congress. To overcome the Southern Democrats’ {{suppression of the}} pro-Republican African-American vote, then-Republican Hawaii’s prospects for statehood were tied to Alaska’s, which many thought would be more Democratic. Hawaii statehood was expected to result in the addition of two pro-civil-rights senators from a state {{which would be the}} first to have majority non-white population. This would endanger the Southern minority segregationist Democrat Senate by providing two more pro-civil rights votes to invoke <b>cloture</b> and halt a Senate filibuster.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{nominated}} former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) {{to succeed}} Leon Panetta {{and serve as}} his second term Secretary of Defense on January 7, 2013. U.S. Senate nomination hearings begin on January 31, 2013. On Tuesday, February 26, 2013, after debate in the full Senate had been closed {{by a vote of}} 71 to 27, Hagel's nomination was confirmed 58–41 (1 not voting). All the negative votes on each roll call came from Republican Senators, while 18 Republicans voted for <b>cloture</b> of debate and 4 for final confirmation. He took office on February 27, 2013.|$|E
