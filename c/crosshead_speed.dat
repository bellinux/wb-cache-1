A total of 120 teeth was tested, 40 per sealer namely AH26, Sultan, and Sealapex; 20 each with and without the smear layer. The teeth were split longitudinally, and the internal surfaces were ground flat. In the smear layer-free specimens the smear layer was removed by washing for 3 minutes with 17% EDTA followed by 5.25% NaOCl. Using a specially designed jig, the sealer was placed into a 4-mm wide × 4-mm deep well which was then set onto the tooth at a 90-degree angle and allowed to set for 7 days. This set-up was then placed into a mounting jig which was designed for the Instron Universal Testing Machine so that only a tensile load was applied without shearing. The set-up was subjected to a tensile load at a <b>crosshead</b> <b>speed</b> of 1 mm per min.

Coupling experiments and high-speed camera with a rate of 0. 5 - 135 frames/s capture enabled determination of crack kinetics and velocities.

40|$|Self-healing {{materials}} {{provide a}} route for enhanced damage tolerance in materials for aerospace applications. In particular, puncture-healing upon impact {{has the potential}} to mitigate significant damage caused by high velocity micrometeoroid impacts. This type of material also {{has the potential to}} improve damage tolerance in load bearing structures to enhance vehicle health and aircraft durability. The materials being studied are those capable of instantaneous puncture healing, providing a mechanism for mechanical property retention in lightweight structures. These systems have demonstrated healing capability following penetration of fast moving projectiles [...] velocities that range from 9 mm bullets shot from a gun (approx. 330 m/sec) to close to micrometeoroid debris velocities of 4800 m/sec. In this presentation, we report on a suite of polymeric materials possessing this characteristic. Figure 1 illustrates the puncture healing concept. Puncture healing in these materials is dependent upon how the combination of a polymer's viscoelastic properties responds to the energy input resulting from the puncture event. Projectile penetration increases the temperature {{in the vicinity of the}} impact. Self-healing behavior occurs following puncture, whereby energy must be transferred to the material during impact both elastically and inelastically, thus establishing two requirements for puncture healing to occur: a.) The need for the puncture event to produce a local melt state in the polymer material and b.) The molten material has to have sufficient melt elasticity to snap back and close the hole. 1, 2 Previous ballistic testing studies revealed that Surlyn materials warmed up to a temperature approx. 98 C during projectile puncture (3 C higher than it s melting temperature). 1, 2 The temperature increase produces a localized flow state and the melt elasticity to snap back thus sealing the hole. Table 1 lists the commercially polymers studied here, together with their physical properties. The polymers were selected based on chemical structure, tensile strengths, tensile moduli, glass transition temperature, melting temperatures, and impact strength.
