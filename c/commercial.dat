Based on the uses and gratifications perspective this study has determined which motives of consumers, content characteristics of viral <b>commercials</b> and medium context explain the passing along of viral <b>commercials.</b> Diffusion theory {{has been used to}} determine if viral mavens and infrequent senders differ regarding their reasons to pass along viral <b>commercials</b> and their demographic characteristics. An online survey was held among 510 youngsters. After viewing four viral <b>commercials,</b> they answered questions about passing along viral <b>commercials</b> (motives, content characteristics and medium context) and demographic variables. The study shows that youngsters pass along surprising and entertaining viral <b>commercials</b> more often than viral <b>commercials</b> that are sexually oriented and shocking. Possibly {{they do not want to}} be associated with these controversial virals. Youngsters pass along viral <b>commercials</b> through e-mail and in a lesser extend by social networks.

The most typical appeals in <b>commercials</b> aimed at male children were action-adventure, sports, and play, whereas <b>commercials</b> aimed at female children emphasized nurturing, physical attractiveness, friendship, and romance.

40|$|Suspense {{has been}} used as a tool that helps to keep audiences’ {{attention}} during a course of a story. It has been studied in the context of a wide range of narrative genres. Attracting and maintaining attention is critical in advertising because of the abundance of audio-visual stimuli in the current media environment. Current research about suspenseful <b>commercials</b> is mainly focused on a combination of hope and fear emotional responses. However, there are very few studies showing how suspense is generated in <b>commercials.</b> This study attempts to find out factors that create suspense in <b>commercials</b> by conducting a content analysis of suspenseful and non-suspenseful <b>commercials</b> and compares their characteristics. A total of 203 awards winning <b>commercials</b> of The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity under the category “Film” from 2012 to 2014 were chosen as the sample of this study. Two coders were trained and then coded these <b>commercials</b> independently from three main aspects: the structure and content of <b>commercials,</b> emotional appeals used in <b>commercials,</b> and the time of brand- or product-related information shown in <b>commercials.</b> The results of this study show that suspenseful <b>commercials</b> tend to be non-or less verbal and use more number of emotional appeals than non-suspenseful <b>commercials.</b> Among four types of emotional appeals (fear, hope, humor, fantasy), humor and fantasy appeals are used more frequently. The results also show that suspenseful <b>commercials</b> tend to show less information of products or brands than non-suspenseful <b>commercials...</b>|$|R

Number of pages: 40 Author: Lotta Norberg Tutor: Amelie Hössjer Course: Media and Communication Studies C Period: Autumn term 2007 University: Division of Media and Communication, Department of Information Science, Uppsala University Purpose/Aim: The aim of this essay {{is to make a}} study of how children experience and construe <b>commercials.</b> Key questions to be answered are; can children distinguish <b>commercials</b> from TV programmes? What do the children think of <b>commercials?</b> How do they watch <b>commercials?</b> What do they think about a ban against <b>commercials</b> directed to children? Do they understand the purpose of <b>commercials?</b> Do their buying habits change? Material/Method: A qualitative method with 18 interviews and 3 observations with 7, 9 and 11 year old children. Main results: The children in my study can distinguish <b>commercials</b> from TV programs. What they think about <b>commercials</b> and how they watch <b>commercials</b> depend on their stage of development and from previous experience. The younger children do not understand the purpose of <b>commercials,</b> they think it is funny to watch them and important so they know what to buy. Most of the 9 - and 11 year olds understand that the companies want to sell their products.

40|$|Background: In this study, {{the nature}} of food <b>commercials</b> in children′s {{television}} (TV) was monitored and analyzed; simultaneously, the relationship between recalling TV food <b>commercials</b> and children′s interest in them and in the consumption {{of the same food}} products was evaluated. Methods: A total of 108 h children′s programs broadcast on two channels (Two and Amouzesh) of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) media organization were monitored (May 6 - 12, 2015). Simultaneously, a cross-sectional study using 403 primary schoolchildren (201 boys) in four schools of Shirvan, Northeast of Iran, was executed. The children were prompted to recall all TV <b>commercials</b> broadcast on IRIB. Meanwhile, they were directed to define in the list of recalled TV food <b>commercials</b> those were interested in and the <b>commercials</b> (food products) they actually were willing to consume. Results: Regarding the frequency and duration of broadcasting, food <b>commercials</b> ranked fifth and sixth, respectively. Fruit leather and plum paste were the most frequently broadcast food <b>commercials.</b> "High quality" (19 %), "good taste" (15 %), "novelty," and "message on nutritional composition" (13 %) were the most frequent messages used in promoting the sale of food products, respectively. In addition, focus on "high quality/precision in the preparation of the food products" was the most frequently used appeals in TV <b>commercials.</b> There was a significant relationship between recalling TV food <b>commercials</b> and the interest in five out of eight of the <b>commercials</b> (62. 5 %) (P < 0. 05). The relationship between recalling TV food <b>commercials</b> and the interest in the consumption of the same food product ("Tomato paste B") was statistically significant for 12. 5 % of the <b>commercials</b> (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: TV food <b>commercials</b> do not encourage healthy eating. The current study provides convincing evidence for policy-makers and researchers {{to pay more attention to}} this area...|$|R
