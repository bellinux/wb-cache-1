5|$|A major railway, {{known as}} the Eurasian Land Bridge allows goods to be transported from <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> EEU to Europe. An {{expansion}} of the original railway line named the New Eurasian Land Bridge provides an uninterrupted rail link between <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> EEU. Talks with China, India and Burma are ongoing to expand the railway network. In June 2014, {{it was announced that}} Russia, North Korea and South Korea would cooperate to expand the Eurasian Land Bridge to connect the peninsula. Advantages of exporting products by rail through the EEU are reduced shipping times and reduced costs. The railways also have the potential for expansion, with the future creation of high-speed railway lines being considered.|$|E

The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when the American pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin.

5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in <b>China,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly {{what they wanted to}} hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism.|$|E
5|$|In April 1969, {{during the}} summit of the Cultural Revolution, Zhu was {{dismissed}} from his position on the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of <b>China,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> activity of the National People's Congress was halted. However, due to the support of Zhou Enlai, he was not harmed or imprisoned. In August 1969, Lin Biao issued a command that dispatched important martial figures to distant areas due to the tension between China and Soviet Union, and Zhu De was driven to Guangzhou. In 1973 Zhu was reinstated in the Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{vulnerability}} to blockade was studied.

However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, {{and many of the}} best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.|$|E
