50|$|<b>Cefsulodin</b> is {{a third-generation}} {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic that is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and {{was discovered by}} Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in 1977.|$|E
50|$|The first {{products}} TAP file {{new drug}} applications for, were two cephalosporins, cefmenoxime (Cefmax) and <b>cefsulodin</b> (Cefonomil), estazolam for sleep disorders, and leuprorelin; leuprorelin {{was the first}} one approved, in 1985.|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>cefsulodin</b> (CGP 7174 /E, SCE 129) a new semi-synthetic cephalosporin, was examined and its interaction with other antimicrobial agents evaluated. <b>Cefsulodin</b> was highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but relatively inactive against coliform bacilli. Combinations of <b>cefsulodin</b> and gen-tamicin {{were found to}} have additive or synergistic activity against a third of strains of Ps. aeruginosa.

40|$|The in vivo {{activities}} of <b>cefsulodin,</b> sulbenicillin, and gentamicin were compared in mice infected intraperitoneally with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mice infected with sulbenicillin- and gentamicin-susceptible strains, <b>cefsulodin</b> was about 12 to 60 times more active than sulbenicillin {{and had an}} activity similar to gentamicin. In mice, the activity of <b>cefsulodin</b> was independent whether the strains were resistant to gentamicin or not, but it was considerably affected by resistance of the strains to sulbenicillin...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>cefsulodin</b> has been {{considered}} essentially as an antipseudomonal antibiotic, a good activity was demonstrated against β-lactamase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <b>cefsulodin</b> against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (50 strains) was determined by an agar-dilution method. The median MIC value was 6. 25 μg/ml. The minimal bactericidal value (MBC) never exceeded 12. 5 μg/ml. The growth curves obtained with the MS- 2 system showed that regrowth did not occur at <b>cefsulodin</b> concentrations MIC x 2, x 4, x 8. No regrowth was observed after 24 hours. The lag of regrowth in the post-antibiotic period (β-lactamase technique) at <b>cefsulodin</b> concentrations MIC x 2, x 4, x 8 was identical to those observed with penicillin G against a Staphylococcus aureus not producing β-lactamase. These in-vitro data should encourage a clinical trial {{in order to assess}} the in-vivo efficacy of <b>cefsulodin</b> against staphylococcal infections.

40|$|<b>Cefsulodin</b> (SCE- 129) is a {{cephalosporin}} with {{a spectrum}} of antibacterial activity largely limited to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. <b>Cefsulodin</b> was compared with carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin against 779 nonenteric gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci collected from five geographically separate institutions. Against P. aeruginosa, <b>cefsulodin</b> was somewhat more active than piperacillin and much more active than other penicillins. In addition, <b>cefsulodin</b> was active against penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus. Collaborative efforts in three laboratories led to the following tentative zone size breakpoints for 30 -micrograms <b>cefsulodin</b> disks: susceptible {{greater than or equal}} to 18 mm (minimal inhibitory concentration) [MIC] less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (MIC {{greater than or equal to}} 64 micrograms/ml). These zone standards are still tentative since the dosage schedule has not yet been defined and sufficient clinical experience has not yet been gathered to support the validity of these MIC breakpoints...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefsulodin</b> {{is a novel}} {{cephalosporin}} {{that contains}} a pyridinomethyl substituent at posi-tion 3 of the dihydrothiazine ring and a sulfo group on the acyl side chain. <b>Cefsulodin</b> has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa but binds poorly {{to those of other}} bacteria. <b>Cefsulodin</b> has the ability to readily pass through the outer wall of P. aeruginosa and is poorly hydrolyzed by most chromosomal { 3 -lacta-mases. It is partially destroyed by the carbenicillinases of P. aeruginosa that are plasmid mediated. <b>Cefsulodin</b> inhibits 50070 of P. aeruginosa isolates at concentrations of 2 - 4 IJg/ml. <b>Cefsulodin</b> acts synergistically with all aminoglycosides against 20 %- 80 % of P. aeruginosa isolates.

40|$|<b>Cefsulodin</b> was {{evaluated}} {{as a potential}} selective agent for aeromonads. Resistance of Aeromonas and coliform isolates was determined by using a standard disk diffusion technique. A total of 119 Aeromonas and 78 coliform strains were isolated. For 102 of 130 [corrected] Aeromonas isolates (environmental and reference strains), the MIC of <b>cefsulodin</b> was 32 micrograms/ml. Because <b>cefsulodin</b> suppresses growth of Aeromonas and other oxidase-positive organisms, total coliform (TC) and Escherichia coli counts on Chromocult Coliform agar (CC agar) without <b>cefsulodin</b> and on CC agar with 10 mg of <b>cefsulodin</b> per liter (CC-CFS) were compared. Variance analysis of data from 14 sewage-polluted irrigation water specimens did not demonstrate any statistically {{significant difference in the}} enumeration of E. coli with CC and CC-CFS media. On average, the CC agar recovered 2. 46 times as many TCs as CC-CFS. However, Aeromonas colonies made up an average of 58. 6 % of the TC counts on CC agar. Because no Aeromonas spp. were recovered on CC-CFS, background interference was eliminated and the counts that were obtained reflected more accurately the number of TCs. Results {{of this study suggest that}} <b>cefsulodin</b> may be a useful selective agent against Aeromonas spp. which should be included in coliform chromogenic media when high levels of accompanying flora are expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} urinary pH on renal {{interaction}} of <b>cefsulodin</b> and probenecid was tested in rabbits. Probenecid was reabsorbed in acidic urine (fractional excretion [FE] = 8 +/- 4 %) and secreted in alkaline urine (FE = 492 +/- 258 %). Renal excretion of <b>cefsulodin</b> alone was {{not affected by}} the urinary pH (FE = ca. 100 %). In acidic urine, probenecid significantly reduced tubular secretion of <b>cefsulodin</b> (FE = 74 +/- 8 %). An inverse pattern was observed in alkaline urine (FE = 122 +/- 18 %) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 169 strains of Yersinia spp. were {{analyzed}} {{for their ability}} to grow on two different kinds of cefsulodin-Irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar containing 15 or 4 micrograms of <b>cefsulodin</b> per ml, on salmonella-shigella agar, and on MacConkey agar. CIN media inhibited the growth of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 3 B serotype O 3 (3 B/O 3) but not the growth of the other Yersinia organisms used. Relative to growth on Trypticase soy agar (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) with 6 % yeast extract, 48 and 44 % of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica 3 B/O 3 strains, respectively, were inhibited on CIN I agar (low <b>cefsulodin</b> concentration), and 83 and 54 %, respectively, were inhibited on CIN II agar (high <b>cefsulodin</b> concentration) after incubation for 24 h at 32 degrees C. The inhibition of Y. pseudotuberculosis growth was significantly more extensive on CIN II agar than on CIN I agar. The MICs of <b>cefsulodin</b> and novobiocin clearly indicated a higher susceptibility for Y. pseudotuberculosis than for the other Yersinia organisms at 32 degrees C. All Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were susceptible to <b>cefsulodin</b> at 15 micrograms/ml (the approximate concentration used in CIN II agar). Y. enterocolitica 3 B/O 3 strains were resistant to <b>cefsulodin,</b> Irgasan, and novobiocin at the concentrations used in CIN media. These findings show that <b>cefsulodin</b> inhibits the growth of Y. pseudotuberculosis at the concentration used in CIN media and that growth inhibition of Y. enterocolitica 3 B/O 3 is related to a component of the CIN Base...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-nine {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis received either <b>cefsulodin</b> or a reference agent (tobramycin or ticarcillin) in a randomized manner {{for treatment of}} pulmonary infec-tions associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients {{ranged in age from}} 12 to 30 years. Their infections were classified as mild (six), moderate (16), or severe (seven). Fourteen patients received <b>cefsulodin,</b> 14 patients were treated with tobramycin, and one patient received ticarcillin. Significant clinical improvement was noted in the majority of patients in both groups. Adverse effects and development of laboratory abnormalities were uncommon in both groups. P. aeruginosa was not permanently eradicated from the sputum of any of the patients. Resistance as measured by disk susceptibility testing may have developed during and immediately after therapy in the <b>cefsulodin</b> group but not in those treated with reference agents. However, this did not appear to affect the clinical outcome. Results of the nonrandomized portion of this multicenter study, in which 46 patients were treated with <b>cefsulodin,</b> were similar to those for the randomized group. Thus, <b>cefsulodin</b> was shown to be as clinically effective as the reference agents in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pa...|$|E
40|$|Examination of {{beta-lactam}} susceptibility of mutants {{altered in}} the control of chromosomal beta-lactamase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa supports the view that a constitutive level of beta-lactamase is not an adequate explanation for resistance to <b>cefsulodin</b> and ceftazidime but could be for resistance to piperacillin which has an efficiency of hydrolysis ca. 10 times higher than does <b>cefsulodin</b> or ceftazidime...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-eight {{strains of}} Aeromonas spp. were {{analyzed}} {{for their ability}} to grow on two different kinds of cefsulodin-Irgasan (triclosan; Ciba-Geigy AG, Basel, Switzerland) -novobiocin (CIN) agar containing 15 or 4 mg of <b>cefsulodin</b> per ml and on inositol-bile salts-brilliant green (IBB) agar. Relative to blood agar, 68 % of the strains were inhibited by more than 2 logs (i. e., less than 1 % growth) at 37 degrees C (39 % at 25 degrees C) on CIN I (high <b>cefsulodin</b> concentration), 7 % were inhibited at either temperature on CIN II (low <b>cefsulodin</b> concentration), 4 % were inhibited on IBB agar at 37 degrees C, and none were inhibited on IBB agar at 25 degrees C. These results reflect the MICs of <b>cefsulodin</b> on CIN Base: the MIC for 50 % of the strains was 8 mg/liter at 37 and 25 degrees C, and the MICs for 90 % of the strains were 16 mg/liter at 37 degrees C and 64 mg/liter at 25 degrees C. The MICs of Irgasan and novobiocin were far beyond the concentrations used in CIN media.

SCE- 1365, cefotaxime, moxalactam, and ceftazidime had very similar activities against Enterobacteriaceae; SCE- 1365 displayed the highest activity, and ceftazidime displayed the lowest activity. These four antibiotics were about 20 times more active than cefoperazone and 50 to 100 times more active than cefoxitin and cefuroxime. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{and the other}} Pseudomonas species, ceftazidime showed the highest activity by far, followed by <b>cefsulodin</b> and cefoperazone.

40|$|In {{order to}} define whether {{the mode of}} action of <b>cefsulodin</b> is the same on two {{different}} Gram-negative bacilli, a growth curve study (MS- 2 Abbott) was carried out on seven different biotypes of Escherichia coli and seven different lysotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In agreement with the high MIC of <b>cefsulodin</b> for the E. coli strain these data show a rapid drop in optical density (lysis checked by phase contrast microscopy) in E. coli culture with high <b>cefsulodin</b> concentrations (from 64 to 500 μg/ml). In P. aeruginosa culture a residual growth was observed at all concentrations from 2 to 500 μg/ml. This residual growth was due to long filaments which were not observed in E. coli cultures. This early response of the growth curve was concentration independent. When β-lactamase was added, the lag of regrowth was concentration dependent for E. coli culture, but concentration independent for P. aeruginosa. This observation reflects the different mode of action of <b>cefsulodin</b> (penicillin binding proteins and/or permeability barrier) related to bacterial species.

40|$|The {{combination}} of antibiotics {{is one of}} the strategies to combat drug-resistant bacteria, though only a handful of such combinations are in use, such as the b-lactam combinations. In the present study, the efficacy of a specific sub-inhibitory concentration of <b>cefsulodin</b> with other b-lactams was evaluated against a range of Gram-negative clinical isolates. This approach increased the sensitivity of the isolates, regardless of the b-lactamase production. The preferred target and mechanism of action of <b>cefsulodin</b> were identified in laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, by examining the effects of deleting the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1 a and 1 b encoding genes individually. Deletion of PBP 1 b was involved in sensitizing the bacteria to b-lactam agents, irrespective of its O-antigen status. Moreover, the use of a sub-inhibitory concentration of <b>cefsulodin</b> in combination with a b-lactam exerted an effect similar to that one obtained for PBP 1 b gene deletion.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, <b>cefsulodin,</b> moxalactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were measured against 62 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis. Ceftazidime and N-formimidoyl thienamycin {{were the most}} active of these agents...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatases (PTPs) {{are potential}} therapeutic targets for many diseases. Unfortunately, despite considerable drug discovery efforts devoted to PTPs, obtaining selective and cell permeable PTP inhibitors remains highly challenging. We describe {{a strategy to}} explore the existing drug space for previously unknown PTP inhibitory activities. This led {{to the discovery of}} <b>cefsulodin</b> as an inhibitor of SHP 2, an oncogenic phosphatase in the PTP family. Crystal structure analysis of SHP 2 interaction with <b>cefsulodin</b> identified sulfophenyl acetic amide (SPAA) as a novel phosphotyrosine (pTyr) mimetic. A structure-guided and SPAA fragment-based focused library approach produced several potent and selective SHP 2 inhibitors. Notably, these inhibitors blocked SHP 2 -mediated signaling events and proliferation in several cancer cell lines. Thus, SPAA may serve as a new platform for developing chemical probes for other PTPs...|$|E
40|$|Infected renal cyst is {{an unusual}} but severe urological problem. Patients with the lesion are known to respond poorly to the {{antibiotic}} therapy despite an adequate plasma level. In an attempt to explain this poor clinical response of antibiotics to the lesion, concentrations of <b>cefsulodin</b> and SCE- 1365 in fluid of cysts were measured in three patients with renal simple cysts. The fluid was collected 50 to 110 minutes after an single intramuscular or a bolus intravenous injection of 500 mg of <b>cefsulodin</b> or SCE- 1365 by aspiration or during unroofing of the cysts. The study disclosed that no or only very low level of either of the cephalosporins was detected in the cysts. These results are considered to explain the poor response of antibiotics for infected renal cysts...|$|E
40|$|Ritipenem {{is highly}} bacteriolytic against Haemophilus influenzae. Bacterial lysis was shown after {{treatments}} with ritipenem and <b>cefsulodin</b> at their MICs and after treatments with fropenem and cefdinir at four times their MICs, indicated by decreases {{in the culture}} turbidities and by morphological changes of the destroyed cells. These β-lactams were preferentially bound to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1 b. Ritipenem, fropenem, and <b>cefsulodin</b> exhibited poor affinities to PBPs 3 a and 3 b, but cefdinir showed high affinities to these PBPs. Microscopic examinations revealed that selective PBP 3 inhibitors, such as aztreonam and cefotaxime, inhibited lysis induced by ritipenem. These {{results suggest that the}} preferential inactivation of PBP 1 b could be essential to induce the lysis of H. influenzae cells and that binding to PBPs 3 a and 3 b may interfere with lysis...|$|E
40|$|Of 43 {{isolates}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 90 % were inhibited by 8 micrograms {{or less of}} N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml by the agar-dilution technique. Cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, and <b>cefsulodin</b> showed relatively poor activity. Vancomycin was {{the most}} active compound by weight, inhibiting 93 % of strains at 1 microgram/ml...|$|E
