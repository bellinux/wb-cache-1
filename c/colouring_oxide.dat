Its use is somewhat controversial since some claim that it can leach from glazes into food and drink. To provide a safe means of use, BaO is often used in fritted form.|$|R
50|$|The salting {{mixture of}} sodium {{chloride}} and water is {{introduced into the}} kiln when the appropriate temperature is reached, typically around 900 °C. As the kiln reaches higher temperatures, typically 1100-1200 °C, the sodium chloride vaporizes and reacts with steam to form hydrogen chloride and soda. These vapors react with the silica {{in the body and}} other body constituents. A glaze of fairly high alumina content (0.6 molecular parts) and a relatively low silica content (2.6 molecular parts), and in which the main base is soda, is formed. Salt glazes have been improved by the addition of borax, and sometimes sodium nitrate, to the salting mixture. <b>Colouring</b> <b>oxides</b> can be incorporated in the salting mixture to give decorative effects, such as a kind of aventurine glaze.|$|R

40|$|Foam glass {{lightweight}} aggregate (LWA) derived from mixed waste and recycled glass has {{great potential for}} use as an alternative material for several applications in building and other industrial applications. Despite the significant superior features of the current product, there is still room for further research to improve the structural performance of newly developed foam glass and foam glass-ceramics produced from waste and recycled materials. Improvements may be achieved through controlling microstructures and the distributions of pore sizes and shapes, altering chemical and phase compositions, creating reinforced structures by the inclusion of other fibrous materials as well as adding colour to the foam glass and glass-ceramics. One commercially used foam glass gravel has been selected and {{was the subject of}} a wide range of tests to determine its physical and mechanical properties and to compare them to conventional products in the industry. Results obtained from percent crushed particle content, abrasion resistance and freezing and thawing resistance testing are presented and analysed. Methods for improving foam properties and expanding its usefulness in engineering applications are proposed; adjusting the microstructure characteristics and changing the chemical and phase composition were found to be effective. A deeper examination of the microstructure by microscopy (SEM or TEM) further revealed the promising features of the evaluated material as a new versatile construction material. In addition, inclusion of <b>colouring</b> <b>oxides</b> in foam formulation was examined as an innovative way for increasing mechanical strength in a colourful product...|$|R
25|$|The {{color of}} a {{sedimentary}} rock is often mostly determined by iron, an element with two major oxides: iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Iron(II) oxide (FeO) only forms under low oxygen (anoxic) circumstances and gives the rock a grey or greenish <b>colour.</b> Iron(III) <b>oxide</b> (Fe2O3) in a richer iron environment is often found {{in the form of}} the mineral hematite and gives the rock a reddish to brownish colour. In arid continental climates rocks are in direct contact with the atmosphere, and oxidation is an important process, giving the rock a red or orange colour. Thick sequences of red sedimentary rocks formed in arid climates are called red beds. However, a red colour does not necessarily mean the rock formed in a continental environment or arid climate.|$|R

40|$|Peer {{reviewed}} paper {{given at}} Digital Fabrication 2012 /NIP 28 28 th International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies. Stephen Hoskins and David Huson at the Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England are continuing their {{research into the}} 3 D printing of ceramic bodies by investigating the possibilities of using techniques developed by the ancient Egyptians to produce a 3 D printed ceramic body that will glaze itself during the firing process. Egyptian faience was the first glazed ceramic material invented by man. Originating in the fifth millennium BC, Egyptian faience is not a clay-based ceramic but is composed of quartz mixed with alkali fluxes. In contemporary terms Egyptian faience is popularly viewed as a low plasticity turquoise coloured self-glazing low-fired body, used primarily to create ornamental objects such as beads and jewellery. In its original Egyptian context faience was a versatile material, used {{in a variety of}} ways and in a number of different forms, to create objects such as sculpture, cups, vessels, funerary figurines, tiles, boxes and body ornamentation all with a highly coloured lustrous glaze. The two methods used in ancient Egypt to enable self-glazing in one firing are efflorescence glazing and cementation glazing: In efflorescence glazing soluble salts are introduced in to the body mix, after forming and during the drying stage these salts migrate to the surface of the formed article and during firing fuse and react with the body materials to form a glaze on the surface, by introducing <b>colouring</b> <b>oxides</b> such as cobalt, iron, manganese or copper into the mix a range of coloured glazes can be produced. In cementation glazing the article that has been formed is surrounded in a saggar (a refractory box used to support and protect a ceramic object during firing) by a powder consisting of a glaze precursor, during the firing process a eutectic reaction takes place between the ceramic article and the glaze precursor powder and a glaze is formed on to the surface of the ceramic article, the firing temperature is below the melting temperature of the glazing powder so that the glazed ceramic article can be removed from the powder bed in which it was fired. There is an interesting and coincidental synergy between the material properties of ancient Egyptian faience and the material requirement for the successful 3 D printing of ceramic powders, this paper will describe the technical aspects of the ancient process and indicate how by using modern materials and methods the process can be replicated by 3 D printing. There are additional potential benefits for the arts and crafts sector as the process will enable the production of glazed ceramic articles with only one firing and at a much-reduced temperature than conventional ceramic bodies allow...|$|R

The oxides were readily synthesized by the solid-state reaction of stoichiometric mixtures of the constituent binaries at around 700 degrees C in air. The crystal structures determined by Rietveld refinement of PXRD data revealed {{that in the}} smaller trivalent-metal-substituted lyonsite oxides, the M-III ions occupy the octahedral (8 d, 4 c) sites and the lithium ions occur exclusively at the trigonal-prismatic (4 c) site in the orthorhombic (Pnma) structure. On the other hand, larger divalent-metal (Co-II/Cu-II) -substituted derivatives show occupancy of the Co-II/Cu-II ions at both the octahedral and trigonal-prismatic sites.

40|$|Electrochromic (EC) {{materials}} {{are able to}} change their optical properties, reversibly and persistently, by the application of an electrical voltage. These materials can be integrated in multilayer devices capable of modulating the optical transmittance between widely separated extrema. We first review the recent literature on inorganic EC materials and point out that today's research is focused on tungsten <b>oxide</b> (<b>colouring</b> under charge insertion) and nickel <b>oxide</b> (<b>colouring</b> under charge extraction). The properties of thin films of these {{materials are}} then discussed in detail with foci on recent results from two comprehensive investigations in the authors' laboratory. A logical exposition is obtained by covering, in sequence, structural features, thin film deposition (by sputtering), electronic band structure, and ion diffusion. A novel conceptual model is given for structural characteristics of amorphous W oxide films, based on notions of defects in the ideal amorphous state. It is also shown that the conduction band density of states is obtainable from simple electrochemical chronopotentiometry. Ion intercalation causes the charge-compensating electrons to enter localized states, implying that the optical absorption underlying the electrochromism {{can be described as}} ensuing from transitions between occupied and empty localized conduction band states. A fully quantitative theory of such transitions is not available, but the optical absorption can be modeled more phenomenologically as due to a superposition of transitions between different charge states of the W ions (6 +, 5 +, and 4 +). The Ni oxide films were found to have a porous structure comprised of small grains. The data are consistent with EC coloration being a surface phenomenon, most likely confined to the outer parts of the grains. Initial electrochemical cycling was found to transform hydrated Ni oxide into hydroxide and oxy-hydroxide phases on the grain surfaces. Electrochromism in thus stabilized films is consistent with reversible changes between Ni hydroxide and oxy-hydroxide, in accordance with the Bode reaction scheme. An extension of this model is put forward to account for changes of NiO to Ni 2 O 3. It was demonstrated that electrochromism is associated solely with proton transfer. Data on chemical diffusion coefficients are interpreted for polycrystalline W oxide and Ni oxide in terms of the lattice gas model with interaction. The later part of this review is of a more technological and applications oriented character and is {{based on the fact that}} EC devices with large optical modulation can be accomplished essentially by connecting W-oxide-based and Ni-oxide-based films through a layer serving as a pure ion conductor. Specifically, we treat methods to enhance the bleached-state transmittance by mixing the Ni oxide with other oxides characterized by wide band gaps, and we also discuss pre-assembly charge insertion and extraction by facile gas treatments of the films, as well as practical device manufacturing and device testing. Here the emphasis is on novel flexible polyester-foil-based devices. The final part deals with applications with emphasis on architectural "smart'' windows capable of achieving improved indoor comfort jointly with significant energy savings due to lowered demands for space cooling.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between grain boundary microstructure and fatigue crack growth with hold-times was investigated for two {{conditions of the}} superalloy Allvac 718 Plus; a Standard condition with the recommended distribution of grain boundary phases and a Clean condition with virtually no grain boundary phases. Fatigue testing was performed at 704 degrees C using 10 Hz cyclic load with intermittent hold-times of 100 s at maximum tensile load. Microstructural characterization and fractography were conducted using scanning- and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Auger electron- and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were used for oxide analyses on fracture surfaces. It was found that in the Standard condition crack growth is mostly transgranular for 10 Hz loading and intergranular for hold-times, while for the Clean condition crack growth is intergranular in both load modes. The lower hold-time crack growth rates in the Standard condition are attributed to grain boundary delta-phase precipitates. No effect of delta-phase was observed for 10 Hz cyclic loading crack growth rates. Two different types of <b>oxides</b> and <b>oxide</b> <b>colours</b> {{were found on the}} fracture surfaces in the Standard condition and could be correlated to the different loading modes.

Metal nanoparticles incorporated within a semiconductive oxide film enhance photocatalytic activity by improving photoinduced charge separation. Silver nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles were synthesised and doped within a titania film by AACVD. This improved solar control properties. Incorporation of high refractive index contrast metal oxide particles within a host film altered the films <b>colour.</b> Discrete tungsten <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles or ceria nanoparticles within a titanium dioxide thin film enhanced the self cleaning, photo-induced super-hydrophilicity and photochromism properties.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, 18 th-century glass mosaics from the Capela de São João Baptista (Chapel of St. John the Baptist, Lisbon) were {{analysed}} by Raman microscopy (RM). This masterpiece in baroque mosaic art {{had one of}} its major contributors the most famous glassmaker in Rome, Alessio Mattioli. Mattioli was celebrated because of the opacity of his mosaics and the astonishing number of hues {{he was able to}} produce for mosaic decorating Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. This study had two goals in mind: (1) characterising the materials involved in the manufacture of these glass mosaics and (2) lengthening the understanding of what was left of Mattioli's glassmaking records. As expected the mosaics presented a high ratio of crystalline phases, making RM the ideal technique for non-destructive analysis. The mosaics contained a white ‘background’ or opacifier added identified as Ca 2 Sb 2 O 7. The yellow tesserae are opacified with lead antimonate (Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7) and ternary oxides, structures related to lead antimonate but with other ions entering the position of Sb 4 + (namely Sn 4 +). Those ternary oxides are pervasive in most colours, admixed with other colorants.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the consequences of the duration and the temperature of the oxidation firing on the bond strength between three non-precious alloys and a conventional dental veneering ceramic. In addition 84 test bodies were produced by every alloy and were submitted according to the demand of this investigation at firing temperatures of 500 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C in each case 5 min, 10 min and 15 min to an oxidation. One group was veneered according to manufacturer’s instructions without previous oxidation and served as a control group. Every series existed of seven metal panels which were veneered with ceramics in the same way and were submitted to the SCHWICKERATH-Test according to the DIN EN ISO 9693. Finally the break gap course was judged by one test body of every series in the longitudinal microsection {{with the help of a}} stereo reflected-light microscope. With the remaining six test bodies the covering degree of the metal as well as the ceramic shard with basic mass were determined in the supervision on the fractured surfaces. All test bodies clearly exceeded the demanded minimum values of 25 MPa of the DIN EN ISO 9693 and can be regarded as clinically safe. The results of the attempts showed with all alloys almost without exception that the bond strength between metal and ceramics decreases continuously with rising temperature of the oxidation. Merely the 500 °C groups, with the exception of Wirobond C, showed no significant differences to the control group. Because an additional oxidation generates costs and time-loss to the dental-technical lab and walks along without significantly better bond strengths, nevertheless, this knowledge is without clinical meaning. An unequivocal connection between the firing temperature, the bond strength and the covering degree of the metal as well as the ceramic shard with basic mass could be indicated. With rising temperature the covering degree with basic mass on the metal panels decreased, the dark <b>colouring</b> of the <b>oxide</b> on the ceramic shard increased and the shear bond strength decreased. The investigations to the effect of the duration of the oxidation showed a nonuniform picture. It took no clear influence on the bond strength. The break gap courses presented themselves continuously very consistently. They always appeared on the edge of the ceramic block, started in the opaque layer and ran out to the edge of the ceramics. A bubble formation in the bond layer between metal and ceramics was only to be found in two of three cases in the control group of Wirobond C and can be held responsible for the in general worse results of this group in comparison to the groups with oxidation. From the results of this work the conclusion of the user arises that an additional oxidation before blinding non-precious alloys with conventional dental veneering ceramic leads to no significant advantage regarding the shear bond strength...|$|R
40|$|Materials {{chemistry}} basically {{deals with}} rational {{design and synthesis}} of new solids exhibiting various functional properties. A sound knowledge of crystal structures and chemical bonding is needed to understand the properties of materials. Space group, cell parameters and atomic positions provide a basic crystallographic description of the structure. Crystal structure could be described in a detailed way in terms of close packing of anions and occupancy of cations in different coordination sites. The coordination polyhedra and their interconnectivity bring out the interrelationships between different structures and the properties exhibited. Transition metals (TMs) are d-block elements which occupy groups 3 - 12 in Periodic Table. IUPAC defines a TM as ‘an element whose atoms have partially filled d-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d-shell’. The partially filled d-shell in TMs {{plays an important role}} in various chemical and physical properties of TMs. Although TM cations can form compounds with different anions, most of the TM containing compounds are metal oxides due to the large free energies for formation of oxides. Binary TM oxides adopt different kinds of structures among which rock salt (e. g. NiO), rutile (e. g. TiO 2), and corundum (e. g. Cr 2 O 3) are most common. Ternary TM oxides are also known to form in variety of structures with the perovskite (e. g. BaTiO 3), and the spinel (e. g. MgFe 2 O 4) structures being well known. TM oxides exhibit a broad range of electronic and magnetic properties. TM oxides, at one end, display metallic behavior (e. g. ReO 3, RuO 2, LaNiO 3) due to the delocalized electrons and at other end, show insulating behavior (e. g. NiO) due to the localized electrons. In between, TM oxides have semiconducting properties involving either the hopping of carriers (e. g. partially reduced TiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, WO 3 and so on) or the electron excitation from the valence band to the conduction band (e. g. SnO 2). TM oxides are known to have diverse magnetic properties: diamagnetic (e. g. TiO 2, ZrO 2), paramagnetic (e. g. VO 2, NbO 2), ferromagnetic (e. g. CrO 2, La 0. 67 Ca 0. 33 MnO 3), ferrimagnetic (e. g. Fe 3 O 4, MnFe 2 O 4) and antiferromagnetic (e. g. NiO, LaCrO 3). TM oxides with partially filled 3 d-shell are expected to be ‘metallic’ according to Bloch-Wilson theory, but in practice they are Mott insulators (localized 3 d electrons) because of correlation energy (U) involved in the transfer of d-electrons between adjacent sites. Certain TM oxides also show insulator-metal (I-M) transitions induced by change of temperature, pressure or composition. For example, VO 2 and Ba 2 IrO 4 are known for their temperature and pressure induced I-M transitions, respectively. La 1 -xSrxCoO 3 becomes metal at a particular Sr concentration being one of the examples for composition-dependent I-M transition. TM oxides are usually synthesized by conventional ceramic method in which stoichiometric mixture of starting materials is reacted at elevated temperatures. Multiple prolonged heating with intermittent grindings in ceramic method generally results in thermodynamically controlled products. The metastable phases which are of interest may not be obtained by ceramic method. Chimie douce/soft chemistry methods are generally adopted to stabilize the metastable phases. The guiding principle behind the chimie douce is to have kinetic control (rather than thermodynamic control) to realize metastable phases. Accordingly, metastable derivatives are obtained by choosing appropriate precursors, or adopting sol-gel and molten flux or ion exchange/intercalation methods. The present thesis is devoted to an investigation of transition metal oxides towards development of functional materials exhibiting visible light absorption/emission and lithium insertion/extraction for cathode materials in lithium ion battery. TM oxides find application as photovoltaic materials, luminescent emission materials, photocatalysts, light absorption/pigment materials and so on, based on their optical properties. Ferroelectric TM oxides with perovskite structure [Green coloured (KNbO 3) 1 -x (BaNi 1 / 2 Nb 1 / 2 O 3 -δ) x] are studied currently as photovoltaic materials which show high open circuit voltage (Voc = 3. 5 V) despite very low short circuit current (Vsc = 40 nA cm- 2). TM oxides are also known to exhibit photoluminescent emission which could be due to the doping activator ions (e. g. MnII doped Zn 2 GeO 4) or TM oxide (e. g. CaWO 4) itself being self-activator. While the green and red emissions are common for TM oxides, blue emission is rare (e. g. Ar+ irradiated SrTiO 3 is a blue emitter). Coloured TM oxides with band gap in visible region are employed as photocatalysts for solar water splitting (e. g. yellow BiVO 4, yellow Ag 3 PO 4, yellow TaON, red Fe 2 O 3) and photo-oxidation of organic pollutants (e. g. TiO 2 -xNx and CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12). The coloured TM oxides also find application as pigments from early times, for example, Egyptian blue (CaCuSi 4 O 10), Han blue (BaCuSi 4 O 10), Han purple (BaCuSi 2 O 6), Malachite green (Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2), Ochre red (Fe 2 O 3) and many others. A list of pigments based on TM oxides is given in Table 1. Pigment materials are applied as colouring materials in inks, dyes, paints, plastics, ceramics glazers, enamels and textiles. Table 1.

Though d-d transitions are parity forbidden, the selection rules get relaxed due to different reasons such as symmetry reduction (due to distortion) and vibronic couplings. The colour of the TM oxides is influenced mainly by two factors (i) oxidation state of TM ion present and (ii) ligand field around the TM ion produced by anion geometry. In order to develop new pigment oxides, our strategy was to choose colourless metal oxides having unusual (five coordinated geometry) or irregular/distorted (distorted octahedral/tetrahedral) coordination geometries around metal ion and produce coloured oxides by substituting 3 d-TM ions at the metal ion site. We made a detailed study on the origin of the colour and pigment quality of the resulting coloured oxides. In the present thesis, which has two parts, the first part (Part 1) discusses the development of 3 d-TM ion substituted coloured oxides with potential for pigment applications. Chapter 1. 1 describes the purple inorganic pigment, YGa 1 -xMnxO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 10), based on the hexagonal YGaO 3. The metastable series of oxides were prepared by a sol-gel technique where the dried gels, obtained from aqueous solutions of metal nitrates-citric acid mixtures, were calcined for a short duration in preheated furnace around 850 °C/ 10 mins. The purple <b>colour</b> of the <b>oxides</b> arises from the specific trigonal bipyramidal ligand field around MnIII that obtains in the YGaO 3 host. Other hexagonal RGaO 3 hosts for R = Lu, Tm and Ho substituted with MnIII also produce similar purple coloured materials. In Chapter 1. 2, we present a study on substitution of 3 d-TM ions in LiMgBO 3 host [where Mg(II) has a trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) oxygen coordination) ]. We find that single-phase materials are formed for LiMg 1 -xCo(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 1. 0), LiMg 1 -xNi(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1), LiMg 1 -xCu(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1) and also Li 1 -xMg 1 -xFe(III) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1) of which the Co(II) and Ni(II) derivatives are strongly coloured, purple-blue and beige-red respectively, thus identifying TBP CoO 5 and NiO 5 as the new chromophores for these colours. Chapter 1. 3 describes the synthesis, crystal structures and optical absorption spectra/colours of 3 d-TM substituted α-LiZnBO 3 derivatives: α-LiZn 1 -xMIIxBO 3 [MII = CoII (0 < x < 0. 50), NiII (0 < x ≤ 0. 05) and CuII (0 < x 0. 10) ] and α-Li 1 +xZn 1 - 2 xMIIIxBO 3 [MIII = MnIII (0 < x ≤ 0. 10) and FeIII (0 < x 0. 25) ]. The crystal structure of the host α-LiZnBO 3, which is both disordered and distorted with respect to Li and Zn occupancies and coordination geometries, is largely retained in the derivatives, giving rise to unique colours [blue for CoII, magenta for NiII and violet for CuII], that could be of significance for the development of new, inexpensive and environmentally-benevolent pigment materials, especially for the blue colour. Accordingly, the work indentifies distorted tetrahedral MO 4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu) (together with a long M-O bond that gives a trigonal bipyramidal geometry) structural units as the new chromophores for the blue, magenta and violet colours respectively, in the α-LiZnBO 3 host. In Chapter 1. 4, we describe the synthesis, crystal structures and optical absorption spectra of 3 d-TM substituted spiroffite derivatives, Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu; 0 < x ≤ 1. 0). The oxides are readily synthesized by solid state reaction of stoichiometric mixtures of the constituent binaries at 620 °C/ 12 h. Rietveld refinement of the crystal structures from powder XRD data shows that the Zn/MO 6 octahedra are strongly distorted, as in the parent Zn 2 Te 3 O 8 structure, consisting of five relatively short Zn/MII – O bonds (1. 898 – 2. 236 Å) and one longer Zn/MII– O bond (2. 356 – 2. 519 Å). We have interpreted the unique colors and the optical absorption/diffuse reflectance spectra of Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 in the visible, in terms of the observed/irregular coordination geometry of the Zn/MII – O chromophores. We could not however prepare the fully-substituted M 2 Te 3 O 8 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu) by the direct solid state reaction method. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling of the electronic structure of both the parent and the transition metal substituted derivatives provides new insights into the bonding and the role of transition metals toward the origin of color in these materials. We believe that transition metal substituted spiroffites Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 reported here suggest new directions for the development of colored inorganic materials/pigments featuring irregular/distorted oxygen coordination polyhedra around transition metal ions. Red coloured materials are rare in nature. Li 2 MnO 3 is a unique oxide with an unusual red colour imparted by MnIV ions. Chapter 1. 5 describes a detailed experimental investigation of Li 2 MnO 3 together with other related MnIV oxides that probes the red colour of Li 2 MnO 3 as well as its photoluminescence. Optical absorption spectra reveal a strong band gap absorption with a sharp edge at ~ 610 nm and a transparent region between ~ 610 and ~ 650 nm that causes the red colour of Li 2 MnO 3 samples. Octahedral MnIV ligand field transitions, corresponding to both MnIV at ideal sites and MnIV displaced to Li sites in the rock salt based layered structure of Li 2 MnO 3, are observed in the excitation spectra of Li 2 MnO 3 samples. Optical excitation at the ligand field transition energies produces tunable emission in the red-yellow-green region, rendering Li 2 MnO 3 a unique MnIV oxide. The honeycomb ordered [LiMn 6] units in the structure likely causes both the absorption and photoluminescence properties of Li 2 MnO 3. Lithium containing TM oxides with rock salt related structure are being investigated extensively for application as next generation cathode materials for Lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Recent research is focused on lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) which are solid solutions between Li 2 MO 3 (where M = Ti, Mn and Ru) and LiMO 2 (where M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). LLOs have excess lithium in the TM layer in addition to lithium in lithium layer of rock salt derived structure. LLOs have gained attention because of their higher discharge capacity in the range of ~ 250 mAhg- 1. While most of the LLOs investigated so far contain 3 d-TM ions (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), recently there has been an interest in the study of the role of ruthenium in addition to 3 d-TM ions. We have investigated ruthenium containing LLOs with a view to probe (i) the role of ruthenium and (ii) the concentration of excess lithium in the TM layers in producing higher discharge capacities. The results are discussed in the Part 2 of the thesis. Li 5 NiMnRuO 8 (Li[Li 0. 25 Ni 0. 25 Mn 0. 25 Ru 0. 25]O 2) form in the Li 2 RuO 3 crystal structure. Electrochemical studies indicate that the Co-containing oxides exhibit a higher initial discharge capacity (for e. g. ~ 180 mAhg- 1 for Li 4 CoRuO 6) as well as a higher reversible discharge capacity (~ 130 mAhg- 1 for Li 4 CoRuO 6) compared to the corresponding Ni-analogs. Participation of oxide ions (higher oxidation state of Ru) in the redox process could explain the higher discharge capacity during the first cycle. Reduced capacity (capacity fade) during the subsequent cycles could arise from the oxygen evolution due to the redox process (2 O 2 - → 2 O- → O 2), which is not reversible. The present work shows that ruthenium incorporation in rock salt layered oxides along with Co/Ni appears to give a beneficial effect in producing a higher discharge capacity. In addition, the compounds crystallizing with the R- 3 m structure (related to LiCoO 2) appear to give a better reversible capacity than the compounds crystallizing in the C 2 /c structures (Li 2 TiO 3 and Li 2 RuO 3) ...|$|R

The d-electrons can be excited by light absorption in the visible {{region of the}} spectrum imparting colour to the material. Charge transfer transitions in the visible region are not restricted by the parity selection rules and therefore give intense colours. Here we have investigated the colours of manganese in unusual oxidation state (Mn 5 +) {{as well as the}} colours of different 3 d-TM ions in distorted octahedral and trigonal prismatic sites in appropriate colourless crystalline host oxides. These results are discussed in Part 3 of the thesis. In Chapter 3. 1, we describe a blue/green inorganic material, Ba 3 (P 1 −xMnxO 4) 2 (I) based on tetrahedral Mn 5 +O 4 : 3 d 2 chromophore. The solid solutions (I) which are sky-blue and turquoise-blue for x ≤ 0 • 25 and dark green for x ≥ 0 • 50, are readily synthesized in air from commonly available starting materials, stabilizing the Mn 5 +O 4 chromophore in an isostructural phosphate host. We suggest that the covalency/ionicity of P–O/Mn–O bonds in the solid solutions tunes the crystal field strength around Mn(V) such that a blue colour results for materials with small values of x. The material could serve as a nontoxic blue/green inorganic pigment. In Chapter 3. 2, an experimental investigation of the stabilization of the turquoise-coloured Mn 5 +O 4 chromophore in various oxide hosts, viz., A 3 (VO 4) 2 (A = Ba, Sr, Ca), YVO 4, and Ba 2 MO 4 (M = Ti, Si), has been carried out. The results reveal that substitution of Mn 5 +O 4 occurs in Ba 3 (VO 4) 2 forming the entire solid solution series Ba 3 (V 1 −xMnxO 4) 2 (0 < x ≤ 1. 0), while, with the corresponding strontium derivative, only up to about 10 % of Mn 5 +O 4 substitution is possible. Ca 3 (VO 4) 2 and YVO 4 do not stabilize Mn 5 +O 4 at all. With Ba 2 MO 4 (M = Ti, Si), we could prepare only partially substituted materials, Ba 2 M 1 −xMn 5 +xO 4 +x/ 2 for x up to 0. 15, that are turquoise-coloured. We rationalize the results that a large stabilization of the O 2 p-valence band states occurs {{in the presence of the}} electropositive barium that renders the Mn 5 + oxidation state accessible in oxoanion compounds containing PO 43 −, VO 43 −, etc. By way of proof-of-concept, we synthesized new turquoise-coloured Mn 5 +O 4 materials, Ba 5 (BO 3) (MnO 4) 2 Cl and Ba 5 (BO 3) (PO 4) (MnO 4) Cl, based on the apatite – Ba 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl – structure. Chapter 3. 3 discusses crystal structures, and optical absorption spectra/colours of 3 d-transition metal substituted lyonsite type oxides, Li 3 Al 1 -xMIIIx(MoO 4) 3 (0 < x ≤ 1. 0) (MIII = Cr, Fe) and Li 3 -xAl 1 -xMII 2 x(MoO 4) 3 (0 < x ≤ 1. 0) (MII = Co, Ni, Cu). Crystal structures determined from Rietveld refinement of PXRD data reveal that in the smaller trivalent metal substituted lyonsite oxides, MIII ions occupy the octahedral (8 d, 4 c) sites and the lithium ions exclusively occur at the trigonal prismatic (4 c) site in the orthorhombic (Pnma) structure; on the other hand, larger divalent cations (CoII/CuII) substituted derivatives show occupancy of CoII/CuII ions at both the octahedral and trigonal prismatic sites. We have investigated the colours and optical absorption spectra of Li 3 Al 1 -xMIIIx(MoO 4) 3 (MIII = Cr, Fe) and Li 3 -xAl 1 -xMII 2 x(MoO 4) 3 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu) and interpreted the results in terms of average crystal field strengths experienced by MIII/MII ions at multiple coordination geometries. We have also identified the role of metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) from the partially filled transition metal 3 d orbitals to the empty Mo – 4 d orbitals in the resulting <b>colours</b> of these <b>oxides.</b> B	The ABO 3 perovskite structure consists of a three dimensional framework of corner shared BO 6 octahedra in which large A cation occupies dodecahedral site, surrounded by twelve oxide ions. The ideal cubic structure occurs when the Goldschmidt’s tolerance factor, t = (rA + rO) /{√ 2 (rB + rO) }, adopts a value of unity and the A–O and B–O bond distances are perfectly matched. The BO 6 octahedra tilt and bend the B – O – B bridges co-operatively to adjust for the non-ideal size of A cations, resulting deviation from ideal cubic structure to lower symmetries. Ordering of cations at the A and B sites of perovskite structure is an important phenomenon. Ordering of site cations in double (A 2 BB'O 6) and multiple (A 3 BB' 2 O 9) perovskites give rise to newer and interesting materials properties. Depending upon the constituent transition metals and ordering, double perovskite oxides exhibit a variety of magnetic behaviour such as ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, antiferromagnetism, spin-glass magnetism and so on. We also have coupled magnetic properties such as magnetoresistance (Sr 2 FeMoO 6), magnetodielectric (La 2 NiMnO 6) and magnetooptic (Sr 2 CrWO 6) behaviour. Here we have investigated new magnetically frustrated double perovskite oxides of the formula Ln 3 B 2 RuO 9 (B = Co, Ni and Ln = La, Nd). The Chapter 4. 1 describes Ln 3 B 2 RuO 9 (B = Co, Ni and Ln = La, Nd) oxides (prepared by a solid state metathesis route) which adopt a monoclinic (P 21 /n) A 2 BB'O 6 double perovskite structure, wherein the two independent octahedral 2 c and 2 d sites are occupied by B 2 + and (B 2 + 1 / 3 Ru 5 + 2 / 3) atoms, respectively. Temperature dependence of the molar magnetic susceptibility plots obtained under zero field cooled (ZFC) condition exhibit maxima in the temperature range 25 – 35 K, suggesting an antiferromagnetic interaction in all these oxides. Ln 3 B 2 RuO 9 oxides show spin-glass behavior and no long-range magnetic order is found down to 2 K. The results reveal the importance of competing nearest neighbour (NN), next nearest neighbor (NNN) and third nearest neighbour (third NN) interactions between the magnetic Ni 2 +/Co 2 + and Ru 5 + atoms in the partially ordered double perovskite structure that conspire to thwart the expected ferromagnetic order in these materials...|$|R
