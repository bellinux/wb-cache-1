At PCB manufacturing level, 50 µm thin chips have been embedded with pitches up to 200 µm in up to 18 "x 2 " panels. Embedding of chips at 100 µm pitch has been achieved at prototype level. Further developments of chip embedding can extend to even finer pitches without redistribution methods only with concurrent developments in ultra fine line patterning, plating methods and chemistries, assembly machines. New manufacturing processes should combine PCB processing and die assembly in one production line in order to benefit the most from this combination without the difficulties of transport between different manufacturing plants. Furthermore, new testing methodologies will be developed and a new supply chain will be created due to incorporation of embedding technologies to PCB production.

40|$|Abstract—There is an {{unprecedented}} trend that content providers (CPs) are building their own content delivery networks (CDNs) {{to provide a}} variety of content services to their users. By exploiting powerful CP-level information in content distribution, these CP-built CDNs open {{up a whole new}} design space and are changing the content delivery landscape. In this paper, we adopt a measurement-based approach to understanding why, how, and how much CP-level intelligences can help content delivery. We first present a measurement study of the CDN built by Tencent, a largest content provider based in China. We observe new characteristics and trends in content delivery which pose great challenges to the conventional content delivery paradigm and motivate the proposal of CPCDN, a CDN powered by CP-aware information. We then reveal the benefits obtained by exploiting two indispensable CP-level intelligences, namely context intelligence and user intelligence, in content delivery. Inspired by the insights learnt from the measurement studies, we systematically explore the design space of CPCDN and present the novel architecture and algorithms to address the new content delivery <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen.</b> Our results not only demonstrate the potential of CPCDN in pushing content delivery performance to the next level, but also identify new research problems calling for further investigation. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{methods and}} challenges faced {{in the health}} impact assessment of vaccination programs, focusing on the pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines in Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS For this narrative review, we searched for the terms "rotavirus", "pneumococcal", "conjugate vaccine", "vaccination", "program", and "impact" in the databases Medline and LILACS. The search was extended to the grey literature in Google Scholar. No limits were defined for publication year. Original articles on the health impact assessment of pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccination programs in Latin America and the Caribbean in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. RESULTS We identified 207 articles. After removing duplicates and assessing eligibility, we reviewed 33 studies, 25 focusing on rotavirus and eight on pneumococcal vaccination programs. The most frequent studies were ecological, with time series analysis or comparing pre- and post-vaccination periods. The main data sources were: health information systems; population-, sentinel- or laboratory-based surveillance systems; statistics reports; and medical records from one or few health care services. Few studies used primary data. Hospitalization and death were the main outcomes assessed. CONCLUSIONS Over the last years, {{a significant number of}} health impact assessments of pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccination programs have been conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean. These studies were carried out few years after the programs were implemented, meet the basic methodological requirements and suggest positive health impact.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{increase}} the amount of recycled waste wood in the wood-processing industry. Contaminations such as plastics and wood preservatives therefore have to be identified and removed. A promising technique to detect this foreign matter is near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. For several organic and inorganic active compounds for wood preservation, the NIR reflectance spectra acquired with sensors with the capability of on-line measurements were characterized. Some of them were significantly different from those of previously published spectra. Moreover, untreated wood was distinguishable from wood treated with preservatives. Confounding factors, such as the water content, wood species and solvent of the preservative, were examined which had so far massively interfered the NIR detection and classification. Chemometric-based solutions are presented in this work to cope with analytical <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen</b> from the complexity of waste wood samples. This formed the basis for a sorting trial in which treated wood chips were detected in real time with an NIR spectrometer and automatically separated by pneumatic nozzles, showing that the laboratory experiments can be transferred into small industrial scale. Additionally, the experiments showed that wood–plastic composites (WPC) of different plastic types were distinguishable with NIR spectroscopy and can be sorted by ejection based on this information. Unmixed material is a major prerequisite for a high-quality recycling of WPC and has never been demonstrated on a technical scale. Furthermore, three different NIR devices (hyperspectral imaging camera, miniaturized spectrometer and sorting plant) were evaluated regarding their applicability in the waste wood recycling process...|$|E

40|$|Despite that Critical Infrastructures (CIs) {{security}} and surveillance are {{a growing concern for}} many countries and companies, Multi Robot Systems (MRSs) have not been yet broadly used in this type of facilities. This dissertation presents a novel study of the <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen</b> by the implementation of this type of systems and proposes solutions to specific problems. First, a comprehensive analysis of different types of CIs has been carried out, emphasizing the influence of the different characteristics of the facilities in the design of a {{security and}} surveillance MRS. One of the most important needs for the surveillance of a CI is the detection of intruders. From a technical point of view this problem can be abstracted as equivalent to the Detection and Tracking of Mobile Objects (DATMO). This dissertation proposes algorithms to solve this specific problem in a CI environment. Using 3 D range images of the environment as input data, two detection algorithms for ground robots have been developed. These detection algorithms provide a list of moving objects in the robot detection area. Direct image differentiation and computer vision techniques are used when the robot is static. Alternatively, multi-layer ground reconstructions are compared to detect the dynamic objects when the robot is moving. Since CIs usually spread over large areas, it is very useful to incorporate aerial vehicles in the surveillance MRS. Therefore, a moving object detection algorithm for aerial vehicles has been also developed. This algorithm compares the real optical flow obtained from a down-face oriented camera with an artificial optical flow computed using a RANSAC based homography matrix. Two tracking algorithms have been developed to follow the moving objects trajectories. These algorithms can efficiently handle occlusions and crossings, as well as exchange information among robots. The multirobot tracking can be applied to any type of communication structure: centralized, decentralized or a combination of both. Even more, the developed tracking algorithms are independent of the detection algorithms and could be potentially used with other detection procedures or even with static sensors, such as cameras. In addition, using the 3 D point clouds available to the robots, a relative localization algorithm has been developed to improve the position estimation of a given robot with observations from other robots. All the developed algorithms have been extensively tested in different simulated CIs using the Webots robotics simulator. Furthermore, the algorithms have also been validated with real robots operating in real scenarios. In conclusion, this dissertation presents a multirobot approach to Critical Infrastructure Surveillance, mainly focusing on Detecting and Tracking Dynamic Objects...|$|E
40|$|International Development Projects (IDP) are {{designed}} to deliver sustained solutions to human life quality threatens. They aim to improve living conditions in emerging countries through initiatives that should provide long-term sustained results. However, the extreme characteristics of IDP contexts challenge traditional project management methodologies. The dynamic nature of stakeholders’ relationships and influence adds additional pressures to the management teams. Higher levels of uncertainty in IDP are faced with non-flexible strategies that compromise the long-term desired results. Not enough participation of relevant stakeholders and beneficiaries limits the impact of development initiatives.   The authors could identify that IDP management is overall an under-investigated field. Specifically, contemporary <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen</b> from unbalanced robust/flexible strategies and low stakeholders participation have undermined the impact success of those projects. Moreover, there is no academic study that constructs on how flexibility could be enhanced in IDP, while maintaining control. Methodologies such as design thinking and agile have elucidated new paths of action for better impact and customer satisfaction in other industries, by enabling flexibility and change management. Despite their huge proven success, these methodologies are still a phenomenon limited to IT and design industries. Therefore, in IDP field there is no framework linking contingency and participatory development theories with flexible methods similar to design thinking and agile methodologies.   In order to bridge this gap the authors will embark in a qualitative study to explore literature and gain insights from actors within the IDP field about the problem at hand. A multiple embedded case study will be conducted with ID academics and practitioners at supervisory and implementation levels from across the world. A possible solution will be designed for IDP management from a different angle to that of traditional management, {{in order to build}} up flexibility without compromising project structure. The proposed framework will tackle flexibility and participation issues by integrating design thinking and agile methodologies into IDP.   The theoretical findings suggest that enabling participatory development strategies in the design phase, and expanding the available project knowledge would enhance IDP flexibility.   Likewise, IDP flexibility during the implementation phase is impacted by the quality and relevance of information and methodological tools available, stakeholders’ involvement, as well as the handover process. Therefore, since no previous studies interconnecting those theories to enhanced flexibility could be found in IDP, an expansion of available theoretical knowledge on contingency and participatory development theory in IDP is produced. The authors concluded that design thinking and agile principles may conceptually prove useful to effectively deal with the problems identified, thus project design is more adequate, and collaboration among stakeholders proves effective to deal with uncertainty and complexity. These constructs are explained in the propositions made for the SUITE framework to IDP, which aims to practically contribute to the management field of IDP...|$|E
40|$|Beyond politic decisions, {{landscape}} changes mostly {{result from the}} economic perception that each community has of its own territory and from the social practices related with agriculture and technical knowledge. Among the cultural landscapes with heritage value, the terraced ones are common in Mediterranean area. Terraces are used by people, or not, in reply to <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen</b> from economic, social and political alterations. In fact, the understanding of these challenges makes communities abandon or recover their terrace landscapes, although other factors as climate disruptions can affect them irremediably. Four terraced landscapes representative of the mentioned factors, and settled in different Mediterranean countries, are compared in this study. They are the following ones: - Safi (Morocco) This landscape is suffering a decay process accompanied by a land demographic decline. As most terraced fields are traditionally hand cultivated or ploughed by draught animals, they are progressively abandoned in benefit of mechanized fields. Actually, the increasing mechanization {{is one of the}} factors which contributes to the human desertification and thus affects drastically the preservation of the walls terraces since continuous hand maintenance is required; - Lebanon Mountain (Lebanon) The regional conflicts lead to population movements and this often causes land occupation changes. Many people who have taken refuge in this hilly region use their ancestral technical knowledge in building and maintaining field terraces for arable land. It is {{the only way they can}} cultivate and survive. - Luberon Mountain (France) In this Regional Park of Provence, land terraces subsistence is the fruit of communities and public authorities interest in keeping high value heritage landscapes. Most of the fields are occupied by olive trees but vineyards and cherry trees can also be found. One example of the special attention given to the heritage development of this land system is the management project for museological purposes called Conservatoire des Terrasses de Cultures, by the village of Goult. - Alto Douro (Portugal) As the upper Douro valley guarantees the selling and profit of the viticultural production, the pressure on the appropriation of land is huge. So the building of terraces was, and still is, the only way to increase the available cultivation area. In the meantime, and given its peculiar characteristics, this landscape has gained a great heritage value, recognized by UNESCO which classified it as World Heritage in 2001. On the other hand, the region has been highly developed in terms of tourism, which is indeed an important asset. Finally, it was thought over the different motivations which have led to the destruction of terraces, their recovery or the building of new ones, in the Mediterranean area.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, the {{researcher}} intended to describe the complexity of the educational environments in which how teachers practice organizational learning in schools of Shenzhen, mainland China and to examine the effectiveness of organizational learning in those environments. In the second part, the researcher conducted a quantitative survey of high schools as learning organizations in Shenzhen and attempted to distinguish their capabilities of organizational learning. Two kinds of high schools were included in the survey, state-run schools and privately-run schools. The key characteristic of learning organizations is organizational learning. Organizational learning is also a process to raise the adaptability and the creativity of an organization through a complex system to cope with the <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen</b> from the unpredictable circumstances. Organizational learning is a result of deep collective conversations and dialogues among staff members and a result of self-reflection in a certain cultural context. It not only brings new arrangements in organizational structures, but also changes the school culture and transformation of behavior patterns. Organizational learning is the pre-requisites of surviving and continuous development of the organization. There were three phases in this study, namely, a pilot study in which a small scale survey were conducted, a main study which included a large scale survey and a case study of four selected schools from the sample in the large scale survey. In the first stage, a pilot study was conducted in order to trial run an instrument which attempted to assess the characteristics of organizational learning of high schools in Shenzhen. After establishing a preliminary framework of organizational learning in schools and an instrument for the study, an attempt was made to assess the capabilities of organizational learning in a greater sample of high schools in Shenzhen. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) This study has based upon the existing problems that teachers faced in the process of curriculum reform in basic education within mainland China. Under the complexity of the environments in educational reform and school organizational development, this study aims to examine the characteristics of schools as learning organizations in mainland China, especially in Shenzhen, and their relations to educational reforms and sustainable school development. 張兆芹.

40|$|The late {{imperial}} period saw {{the development}} of a significant and substantial, although somewhat small, civil society in Kiev. After 100 years, the fall of communism gave way to increasing growth of the public sphere again. Now, however, critics are calling Ukraine???s recent civil society development a fa??ade. What conditions have changed and new <b>challenges</b> <b>arisen</b> in the last century that have affected the function, composition, and capacity of voluntary associations and organizations? Can history shed some light on Ukraine???s current ???third sector crisis???? This thesis examines {{the development of}} civil society in both late imperial and post-communist Kiev. A historically diverse and foreign-dominated nation, Ukraine has remained a multi-cultural, multi-lingual, and multi-confessional state with large Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, and Jewish populations. In the 19 th century, rapid urbanization and industrialization, coupled with declining power of Russian imperial rule, led to a growing public sphere and civil society in urban centers such as Kiev. The increasing number of voluntary associations largely included recreational, professional, and social organizations, which functioned as public spaces for individuals to unite around civic causes. 	 The fall of communism and the collapse of the USSR again allowed for a growing public sphere and civil society in Kiev. The political climate, however, had changed dramatically throughout the 20 th century, as had the international system. As voluntary associations increased in number once again, this time much more political in nature, they largely included NGOs, political parties, media groups, and activist organizations, which functioned as information vehicles and mobilizing networks, unifying around nationalist political goals. Kiev???s late imperial civil society developed internally from largely private funding to address social justice issues, whereas Kiev???s post-communist civil society developed with strong elite and external influence, funded by many state actors and international governments, to address political issues and provide financial benefits. The former had substance, but lacked power to influence the state, while the latter had power to change the regime, but lacks substance so much that it has been called a fa??ade. Over the last century, conditions have changed in a way that poses increasing challenges to civil society development in Kiev. This work contributes to the current discourse and understanding of civil society in Ukraine as it has developed historically and in recent years. By placing the case of Kiev in a comparative historical context and a broader regional historical context, it demonstrates how Ukraine???s civil society development follows historical patterns and is inextricably linked to political climate, national sentiment, and international influence. It argues that the nature of voluntary associations and institutions [...] their function, composition, structure, and societal impact [...] determines the quality of the civil society. It further suggests mechanisms for change, on several levels, which could serve as the first steps toward improving the relevance, autonomy, and impact of third sector organizations in Kiev...|$|E
