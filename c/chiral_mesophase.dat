5|$|It is {{possible}} for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} <b>chiral</b> <b>mesophases</b> from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present.

We determined cholesteric pitch and interaxial spacing by polarizing optical microscopy and x-ray scattering, respectively, from which the twist-angle between DNA molecules can be calculated. Surprisingly, we found that decreasing ionic strength resulted in weaker chiral interactions between DNA chains, as evidenced by the decrease in the twist-angle, and consequent increase in the cholesteric pitch, for a fixed interaxial spacing. We propose that this behavior can be explained by increased smearing-out of the helical charge pattern along DNA as the Debye screening length is increased...|$|R
40|$|Suspended {{droplets}} of cholesteric (chiral nematic) liquid crystals spontaneously rotate {{in the presence}} of a heat flux due to a temperature gradient, a phenomenon known as Lehmann effect.

Here, we report the continuous rotation in a temperature gradient of nematic {{droplets of}} a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal featuring a twisted bipolar configuration. The achiral nature of the molecular components leads to a random handedness of the spontaneous twist, resulting in the coexistence of droplets rotating in the two senses, with speeds proportional to the temperature gradient and inversely proportional to the droplet radius. This result shows that a macroscopic twist of the director field is sufficient to induce a rotation of the droplets, and that the phase and the molecules do not need to be chiral. This suggests that one can also explain the Lehmann rotation in cholesteric liquid crystals without introducing the Leslie thermomechanical coupling [...] only present in <b>chiral</b> <b>mesophases.</b> An explanation based on the Akopyan and Zeldovich theory of thermomechanical effects in nematics is proposed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{undertakes}} a challenge {{of general interest}} in supramolecular chemistry: the achievement of helical organizations with controlled structure. To achieve this target we considered the possibility of inducing supramolecular chirality using molecules that were designed to organize into columnar mesophases. The use of oxazoline-derived ligands and metal coordination served as tools to prepare molecules with a phasmidic-like structure, which show columnar organization in the liquid crystalline state. To ensure the formation of <b>chiral</b> <b>mesophases,</b> these complexes bear stereogenic centers in the rigid coordination environment of the metal. X-ray and circular dichroism experiments have revealed that chirality transfer does indeed take place from the chiral molecule to the columnar liquid crystal organization. This chiral columnar organization appears as a helix consisting of stacks of molecules that rotate with respect to one another along the column while maintaining their mean planes parallel to each other. In fact, it has been concluded that packing of these polycatenar molecules must be more efficient upon rotation of a molecule {{with respect to the}} adjacent one along the column. Furthermore, the same type of helical supraorganization {{has been found to be}} present in the mesophase of the racemic mixture and the mixture of diastereomers prepared from the racemic ligand. In this case, segregation of the optical isomers is proposed to occur to give rise to both types of helix (right-handed and left-handed). SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{splitting}} {{of signals}} in the NMR spectra originating from enantiotopic sites in prochiral molecules when dissolved in chiral solvents {{is referred to}} as spectral enantiotopic discrimination. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) due to the combined effect of the anisotropic magnetic interactions and the ordering of the solute in the mesophase. The enantiorecognition mechanisms are different for rigid and flexible solutes. For the former, discrimination results from symmetry breaking and is restricted to solutes whose point groups belong to one of the following four (“allowed”) symmetries, Cs, C 2 v, D 2 d and S 4. The nature of the symmetry breaking for each one of these groups is discussed and experimental examples, using mainly 2 H 1 D/ 2 D-NMR in <b>chiral</b> polypeptide lyotropic <b>mesophases,</b> are presented and analyzed. When flexible optically active solutes undergo fast racemization (on the NMR timescale) their spectrum corresponds to that of an average prochiral molecule and may exhibit enantiotopic sites. In CLCs, such sites will become discriminated, irrespective of their average (improper) symmetry. This enantiodiscrimination results mainly from the different ordering of the interchanging enantiomers. Several examples of such flexible molecules, including solutes with average axial and planar symmetries, are commented. Dynamic processes in solution that are not accompanied by the modulation of magnetic interactions remain “NMR blind”. This is sometimes the case for interconversion of enantiomers (racemization) or exchange of enantiotopic sites in isotropic solvents. The limitation can be lifted by using CLCs. In such solvents, non-equivalence between enantiomers or between enantiotopic sites is induced by the chiral environment, thus providing the necessary interactions to be modulated by the dynamic processes. Illustrative examples involving exchange of both, enantiotopic sites and enantiomers are examined. In this comprehensive review, various important aspects of enantiodiscrimination by NMR are presented. Thus the possibility to reveal enantiotopic recognition using residual dipolar couplings or to determine the absolute configuration of enantiotopic NMR signals is discussed.

The gels, containing 70 wt% PC or a mixture of PC and EC, were readily crosslinked to form films exhibiting moderate elastomeric properties and room temperature conductivities of #approx# 10 "-" 3 S cm"-" 1. These films are very promising candidates for practical applications. Three kinds of mesogenic units, 4 -cyano- 4 '-oxybiphenyl group, 4 -methoxy- 4 '- oxylbiphenyl group and 4 -methoxyphenyl- 4 '-oxybenzoate group, were incorporated onto the cellulose backbone via a flexible spacer, respectively. The effects {{of the structure of}} the mesogenic groups and the length of spacer on the thermotropic liquid crystallinity of these polymers were investigated.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental H- 2 NMR {{study of the}} effect of external magnetic fields on the supramolecular organization of <b>chiral</b> smectic liquid-crystalline <b>mesophases,</b> such as SmC* and re-entrant SmC*. Three experimental cases in which the supramolecular helical structure of the smectic C* phase is unwound by a magnetic field (H), parallel to the helical axes of I this phase, are discussed in detail. Unwinding of the helical structure is described by using a theoretical model based on the Landau-de Gennes theory, which allows us to explain the transition temperatures among the SmA, SmC*, and uSmC* phases. The energy-density behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} transitions and the value of the critical magnetic field H, for unwinding the helical structure are discussed by applying this model to three ferroelectric smectogens (MBHB, 11 EB 1 M 7, ZLL 7 /*), which are studied by H- 2 NMR spectroscopy at different magnetic fields (from 2. 4 to 9. 4 Tesla). Furthermore, the tilt angle of the three smectogens in the SmC* phase has been directly evaluated, for the first time, by comparing the quadrupolar splittings at different magnetic fields. In one Case, H- 2 NMR angular measurements are used to obtain the tilt angle in the re-entrant smectic C phase...|$|R
40|$|Following in {{the same}} line of {{research}} initiated by the Catalysis and Inorganic Synthesis Group within the ICMAB time ago, this work is mainly focused on the synthesis of carborane derivatives with styrenyl groups via nucleophilic substitution reactions, followed by the incorporation of these derivatives to different types of platforms and structures in order to study their photoluminescence properties. Starting from these compounds, in which the o-carborane cluster is of closo nature (therefore neutral from electronic point of view), their corresponding nido (anionic) derivatives have been obtained, by the cluster’s partial deboronation reaction in basic medium. These derivatives have been fully characterised using common spectroscopic techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and in some cases, X-ray diffraction. Subsequently, photoluminescence studies have been performed, indicating that although the derivatives of methyl-o-carborane and monosubstituted o-carborane exhibit an intense fluorescence, their phenyl-o-carborane analogues show almost no light emission at all. In order to explain such phenomenon, the cyclic voltammetry has been studied as well as DFT theoretical calculations performed, leading {{to the conclusion that}} the lack of fluorescence for the phenyl-o-carborane derivative is most probably due to a photoinduced electronic transfer process (PET). Different types of carbosilane and poly(aryl-ether) dendrimers have been chosen as platforms to which the styrenyl group-containing compounds have been incorporated into. To achieve this objective, these carboranyl derivatives have been adequately functionalised to contain a terminal Si-H bond and, in this manner, to carry out the hydrosilylation reaction of them with different type and generations of dendrimers that contain a variable number of terminal alkenes. In this way, structures bearing from 3 to 12 carborane clusters at the periphery have been obtained. Polyanionic dendrimers have also been generated via partial deboronation reactions of closo clusters to the respective nido derivatives, and isolated as alkaline salts. All of these synthesised dendrimers have been fully characterised. For the poly(aryl-ether) dendrimers, their thermal properties have been studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as well as their photophysical properties. The influence of the different substituents of the clusters (phenyl or methyl), number of clusters and the electronic nature of the cage on the photoluminescence has been studied. Those compounds that contain methyl-o-carborane have shown the highest emission quantic yields. These dendrimers, due to their elevated boron content, are considered to be good candidates for future biomedical applications, among others Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) and other applications such as antivirals or bactericides. The family formed by cubic silsesquioxanes or POSS constitutes another interesting platform to be taken into account, when considering the incorporation of our carborane derivatives bearing the styrenyl group. With the aim of retaining the structure of these compounds, they have been reacted with octavinylsilsesquioxane via olefin metathesis reactions, yielding macromolecules that contain 8 carborane clusters at the periphery. As was previously accomplished for the poly(aryl-ether) dendrimers, their corresponding polyanionic derivatives have been also obtained, using the same partial deboronation reaction of the closo cluster to the respective nido species. All resulting compounds have been fully characterised by different spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. The thermal properties of neutral POSS with closocarboranes have been studied by TGA, showing a remarkable thermal stability. This fact lead us to carry out a more complete study of POSS, previously treated at 600 ºC for 1 hour, using powder X-rays diffraction (XRD) technique and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Photoluminescence studies of neutral POSS have revealed a different behaviour concerning emissions data, respect to their styrenyl-carborane precursors. In this case, the phenyl-o-carborane derivative presents the highest intensity of emission, whereas the monosubstituted o-carborane species shows a total fluorescence quenching. DFT calculations have been done, both in fundamental and excited states, corroborating the experimental results. By analysing the photoluminescent properties of the isolated starting materials and after anchoring them to different platforms (dendrimers and POSS), it has been observed that the carborane cluster and its substituents play an important and interesting role within these properties. Therefore, we decided to go even further and synthesize, using diverse synthetic strategies (addition, hydrosilylation, nucleophilic substitution or Heck reactions, etc), compounds bearing carborane clusters and different fluorophore groups, such as fluorene, anthracene or stilbene. All of these compounds have been adequately characterised and there photoluminescent properties studied. In all cases, it has been observed that when the fluorophore group is not directly bonded to the cluster and is situated away from it, the emission intensities are quite elevated, whereas if there is an aromatic group directly bonded to the cluster (phenyl or fluorene) and the fluorophore group is close to it in space, a quenching of the fluorescence is produced, which, depending on the type of fluorophore, is more or less efficient. This phenomenon is in close agreement with the results obtained for the phenyl-o-carborane derivatives, for the starting carboranestyrenyl- carborane derivatives as well as for the poly(aryl-ether) dendrimers. During the three months stage at the University of York, different compounds derived from the o-carborane and incorporating at least 1 mesogen derivative of cholesterol have been synthesised, with the aim of obtaining new materials with liquid crystal properties. Once these compounds have been characterised, they have also been analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarised optical microscopy (POM), to confirm that in general all compounds synthesised by hydrosilylation reaction do not show mesogenic properties, with the exception of the compound bearing 4 mesogens within its structure. On the other hand, all of the compounds synthesised via olefinic metathesis, show interesting mesogenic properties, exhibiting, in all cases, a <b>chiral</b> nematic <b>mesophase</b> (N*). Moreover, in the case of the methyl-o-carborane derivative, a Blue Phase (BP*) and a <b>chiral</b> smectic <b>mesophase</b> A (SmA*) are exhibited during the cooling cycle. These results indicate that for the latter compounds, the incorporation of the carborane clusters does not destroy the mesomorphic behaviour of the mesogen, but in addition, confers it new and interesting mesogenic properties...|$|R
