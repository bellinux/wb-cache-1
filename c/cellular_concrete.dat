40|$|Abstract: In {{the article}} {{a part of}} the quartz {{component}} in autoclave <b>cellular</b> <b>concretes</b> has been replaced by aluminum silicate rock – perlite. In contrast to quartz sand the perlite rock consists of nano-sized glass phase, which determines its pozzolanic activity. With X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy), microscopy equipment mechanisms of interaction between components of the binder is established. Aluminosilicate rocks in the highly alkaline binders are actively involved in the structural and phase transformations during hydration and hardening of silicate binder producing a predominantly low-basic hydrated calcium silicates- 11 Å-(Al) -tobermorite, hydrated calcium silicates with amorphous structure. The cation exchange capacity of the perlite is the main characteristic of zeolite synthesis of L-K (Al Si O) 11. 7 1. 8 34. 2 72 type that is an analogue of rock-forming minerals of the lithosphere.
