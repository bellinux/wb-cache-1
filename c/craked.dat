40|$|We {{identified}} the <b>craked</b> zones based on geoelectrical resistivity method in Sutami Dam. There are four lines measurement of geoelectrical resistivity method with {{a length of}} 380 - 400 meters. The direction of each line is from the northeast to the southwest. All of the tracks are located {{at the top of}} Sutami Dam i. e. two tracks in the upstream and the others in the downstream. From the analysis we found that the lithology is detected by geoelectrical resistivty method showed two layers of design of Sutami Dam. The two layers that are detected are transition zone and filter zone. Transition zone consists of sandstone rock containing water (0. 922 Ωm- 9. 57 Ωm) and dry sandstone (> 9. 57 Ωm- 320 Ωm). Filter zone consists of sand (> 320 Ωm- 4410 Ωm). Cracked zones spread in the upstream, downstream, and roadway at the top of Sutami Dam which are indicated by the presence of low resistivity (0. 922 Ωm- 9. 57 Ωm) based on 3 D processing of data of geoelectrical resistivity. The distribution of cracked zone indicates that Sutami Dam is susceptible to ground movement...|$|E
40|$|The stress {{intensity}} factor {{is one of the}} most important concepts in fracture mechanics because of stresses near the crack tip increase in proportion to it. Therefore, it must be calculated accurately to obtain the fracture damage. This paper deals with determination of the {{stress intensity}} factor mode I (KI) for Centre <b>Craked</b> Tension (CCT), Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) and Double Edge Notch Tension (DENT) finite platesunder Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and plane strain assumptions. To investigate the differences between the theoretical and numerical solutions, a comparison is made between the {{stress intensity factor}}s calculated using a large number of standard equations with the others calculated using finite element software ANSYS R 14. 5. Stress intensity factors are evaluated with variation of crack length to plate width ratio (a/b), tensile stresses (Ϭt) and plate length to plate width (h/b). The analysis shows that the numerical solution is more suitable than the theoretical solution due to the results that the theoretical equations are limited in a range of parameters values, some parameters such as length plate is not considered in it and also the difficulty to determine the accurate stress intensity factors for cracks in complex structures...|$|E

The mud water created problems in the environment, relocation of people, conflicts, and controversies {{on the issue of}} dumping warm mud water into Porong River and Madura Strait, East Java. In this paper, I reviewed secondary literature to analyze and examine the impacts of dumping mud water in Madura Strait East Java to provide recommendations in the proper management of mud water. Literature provides that the quality of mud water was beyond the standards provided by the State Ministry of Environment Republic Indonesia and International Environment Quality Standard. T emperature is 38 - 56 0 C, Hg (Mercury) is 2. 5 ppm, H 2 S Fenol is 3. 37 - 4. 25 ppm, BOD is 38. 40 mg/L, Manganese is  0. 806 ppm, Pb is 0. 104 ppm, Selenia is 0. 0071 ppm. Water mud of Lapindo drained into the sea endangers biotic organisms. The recommendation are: Spray out of mud water should be stopped and mud water doesn't thrown to sea, Lapindo must make a permanent giant lake to keep mud water in the origin of place, If the previous recommendation cannot done, than for keep the live of man surrounding the area, the water may be trown to the river or sea after the water processing, but the mud must still remaining in the ground, not to thrown in the sea.   Keywords: Mud water of Lapindo, Dumping. </pre...|$|E

50|$|The dot-winged <b>crake</b> (Porzana spiloptera) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Rallidae.

5000|$|However, {{molecular}} phylogenetic analyses {{have confirmed}} the suspicion, {{raised in the}} late 20th century in the first cladistic studies of morphology, that the [...] "genus" [...] Porzana is rather an evolutionary grade, consisting of an assemblage of unrelated plesiomorphic rails. The striped and white-browed <b>crakes</b> (and sometimes the yellow-breasted <b>crake)</b> were sometimes united in Poliolimnas as they appear to share some apomorphies. As they are widely allopatric, their similarities are more likely convergent evolution, and they are now moved to a monotypic genus Aenigmatolimnas (striped <b>crake)</b> and included in Amaurornis (white-browed <b>crake).</b> This may, however, be premature, as Amaurornis seems polyphyletic itself. Similarly, Micropygia is maintained as monotypic genus for the ocellated <b>crake</b> until its relationships are fully resolved. The ash-throated <b>crake,</b> which was only tentatively placed in Porzana, has been united with the two former species of Neocrex in Mustelirallus; they are almost certainly closely related to Pardirallus.|$|R
