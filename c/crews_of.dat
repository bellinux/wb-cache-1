5|$|The United States {{military}} sent a plane carrying {{doctors and}} food from Patrick Air Force Base to Mayaguana in the Bahamas. <b>Crews</b> <b>of</b> doctors and workers {{with food and}} supplies left from Key West and Miami to traverse the Florida Keys, bringing aid to affected residents. In Marathon, a large reconstruction program rehabilitated the key by Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E
5|$|By February 1918, the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> Sankt Georg {{and several}} other {{warships}} grew weary {{of the war and}} the long periods of inactivity, which led to the Cattaro Mutiny. The mutiny was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg {{and several other}} ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent to the {{decision}} to assign Schmitt to Apollo 17, there remained the question <b>of</b> which <b>crew</b> (the full backup <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Apollo 15, Dick Gordon, Vance Brand, and Schmitt, or the backup <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Apollo 14) would become prime <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> the mission. NASA Director <b>of</b> Flight <b>Crew</b> Operations Deke Slayton ultimately assigned the backup <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Apollo 14 (Cernan and Evans), along with Schmitt, to the prime <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Apollo 17.|$|R
25|$|The {{fourth and}} final {{rearrangement}} <b>of</b> the Gemini <b>crew</b> assignment occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett when their trainer jet crashed, coincidentally into a McDonnell building which held their Gemini 9 capsule in St. Louis. The backup <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Stafford and Cernan was then moved up to the new prime <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> the re-designated Gemini 9A. Lovell and Aldrin were moved from being the backup <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Gemini 10 to be the backup <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Gemini 9. This cleared {{the way through the}} crew rotation for Lovell and Aldrin to become the prime <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Gemini 12.|$|R
5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the safer}} eastern channel and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E
5|$|Her {{tenure in}} Pola was enlivened by {{a visit from}} the new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by Kaiser Wilhelm on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German submarine base there. The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E

50|$|Following a four-orbit rendezvous, the {{spacecraft}} docked with the Poisk module of the International Space Station just under six hours after launch, at 02:11 UTC on Friday, 26 September. Hatches {{between the two}} spacecraft were opened at 04:06 UTC. At this time, the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> TMA-14M joined the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Expedition 41, where they were scheduled to remain until the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Soyuz TMA-13M departed in November 2014.

5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In April 1919, {{while helping}} to defend Sevastopol from the {{advancing}} Bolsheviks, the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> France and Jean Bart mutinied, but collapsed when Vice-Admiral Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet {{agreed to meet}} their main demand to take the ships home. 26 crewmen on France and three on Jean Bart were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although they were commuted in 1922 {{as part of a}} bargain between Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré and the parties of the Left.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> two Cuban {{fishing boats}} were kidnapped by Florida-based {{dissident}} group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering {{the arrest of}} dissident poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.|$|E

5|$|In spring, new {{reinforcements}} {{were sent}} by the new caliph, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 717–720), by sea from Africa and Egypt and over land through Asia Minor. The <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> the new fleets were composed mostly of Christians, who began defecting in large numbers, while the land forces were ambushed and defeated in Bithynia. As famine and an epidemic continued to plague the Arab camp, the siege was abandoned on 15 August 718. On its return, the Arab fleet suffered further casualties to storms and an eruption of the volcano of Thera.|$|E
5|$|Lundström {{points out}} (p.134) {{that some of}} the {{international}} and national reports took on the features of urban legends. They reflected a prevailing disrespect for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who were portrayed in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages who had killed the three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition's final resting place on Kvitøya by the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> two ships, the Bratvaag and the Isbjørn.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, The {{newly arrived}} crew of EO-19 undocked {{temporarily}} {{from the station}} aboard Soyuz TM-21 to observe and photograph {{the departure of the}} STS-71 and EO-18 crews aboard Atlantis. TM-21 undocked at 10:55 GMT, followed by STS-71 at 11:09:45 GMT. The EO-19 crew redocked aboard TM-21 at 11:39 GMT as Atlantis conducted a fly-around of the station. Atlantis, carrying the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> EO-18 and STS-71, landed on July 7 after several more days in Earth orbit.|$|E
25|$|The <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> PA2 was {{expected}} to be about 1,650, a significant decrease from the 1,950 <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Charles de Gaulle, indicating the high level of automation integrated into the ship's systems.|$|R
50|$|Soyuz TM-32 was a manned Russian {{spacecraft}} {{which was}} launched on April 28, 2001, and docked with the International Space Station two days later. It launched the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> the visiting mission ISS EP-1, {{which included the}} first paying space tourist Dennis Tito, {{as well as two}} Russian cosmonauts. The Soyuz TM-32 remained docked to the station until October; during this time it served as the lifeboat for the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Expedition 2 and later for the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> Expedition 3. In October it landed the <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> ISS EP-2, who had been launched by Soyuz TM-33.|$|R

Norway won the bronze medal through beating the Netherlands with 3-1 in matches.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class midget {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation against US battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor. The navy hoped that upgrades to the submarines, intensified crew training, and {{the selection of a}} less well defended target would lead to better results and an increased chance of the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> the midgets to return alive from their mission. Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second midget submarine operation.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she would}} remain in port for another three years, Prinz Eugens stay in Pola was enlivened by {{a visit from the}} new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by the German Kaiser Wilhelm II on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German submarine base in the port city. The Italian Air Force conducted at least eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which probably kept the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, all four Helgoland-class battleships were {{disarmed}} and surrendered as prizes of war to the Allies as replacements for the ships scuttled in Scapa Flow. On 21–22 November 1918, Helgoland steamed to Harwich to retrieve the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> U-boats that had been surrendered there. She was then removed from active service on 16December 1918. Helgoland and her sisters were stricken from the German navy on 5November 1919. Helgoland was formally handed over to the United Kingdom on 5August 1920. She was scrapped at Morecambe; work began on 3March 1921. Helgolands coat of arms is currently preserved in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E

5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the Bering Sea. The <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon.|$|E
5|$|Bockscar {{had been}} flown by Sweeney and crew C-15 in three test drop rehearsals of inert Fat Man {{assemblies}} {{in the eight}} {{days leading up to}} the second mission, including the final rehearsal the day before. The Great Artiste, which was the assigned aircraft of the crew with whom Sweeney most often flew, had been designated in preliminary planning to drop the second bomb, but the aircraft had been fitted with observation instruments for the Hiroshima mission. Moving the instrumentation from The Great Artiste to Bockscar would have been a complex and time-consuming process, and when the second atomic bomb mission was moved up from 11 August to 9 August because of adverse weather forecasts, the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> The Great Artiste and Bockscar instead exchanged aircraft. The result was that the bomb was carried by Bockscar, but flown by the crew C-15 of The Great Artiste.|$|E
