These are used as spas by locals and tourists. Some of the radium precipitates into travertine, a form of limestone, and the rest diffuses into the soil, where it is absorbed by crops and mixes with drinking water. Residents have unknowingly used the radioactive limestone as a building material for their homes. The stone irradiates the inhabitants and generates radon gas which is usually seen to promote lung cancer. Crops contribute 72 µSv/yr to a <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of 50 residents.|$|E

When the dot-com bubble burst, {{the loss of}} a <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of investors forced the lab to close its doors in 2001. The lab's assets were liquidated, and the former embassy building inhabited by the lab was purchased by the Brussels regional government. The surviving research division in Barcelona, Starlab DF2, or [...] "Deep Future 2," [...] then adopted a different business strategy, focusing on specialized, direct contracts with ESA under support of the Catalan and Spanish Governments. Founded by Manel Adell, Giulio Ruffini, and Ana Maiques, Starlab Barcelona maintains the interdisciplinary spirit of Starlab Brussels but focuses on space and neuroscience technologies and applications. The lab has been awarded the Barcelona Innovation prize and other awards from ENDESA and BMW Innovation. It has now produced a successful spinoff, Neuroelectrics, which commercializes the Enobio and StarStim systems.|$|E
50|$|Chapter Five {{focuses on}} the {{internal}} and national control arrangements. It begins by accepting that the hazards of ionizing radiation are well appreciated by anyone {{who works in the}} field and that there is, and has been, an elaborate system at the national and international level to minimize these risks. Although there are many questions to be answered, much has been learned {{and there has been a}} stricter management with respect to ionizing radiation and protecting the health of both radiation workers and the general public. It suggests that greater resources should be allocated to a <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> that is most exposed to a particular pollutant in order to determine a safe discharge criteria. This chapter also {{focuses on the}} organizational arrangements of responsibility, which may still be unclear. If a rapid expansion in the near future occurs, new problems are likely to rise; thus, creating new changes in the allocation of responsibilities. It focuses on the present arrangements, their efficacy, and recommendations that arise in order to sustain efficacy and effectiveness. It does not discuss discharges of radioactivity to the environment, but rather presents arrangements that are made in order to ensure protection to the general public and the environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of a graph is {{a finite}} abelian group whose order {{is the number}} of {{spanning}} forests of the graph. This paper provides three basic structural results on the <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of a line graph. • The first deals with connected graphs containing no cut-edge. Here the number of independent cycles in the graph, which is known to bound the number of generators for the <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of the graph, is shown also to bound the number of generators for the <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of its line graph. • The second gives, for each prime p, a constraint on the p-primary structure of the <b>critical</b> <b>group,</b> based on the largest power of p dividing all sums of degrees of two adjacent vertices. • The third deals with connected graphs whose line graph is regular. Here known results relating the number of spanning trees of the graph and of its line graph are sharpened to exact sequences which relate their critical groups. The first two results interact extremely well with the third. For example, they imply that in a regular nonbipartite graph, the <b>critical</b> <b>group</b> of the graph and that of its line graph determine each other uniquely in a simple fashion.
