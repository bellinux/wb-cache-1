In addition to the bullet wounds, Gorrostieta Salazar suffered further injuries when the vehicle crashed after the shooting. Her wounds left her in constant pain and she had to use a <b>colostomy</b> bag, but she refused to resign her post as mayor. She publicly displayed her wounds in photographs published in an issue of Contacto Ciudadano magazine, and repeated her statement that she would continue her work.|$|E
25|$|When {{excessive}} {{inflammation of}} the colon renders primary bowel resection too risky, bowel resection with <b>colostomy</b> remains an option.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis study {{examined}} the correlation between social relational quality and hope among patients with permanent <b>colostomies.</b> MethodsEighty-six eligible patients with permanent <b>colostomies</b> were recruited from a Class A tertiary hospital from July to December 2012. A self-designed demographic questionnaire, the Social Relational Quality Scale (SRQS), and the Herth Hope Index (HHI) were administered to all patients. ResultsThe total social relationship quality and hope scores were 49. 42  ±  4. 98 and 38. 52  ±  4. 64, respectively. The total scale score and composing subscale scores for social relationship quality and hope showed a statistically significant positive correlation with each other (r =  0. 324 – 0. 680; p <  0. 01).

25|$|The <b>colostomy</b> {{is usually}} temporary, {{but it may}} be permanent, {{depending}} on the severity of the case.

25|$|Emergency {{surgery is}} {{necessary}} for people whose intestine has ruptured; intestinal rupture always results in infection of the abdominal cavity. During emergency diverticulitis surgery, the ruptured section is removed and a <b>colostomy</b> or ileostomy is performed. This means that the surgeon will create an opening between the large intestine and {{the surface of the}} skin. The <b>colostomy</b> is closed in about 10 or 12 weeks in a subsequent surgery in which the cut ends of the intestine are rejoined.|$|E

Diverting <b>colostomies</b> were performed in 17 patients, Hartmann's <b>colostomies</b> in 7 patients, and proximal loop <b>colostomies</b> in 4 patients. Presacral drainage was used in 25 patients (89. 3 %). Distal irrigation was performed in 13 patients (46. 4 %) and primary repair in 9 patients (32. 1 %). There was one infectious complication (3. 6 %) and no deaths (0 %). Fecal diversion and presacral drainage are the mainstay of therapy for civilian rectal injuries. The importance of distal irrigation of the rectum has not been established. Primary repair of the rectum has no effect on morbidity and mortality...|$|R

25|$|Diverticulitis surgery {{can be done}} in two ways: {{through a}} primary bowel {{resection}} or through a bowel resection with <b>colostomy.</b> Both bowel resections may be done in the traditional way or by laparoscopic surgery. The traditional bowel resection is made using an open surgical approach, called colectomy. During a colectomy, the patient is placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon performing a colectomy will make a lower midline incision in the abdomen or a lateral lower transverse incision. The diseased section of the large intestine is removed and then the two healthy ends are sewn or stapled back together. A <b>colostomy</b> may be performed when the bowel has to be relieved of its normal digestive work as it heals. A <b>colostomy</b> implies creating a temporary opening of the colon on the skin surface {{and the end of the}} colon is passed through the abdominal wall and a removable bag is attached to it. The waste will be collected in the bag.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{antibiotics and}} may involve drainage of the buboes or abscesses by needle aspiration or incision. Further supportive measure {{may need to}} be taken: dilatation of the rectal stricture, repair of rectovaginal fistulae, or <b>colostomy</b> for rectal obstruction.|$|E

Four months later, on her 60th birthday, the Associated Press reported that Fawcett {{was at that point}} cancer-free. However, in May 2007, Fawcett experienced a recurrence and {{was diagnosed}} with stage IV cancer that had metastasized to her liver (which has a 5-year survival rate of <20%); a malignant polyp was found where she had been treated for the initial cancer. Doctors contemplated whether to implant a radiation seeder (which differs from conventional radiation and is used to treat other types of cancer). Fawcett's U.S. doctors told her that she would require a <b>colostomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Zaharias was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer. After undergoing surgery, she made a comeback in 1954.

40|$|This study aims to {{validate}} a classification system of couple adjustment to cancer, developed with breast and prostate cancer patients. The classification proposes that couples undergo fluctuations between togetherness (“We”-ness) and separateness (“I”-ness) during their cancer experience, which may affirm or erode their mutual identity. The {{application of the}} classification system to couples coping with colorectal cancer (CRC) and permanent <b>colostomies</b> served as a novel approach to member checking {{as a means of}} validation. Nine couples were interviewed. Transcripts were coded for “I-We” shifts in couples’ adjustment, either as these were implicitly described within their dialogue, or as they were explicitly self-identified by the couple. With the exception of four “We”-eroding shifts, all of the previously identified shifts within the “I-We” classification system were observed. One new “I-We” shift was developed from this analysis. Implications to colorectal cancer patients with <b>colostomies</b> and theories of couple resilience emphasizing “We”-ness are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{anal cancer}} {{was treated with}} surgery, and in early-stage disease (i.e., {{localised}} cancer of the anus without metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes), surgery is often curative. The difficulty with surgery has been the necessity of removing {{the internal and external}} anal sphincter, with concomitant fecal incontinence. For this reason, many patients with anal cancer have required permanent <b>colostomies.</b>|$|R
50|$|People with <b>colostomies</b> must wear an ostomy {{pouching}} {{system to}} collect intestinal waste. Ordinarily the pouch must be emptied or changed {{a couple of}} times a day depending on the frequency of activity; in general the further from the anus (i.e., the further 'up' the intestinal tract) the ostomy is located the greater the output and more frequent the need to empty or change the pouch.|$|R
25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. <b>colostomy).</b> A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E
25|$|As {{he entered}} St. Peter's Square to address an {{audience}} on 13 May 1981, Pope John Paul II {{was shot and}} critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca, an expert Turkish gunman {{who was a member}} of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves. The assassin used a Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times. John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds. Surgeons performed a <b>colostomy,</b> temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery. The pope later stated that Our Lady of Fátima helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.|$|E

However, an interview transcript in which Lawrence stated that Oppenheimer [...] "should never again have anything to do with the forming of policy" [...] was presented at the hearing, and several other members of Lawrence's Radiation laboratory did testify against Oppenheimer in person.
