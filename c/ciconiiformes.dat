5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the albatross {{group has been}} a source of much debate. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order, <b>Ciconiiformes,</b> whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes. The albatrosses can be separated from the other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight).|$|E
5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.

Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from <b>Ciconiiformes</b> and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.

Some fishes, such as tilapia, are also found. Its recognized importance is as a breeding, passage and wintering area for numerous bird species: as many as 300–400 breeding pairs of wading birds in the <b>Ciconiiformes</b> {{can be found in}} the eastern zone of the lagoon. Important avian raptor species of the lake include the osprey, Pandion haliaetus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cormorants}} are a group {{traditionally placed}} within the Pelecaniformes or, in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy, the expanded <b>Ciconiiformes.</b> This latter group {{is certainly not}} a natural one, and even after the tropicbirds have been recognised as quite distinct, the remaining Pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely monophyletic. Their relationships and delimitation – apart from {{being part of a}} [...] "higher waterfowl" [...] clade which is similar but not identical to Sibley and Ahlquist's [...] "pan-Ciconiiformes" [...] – remain mostly unresolved. Notwithstanding, all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the darters and Sulidae (gannets and boobies), and perhaps the pelicans or even penguins, than to all other living birds.|$|E
2500|$|Usually the {{starlings}} {{are considered}} a family, as is done here. Sibley & Monroe included the mimids {{in the family and}} demoted the starlings to tribe rank, as Sturnini. This treatment was used by Zuccon et al. However, the grouping of Sibley & Monroe (besides leaving the subfamily rank vacant) is overly coarse due to methodological drawbacks of their DNA-DNA hybridization technique and most of their proposed revisions of taxonomic rank have not been accepted (see for example <b>Ciconiiformes).</b> The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping is all but noninformative as regards biogeography, and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the clade consisting of Sibley/Monroe's [...] "pan-Sturnidae" [...] would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} for sure about the {{colouration}} of these birds, as they have not left living descendants. But some inferences can be made based on their phylogeny: {{if they were a}} member of the [...] "higher waterbird" [...] group (see below), they most probably had a plumage similar to that depicted in the reconstruction of Osteodontornis orri – Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes in the modern sense (or <b>Ciconiiformes,</b> if Pelecaniformes are merged there) have hardly any carotenoid or structural colors at all in their plumage, and generally lack even phaeomelanins. Thus, the only colours commonly found in these birds are black, white and various shades of grey. Some have patches of iridescent feathers, or brownish or reddish hues, but these are rare and limited in extent, and those species in which they are found (e.g. bitterns, ibises or the hammerkop) are generally only found in freshwater habitat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{systematics}} of bony-toothed {{birds are}} subject of considerable debate. Initially, they were {{allied with the}} (then-paraphyletic) [...] "Pelecaniformes" [...] (pelicans and presumed allies, such as gannets and frigatebirds) and the Procellariiformes (tube-nosed seabirds like albatrosses and petrels), because of their similar general anatomy. Some of the first remains of the massive Dasornis were mistaken for a ratite's and later a diatryma's. They were even used to argue for a close relationship between these two groups – and indeed, the pelicans and tubenoses, {{as well as for}} example the other [...] "Pelecaniformes" [...] (cormorants and allies) which are preferably separated as Phalacrocoraciformes nowadays, the <b>Ciconiiformes</b> (storks and/or either herons and ibises or the [...] "core" [...] Pelecaniformes) and Gaviiformes (loons/divers) seem to make up a radiation, possibly a clade, of [...] "higher waterbirds". However, the Pelagornithidae are not generally held to be a missing link between pelicans and albatrosses anymore, but if anything much closer to the former and only convergent to the latter in ecomorphology.|$|E
2500|$|As their {{relationships}} are still unresolved between Galloanserae and [...] "higher waterbirds", the pseudotooth birds are here {{placed in the}} distinct order Odontopterygiformes as a compromise, {{rather than in a}} pelecaniform/ciconiiform or anseriform suborder Odontopterygia or even a family of the Anseriformes, <b>Ciconiiformes</b> or Pelecaniformes. Such a treatment is unlikely to be completely wrong in either case, as the pseudotooth birds are well distinct from the Presbyornithidae and Scopidae, today generally regarded as the very basal divergences of, respectively, the Anseriformes and the pelican-stork group. It also provides leeway should the proposed separation of the Pelagornithidae into several families turn out to be appropriate. It is perhaps notable that when Boris Spulski established the Odontopterygia in 1910, he did this partly because he noted some of the similarities between pseudotooth birds and waterfowl listed above. Dasornis was long mistaken for a diatryma (Gastornithiformes), now strongly suspected to be very close indeed to the Anseriformes. Also, the pelagornithid Palaeochenoides mioceanus was initially mistaken for an anseriform, and the same might hold true for the supposed Oligocene swan Guguschia nailiae. In the former case, however, a [...] "much the more convincing" [...] analysis for a placement outside the Galloanseres was published the year after its description already. Most unrecognised pelagornithid bones were initially assigned to [...] "higher waterbird" [...] families however, typically to the (then-paraphyletic) [...] "Pelecaniformes", but in particular the tarsometatarsus was typically mistaken for that of a procellariiform. The Odontopterygiformes were first proposed when Osteodontornis was described from the first – and still the only known – reasonably complete skeleton of one of these birds. Hildegarde Howard found that, no matter that some of its features resembled other birds, the combination was quite unlike any neognath known.|$|E
