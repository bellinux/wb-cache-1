40|$|Aim: To quantitatively analyse energy intake {{reported}} by {{young men and}} {{the accuracy of the}} Goldberg <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> for identifying misreporters. [...] - Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which: food intake was assessed by a four-day food record; resting metabolic rate was assessed by indirect calorimetry; percentage body fat was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; and energy expenditure was assessed by physical activity record completed simultaneously with food intake measurements. Energy intake was analysed by direct comparison of energy intake and energy expenditure and by the Goldberg cut-off. Subjects: 34 healthy men aged 18 – 25 years. Setting: Queensland University of Technology, Queensland, Australia. Main outcome measures: percentage of misreporters in a group of young men using different methods. Statistical analyses: data are presented as means and standard deviations. The analyses were conducted using Statistic for Windows 5. 5 software. [...] - Results: Seven underreporters were identified by direct comparison of energy intake and energy expenditure. The Goldberg cut-off found six out of the seven underreporters identified by direct comparison of energy intake and energy expenditure, but wrongly identified two acceptable reporters as underreporters. The sensitivity and specificity of the Goldberg <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> were 0. 86 and 0. 93, respectively. [...] - Conclusions: Seven out of 34 participants underreported their energy intake. In the absence of physical activity measurements, the Goldberg <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> identified underreporters in this group of young men with assessed resting metabolic rate. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{address a}} {{frequently}} asked {{question on the}} covariance fitting of the highly correlated data such as our $B_K$ data based on the SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory. Basically, {{the essence of the}} problem is that we do not have an accurate fitting function enough to fit extremely precise data. When eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are small, even a tiny error of fitting function yields large chi-square and spoils the fitting procedure. We have applied a number of prescriptions available in the market such as the <b>cut-off</b> <b>method,</b> modified covariance matrix method, and Bayesian method. We also propose a brand new method, the eigenmode shift method which allows a full covariance fitting without modifying the covariance matrix at all. In our case, the eigenmode shift (ES) method and Bayesian method turn out to be the best prescription to the problem. We also provide a pedagogical example of data analysis in which the diagonal approximation and the <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> fail in fitting manifestly, but the ES method and the Bayesian approach work well.

40|$|<b>Methods</b> for specifying <b>cut-off</b> {{scores for}} a criterion-referenced test usually rely on {{judgments}} about item content and/or examinees. Comparisons of <b>cut-off</b> score <b>methods</b> {{have found that}} different methods result in different cut-off scores. This dissertation focuses on understanding why and how <b>cut-off</b> score <b>methods</b> are different. The importance of this understanding is reflected in practitioners 2 ̆ 7 needs to choose appropriate <b>cut-off</b> score <b>methods,</b> and to understand and control inappropriate factors that may influence the cut-off scores. ^ First, a taxonomy of <b>cut-off</b> score <b>methods</b> was developed. The taxonomy identified the generic categories of setting cut-off scores. Second, the research focused on three methods for estimating the errors associated with setting cut-off scores: generalizability theory, item response theory and bootstrap estimation. These approaches were applied to Angoff and Contrasting-groups <b>cut-off</b> score <b>methods.</b> ^ For the Angoff <b>cut-off</b> score <b>method,</b> the IRT index of consistency and analyses {{of the differences between}} judges 2 ̆ 7 ratings and expected test item difficulty, provided useful information for reviewing specific test items that judges were inconsistent in rating. In addition, the generalizability theory and bootstrap estimates were useful for overall estimates of the errors in judges 2 ̆ 7 ratings. ^ For the Contrasting-groups <b>cut-off</b> score <b>method,</b> the decision accuracy of the classroom cut-off scores was useful for identifying classrooms in which the classification of students may need to be reviewed by teachers. The bootstrap estimate of the pooled sample of students provided a useful overall estimate of the errors in the resulting cut-off score. ^ There are several extensions of this investigation that can be made. For example, {{there is a need to}} understand the magnitude of errors in relationship to the precision with which judges are able to rate test items or classify examinees; better ways of reporting and dealing with judges 2 ̆ 7 inconsistencies need to be developed; and the analysis of errors needs to be extended to other <b>cut-off</b> score <b>methods.</b> Finally, these procedures can provide the operational criterion against which improvements and comparisons of cut-off score procedures can be evaluated. ...|$|R

Most of the building maintenance works are carried out by contractors through quotation works. The selection of good contractors is important to ensure the successful completion of the project. The evaluation and selection of the contractors are usually carried out in three stages. The first stage is to check all relevant documents submitted by the contractors, the second stage is to evaluate the technical and financial capabilities of the contractors and the final stage is to evaluate the tender price. However, the tender price is evaluated either by the comparison of price quoted to the department estimate method or the evaluation of the price quoted by <b>cut-off</b> <b>method.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of the contractors selected through the ‘cut-off’ method and the ‘comparison against office estimate’ method and to identify the method preferred by the contractors. The objectives of the study are to study the quotation evaluation process in the selection of contractors for building maintenance work, to evaluate the performance of contractor selected through comparison of quoted price to the department estimate method, to assess the performance of contractor selected through the evaluation of the quoted price by <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> and to identify the method preferred by the contractor in evaluating the tender price. The scope of this study is conducted at JKR Daerah Johor Bahru. The study is carried out by interviews, questionnaires and through records checking at the JKR’s office. A total of 100 questionnaires were distributed and 50 questionnaires were returned duly answered. The data is analyzed using Average Index. From the study, the evaluation process for contractors executing minor works comprises of 3 stages namely; Stage 1, checking all documents submitted by the contractors, Stage 2 : analyzing the technical and financial status of contractors and stage 3 : analyzing the contractors’ tender amount.

40|$|Abstract Background Physician cost {{profiles}} (also called efficiency {{or economic}} profiles) compare {{the costs of}} care provided by a physician {{to his or her}} peers. These profiles are increasingly being used as the basis for policy applications such as tiered physician networks. Tiers (low, average, high cost) are currently defined by health plans based on percentile cut-offs which do not account for statistical uncertainty. In this paper we compare the percentile <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> to another method, using statistical testing, for identifying high-cost or low-cost physicians. Methods We created a claims dataset of 2004 - 2005 data from four Massachusetts health plans. We employed commercial software to create episodes of care and assigned responsibility for each episode to the physician with the highest proportion of professional costs. A physicians' cost profile was the ratio of the sum of observed costs divided by the sum of expected costs across all assigned episodes. We discuss a new method of measuring standard errors of physician cost profiles which can be used in statistical testing. We then assigned each physician to one of three cost categories (low, average, or high cost) using two methods, percentile cut-offs and a t-test (p-value ≤ 0. 05), and assessed the level of disagreement between the two methods. Results Across the 8689 physicians in our sample, 29. 5 % of physicians were assigned a different cost category when comparing the percentile <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> and the t-test. This level of disagreement varied across specialties (17. 4 % gastroenterology to 45. 8 % vascular surgery).

The main scope of this research is to identify and assess the existing procedure that has been implemented in UiTM and comparing it with the procedure of other agencies in Malaysia and to propose recommendations to UiTM for improvement of the tender process and evaluation. The data gathered for this project were mainly from the Pejabat Pembangunan, Pejabat Pengurusan Fasiliti of UiTM and from interview sessions with personnel from other agencies. The agencies involved were Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), Telekom Malaysia (TM), Public Work Department (PWD) and Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID). The interviews conducted were to evaluate processes, as well as looking into the standard guidelines used by them.

40|$|Abstract. Parameterized systems (e. g., network protocols) are compo-sitions of {{a number}} of isomorphic, finite-state processes. While correct-ness is decidable for any fixed-size instance, {{correctness}} over all instances is undecidable in general. Typical proof methods, such as those based on process invariants or cutoffs, rely on summarizing the behavior of a pa-rameterized system by a finite-state process. While these methods have been applied successfully to particular protocols, it is unknown whether such summarization is always possible. In this paper, it is shown that—after essential modifications—the <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> (which has the most stringent requirements) is complete for safety properties. The proof also shows that cutoff proofs are equivalent to determining inductive invariants. The paper studies this question next, presenting a new algorithm to construct universally quantified inductive invariants. The algorithm computes the strongest invariant of a given shape, and is therefore complete. The key to this result is a previously unnoticed connection between inductiveness, small model theorems, and compositional analysis, which is interesting in its own right. ...|$|E

Kartläggning av produkters totala miljöpåverkan genom livscykelanalyser (LCA), och sammanställning i miljödeklarationer typ III (EPD), kan vara en åtgärd för att minska deras miljöbelastning. Syftet med examensarbetet är att definiera skedet för en byggnads livsavslut, för rivningen av byggnaden med efterföljande aktiviteter, ämnat för miljödeklarationer typ III och praktisera resultaten i en fallstudie. Syftet inkluderar även en utvärdering av beräkningsproceduren för miljöbelastningar och miljöbesparingar relaterade byggnaden men belagda utanför dess systemgränser. Resultaten ska utgöra underlag för produktkategoriregler (PCR) för byggnader. Arbetet baserades på litteratur, inklusive studiet av standarderna SS-EN 15804 : 2012 och SS-EN 15978 : 2011, LCA-metodik, en fallstudie och semistrukturerade intervjuer. Systemgränserna för byggnadens livsavslut baserades på EN 15804, där miljöinformationen från fallstudiens LCA presenterades separat i informationsmodulerna Rivning, Transport, Avfallshantering och Sluthantering. Vid allokering av miljöbelastningar mellan flera produktsystem var två {{open-loop}} allokeringsmetoder kompatibla med EN 15804 : cut-off metoden och extraction-load metoden. En tredje metod utvecklades och namngavs hybrid-metoden. Alla tre allokeringsmetoderna utvärderades i fallstudien, i vilken aktuella rivnings-, sorterings- och avfallsbehandlingsprocesser även kartlades och livscykel-modellerades. Cut-off metoden bidrog till lägst beräknad miljöpåverkan och var den metod som var fullt kompatibel med direktiven i EN 15804. På grund av dess kompatibilitet med EN 15804 så rekommenderas cut-off metoden vid allokering mellan flera produktsystem. Övrig allokering ska göras enligt principen att den som är villig att betala för ett material också ska hållas ansvarig för miljöbelastningen som materialet genom dess förbrukning genererar (PPP), samt den stegvisa allokeringsproceduren i EN 15804. Det fordras dock ytterligare diskussioner om vad miljödeklarationer typ III egentligen kan och borde bidra till eftersom valet av open-loop allokeringsmetod premierar och ger incitament till olika aktiviteter; så också cut-off metoden. I fallstudien identifierades ytterligare tvetydigheter i EN 15804 gällande redovisningsformen för biogena utsläpp och upptag av koldioxid, beräkningsreglerna för undviken miljöpåverkan relaterade sekundära bränslen, samt geografisk detaljnivå vid modellering av teknologier. För att undvika godtyckligheter behöver detta förtydligas i det fortsatta arbetet med PCR för byggnader. Climate {{change as}} a consequence of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases may be the biggest challenge of our time. One potential measure to reduce the environmental impact of products is to map their total environmental burden with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and compile the results in Environmental Product Declarations type III (EPD), to facilitate a comparison of their environmental impacts. The aim of this master thesis is to define the end-of-life stage of buildings for an EPD and practice the results in a case study based on current technologies. The aim also includes an evaluation and practical application of the calculation procedure of environmental loads and benefits related the building but located outside of its system boundaries. The results should undertake the form of Product Category Rules (PCR) for buildings. The thesis is based on literature, including the study of the standards SS-EN 15804 : 2012 and SS-EN 15978 - 2011, LCA methodology, one case study and semi-structured interviews. The design of the end-of-life stage of buildings was based on EN 15804, wherein the environmental information from the LCA should be presented according to the modularity principle in the information modules De-construction/Demolition, Transport, Waste processing and Disposal. Two open-loop allocation methods were compatible with the EN 15804 in allocation of environmental burdens among two or more product systems: the <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> and the extraction-load method. A third open-loop allocation method was developed and given the name the hybrid-method since it was based on the cut-off and the extraction-load method. All three open-loop allocation methods were evaluated in a case study, which also aimed to map and life cycle model current demolition practices as well as sorting and waste treatment processes. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> contributed to the lowest calculated environmental impact and was the method that had the best compliancy with the principles of EN 15804. Due to its compliancy with EN 15804, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> is recommended when allocating burdens among several product systems. Other types of allocation shall be based on the polluter pays principle (PPP) and the stepwise allocation procedure given in EN 15804. However, even though the <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> had the best compliancy with the system boundaries drawn in EN 15804, a discussion is needed regarding the actual purpose of an EPD; a discussion addressing the potential of an EPD to change environmental misbehavior. That is because of the incentives imbedded in the open-loop allocation methods, as the choice of method rewards or discredits specific activities. Finally, some major ambiguities were identified during the case study – especially regarding the treatment of biogenic carbon, the calculation rules of avoided burdens related secondary fuels, and the geographical level of detail in the life cycle modeling of technologies – which do need to be clarified in the continued development of a PCR for buildings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the Casimir force {{acting on a}} d-dimensional rectangular piston due to massless scalar field with periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and electromagnetic field with perfect electric conductor and perfect magnetic conductor boundary conditions. The Casimir energy in a rectangular cavity is derived by using <b>cut-off</b> <b>method,</b> and it is shown that its regular part {{coincides with the result}} obtained by zeta regularization method. The divergent parts of the Casimir energy from the interior and exterior regions of the piston are shown to contribute Casimir force of equal magnitude but opposite signs. Therefore the Casimir force acting on the piston is divergence free. It is verified analytically that at any temperature, the Casimir force acting on the piston increases from − ∞ to 0 when the separation a between the piston and the opposite wall increases from 0 to ∞. This implies that the Casimir force is always an attractive force pulling the piston towards the interior region, and the magnitude of the force gets larger as the separation a gets smaller. Explicit exact expressions for the Casimir force for small and larg...|$|E
30|$|We have {{estimated}} the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) using the dual <b>cut-off</b> <b>method</b> developed by Alkire and Foster (2007, 2011), which is disseminated in the Human Development Report (HDR) 2010 (UNDP 2010). It has used three dimensions, namely, education, {{standard of living}} and health, and assigns an equal weight to each dimension and an equal weight to each indicator within each dimension. A household gets a weighted deprivation score according {{to the number of}} weighted deprivations experienced by that household, and the total weighted deprivation score ranges between 0 and 1. A household is identified as multidimensional poor if the household’s weighted deprivation score is more than 0.33, which is one third of the total weighted deprivation score. The dimensions, indicators, weights and mean values are presented in Table  1. The weighting of variables and dimensions in the AF method is based on normative decision that assigns an equal weight to each dimension and an equal weight to variables within each dimension. The cut-off point of 0.33 is based on distribution. However, while we have used the equal weighting of dimension and indicators, a cut-off point of 0.34 is used because with that score, a household will be poor in more than one dimension.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we attempt to}} show in a clear and simple manner the {{fundamental}} ideas of the Renormalization Theory. With that intention we use two well-known problems of the Physic and Engeneering undergraduate students, the calculation of the electrostatic and vector potential of a infinite line charge density and current, respectively. We still employ different regularization <b>methods</b> (<b>cut-off,</b> dimensional and zeta function) and the arising of the scale parameter is consider. Comment: 9 pages, text in Portugues...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the effect}} of the {{terminations}} is to cause a rounding of the frequency response at <b>cut-off.</b> The image <b>method</b> predicts a sharp discontinuity in the slope of the response at cut-off which is not realised in practice, although a well designed image filter may get close to this. Another prediction of the image method is zero loss in the passband (assuming ideal lossless components). Again, this cannot be achieved in practice because reflections from the end terminations always cause some loss.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{accuracy}} of the Euclidean Distance Discriminant rule (EDDR) is studied in the high-dimensional asymptotic framework which allows the dimensionality to exceed sample size. Under mild assumptions on the traces of the covariance matrix, our new results provide the asymptotic distribution of the conditional misclassification error and the explicit expression for the consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected misclassification error. To get these properties, new results on the asymptotic normality of the quadratic forms and traces of the higher power of Wishart matrix, are established. Using our asymptotic results, we further develop two generic methods of determining a cut-off point for EDDR to adjust the misclassification errors. Finally, we numerically justify the high {{accuracy of}} our asymptotic findings along with the <b>cut-off</b> determination <b>methods</b> in finite sample applications, inclusive of the large sample and high-dimensional scenarios...|$|R
