40|$|Abstract. Compact deformation- induced {{martensite}} {{found in}} Fe- 25 Ni- 0. 66 C alloys {{has been studied}} by using optical, electron and scanning electron microscopy. The compact martensite consists {{of a large number}} of martensites with different variants connected closely to form large bulk in which almost no residual austenite remains. Its formation process is by further growth of thin plates to form lenticular plates and possible crossing and <b>coalesence</b> to form bulky martensite. These growth and <b>coalesence</b> are through martensitic twinning or twinning domains during deformation which leads to various interactions between the plates including cross, insert, coalescence and conversion. The substructure of the martensite is a crisscross twinning net. The corresponding deformation modes of the austenite are also studied. 1...|$|E

40|$|Achieving the {{demanding}} sensitivity and bandwidth, envisaged for third generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories, is extremely challenging {{with a single}} broadband interferometer. Very high optical powers (Megawatts) are required to reduce the quantum noise contribution at high frequencies, while the interferometer mirrors have to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures {{in order to reduce}} thermal noise sources at low frequencies. To resolve this potential conflict of cryogenic test masses with high thermal load, we present a conceptual design for a 2 -band xylophone configuration for a third generation GW observatory, composed of a high-power, high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-power, low-frequency instrument. Featuring inspiral ranges of 3200 Mpc and 38000 Mpc for binary neutron stars and binary black holes <b>coalesences,</b> respectively, we find that the potential sensitivity of xylophone configurations can be significantly wider and better than what is possible in a single broadband interferometer...|$|R

Particular attention was given to <b>coalesence.</b> This mechanism involves annihilation production of along the boundary of matter-antimatter, high energy photons, electrons, and positrons.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the production of}} antideuterons from decaying dark matter, using gravitinos in supersymmetric models with trilinear R-parity violating (RPV) operators as an example. The model used for antideuteron formation is shown to induce large uncertainties in the predicted flux, comparable to uncertainties from cosmic-ray propagation models. We improve on the formation model by tuning hadronization and <b>coalesence</b> parameters in Monte Carlo simulations to better reproduce the hadron spectra relevant for antideuteron production. In light of current bounds on fluxes and future prospects from the AMS-II and GAPS experiments we set limits on RPV couplings {{as a function of}} the gravitino mass.

Xu, C. Iwamoto and S. -I. Tanaka in 1996 [1]. The structural and morphological changes with irradiation time are studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thin film-like crystalline Cu 3 N which is covered with amorphous or polycrystalline cuprite (Cu 2 O) layer in the as-received Cu mask plays a role of target. Polycrystalline Cu 3 N nanoparticles nucleate and grow up to the average size of 15 nm after 30 sec-irradiation. <b>Coalesence</b> of 50 nm-sized grown Cu 3 N nanoparticles forms polycrystalline thin film after 2 min-irradiation and its growth behavior follows Volmer-Weber mode.

40|$|The {{effect of}} shear {{velocity}} gradients {{on the size}} (L) of rodlike micelles in dilute and semidilute solution is considered. A kinetic equation is introduced for the time-dependent concentration of aggregates of length L, consisting of 'bimolecular' combination processes L + L-prime yield (L + L-prime) and unimolecular fragmentations L yield L + (L - L-prime). The former are described by a generalization (from spheres to rods) of the Smoluchowski mechanism for shear-induced <b>coalesence</b> of emulsions, and the latter by incorporating the tension-deformation effects due to flow. Steady-state solutions to the kinetic equation are obtained, with the corresponding mean micellar size evaluated {{as a function of}} the Peclet number P (i. e., the dimensionless ratio of the flow rate and the rotational diffusion coefficient). For sufficiently dilute solutions, only a weak dependence of the micellar size on P is found. In the semidilute regime, however, an apparent divergence in the micellar size at P of about 1 suggests a flow-induced first-order gelation phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|For {{relativistic}} {{heavy ion}} collisions the energy {{flow in the}} collision reveals information on the equation of state of matter at high density. The BRAHMS experiment has studied the relation between multipliciity in the sidewards direction and zero degree energy using our Tile Multiplicity Array and Zero Degree Calorimeters. To understand this spectrum requires {{a knowledge of the}} <b>coalesence</b> of nucleons that are close in phase space. We have also studied electromagnetic collisions and compared our results to lower energy data. As the center of mass energy increases, each nucleus sees a stronger electromagnetic field resulting in more energy being absorbed. This in turn causes an increase in the neutron multiplicity. 1 The Experimental Setup The BRAHMS experiment consists of two movable spectrometers and three detector systems to measure global variables for each event, 1.

40|$|Assuring {{transport}} and separation {{of oil and}} water crude emulsions is of significant importance to {{the oil and gas}} industries. The crude oil, due to its profuse chemical composition, has complex dispersion and emulsion flow behavior with water. As a result, of the interface chemistry, the bubbles and droplets may separate easily, or not separate at all, impacting flow regime, water holdup, pressure drop and separation efficiency during pipe transport. Using a recently developed new stirred tank characterization technique for emulsion stability droplet relaxation parameters can be studied. Multiple model oils and crude oils were characterized by this technique. This work discusses development of a pragmatic modeling method that can validate the experimental measurements. A time averaged velocity profile in a stirred tank is used to obtain a 1 -D flux flow profile in the vertical direction. This 1 -D flux profile is used as a simplified flow equation and scalar equations for droplet size and dispersed phase fraction is used for modeling the emulsion stability and relaxation. This method can help in fast simulation of emulsion stability that involves long time scales of <b>coalesence</b> and breakage evolution for crude oil and water...|$|E
40|$|NA 44 has {{measured}} mid-rapidity deuteron spectra from AA collisions at sqrt{s}= 18 GeV/A at the CERN SPS. Combining these spectra with published proton, antiproton and antideuteron data {{allows us}} to calculate, within a coalescence framework, proton and antiproton source sizes and phase space densities. These results are compared to pion source sizes and densities, pA results and to lower energy (AGS) data. The antiproton source {{is larger than the}} proton source at sqrt{s}= 18 GeV/A. The phase space densities of pions and protons are not constant but grow with system size. Both pi+ and proton radii decrease with transverse mass and increase with sqrt{s}. Pions and protons do not freeze-out independently. The nature of their interaction changes as sqrt{s}, and the pion/proton ratio increases. Comment: 4 pages, Latex 2. 09, 3 eps figures.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{a potential}} impact of turbulent velocity fluctuations of the air on a drizzle formation in Cumulus clouds. Two different representations of turbulent velocity fluctuations for a microphysics formulated in a Lagrangian framework are discussed - random walk model and the interpolation, {{and its effect on}} microphysical properties of the cloud investigated. Turbulent velocity fluctuations significantly enhances velocity differences between colliding droplets, especially those having small sizes. As a result drizzle forms faster in simulations including a representation of turbulence. Both representations of turbulent velocity fluctuations, random walk and interpolation, have similar effect on droplet spectrum evolution, but interpolation of the velocity does account for a possible anisotropy in the air velocity. All discussed simulations show relatively large standard deviation (∼ 1 μm) of the cloud droplet distribution from the onset of cloud formation is observed. Because <b>coalesence</b> processes aerosol inside cloud droplets, detail information about aerosol is available. Results from numerical simulations show that changes in aerosol spectrum due to aerosol processing during droplet coalescence are relatively small during ∼ 20 min. of the cloud evolution simulated with numerical model.

40|$|The {{complexation}} {{of proteins}} with phenolic compounds has been recently considered a promising route {{to improve the}} oxidative stability of food dispersions, such as oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. However, the effect of such a complexation on the functional properties of proteins, such as their emulsifying and interfacial properties, has not been deeply studied yet. To gain insight on this matter, non-covalently bonded protein-phenol complexes were formed in aqueous dispersions. Highly pure sunflower protein isolate (SFPI, 94 wt%) and the polar phenolic compound chlorogenic acid (CGA) were mixed at neutral pH and the resulting complexes were characterised regarding their size and interfacial properties. Larger amounts of CGA led to more extensive complexation, therefore larger complexes, and reduction of free protein molecules. Hydrogen bonding was indicated as the main form of interaction between the elements. Sunflower proteins were able to adsorb at the oil-water interface and thereby to decrease the interfacial tension. The latter was further decreased when the complexes were used instead of the sole SFPI. Furthermore, O/W emulsion droplets stabilized by the complexes exhibited high stability against <b>coalesence.</b> These {{results indicate that the}} physical interactions between SFPI and CGA positively affected the interfacial and emulsifying properties of sunflower proteins. This is an intriguing bottom line regarding the challenges (e. g discoloration, loss of solubility and nutritional value) associated with full valorization of sunflower oil extraction residues and in general protein fractions rich in phenolic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} elements {{used in the}} binder system for the injection moulding of titanium metal powders will change the final composition when not adequately controlled. Excess levels of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen adversly effect the mechanical properties by embrittlement. Before sintering debinding is done to remove the maximum possible amount binder thereby ensuring residual carbon levels are minimal. Testing the mechanical properties of samples can acknowledge deficiencies in the final part however, identification {{of the nature of}} the deficiencies is not so simple. In this work titanium-based metal parts were made using the metal injection moulding process and the microstructure was inspected. The investigation used scanning electron microscopy imaging, electron dispersion spectroscopy point and area mapping, LECO trace analysis and X-ray diffraction elemental mapping. Following this samples were ground and polished before immersing their surfaces in an etching solution to further expose the microstructure. Although the data collected from debinding indicated the binder had been removed prior to sintering contamination was still evident. This result showed that the traditional means of reporting binder levels in proportion to part mass after debinding is inaccurate. Subsequently laser induced breakdown spectroscopy was trialed as a method by which to determine the binder levels for parts in the green, grey, brown and sintered form. Interstitial carbon is a known alpha stabiliser however excess carbon on particle surfaces may impinge on particle <b>coalesence</b> limiting density levels. Comparison of the part mass method of binder determination with the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy results showed that the mass determination method was more accurate for the green and grey parts but the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy results were able to detect the residual binder more accurately for brown and sintered parts...|$|E
40|$|Beginning {{with their}} {{discovery}} by Buck & Axel (1991), {{a series of}} significant advances mark our increased understanding of odor receptors (ORs) and their roles in both odor transduction and axon <b>coalesence</b> (Imai & Sakano, 2008). Somewhat unexpectedly, the family of 1200 + ORs (Zhang & Firestein, 2002) found in the main olfactory epithelium exhibit little homology {{to those found in}} the vomeronasal organ where two families, of over 300 vomeronasal receptors (VRs) (Touhara, 2008) mediate pheromone detection. They differ in many respects, including the downstream transduction cascade, but share the elegant property of allelic exclusion, which results in any one sensory neuron expressing one OR or VR from either the maternal or paternal chromosome, but not both. While the significance of allelic exclusion in processing sensory information in the olfactory and vomeronasal systems remains unknown, the mechanisms regulating allelic exclusion are of intense interest. In this issue, Capello et al. (2009) address the question of whether mechanisms of allelic exclusion are similar in both the olfactory and vomeronasal sensory systems. They approached the question using a mouse model in which the odorant receptor M 71, normally expressed in the main olfactory epithelium, is now expressed in the vomeronasal organ. This was achieved by using the promoter region of the vomeronasal gene V 1 RB 2 to direct the expression of M 71 in vomeronasal sensory neurons in lieu of V 1 RB 2 expression. It was advantageous that M 71 has a low percentage of identity with V 1 RB 2 protein, or with any member of the V 1 R family of vomeronasal receptors. Previous results showed that axons from new M 71 > V 1 rb 2 neurons target the accessory olfactory bulb where they coalesce to form homogenous glomeruli (Rodriguez et al., 1999). Here, Capello et al. (2009) show that these neurons do not express the endogenous V 1 RB 2 receptor or any member of the V 1 R family of genes. Because members of the odor transduction cascade are important in axon targeting from th...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the course}} of this master thesis project, subcooled {{nucleate}} boiling in a vertical pipe has been modeled using CFD. The modeling has been carried out within the OpenFOAM framework and a two-phase Eulerian approach has been chosen. The code can be used to predict the distribution of the local ow parameters, i. e. the void fraction, the bubble diameter, the velocity of both liquid and gas, the turbulent intensity as well as the liquid temperature. Special attention has been devoted to the phenomena which govern the void fraction distribution in the radial direction. Two di erent solvers have been implemented and the simulations have been performed in two dimensions. Firstly, isothermal turbulent bubbly ow is mechanistically modeled in a solver named myTwoPhaseEulerFoa-mAdiabatic. The conservation equations of mass and momentum are solved for the two phases, taking special care in the modeling of the interfacial forces. The turbulence phenomena are described by a classical k- model in combination with standard wall functions for the near-wall treatment. Furthermore, an interfacial area concentration equation is solved and two di erent models for its sink- and source terms (corresponding to bubble <b>coalesence</b> and bubble breakup) have been investigated. Secondly, a solver named myTwoPhaseEulerFoamBoiling has been developed based on the rst solver in order to model a heated wall leading to subcooled nucleate boiling and subsequent condensation in the subcooled liquid. Additional terms accounting for the phase change have been included in the mass and momentum conservation equations {{as well as in the}} interfacial area equation. Assuming the gas phase being at saturation conditions, only one energy equation for the liquid phase needs to be solved. The adiabatic solver has been validated against the DEDALE experiment and the simulation results showed satisfactory agreement with the measured data. The predictions obtained from myTwoPhaseEulerFoam-Boiling have been compared to the DEBORA experimental data base. They are qualitatively similar but rather high quantitative discrepancies exist. Grid dependence tests revealed that the latter solver depends on the near-wall grid resolution, a yet unresolved issue related to the application of the wall heat ux as the boundary condition. However, the results were shown to be insensitive to small variations in the applied inlet conditions...|$|E
40|$|Zinc(II), copper(II), and copper(I) {{complexes}} of the pentadentate ligand, ((5 -MeimidH) 2 DAP) {{were prepared}} and studied as their (BF 4) - salts. The divalent compounds, (M II((5 -MeimidH) 2 DAP)) (BF 4) 2 (M = Zn, Cu), {{were found to}} have intermediate geometries between idealized trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal structures by x-ray crystallography. It is assumed that (Cu I((5 -MeimidH) 2 DAP)) (BF 4) is also pentacoordinate as is its parent compound, (Cu I((imidH) 2 DAP)) (BF 4). In addition to the x-ray structures, the new compounds have been fully characterized, where appropriate, by a battery of techniques for both the solid and solution states. These studies all suggest that the pentacoordinate structures of the solid state are also retained in solution. Variable-temperature proton NMR studies in non-aqueous solvents were used to extensively probe the intramolecular conformational dynamics of (M((5 -MeimidH) 2 DAP)) n+ (M = Zn(II), Cu(I)) and two related pentacoordinate systems ((M((imidH) 2 DAP)) n+ and (M((py) 2 DAP)) n+). Computer simulation of the temperature-dependent methylene proton regions were used to observe λ and δ chelate ring conformations. <b>Coalesence</b> rate constants were obtained in four of the six cases. The electron self-exchange rate of the (Cu((5 -MeimidH) 2 DAP)) +/ 2 + couple was measured in CD 3 CN, as a function of temperature, by dynamic NMR line-broadening techniques. Under controlled conditions (μ = 25 mM), the observed rate constant ranged from 0. 9 (± 0. 1) × 104 M- 1 s- 1 (243 K) to 3. 9 (± 0. 4) × 104 M- 1 s- 1 (293 K) with activation parameters of ΔH = 12. 5 kJ mol- 1 and ΔS = - 116 J mol- 1 K- 1. The present electron self-exchange rate constant, together with those for two related Cu(I/II) couples ((Cu((imidH) 2 DAP)) +/ 2 + and (Cu((py) 2 DAP)) +/ 2 +) indicate a possible relationship between intramolecular dynamics of the Cu(I) species and the electron self-exchange rates of the Cu(I/II) couples. Finally, the reactivity of (Cu I((5 -MeimidH) 2 DAP)) + towards O 2 was investigated and found to be something other than a reversible process. Although an initial uptake stoichiometry of 2 Cu:O 2 was obtained by manometry, a Toepler pump experiment showed that regeneration of Cu(I) proceeded without significant release of O 2...|$|E
