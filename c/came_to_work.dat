5|$|As Part III progresses, the {{narrative}} switches to describing their upper-class {{life on the}} island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born into. The story of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for Laura, although much of her family was not so lucky.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith's nephew Henry Frank Peterson <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{with her}} at the library, and began to {{organize}} the books into a faceted classification scheme that she specified, one which used one- and two-digit numbers to stand for general subjects, and three-digit numbers to indicate individual books in that subject. Before this, Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books; she had wished to continue the reading-room atmosphere that she had established.|$|E

5|$|The 15th and 16th centuries {{were known}} as Poland's Złoty Wiek or Golden Age. Many works of Polish Renaissance art and {{architecture}} were created, including ancient synagogues in Kraków's Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz, such as the Old Synagogue. During the reign of Casimir IV, various artists <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and live in Kraków, and Johann Haller established a printing press in the city after Kasper Straube had printed the Calendarium Cracoviense, the first work printed in Poland, in 1473.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of Kansas Saloon Smashers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for Edison as a cameraman in 1900. Eventually, Porter became the director {{responsible for all}} of Edison Studios' output. Porter based the set off of {{a photograph of a}} wrecked saloon which appeared in the Journal, while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper. Porter frequently read the publication when he wanted inspiration on topics that filmgoers would be interested in.|$|E
5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented {{a new and more}} complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.|$|E

5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as a {{chef and}} servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton {{and his wife}} Gertrude had previously served {{in the house of}} Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E
