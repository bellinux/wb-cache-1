It finds that spending on education and health is procyclical in developing countries and acyclical in developed countries. In addition, education and health expenditures follow an asymmetric pattern in developing countries; they are procyclical during periods of positive output gap and acyclical during periods of negative output gap. Furthermore, the degree of cyclicality is higher the lower the level of economic development.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, Regions have been {{experiencing}} deep {{changes that have}} highlighted their need to become accountable towards their stakeholders. This need for accountability can be satisfied, first of all, by the budgeting and financial statement system. As this matter, Regions have renewed this system thanks to legislative decree 76 / 2000 that lets each Region significant choices regarding some relevant aspects. This article focuses its attention on the cases of Liguria and Lombardia Regions, in order to underline how different approaches relating to the budgeting and financial statement system are able to satisfy, in different ways, the need for accountability. In details, {{the structure of the}} budgeting and financial statement system of the Liguria Region can meet the need for financial and political accountability. The <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (in the “Annual Budget” and then in the “Financial Reporting”) and the decision to draft a separate document (“Objective-Functions based Budget”) for the representation of financial resources based on regional policies allow, in fact, to know the priorities of the regional administration on the allocation of resources. This facilitates a clear assignment of responsibilities to politicians and managers and the communication towards citizens also in order to consolidate their consensus to the majority government. With regard to the Lombardia Region, instead, the hierarchy of objectives can meet the need for managerial accountability, as it makes clear the relationship between the implementation of sector regional policies (listed in the regional planning document – “Regional Development Plan”) and the achievement of objectives by each responsibility centres (listed in the “Annual Operative Budget”). Furthermore, the document (“Management Report”) attached to the “Financial Reporting” communicates the activities developed, meeting the need for political accountability. In the face of innovations introduced, it should be reported as in both Regions the budgeting and financial statement system will focus on the traditional financial dimension of management, ignoring the economic one...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Mali’s Request for a Three-Year Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. Mali’s {{economic}} situation improved in 2003, {{in spite of}} a difficult regional environment. The IMF staff considers that the government’s medium-term program, which is aligned to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) policy agenda, offers a strong framework for Mali to implement its poverty reduction strategy, pursue fiscal consolidation, and continue the reform process. The IMF staff also notes the progress made in implementing the PRSP, as indicated in the first annual progress report.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the factors {{that have to be}} {{considered}} when designing an aggregate expenditure ceiling. It is argued that expenditure ceilings are effective in promoting fiscal discipline and sustainability, but that a number of trade-offs have to be made when setting up a fiscal framework that will survive in a politically charged environment. The paper illustrates the discussion with a case study of medium-term aggregate expenditure ceilings in three countries: Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden.

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{globalization}} to public spending {{as well as}} a fiscal debate of the disciplining hypothesis and compensation hypothesis on large sample of countries, have been widely analyzed in the public finance literature. Yet the welfare states in Nordic countries with largest share <b>of</b> public <b>expenditures</b> have never been singled out for similar studies. This study employs a much more detailed government <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> public <b>expenditures</b> (COFOG), to investigate the impact of globalization on the composition <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Nordic countries from 1990 - 2007. Several measures of globalization are shown to affect some <b>of</b> the <b>expenditures</b> categories but not in a notable way. Further aggregating the expenditure categories into productive and unproductive expenditures, in order to find out whether it is the efficiency or compensation hypothesis that prevails in the Nordic countries. This study finds a slight support for the efficiency hypothesis over the compensation view. KEY WORDS: Globalization, public spending, efficiency and compensation hypothesis...|$|R
30|$|More {{detailed}} purpose codes {{would significantly}} improve tracking all external financing sources in global health. Additionally, better <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> would help elucidate exactly how charitable organizations are utilizing their funds, promoting transparency and accountability. It {{became clear that}} there is an overall lack of standardized measurement metrics, and in some cases, a complete lack of reporting on what defined a program service expense. Organizations adhering to the short-term mission model best illustrate this point. In this model, surgical teams from high resource settings come to a LMIC for short period of time, often with their own supplies and equipment, and perform a very specific surgery on a group of patients in a defined period of time. While their own time is often voluntary, the cost of their travel (airfare, accommodations, and meals) is often paid for by the organization. If these indirect costs are being counted as, for example, a service expense or administrative expense, it will not be clear from the financial data that these expenses were actually relating to a short-term mission, making it challenging to track funding flows to all elements of charitable surgical care. Consequently, this makes it difficult to fully analyze the allocation of resources and make corresponding recommendations for their most efficient use.|$|R
40|$|Economy Context Technological changes, {{along with}} the {{globalization}} of markets, are transforming industrial countries into knowledge-driven economies. This shift has made human capital {{one of the leading}} public policy themes. However, existing measures of investment do not allow policymakers to comprehend fully the implications of human capital on economic performance and technological advancement. This paper discusses the elements of a comprehensive definition of human capital and identifies the fundamental differences between human and physical capital. It shows that the main features of human capital and its differences with physical capital have implications for national income acounting, the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> government <b>expenditures,</b> and the endogenous growth literature. ...|$|R
