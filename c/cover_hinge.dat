50|$|In November 2009, Maclaren voluntarily {{recalled}} {{its entire}} line of strollers {{sold in the}} U.S. and produced from 1999-2009, citing 12 reported fingertip amputations in its hinges.

50|$|The single-piece frame/receiver is molded from ABS {{plastic and}} largely {{unmachined}} {{with the exception}} of the bolt guides which the bottom of the bolt rides on. A stamped steel receiver cover rests over the top of the bolt, sandwiching it in place. The receiver <b>cover</b> <b>hinges</b> at the front of the frame and latches onto the rear of the bolt assembly. The bolt assembly consists of a cast steel bolt that rides on a spring and follower; a thin firing pin channel runs down the center of the bolt, allowing the stamped firing pin to be struck by the hammer and impact the cartridge at the front of the bolt.|$|R

50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top <b>cover</b> <b>hinge</b> pin {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking top <b>cover</b> <b>hinge</b> pin that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|E

Seating options range from four to six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy.

50|$|The Barrett 240LWS {{features}} a removable and telescoping buttstock, that can has 6 adjustable positions. It {{differs from the}} buttstock of the 240LW by being half of its size in length, and doesn't have a polymer cheek piece. There are two telescoping rods that allows the buttstock to be extended to the desired position, when depressed from the top portion. The rods have indentations on them, which lock into positional latches within {{the rear of the}} buttstock. The hydraulic buffer is permanently encased within the stock and is necessary for recoil reduction from the reciprocating movement of the bolt group. Early prototypes had steel QD sling sockets {{on both sides of the}} stock, however current production versions will have solid steel sling loops on either side of it. This is to alleviate any damage that may occur to a sling mounted on the QD socket, and the amount of stress that it could take while carrying the machine gun. It also {{features a}} Picatinny rail that is longer compared to the Picatinny rail of the M240 machine guns, and where the Barrett M107A1 rear sight can be mounted and other various optics. The design of the feed tray <b>cover</b> <b>hinge</b> has been altered to be in the shape of a hexagon, thus allowing for the feed tray cover to be able to stay open while at a 45 degree angle to the receiver, while the machine gunner is loading a belt of ammunition. The feed tray has also been altered, with two protruding spring-loaded teeth which can bend in the direction of the ammunition belt. These teeth allows the operator to securely place a belt of ammunition on the feed tray, while at an upright angle, and not have the belt slip out while closing the cover. In addition they allow the operator to be able to squeeze the front of the belt into a closed cover because the teeth only bends in the direction of the belt, and the belt will pass over them, then the teeth will click upwards, thus locking the belt in place. Another click forward, and the belt of ammunition will be in place to fire. This allows the operator to feed a belt of ammunition into his 240LWS without ever having to possibly expose his position or line of sight, by opening the feed tray cover.|$|E

40|$|The {{stringent}} requirements {{imposed upon}} the Shuttle booster separation system {{led to the}} development of two unique nozzle cover concepts with potential applications in other space propulsion systems. Major requirements were to (1) protect the booster separation motors (BSMs) from the ascent aerothermal environment; (2) provide a humidity seal for the BSM during storage and readiness on the launch pad; (3) open completely during the ignition transient; and (4) produce no debris during ascent, separation, and booster reentry. The nozzle cover concepts included (1) a frangible reinforced elastomeric cover with a retraction mechanism to remove the cover sections away from the plume, and (2) a stainless steel <b>cover</b> <b>hinged</b> by a plastically deforming torsion pin...|$|R

50|$|Three-speed DJ {{turntables}} {{offered by}} Audio-Technica, ReLoop, and Stanton, {{as well as}} Numark, are Hanpin descendants of the Numark Pro TT series. Examples are the Audio-Technica AT-LP1240-USB, AT-LP120-USB, and AT-PL120 at the lower end, and the Reloop RP-7000 and RP-8000 at the high end. The tonearm and plastic dust <b>cover</b> <b>hinges</b> remain the same. The direct drive motor has been updated to a 16 pole motor. Most models now offered include a preamp with a line level output {{as well as a}} USB output. A newer model offered by Numark, the TTXUSB direct drive turntable, made by Hanpin, features a LCD display, three speeds, and a restyled plinth but it is not supplied with a dust cover. There are also other Hanpin turntables on the market in different regions of the world sold under various brand names.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus pressure ring on the tonearm counterbalance weight assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust <b>cover</b> <b>hinges</b> eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring. One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|R
5000|$|The AKS-74U {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting system with a U-shaped flip sight instead of the standard sliding notch tangent rear sight. This rear sight has two settings: [...] "П" [...] corresponding to a 350 m [...] "point-blank range" [...] battle zero setting and [...] "4-5" [...] (used for firing at distances between 400 - 500 m). The rear sight is housed in a semi-shrouded protective enclosure that is riveted to the receiver's spring-loaded top cover. This top <b>cover</b> <b>hinges</b> from the barrel trunnion, pivoting forward when opened, which also works to unlock the gas tube cover. Both the gas tube and handguard are also of a new type and are shorter than the analogous parts in the AKS-74.For the AKS-74s combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 350 m battle zero setting limits the apparent [...] "bullet rise" [...] within approximately -5 to +42 cm relative {{to the line of}} sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.|$|R

50|$|WZ-523s have {{relatively}} good range and payload, and may seat {{up to ten}} passengers who enter and debus from a single door in the rear hull. The vehicle has a long, boat-shaped hull with a trim vane mounted on the glacis plate.

25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the lift engines in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using vectored thrust from the lift engines and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the lift engines being shut down and <b>covered</b> by <b>hinged</b> doors.|$|R
