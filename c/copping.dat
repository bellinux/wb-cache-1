In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and <b>Copping</b> stepping up for their team.|$|E

40|$|<b>COP</b> 1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1), a {{ubiquitin}} E 3 ligase, is {{a central}} negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. However, how <b>COP</b> 1 activity is regulated by post-translational modifications remains largely unknown. Here we show that SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) modification enhances <b>COP</b> 1 activity. Loss-of-function siz 1 mutant seedlings exhibit a weak constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype. SIZ 1 physically interacts with <b>COP</b> 1 and mediates the sumoylation of <b>COP</b> 1. A K 193 R substitution in <b>COP</b> 1 blocks its SUMO modification and reduces <b>COP</b> 1 activity in vitro and in planta. Consistently, <b>COP</b> 1 activity is reduced in siz 1 {{and the level of}} HY 5, a <b>COP</b> 1 target protein, is increased in siz 1. Sumoylated <b>COP</b> 1 may exhibits higher transubiquitination activity than does non-sumoylated <b>COP</b> 1, but SIZ 1 -mediated SUMO modification does not affect <b>COP</b> 1 dimerization, <b>COP</b> 1 -HY 5 interaction, and nuclear accumulation of <b>COP</b> 1. Interestingly, prolonged light exposure reduces the sumoylation level of <b>COP</b> 1, and <b>COP</b> 1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of SIZ 1. These regulatory mechanisms may maintain the homeostasis of <b>COP</b> 1 activity, ensuing proper photomorphogenic development in changing light environment. Our genetic and biochemical studies identify a function for SIZ 1 in photomorphogenesis and reveal a novel SUMO-regulated ubiquitin ligase, <b>COP</b> 1, in plants...|$|R
40|$|CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (<b>COP</b> 1) {{functions}} as an E 3 ubiquitin ligase in both plants and animals. In dark-grown Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, <b>COP</b> 1 targets photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for degradation to repress photomorphogenesis. Little is known, however, about how <b>COP</b> 1 itself is regulated. Here, we identify <b>COP</b> 1 SUPPRESSOR 1 (CSU 1), a RING-finger E 3 ubiquitin ligase, as a regulator of <b>COP</b> 1. Genetic evidence demonstrates that csu 1 mutations suppress <b>cop</b> 1 - 6 phenotypes {{completely in the}} dark. Furthermore, CSU 1 colocalizes with <b>COP</b> 1 in nuclear speckles and negatively regulates <b>COP</b> 1 protein accumulation in darkness. CSU 1 can ubiquitinate <b>COP</b> 1 in vitro and is essential for <b>COP</b> 1 ubiquitination in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that CSU 1 {{plays a major role}} in maintaining <b>COP</b> 1 homeostasis by targeting <b>COP</b> 1 for ubiquitination and degradation in dark-grown seedlings...|$|R

40|$|Wild-type Arabidopsis {{seedlings}} {{are capable}} of following two developmental programs: photomorphogenesis in the light and skotomorphogenesis in darkness. Screening of Arabidopsis mutants for constitutive photomorphogenic development in darkness resulted {{in the identification of}} three new loci designated <b>COP</b> 8, <b>COP</b> 10, and <b>COP</b> 11. Detailed examination of the temporal morphological and cellular differentiation patterns of wild-type and mutant seedlings revealed that in darkness, seedlings homozygous for recessive mutations in <b>COP</b> 8, <b>COP</b> 10, and <b>COP</b> 11 failed to suppress the photomorphogenic developmental pathway and were unable to initiate skotomorphogenesis. As a consequence, the mutant seedlings grown in the dark had short hypocotyls and open and expanded cotyledons, with characteristic photomorphogenic cellular differentiation patterns and elevated levels of light-inducible gene expression. In addition, plastids of dark-grown mutants were defective in etioplast differentiation. Similar to <b>cop</b> 1 and <b>cop</b> 9, and in contrast to det 1 (deetiolated), these new mutants lacked dark-adaptive change of light-regulated gene expression and retained normal phytochrome control of seed germination. Epistatic analyses with the long hypocotyl hy 1, hy 2, hy 3, hy 4, and hy 5 mutations suggested that these three loci, similar to <b>COP</b> 1 and <b>COP</b> 9, act downstream of both phytochromes and a blue light receptor, and probably HY 5 as well. Further, <b>cop</b> 8 - 1, <b>cop</b> 10 - 1, and <b>cop</b> 11 - 1 mutants accumulated higher levels of <b>COP</b> 1, a feature similar to the <b>cop</b> 9 - 1 mutant. These results suggested that <b>COP</b> 8, <b>COP</b> 10, and <b>COP</b> 11, together with <b>COP</b> 1, <b>COP</b> 9, and DET 1, function to suppress the photomorphogenic developmental program and to promote skotomorphogenesis in darkness. The identical phenotypes resulting from mutations in <b>COP</b> 8, <b>COP</b> 9, <b>COP</b> 10, and <b>COP</b> 11 imply that their encoded products function in close proximity, possibly with some of them as a complex, in the same signal transduction pathway...|$|R

Wolves, 8–1 v. Liverpool, and 8–0 twice, v. Leicester City and v. Middlesbrough).

40|$|To {{maintain}} a standing posture during various activities, {{the center of}} pressure (<b>COP)</b> must be controlled in a specific area.

Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar.
