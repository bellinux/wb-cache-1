5|$|Aspirin causes an {{increased}} risk of <b>cerebral</b> microbleeds having the appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches. Such <b>cerebral</b> microbleeds are important, since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, Binswanger disease, and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebral</b> Palsy: Athletes with non-progressive brain damage, {{for example}} <b>cerebral</b> palsy, {{traumatic}} brain injury, stroke or similar disabilities affecting muscle control, balance or coordination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebral</b> edema, if {{associated}} with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of <b>cerebral</b> edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous mannitol and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as {{in some other}} forms of <b>cerebral</b> edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{classification}} for swimmers with <b>cerebral</b> palsy was {{governed by}} CP-ISRA. There were five <b>cerebral</b> palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could {{compete in the}} 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors with <b>cerebral</b> palsy competed in the same classification in international competitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the <b>cerebral</b> cortex {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the <b>cerebral</b> cortex. The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the <b>cerebral</b> cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of thrombosis of the <b>cerebral</b> veins and sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed thrombosis of the saggital sinus and <b>cerebral</b> veins in {{a man who had}} suffered from seizures and delirium. Until {{the second half of the}} 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of <b>cerebral</b> venous thrombosis, using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior <b>cerebral</b> arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior <b>cerebral</b> arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle <b>cerebral</b> arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle <b>cerebral</b> arteries send branches along their length.|$|E
5|$|The tube flexes as it grows, {{forming the}} {{crescent-shaped}} <b>cerebral</b> hemispheres at the head. The <b>cerebral</b> hemispheres first appear on day 32.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or <b>cerebral</b> venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter <b>cerebral</b> venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|As a primate brain, {{the human}} brain has a much larger <b>cerebral</b> cortex, in {{proportion}} to body size, than most mammals, and a highly developed visual system.|$|E
5|$|Ataxia – Ataxia is an {{impairment}} {{that consists}} {{of a lack of}} coordination of muscle movements (e.g. <b>cerebral</b> palsy, Friedreich’s ataxia, multiple sclerosis).|$|E
5|$|Athetosis – Athetosis is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. <b>cerebral</b> palsy, choreoathetosis).|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebral</b> malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and <b>cerebral</b> malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebral</b> veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great <b>cerebral</b> vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent <b>cerebral</b> veins.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in <b>cerebral</b> autoregulation of <b>cerebral</b> blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Dissecting aneurysms of the {{vertebral}} artery constitute 4% of all <b>cerebral</b> aneurysms, and are hence a relatively rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from <b>cerebral</b> malaria. Some survivors of <b>cerebral</b> malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E

5|$|In {{a case in}} Zurich in 2001 a 23-year-old who {{had taken}} BZP and ecstasy (MDMA) died from a massive <b>cerebral</b> edema 57 hours after {{hospital}} admission.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green {{suffered}} a <b>cerebral</b> hemorrhage {{and died of}} pneumonia in Philadelphia on May 31, 2007. He was survived by his wife, daughter & grand daughter.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is {{a medical}} emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop <b>cerebral</b> involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as <b>cerebral</b> palsy.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (<b>cerebral</b> hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the <b>cerebral</b> cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|Overall, about 1 {{percent of}} all people have one or more <b>cerebral</b> aneurysms. Most of these, however, are small and {{unlikely}} to rupture.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} paired <b>cerebral</b> organs, sacs whose only {{openings}} {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired <b>cerebral</b> organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the <b>cerebral</b> organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, {{consisting}} of the <b>cerebral</b> hemispheres, forms the largest {{part of the brain}} and is situated above the other brain structures. The outer region of the hemispheres, the <b>cerebral</b> cortex, is grey matter, {{consisting of}} cortical layers of neurons. Each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} neuroimaging {{investigations}} that may detect <b>cerebral</b> sinus thrombosis. <b>Cerebral</b> edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, {{but for the}} detection of the thrombus itself, the most commonly used tests are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|If <b>cerebral</b> edema is {{suspected}} because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or other symptoms, computed tomography may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke.|$|E
5|$|The subcommissural organ secretes SCO-spondin, {{which forms}} Reissner's fiber within the CSF that assist {{movement}} through the <b>cerebral</b> aqueduct. It {{is present in}} early intrauterine life but disappears during early development.|$|E
25|$|Ataxic <b>cerebral</b> palsy is {{clinically}} {{observed in}} approximately 5-10% {{of all cases}} of <b>cerebral</b> palsy, making it the least frequent form of <b>cerebral</b> palsy diagnosed. Ataxic <b>cerebral</b> palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures, differentiating it from the other two forms of <b>cerebral</b> palsy, which are spastic <b>cerebral</b> palsy (damage to cortical motor areas and underlying white matter) and athetoid <b>cerebral</b> palsy (damage to basal ganglia).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cerebral</b> palsy sport {{classification}} - {{describes the}} disability sport classification for <b>cerebral</b> palsy.|$|E
25|$|People with high-altitude {{sickness}} {{generally have}} reduced hyperventilator response, impaired gas exchange, fluid retention or increased sympathetic drive. There {{is thought to}} be an increase in <b>cerebral</b> venous volume due to increase in <b>cerebral</b> blood flow and hypocapnic <b>cerebral</b> vasoconstriction causing oedema.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} carotid then divides to {{form the}} anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery and middle <b>cerebral</b> artery. The internal carotid artery can receive blood flow via an important collateral pathway supplying the brain, the <b>cerebral</b> arterial circle, which is more {{commonly known as the}} Circle of Willis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cerebral</b> aneurysms, {{also known}} as {{intracranial}} or brain aneurysms, occur most commonly in the anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery, {{which is part of}} the circle of Willis. This can cause severe strokes leading to death. The next most common sites of <b>cerebral</b> aneurysm occurrence are in the internal carotid artery.|$|E
25|$|Reduced <b>Cerebral</b> Blood Flow in Angular Gyrus. A {{couple of}} studies found reduced <b>cerebral</b> blood flow in angular gyrus of murderers and impulsive, violent criminals.|$|E
25|$|Stroke, {{which can}} result from a {{progressive}} narrowing of blood vessels, prevents oxygen from reaching the brain. <b>Cerebral</b> infarction occurs in children and <b>cerebral</b> haemorrhage in adults.|$|E
