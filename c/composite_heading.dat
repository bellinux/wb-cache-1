50|$|The Mannerist {{master at}} the 16th-century {{imperial}} Habsburg courts of Vienna and Prague, Giuseppe Arcimboldo of Milan {{was probably the}} best known artist for creating extraordinary hidden faces.

50|$|In simple terms, {{the power}} {{scrubber}} is a pot brush {{with an electric}} motor. Recognizing the effort it takes to scrub pots with baked-on food or grease, at least one manufacturer has designed these brushes to rotate on flexible power shafts and scour pots, pans and utensils with minimal effort. The power unit for the scrubber typically mounts on the wall at the pot sink and is connected to a six-foot flexible shaft used to scrub the soiled dishware. One manufacturer makes a variety of brushes and scrubbers {{that can be easily}} changed on the shaft. In addition to the traditional brushes, there are wire brushes for scouring tougher soil and even an impregnated plastic <b>composite</b> <b>head</b> for scrubbing baked-on carbon deposits from pots and baking pans.|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} of the European Upper Palaeolithic yielded abundant evidence {{of the use of}} <b>composite</b> projectile <b>heads,</b> in the form of osseous points on the side of which one or several (micro) lithic elements are attached. Yet, little experimental work has been devoted to testing and assessing the parameters of use of this type of composite tips. In this paper we present a pilot experiment with replicas of Magdalenian composite spear tips, made of an antler point with one or two rows of flint backed bladelets. Two series of replicas were manufactured after the lithic and osseous record of, respectively, the Lower Magdalenian from southwest France (c. 20 - 18 Ky cal BP) and the Upper Magdalenian of Pincevent in the Paris Basin (c. 15 - 14 Ky cal BP). The 34 experimental <b>composite</b> <b>heads</b> were hafted to spears that were then shot with a spearthrower at the carcasses of two young deer. The results provide some insight into the performance characteristics of the osseous and lithic components, both in efficiency and durability. Finally, possible improvements of the experimental protocol are discussed, as well as the implications of our results for the understanding of projectile point variability in the Upper Palaeolithic.

40|$|The cytoembryologic {{analysis}} of {{wet and dry}} samples of super dwarf wheat cultivated in greenhouse SVET aboard the MIR station over the whole cycle of vegetation was made {{with the use of}} light microscopy. Characteristic features of wheat development in space flight are plentiful early tillering, and formation and rapid growth of side shoots. Elementary spikelets in the <b>composite</b> <b>head</b> were more numerous but the top spikelets were rudimentary and, therefore, the ripe head contained less of these spikelets as compared with the ground controls (9 - 13 and 14, respectively). The number of florets in a spike was also higher reaching 14 - 16 vs. 7 - 8 in the control. Typically, no more than 4 to 5 florets vs. 3 in the control were fully differentiated while the others died off earlier in development. The fact that there were no caryopses found in the flight crop is explained by absolute male sterility appearing at different stages of staminal development: before archesporium formation, on the stage of differentiated archesporium, during meiosis, on the stage of microspores or uninucleate "pollen". The female generative system developed mainly without abnormalities. An assumption was made that elevated ethylene concentrations in the MIR atmosphere {{at the time of the}} wheat experiment were the cause for abnormal development of the male generative system which led to barrenness of the super dwarf wheat crop...|$|R

The newest generation of these bearings incorporate nanosized, yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia particles producing an alumina matrix composite. We asked whether this new material would perform {{as well as a}} conventional bearing in terms of functional hip scores, radiographic migration and osteolysis, complications and survival. As part of a US FDA investigational device exemption study (G 000075), we conducted an initial prospective safety study of 21 alumina matrix <b>composite</b> femoral <b>heads</b> articulating on alumina liners followed by a prospective, randomized study with 44 more of these articulations and 45 zirconia femoral heads on polyethylene liners. The minimum followup for all patients was 26 Â months (mean, 73 Â months; range, 26 â 108 Â months). Harris hip scores and radiographic findings were similar in the two groups as was survivorship (trial 95 % versus control 93 %). There were three reoperations in the trial group and three in the control group. A fractured head retrieval showed a 33 % monoclinic transformation with an increase in surface roughness from 3 to 5 Â nm at the main wear zone.

50|$|Up to late 1999, this {{engine type}} {{suffered}} from oil leaks between {{the block and}} cylinder head. The threads for the head bolts near the 4th cylinder were bored too shallow at the factory, preventing the head from properly sealing.

Chrysler Corporation used several different designs of <b>composite</b> material <b>head</b> gasket {{in an attempt to}} solve this problem.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a spontaneous sheared plasma flow in the edge region of reversed field pinch (RFP) plasmas has been recently documented [1]. The shear of the EÃB drift velocity {{has been found to}} be in a marginal situation for providing decorrelation of the electrostatic turbulence [2], although some evidence of a beneficial effect on the transport driven by electrostatic fluctuations has been put forward [2]. In this paper we report the results of edge biasing experiments performed on the RFX machine (R = 2 m, a = 0. 457 m) aimed at modifying plasma rotation in the external region of the plasma. Two electrodes, whose characteristics are described in detail elsewhere [3], have been inserted into the plasma. Most of the data refer to an insertion at r/a= 0. 81. The electrodes have a carbon-carbon <b>composite</b> <b>head</b> whose diameter is 70 mm, placed in a shaft protected by a boron nitride tube. A set of capacitor banks provided up to 10 kA per electrode with a half wave sinusoidal pulse of duration around 10 ms, biasing the electrodes at a negative potential with respect to the vacuum vessel. The electrodes were located in two different toroidal positions (Ï = 142 Â° and 322 Â° respectively). The duration of the electrode operation was chosen as an intermediate value between the plasma discharge length (which was typically 60 ms for the present conditions) and the typical particle and energy confinement times, which are around 1 ms. An example of a discharge where biasing was applied is shown in fig. 1. In this case the electrode was acting in the interval 18 - 30 ms. In the first frame the plasma current Ip and the line-averaged electron density ne are shown. In the second frame the current and the voltage of one of the two electrodes can be seen.

MethodsAccording {{to the size}} of medial malleolus and composite soft tissue defect, vascular fibular <b>head</b> <b>composite</b> tendon bone flap free grafting using anterior tibial recurrent vessel as the perforating branch was designed to reconstruct the medial malleolar saddle and triangular ligament, and composite back broadest muscle flap free grafting was designed to repair the medical malleolar wound surface. From January 2000 to December 2006, the technique was used in 5 male patients who were injured by machine or in traffic accidents, causing bone and soft tissue defect. The size of wound surface ranged from 19 cm Ã 12 cm to 24 cm Ã 12 cm. ResultsThe wound surface was healed at the first stage in 4 cases, and the other case had infection and was cured in 6 months with anti infection therapy. Postoperative follow-ups from 6 months to 6 years showed that grafted bones and free cutaneous flaps were healed well, malleolar joints were stable, joint movement was normal, and the appearance was satisfactory.
