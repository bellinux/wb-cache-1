25|$|The AhR protein {{contains}} several domains {{critical for}} function and {{is classified as}} a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors. The bHLH motif is located in the N-terminal of the protein and is a common entity in a variety of transcription factors. Members of the bHLH superfamily have two functionally distinctive and highly conserved domains. The first is the basic-region (b), which is involved in the binding of the transcription factor to DNA. The second is the helix-loop-helix (HLH) region, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Also contained with the AhR are two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are stretches of 200-350 amino acids that exhibit a high sequence homology to the protein domains that were originally found in the Drosophila genes period (Per) and single-minded (Sim) and in AhR’s dimerization partner the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The PAS domains support specific secondary interactions with other PAS domain containing proteins, as is the case with AhR and ARNT, so that dimeric and heteromeric protein complexes can form. The ligand binding site of AhR is contained within the PAS-B domain and contains several conserved residues critical for ligand binding. Finally, a glutamine-rich (Q-rich) domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and is involved in <b>co-activator</b> recruitment and transactivation.|$|E

5000|$|HATs act as {{transcriptional}} <b>co-activators</b> or gene silencers and {{are most}} often found in large complexes made up of 10 to 20 subunits, some of which shared among different HAT complexes.

[...] These complexes modulate HAT specificity by bringing HATs to their target genes where they can then acetylate nucleosomal histones.

40|$|The CREB {{regulated}} transcription <b>co-activators</b> (CRTCs) regulate many {{biological processes}} by integrating and converting environmental inputs into transcriptional responses. Although the {{mechanisms by which}} CRTCs sense cellular signals are characterized, little is known regarding how CRTCs contribute to the regulation of cAMP inducible genes. Here we show that these dynamic regulators, unlike other <b>co-activators,</b> independently direct either pre-mRNA splice-site selection or transcriptional activation depending on the cell type or promoter context. Moreover, in other scenarios, the CRTC <b>co-activators</b> coordinately regulate transcription and splicing. Mutational analyses showed that CRTCs possess distinct functional domains responsible for regulating either pre-mRNA splicing or transcriptional activation. Interestingly, the CRTC 1 –MAML 2 oncoprotein lacks the splicing domain and is incapable of altering splice-site selection despite robustly activating transcription. The differential usage of these distinct domains allows CRTCs to selectively mediate multiple facets of gene regulation, indicating that <b>co-activators</b> are not solely restricted to coordinating alternative splicing with increase in transcriptional activity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe CBP and p 300 (CBP/p 300) acetyltransferases {{function}} as transcriptional <b>co-activators</b> and play critical roles in cell differentiation and proliferation.

In the present study, we show that the levels of the CBP and p 300 <b>co-activators</b> decrease dramatically by continuous PDGF and Ras signaling pathway activation in NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts. This effect occurs by reducing the expression levels of the CBP and p 300 genes. In addition, CBP and p 300 are degraded by the 26 S proteasome pathway leading to an overall decrease in the levels of the CBP and p 300 proteins. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Mdm 2, {{in the presence of}} active H-Ras or N-Ras induces CBP/p 300 degradation in NIH 3 T 3 cells.

Here we examined how these interactions coordinate to regulate KLF 8 transactivity. Mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitations determined that p 300 and/or PCAF promoted KLF 8 acetylation at K 67, K 93, and K 95 and this acetylation was abolished in lysine-to-arginine (R) mutants. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors or expression of <b>co-activators</b> inhibited sumoylation at K 67. K 93 R or K 95 R mutation exerted {{high levels of}} sumoylation while the acetylation mimetic mutations K 93 Q and K 95 Q blocked the sumoylation. Interestingly, CtBP promoted sumoylation at K 67 of wild-type but not AVALF mutant KLF 8, and KLF 8 interaction with CtBP was inhibited by treatment with the HDAC inhibitors, ectopic expression of the <b>co-activators,</b> or K 93 Q or K 95 Q mutation. Promoter reporter assays showed that CtBP inhibited KLF 8 transactivity which was rescued by PCAF or p 300 expresson. Finally, KLF 8 -mediated cyclin D 1 protein expression and cell cycle progression were significantly decreased in the K 93 R and K 95 R but increased in the K 93 Q, K 95 Q, K 67 R or K 67 Q mutant. Taken together, these results identified a novel mechanism by which <b>co-activators</b> promote KLF 8 transactivity by competing with SUMO for K 67 modification and by acetylating K 93 and K 95 to inhibit CtBP-induced K 67 sumoylation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background p 68 (Ddx 5) and p 72 (Ddx 17) {{are highly}} related {{members of the}} DEAD box family and are {{established}} RNA helicases. They have been implicated in growth regulation and {{have been shown to}} be involved in both pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing. More recently, however, these proteins have been reported to act as transcriptional <b>co-activators</b> for estrogen-receptor alpha (ERα). Furthermore these proteins were shown to interact with <b>co-activators</b> p 300 /CBP and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Taken together these reports suggest a role for p 68 and p 72 in transcriptional activation. Results In this report we show that p 68 and p 72 can, in some contexts, act as transcriptional repressors. Targeting of p 68 or p 72 to constitutive promoters leads to repression of transcription; this repression is promoter-specific. Moreover both p 68 and p 72 associate with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1), a well-established transcriptional repression protein. Conclusions It is therefore clear that p 68 and p 72 are important transcriptional regulators, functioning as <b>co-activators</b> and/or co-repressors depending on the context of the promoter and the transcriptional complex in which they exist. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aimed to {{identify}} a new selec-tive glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand {{for the treatment of}} chronic inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The IN Cell Analyzer 1000 platform was employed to screen for compounds that may promote GR nuclear translocation. A mammalian two-hybrid system and transactivation assay-were used to analyze the selected GR ligands and evaluate their activities for GR transcription and the recruitment of <b>co-activators.</b> A novel selective GR ligand, compound Q 40, was identified that was able to promote GR nuclear transloca-tion {{in a short period of}} time. It increased the ability of GR to recruit <b>co-activators</b> in a concentration-dependent manner, but had no positive effect on GR transcriptional activity. In conclusion, an increase in the expression levels of gluconeo-geneic genes, induced by the transcriptional activation of GR, is the predisposing factor most commonly associated with the side-effects of glucocorticoids. The results suggest that compound Q 40 is a ligand of the GR and exerts an agonistic action on the recruitment of <b>co-activators</b> without sugar dysmetabolism-related side-effects. Thus, compound Q 40 has the potential to be used as an anti-inflammatory adjuvant therapy with minimal side-effects in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R

40|$|Estrogen-related {{receptor}} alpha (ERR 1) is {{an orphan}} nuclear receptor that can bind transcriptional <b>co-activators</b> constitutively. ERR 1 expression correlates with poor patient outcomes in breast cancer, heightening {{interest in this}} nuclear receptor as a therapeutic target. Because ERR 1 has no known regulatory ligand, a major challenge in targeting its activity is to find cellular or synthetic modulators of its function. We identified an interaction between ERR 1 and KIF 17, a kinesin- 2 family microtubule motor, in a yeast- 2 -hybrid screen. We confirmed the interaction using in vitro biochemical assays and determined that binding is mediated by the ERR 1 ligand-binding/AF 2 domain and the KIF 17 C-terminal tail. Expression of KIF 17 tail domain in either ER-negative or ER-positive breast cancer epithelial cells attenuated nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized ERR 1 and inhibited ERR 1 transcriptional activity. Conversely, ERR 1 transcriptional activity was elevated significantly in KIF 17 knock-out cells. Sequence analysis of the KIF 17 tail domain revealed it contains a nuclear receptor box with a conserved LXXLL motif found in transcriptional <b>co-activators.</b> Expression of a 12 amino-acid peptide containing this motif was sufficient to inhibit ERR 1 transcriptional activity and cell invasion, while deletion of this region from the KIF 17 tail resulted in increased ERR 1 activity. Together, these data suggest KIF 17 modifies ERR 1 function by two possible, non-exclusive mechanisms: (i) by regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution or (ii) by competing with transcriptional <b>co-activators</b> for binding to ERR 1.
