5|$|Affairs became further {{complicated}} when, on 2February 1583, {{also known as}} Candlemas, Gebhard married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben in a private house in Rosenthal, outside of Bonn.

De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in contravention of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E

5|$|Blois died on 10 May 1206, and {{was buried}} in Lincoln Cathedral. In the early fourteenth century, he was still remembered well by the cathedral <b>chapter</b> <b>and</b> was {{described}} as learned and kindly by the 14th century writer John Schalby, who wrote a work {{on the lives of}} the bishops of Lincoln. Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de Marum. Marum succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, but there is no evidence supports that identification.|$|E
5|$|Foliot was a {{canon of}} Lincoln Cathedral by 1147, and an {{official}} of Alexander of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church. Foliot {{was sent to the}} Council of Reims in 1148 by the Lincoln cathedral chapter to learn Pope Eugene III's wishes regarding the vacant bishopric, as Alexander had died in February 1148. Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, was attempting to secure Lincoln for one of his nephews, but the pope agreed with the <b>chapter</b> <b>and</b> appointed Robert de Chesney as bishop instead. After his consecration, Chesney continued to employ Foliot as a clerk.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L.

The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees {{the case against the}} abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E

5|$|If the {{election}} {{had been left}} to the papacy, Ernst {{would have been the}} choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral <b>Chapter</b> <b>and</b> Gebhard had the support of several of the Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} <b>chapter</b> <b>and</b> {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E
