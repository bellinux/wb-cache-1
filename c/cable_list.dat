En specifik gång- och cykelvägstunnel har varit ämne för klagomål från allmänheten på grund av att dess belysning släcks under dagtid. Under vissa perioder på dygnet upplevs tunneln som mörk och otrygg. I dagsläget styrs tunnelbelysningen tillsammans med andra delar av gatubelysningen av en ljussensor och önskemål finns att installera ett batterilager som försörjer tunnelbelysningen under den tiden som den ordinarie strömförsörjningen är avstängd. Då gatubelysningen utöver att vara avstängd periodvis över dagen även är helt avstängd under hela juni och halva juli krävdes även en solpanel för att försörja belysningen under den tiden. Solkraft valdes mycket på grund av det faktum att den producerar som mest under den tid som anläggningen inte har någon typ av fast strömförsörjning men även med tanke på kundens önskan om att jobba med förnybar energi. För att leva upp till Trafikverkets riktvärden behövdes enligt utförda mätningar bara en lite del av belysningens fulla effekt användas. Då armaturerna var förberedda för Dali och anläggningen önskades hållas så liten som möjligt föreslogs rörelsesensorer som både stänger av belysningen när det inte befinner sig någon i tunneln men även inte höjer belysningen mer än nödvändigt. Batterier dimensionerades utefter förväntad belastning och givna effektförluster. För att utvärdera solpanelens förmåga att täcka in anläggningens behov simulerades anläggningen i Polysun. De 37 kWh/månad som solpanelen på 300 Wp genererar under sommaren räcker till 14 timmar belysning per dag vilket anses räcka under den tidsperioden baserat på tunnels användning. Kretsschema med komponentlista, kabellista och en föreslagen layout producerades i PCSchematics för att visa på en typ av lösning. I övrigt rekommenderades det att måla tunneln i ljus färg för bättre förmåga att reflektera ljus. Möjligtvis skulle det kunna leda till att belysningen kan dimras ner ytterligare.  This {{bachelor}} thesis {{has been}} carried out along with Umeå Energi and addresses one of their clients' problems. A specific tunnel used for walking- and cycling traffic {{has been the subject of}} complaints from the public because its lighting is switched off during the daytime. During certain periods of the day, the tunnel feels dark and unsafe. Currently, the tunnel lighting is being controlled, alongside with other parts of the street lighting, by a light sensor. There is a desire to use battery storage to supply the tunnel lighting during the time when the power is turned off. Since the street lighting in addition to being switched off periodically throughout the day is also completely shut down throughout June and half of July, a solar panel was required to provide energy to the luminaires during that time. Solar power was chosen partly because of the fact that it produces the most amount of energy during the time the facility has no type of power supply but also in view of the customer's desire to work with renewable energy. In order to live up to the Traffic Authority's guideline values, only a small part of the power was required. The luminaires were prepared for Dali and since the facility was desired to be as small as possible, motion sensors that both turn off the lighting when there is no one in the tunnel but also does not raise the lighting more than necessary was suggested. Batteries were dimensioned upon expected load and given power losses. To evaluate the solar panel's ability to cover the luminaires needs, simulations was made in Polysun. The 37 kWh/month that the 300 Wp solar panel generates during the summer is sufficient for 14 hours of lighting per day, which is considered enough for the time period based on the tunnel usage. Circuit diagram with component list, <b>cable</b> <b>list</b> and a proposed layout were produced in PCSchematics to display one type of solution. In addition, it was recommended to paint the tunnel in a bright color to better reflect light. Possibly, it could lead to a further reduction of the illumination. ...|$|E

The wavelength of light from the laser head is used as the length standard for Agilent laser measurement systems. The laser head generates a coherent (all light waves in phase), collimated (all waves traveling parallel to one another), light beam consisting of two orthogonally polarized frequency components. To differentiate between the frequencies, the lower frequency is identified as f 1 and the higher as f 2. The difference between these two frequencies is the “Reference Frequency”, listed in Table 5 - 1. Agilent offers several laser head models to fill a variety of requirements. A summary listing of Agilent laser heads is provided in Table 5 - 1.

It turns out that interconnection is pivotal in determining market structure, the viability of competitors and the success of deregulatory programs. Interconnecting the Network of Networks by Professor Eli Noam (2001) provides a remarkable review of the issues surrounding this topic. Interconnection’s importance is clear upon a moment’s reflection. In today’s society, we have mobile telephones talking to subscribers on wireline networks; the same mobile phone can read e-mail messages, and surf the web. Computers, via voice over internet protocol (VoIP), can be used to replace the traditional phone over broadband <b>cable</b> connections. The <b>list</b> goes on… The book is an omnibus approach to the subject. It begins with a brief history of the industrial segment and interconnection’s {{role in the development of}} the telecommunications industry’s structure. From the beginning of the telecommunications industry, starting with the telegraph, interconnection has been important in ensuring the connectivity of networks. In 1865, the predecessor of the International Telecommunication Union was formed to ensure interconnection of telegraph service across national boundaries. The issues related to network access have become more critical in the age of multiple communications technologies – internet, mobile phone, WiFi (80211. b) wireless networks, wide and local area networks (WANs and LANs), satellite systems, cable broadband – all of which are capable o...|$|R
40|$|DFACS is an {{interactive}} multi-user computer-aided engineering tool for system level electrical integration and cabling engineering. The {{purpose of the}} program is to provide the engineering community with a centralized database for entering and accessing system functional definitions, subsystem and instrument-end circuit pinout details, and harnessing data. The primary objective is to provide an instantaneous single point of information interchange, thus avoiding error-prone, time-consuming, and costly multiple-path data shuttling. The DFACS program, which is centered around a single database, has built-in menus that provide easy data input and access for all involved system, subsystem, and cabling personnel. The DFACS program allows parallel design of circuit data sheets and harness drawings. It also recombines raw information to automatically generate various project documents and drawings including the Circuit Data Sheet Index, the Electrical Interface Circuits List, Assembly and Equipment Lists, Electrical Ground Tree, Connector <b>List,</b> <b>Cable</b> Tree, Cabling Electrical Interface and Harness Drawings, Circuit Data Sheets, and ECR List of Affected Interfaces/Assemblies. Real time automatic production of harness drawings and circuit data sheets from the same data reservoir ensures instant system and cabling engineering design harmony. DFACS also contains automatic wire routing procedures and extensive error checking routines designed to minimize the possibility of engineering error. DFACS is designed to run on DEC VAX series computers under VMS using Version 6. 3 / 01 of INGRES QUEL/OSL, a relational database system which is available through Relational Technology, Inc.

30|$|In {{the method}} of {{guessing}} by analogy, {{the first step is}} to find similar new service that was introduced earlier and where historical data were used for estimating p and q by OLS or NLS method. The second step is to use the coefficients estimated from the diffusion scheme of analogous service. Thus, for p and q, the task is to select from the set of previously known introduced services thebest analogy to use. Different industry categories of products and services are listed [20] with p and q data available. The best approach in choosing the analogy service is to use the analogs based on the similarities in expected market reactions rather than the similarities of service itself. Following this approach, in searching for analogies of PayTV service we focused around other television services/products - color TV, terrestrial TV, satellite TV, cable TV and IPTV. Among them we have chosen cable TV as the most similar to PayTV because it is subscription service in its nature, while others could be used simply by pointing the antenna and tuning to the right frequency... with the exception of IPTV. The reason we have not chosen IPTV is because in literature there are not enough reliable data for p and q parameters of Bass model as this is a quite new service (with the history of less than 10 years). <b>Cable</b> TV is <b>listed</b> in [20] with p = 0.100 and q = 0.060. Analyzing further this analogy in terms of the similarities in expected market reactions, we found one significant difference between selected cable TV service and PayTV. PayTV is the additional service which comes on top of the basic TV programs received by terrestrial digital network as free-to-air content while cable TV subscriber pays subscription fee for the whole package (basic + additional programs) and usually there is no other way that a subscriber home gets TV program. That fact makes PayTV a kind of luxury for the broadcasting market compared to cable TV as elementary TV service. We believe the imitator q parameter will not be changed because it reflects the power of internal influences in the industry which is not varied by the observed fact. The innovator p parameter should be changed because p is usually regarded as being influenced by the firm's advertising policy (impact of mass media) and if we treat PayTV as luxury the impact of advertising cannot be as high as for cable TV because it is not the necessity (the advertising have greater impact to the market for necessity product than for the luxury product). This is the reason why we use in this article p = 0.03 for PayTV as the average across the studies for the long list of different products and technologies [20]. That value is lower than for cable TV and as p depends on firm's advertising policy which could vary a lot, we believe it makes sense to implement the average value.|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the second step in the project GRUVAN: the site {{inventory}} in operational mines. The main purposes of the inventory are: -          To get {{a clear picture of}} the risks in the different mines. -          To get a clear picture of the protective measures of each mine. -          Optimize the choice of design fires for each mine. The site inventories were conducted through actual visits to the two LKAB mines in Sweden and through e-mail correspondence with LKAB personnel responsible for the different sections and areas. During the inventories, predefined forms for each type of item were used in order to facilitate the work. The following items were examined: -          Combustible materials in general, for example large amounts of wood. -          Vehicles -          Cables -          Fire barriers -          Ventilation systems -          Extinguishing systems   Besides the above items, earlier fires and fire incidents were also examined. As the two LKAB mines are tremendously large with a large amount of equipment etc, only the most common vehicles were listed and examined further. Also, only the sites with the largest amount of cables and other combustible materials were listed.   The following conclusions were made based upon the findings of the inventory: -          With respect to earlier fires and fire incidents for the two LKAB mines, the most common causes and the causes to focus on are: electrical cause, flammable liquid or material on hot surface, hot works and equipment running hot. -          Both the production area and the infrastructure part should be regarded in the future studies as fires are almost identically frequent in both areas. -          When it comes to combustible material in general, the amount of combustibles seems to be more frequent in the Malmberget mine. In the Kiruna mine, the places with wood and conveyor belts seems to be interesting enough for further investigation. Even though self extinguishing conveyor belts means a limited fire in size, the amount of smoke emitted can be quite extensive. Also the storage of tyres at the contractor’s depots could be worthwhile investigating due to the sensitive surroundings. -          Regarding the Malmberget mine, the sites with wood combustibles, tyres and conveyor belts are all interesting for further investigation due to the large amount of combustibles and the surroundings. -          With respect to flammable liquids: - The tank stations in the Kiruna and the Malmberget mine should be looked          into with respect to potential pool fires. - The larger workshops and warehouses in the Kiruna mine and the Malmberget     mine should also be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The crusher levels and draw points in the two mines should be investigated          with respect to spray fires. - The diesel tanks in the main ramps and the production areas should be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The media drifts, distribution levels, shaft hoisting levels and pumping stations    should be investigated with respect to pool fires. -          With respect to fire barriers, as the main ramps of each mine does not contain any fire barriers the impact of a vehicle fire in the main ramp would be interesting to investigate. It would also be interesting to validate the ventilation strategy in the Malmberget mine regarding preventing smoke spread to adjacent compartments. -          With respect to vehicles, all the common heavy vehicles listed in this report would be worthwhile to try to reconstruct a possible fire scenario for each type of vehicle. The reason for this is to have better tools when working on possible scenarios of each mine. -          Regarding <b>cables,</b> all <b>listed</b> sites with a high load of electrical cables would be interesting to investigate. Even though the immediate surroundings are not sensitive, an extensive smoke spread would make a large impact on {{a large portion of the}} mine. -          When looking into the ventilation system of the Kiruna mine, both the mine production area and the infrastructure part should be investigated due to the differences in each system and their surroundings. Also, the difference in systems whether you are below or above level 775 should be considered. The function and impact of oversteering should also be included in the investigations. -          The impact of a ventiflex PVC-tube being burned up on the fire behaviour in a production area should be investigated. The different fire scenarios in a production area depending on the position of the fire with respect to the ventilation should also be investigated. -          One scenario should put the fire right at the end of the intake air tube, other scenarios should be at a certain length interval from the end of the intake air tube. The likelihood of the power cables to the intake and exhaust air fans being burned off should be looked into. The impact on the surroundings should also be investigated. The return air fan capacity should be examined with respect to fires, such as vehicle fires. GRUVA...|$|R
