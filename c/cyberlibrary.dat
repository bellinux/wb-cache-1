2500|$|The Silliman Library System is {{composed}} of the Robert B. and Metta J. Silliman Library, which serves as the university library, and the local libraries of the College of Agriculture, College of Business Administration, College of Law, the Divinity School, the Allied Health Sciences, High School, Elementary and Early Childhood Schools. Among these libraries the Robert B. and Metta J. Silliman Library (university library) serves as the largest repository of books, periodicals and other reading materials. Built in 1978, the university library is a four-story structure with a seating capacity of 490 readers. It holds over 250,000 volumes, with enough space to accommodate 400,000 more. It also subscribes to 500 periodicals. Some courses provide instruction in the location of books and publications for research and other school work. Students can search for library materials using the On-Line Public Access Catalogue. [...] Instructions {{on how to use}} it are posted on the stations were the system is installed. [...] Research can also be done using the Internet through the <b>Cyberlibrary.</b> Students pay a semestral fee to avail of this service.|$|E
40|$|The {{domain of}} Tele-Learning {{may be a}} new one, but it has many roots. In essence, it {{can be defined as}} {{telematics}} applied for learning-related purposes. Examples of tele-learning may be defined by category relating to purpose. Thus five purposes of using 'Teleware' may be the publication and dissemination of information, such as through Web sites; structured communications through e-mail; collaboration through groupware; information and resource handling through search engines; and specific applications for course delivery and support. An alternative perspective relates to aspects of the user-interface and human- computer interactions, ranging from the software engineering world, to the importance of a cognitive and social fit in terms of potential usability and dissemination. In practice however, evaluating teleware to ensure tele-learning may take place requires an appropriate model. This paper outlines the 3 -G model, which hypothesises that an individual's likelihood of using a telematics application in teaching or learning can be expressed as a vector sum of three vectorsâ€“'gewin' or perceived pay-off, 'gemak' or level of difficulty or discomfort in making use of the application, and 'genot' or subjective personal interest in and response to the application. This model has the potential to provide a helpful interpretative framework in a number of investigations into the complex relationship between telematics materials and facilities, and the learning they may generate. It {{can also be used to}} assess the potential of new developments, such as <b>Cyberlibraries,</b> lesson-support environments, and course- support environments, that are emerging...|$|R
