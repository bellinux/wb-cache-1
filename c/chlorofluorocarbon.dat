5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. <b>Chlorofluorocarbon</b> restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{concerns}} {{developed over}} the role chlorofluorocarbons play in damaging the ozone layer. By 1996, almost all nations had banned <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> refrigerants and commercial production ceased. Fluorine continued {{to play a role}} in refrigeration though: hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were developed as replacement refrigerants.|$|E

25|$|Environmental cooperation– One of {{the biggest}} successes of {{environmental}} cooperation has been the agreement to reduce <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) emissions, as specified in the Montreal Protocol, {{in order to stop}} ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.|$|E
25|$|Sulfate {{aerosols}} promote complex {{chemical reactions}} on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical {{species in the}} stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly {{fall to the ground}} as acid rain. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
500|$|The Frigidaire {{division}} of General Motors (GM) experimented with <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> refrigerants {{in the late}} 1920s, and Kinetic Chemicals was formed as {{a joint venture between}} GM and DuPont in 1930 hoping to market Freon-12 (...) as one such refrigerant. It replaced earlier and more toxic compounds, increased demand for kitchen refrigerators, and became profitable; by 1949 DuPont had bought out Kinetic and marketed several other Freon compounds. Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) was serendipitously discovered in 1938 by Roy J. Plunkett while working on refrigerants at Kinetic, and its superlative chemical and thermal resistance lent it to accelerated commercialization and mass production by 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Freon is an odorless, colorless, nonflammable, and noncorrosive <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> and {{hydrochlorofluorocarbon}} refrigerant, {{which is}} used in air conditioning, refrigeration and some automatic fire-fighting systems. Refrigerators from the late 19th century until 1929 used toxic gases, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide as refrigerants.

2500|$|The {{main cause}} of ozone {{depletion}} and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, especially man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (<b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFCs), HCFCs, freons, halons), [...] referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by winds after being emitted at the surface. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Frigidaire, one of GE’s main competitors, {{synthesized}} Freon. [...] With {{the invention}} of synthetic refrigerants based mostly on a <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home and consumer use. [...] Freon {{led to the development}} of smaller, lighter, and cheaper refrigerators. The average price of a refrigerator dropped from $275 to $154 with the synthesis of Freon. This lower price allowed ownership of refrigerators in American households to exceed 50%. [...] Freon is a trademark of the DuPont Corporation and refers to these CFCs, and later hydro <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (HCFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFC), refrigerants developed in the late 1920s. These refrigerants were considered at the time to be less harmful than the commonly-used refrigerants of the time, including methyl formate, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide. The intent was to provide refrigeration equipment for home use without danger. These CFC refrigerants answered that need. In the 1970s, though, the compounds were found to be reacting with atmospheric ozone, an important protection against solar ultraviolet radiation, and their use as a refrigerant worldwide was curtailed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.|$|E
2500|$|PTFE was accidentally {{discovered}} in 1938 by Roy Plunkett {{while he was}} working in New Jersey for DuPont. As Plunkett attempted {{to make a new}} <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> refrigerant, the tetrafluoroethylene gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling [...] "empty." [...] Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. He found the bottle's interior coated with a waxy white material that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new fluorinated plastic (analogous to the already known polyethylene) in 1941, and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.|$|E
