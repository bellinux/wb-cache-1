40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) {{are capable}} of persisting in the environment, transporting between phase media and accumulating to high levels, implying that they could pose a risk of causing adverse effects to {{human health and the}} environment. Consequently, most OCPs are designated as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and even as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The objective of this paper was to review the current status of pesticide POPs in Taiwan, including aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, α/β-hexachlorocyclohexanes, lindane, mirex, pentachloro-benzene, and toxaphene. The information about their environmental properties, banned use, carcinogenic toxicity and environmental levels, can be connected with the regulatory infrastructure, which has been established by the joint-venture of the <b>central</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> (i. e., Environmental Protection Administration, Department of Health, Council of Agriculture, and Council of Labor Affairs). The significant progress to be reported is that the residual levels of these pesticide-POPs, ranging from trace amounts to a few ppb, have declined notably in recent years...|$|R

And the Child Welfare Law and Youth Welfare Law were amended and merged as Child and Youth Welfare Law in 2003 {{to go along with the}} international trend. According to article 6 of the detailed rules for the implementation of this law, “children with developmental delay” is defined as children with suspected abnormalities or expected to develop suspected abnormalities on various aspects such as cognition development, physiological development, language and communication development, psychological & social development or self-care skills and have undergone the evaluation process in any hospital approved by the competent authority in charge of healthcare issues and have been confirmed with such abnormalities and issued a certificate. Furthermore, according to this very same article, “early intervention service” is defined as any necessary healthcare and treatment, education, consultation, referral, accommodation and other services that are provided by social welfare, healthcare, education professionals in team work according to the individual needs of children with developmental delay under the age of 6 and their families.|$|E
40|$|In {{support to}} a {{decision}} {{to be made by}} the Swedish <b>central</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> on a minimal amount of straw for conventional growing-finishing pigs, a study using 168 pigs provided 7 different amounts of straw (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200 or 300 grams/pig/day) was performed. The straw was provided either once or four times per day. Detailed behaviour observations were made using focal animal sampling and continuous recording for one hour between 9 and 10 am and again between 3 and 4 pm. The data analysis is presented in three ways: broken stick model, polynomial trend line and logarithmic trend line. No method was suitable on its own but the use of all the methods simultaneously was found to portray the data in the best way. No significant differences were found when comparing pens provided with straw once or four times per day. The maximum time spent in manipulative behavior towards straw could not be observed in the current study suggesting that the amount of straw needed for pigs to perform that behavior at maximum is above 300 g. The time spent in manipulative behaviour directed towards straw was increased over 10 % ranging up to 27 % in all the pens receiving over 200 g of straw per day compared to the range from 4 - 22 % in pens receiving 20 - 100 g of straw. Meanwhile, the time spent in redirected behaviour was decreased below 5 % in all the pens receiving over 200 g of straw per day. 200 g is also the value received when using the broken stick model for data of redirected behaviour from all the pens...|$|E
40|$|As Taiwan has a dense {{population}} and only limited natural resources, {{the government began}} actively establishing a Taiwan’s sustainable development indicators (TSDI) system in 2003 to evaluate the progress towards sustainability. Commonly used pesticides could pose a risk of causing adverse effects to food sanitation, {{human health and the}} environment. Thus, the pesticide usage rate per hectare of farmland and the area of organic cultivation have been selected as agricultural sustainability indicators. The objective of this paper was to describe an analysis of current status of pesticide use and regulatory policy for environmental sustainability in Taiwan. Furthermore, it can be connected with the regulatory infrastructure, which has been established by the joint-venture of the <b>central</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> (i. e., Council of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Administration, Department of Health, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Council of Labor Affairs) for controlling and/or preventing pesticide distribution in the environment. The significant progress is that the residual pesticides have notably declined in the past decade, which was in parallel with the pesticide usage rate decreased and organic farming area increased. For example, total area of organically certified cropping in Taiwan has been increased from 900 hectares (ha) in 2001 to about 4, 500 ha in 2010. Finally, some recommendations for the pollution prevention and toxicity reduction of pesticide use were also addressed to progress towards a sustainable agriculture in Taiwan. </p...|$|R

The “site safety survey group” was established immediately after the meeting to start the safety evaluation and survey of the sites of permanent relocation. The group consisted of experts from <b>central</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities,</b> professional engineering associations and universities (those who are specialized in civil engineering, water resources, geology, water and soil conservation, and environmental protection), and representatives from local governments (city/county governments and township offices), charity groups (NGOs), local reconstruction shareholders and the public. The group was gathered to perform the initial survey of these permanent sites and help the government accelerate the reconstruction progress. The permanent relocation sites to be surveyed were government lands, state-owned properties and abandoned school lands owned or operated by local governments, military lands not in use or lands owned by Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The lands recommended by the Council of Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan were given higher priorities. For the surveyed sites, the maps of “limited development areas” and “disaster potential areas” and the “strategic reconstruction zoning” charts approved by the Executive Yuan were developed for limited development analysis, and the result was provided to the survey group for the knowledge and diagnosis of areas surrounding the sites. The accounts of the locals were added to the evaluation and judgment. On the completion of the surveys, the survey records were collected and the statistics and evaluation results were compiled into a site survey overview, which was integrated with the comments provided in the records and by the experts for the reference of the site development. The sites that were evaluated as appropriate were given to local governments on the list of reserve sites for permanent relocation. From Aug 20 2009 to Sep 30 2010, 145 sites that met the strategic reconstruction zoning” were surveyed, and 77 were selected as appropriate sites for relocation. 102 experts in total were invited for the surveys. The survey results were provided to local governments for the selection of post-disaster residence relocation...|$|R
