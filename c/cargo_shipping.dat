5|$|As a {{steamship}} line connecting northern {{cities and}} the south, the Old Bay Line hauled a considerable volume of freight between the two regions and their ships' cargo holds were filled with bales of cotton, produce, and other goods.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>shipping</b> in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, PLAN begun to convert Qiongsha-class <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> to {{ambulance}} transport {{to meet the}} urgent maritime/naval medical needs. A pair of Qiongsha-class converted {{was not enough to}} meet the need, so some other <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carry passengers were selected to be converted to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) to supplement the converted Qiongsha-class. The reason <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carrying passengers were specifically selected is because neither the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> nor the passenger ship could meet the requirement for conversion: the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> lacked the accommodation and comfort for crew and patient because it does not carry passengers, and passenger ship does not have the room needed to house the medical facilities and support equipment, so both types would require higher conversion cost because more work is needed for both types. In contrast, <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> that also carries passengers would cost less to convert to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) because it has what both <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and passenger ship lack. As a result, Type Long March cargo-passenger ship was selected for conversion.|$|R

As a result, the Star of Bengal was purchased by a San Francisco trading company J.J. Smith & Co. and, {{along with many other}} old European vessels, was taken around Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean.

25|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for Montreal, Quebec when {{shipping}} was unable to traverse the sea ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River.

In 1988, Cunard acquired Ellerman Lines and its small fleet of cargo vessels, organising the business as Cunard-Ellerman, however, only a few years later, Cunard decided to abandon the cargo business and focus solely on cruise ships. Cunard's cargo fleet was sold off between 1989 and 1991, with a single container ship, the second Atlantic Conveyor, remaining under Cunard ownership until 1996. In 1993, Cunard entered into a 10-year agreement to handle marketing, sales and reservations for the Crown Cruise Line, and its three vessels joined the Cunard fleet under the Cunard Crown banner.
