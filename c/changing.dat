5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour <b>changing.</b> A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without <b>changing</b> the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour <b>changing,</b> so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} in strategic planning of public and rail transport is the line planning problem to find a system of lines and its associated frequencies. The objectives of this planning process are usually manifold and often contradicting. The transport operator wants to minimize cost, whereas passengers want to have travel time shortest routes without any or only few <b>changings</b> between different lines. The travel quality of a passenger route depends on the travel time and {{on the number of}} necessary <b>changings</b> between lines and is usually measured by a disutility or impedance function. In practice the disutility strongly depends on the line plan, which is not known, but should be calculated. The presented model combines line planning models and traffic assignment model to overcome this dilemma. Results with data of Berlin 2 ̆ 7 s city public transportion network are reported...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} attentional dispersion on sensory-motor processing of anticipatory postural control during unilateral arm abduction. Methods: Thirteen adults performed arm abduction under {{two types of}} attentional dispersion conditions. A target stimulus was presented with 30 % probability in two- or three-positions. By cue signal presentation, subjects either focused their attention on one position or divided attention {{for two or three}} positions and abducted right arm for target stimulus. Event-related potentials and onset time of postural muscles were measured. Results: P 1 -N 1 and N 2 amplitudes decreased with attentional dispersion in both conditions, but P 3 did not change. With attentional dispersion to three-positions, N 2 latency increased and start of late CNV was delayed, and also the onset time of gluteus medius was late in correlation to the late CNV <b>changings,</b> with no <b>changings</b> in two-positions. Conclusions: With attentional dispersion, brain activation decreased in the area related to the sensory processing and especially in the stimulus discrimination area. With increasing attentional dispersion, the delay in motor preparation or anticipatory attention to target stimuli was related to the delay in stimulus discrimination and onset time of postural muscle activation. Significance: Effects of attentional dispersion on sensory-motor processing of anticipatory postural control were experimentally demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Key words: vortex breakdown, {{cylinder}} Abstract. In {{this paper}} the vortex breakdown {{phenomenon of the}} rotating flow within a closed cylinder with an instationary rotating lid is considered by calculating the viscous and laminar internal cylinder flow solving the unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations. Thereby the rotation speed of the lid is linearly increased, which causes a gradual transition of the internal flow from a flow without any reversed flow at the vortex axis to a flow {{with one or more}} vortex breakdown bubbles. Later on the vortex breakdown bubbles disappear again. One research topic is to describe the transition phenomenologically using a simple visualization technique based on the magnitude of axial velocity and streamline integration. Beyond that a topological analysis has be done to get an impression of the main flow structures, their behaviour and <b>changings.</b> This is done by an advanced search for critical points of the velocity field both locally and in time. At these singular points the velocity magnitude vanishes and a structural change becomes obvious. The birth of critical points of the velocity field marks the beginning of the vortex breakdown in place and time and allows to compare the topological <b>changings</b> of different vector fields locall...|$|R
