30|$|Rail <b>corrugation</b> is an undulatory wear which {{occasionally}} {{occurs on}} the rail rolling surface. The research history of rail <b>corrugation</b> {{can be traced back}} to 1900 s. Since then, many researchers have made gigantic contributions to the understanding of the generation mechanism of rail <b>corrugation.</b> It is well known that the generation mechanism of rail <b>corrugation</b> consists of both the material damage and wavelength fixing mechanisms [1]. Several sagacious concepts have been proposed in the literature, which include the wear law of the frictional power causing rail working surface wear [2], the feedback mechanism for <b>corrugation</b> development [3], the contact filter [4], the pinned–pinned resonance [5], and so on. Specifically, Hempelmann et al. [2] studied rail <b>corrugation,</b> holding an opinion that rail working surface wear is dominated by the wear law of the frictional power. Hempelmann and Knothe [3] extended a linear model to study the short pitch <b>corrugation.</b> Müller [6] studied rail <b>corrugation</b> from the instability of the wheel–rail system. Igeland and Ilias [7] studied rail <b>corrugation</b> from the viewpoint of non-linear interaction between wheel and rail. Knothe and Ripke [8] studied parameter sensitivity of rail <b>corrugation.</b> Andersson and Johansson [9] studied rail <b>corrugation</b> using a three-dimensional wheel–rail interaction model. Johansson and Nielsen [10] studied the influence of powered wheelsets with wheel tread irregularities on rail <b>corrugation.</b> Clark [11] and Brockley [12] studied rail <b>corrugation</b> from the viewpoint of stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Wu and Thompson [13] attributed rail <b>corrugation</b> to the micro-slip between wheel and rail. Xie and Iwnicki [14] analyzed the railhead wear using a three-dimensional non-Hertzian and non-steady contact model. Daniel and Coworkers [15] discussed the effect of the wheel pass time delay on rail <b>corrugation.</b> Matsumoto [16] and Suda [17] all believed that rail <b>corrugation</b> was probably due to the stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Sun and Simson [18] studied rail <b>corrugation</b> using an integrated model including rail surface roughness and stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Jin [19] developed a comprehensive three-dimensional train-track model to study rail <b>corrugation.</b> Contributions from these researchers constitute the theoretical groundwork of rail <b>corrugation.</b>|$|R

The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical <b>corrugations</b> of 2 to 20 m amplitude; the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60km in 1995 to 30km by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ~1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the rings out of the equatorial plane. A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter's main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.|$|E
40|$|Rail <b>corrugation</b> is a {{periodic}} wear pattern that develops {{on the wheel}} and rail contacting surfaces in railway systems. It is a commonly observed phenomenon worldwide and {{is a serious problem}} because it causes degradation of the track and its components and is a significant source of noise. Currently the only reliable method of ameliorating the negative effects of rail <b>corrugation</b> is to periodically regrind the rail surface to a smooth profile, at great expense to the railway operator. It is therefore of interest to investigate other possible control strategies to reduce <b>corrugation</b> growth through an understanding of the mechanism of <b>corrugation</b> formation. This thesis presents an investigation into the effect of speed variation on the <b>corrugation</b> formation mechanism. The research presented is intended to highlight the significant role that speed variation has on <b>corrugation</b> formation via a disruption of the feedback mechanism which leads to <b>corrugation</b> growth over successive train passages. This discovery motivates the investigation the feasibility of altered speed variation as a novel <b>corrugation</b> control method, due to the large effect that the variance of train speed has on <b>corrugation</b> growth rates. The effect of variable pass speed on <b>corrugation</b> formation has been investigated in this thesis through the use of efficient models of <b>corrugation</b> formation in straight track and cornering conditions. These models are simple enough to readily perform <b>corrugation</b> control studies without neglecting any relevant physics, obscuring the <b>corrugation</b> formation mechanism with overly detailed modelling or imposing a significant computational burden on performing control studies. These novel models have been outlined and their predictions elucidated in detail. A theoretical investigation into the effect of speed variation {{in the presence of a}} resonance free mechanism for <b>corrugation</b> growth via a contact filter has been performed and shown to only be important when the dynamic wavelength of formation approaches the size of the contact patch. The results of these <b>corrugation</b> models have been validated via test rig and field experiments. An investigation of the effectiveness of speed variation as a <b>corrugation</b> growth control measure has also been investigated via test rig experiments.

Statistically significant relationships between average daily rainfall, humidity {{and the growth of}} rail <b>corrugation</b> were investigated using meterological and railway site field monitoring of a metropolitan network test site with a recurring rail <b>corrugation</b> of about 95 mm wavelength. <b>Corrugation</b> growth rate (Gr) was determined by systematically measuring the longitudinal rail profile with a <b>Corrugation</b> Analysis Trolley (CAT) on the 240 m radius, narrow gauge, concrete-sleepered curve.

50|$|Rail <b>corrugation</b> {{is a type}} {{of track}} wear that {{develops}} from track and train wheel set contact over time. Once this process has started it will begin to grow exponentially worse as time progresses. The wear that develops due to the wheel set contact between railways takes its form in the many troughs and crests it leaves behind over time {{which may or may not}} develop into rail <b>corrugation</b> depending on the circumstances. Rails that are heavily used and put under continual and constant wear will develop rail <b>corrugation.</b> Rail <b>corrugation</b> is represented in wavelength. Typically, heavily corrugated rails experience a concave deformation on the top of the railroad track in 20mm to 200mm intervals. Significant rail <b>corrugation</b> can decrease the service life span of tracks and make the replacement of the affected railroad track necessary. Rail <b>corrugation</b> is caused by the friction between the rail and the train wheels tangentially, vertically, and axially. Wear <b>corrugation</b> is a result of friction on the lower rail, which comes in contact with the train wheel. Excessive <b>corrugation</b> can be identified by the wavelength found on the higher, or outer, rail. Rail <b>corrugation</b> may be limited or lessened with the use of heat treated or alloyed rails, as oppose to the traditionally used carbon composite rail. The estimated tendency for wear is calculated by taking into account fluctuations in track and wheel set contact which causes the amount of wear to vary. The dynamic properties of different lines of the track can lead to varied degrees of rail <b>corrugation</b> through the use of high-speed wheel sets. In a study of high-speed railroad tracks, four types of tracks were studied for their tendency to develop <b>corrugation</b> (RHEDA 200, AFTRAV, STEDEF, and high performance ballasted track) and of the four considered the ballasted track was the one least prone to rail <b>corrugation</b> with the AFTRAV track being the second most reliable as well.|$|R
