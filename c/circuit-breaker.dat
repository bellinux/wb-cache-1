2500|$|School {{district}} trustees approved $150,000 in 2010 {{to conduct}} an architectural study of the building. Representatives from seven architectural and engineering firms toured the facility on June 30, 2011. In 2015, GFPS officials proposed a $98 million bond levy to improve GFHS, C.M. Russell High School, and 20 of the city's elementary and middle schools. The proposal included $20.76 million in infrastructure improvements at GFHS, to include a new heating and ventilation system; replacement of all electrical outlets and <b>circuit-breaker</b> panels; replacement of all fresh water pipes, sinks, toilets, and water fountains; replacement of insulation-covered 1960s windows with new energy-efficient windows; remodeling of all main building classrooms (including installation of audio-visual and other flexible modern teaching technology); creation of new parking areas; installation of a main fiber optic line in the main building, with a peripheral line to each classroom; and construction of a reliable and high-speed wireless system throughout the campus. The proposal also included $16.57 million in new constructure at Great Falls High, including construction of a [...] "Hub" [...] building containing career and technical education (CTE) classrooms; eight science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classrooms; a modern and expanded cafeteria and dining space; an informal social and gathering space for students; two new main entrances to the school (replacing the existing main building and fieldhouse entrances). The [...] Hub would also act as a bridging structure, connecting the main building, existing industrial arts annex, fieldhouse, and South Campus so that students would {{no longer need to}} go outdoors to move from one facility to another. It would also make access to all four building much easier for students with physical disabilities. Another $705,000 would be spent replacing sod at Memorial Stadium with artificial turf, to allow more use and generate more revenue as well as to cut down substantially on maintenance costs. The running track would also be resurfaced. Another $250,000 would be spent upgrading the school's antiquated telephone system. About $975,000 would be used to transform grassy areas into student parking. Voters approved the high school levy on October 4, 2016, by 60.9 percent (11,341 to 7,187).|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to analyze the}} risks of HV <b>circuit-breakers,</b> develop the probabilistic models, breakdown the cost structure and establish the improved maintenance strategies. Normally, HV <b>circuit-breakers</b> have been maintained by using manufacturers’ guidelines and experiences of operators. It is not well proved that such maintenance programs are effective regarding costs and performance. Although there are many literatures introducing the optimal maintenance for HV <b>circuit-breakers,</b> most of them propose only the ideas and mathematical models without the reference from the failure database. In this context it was challenging to design and investigate reliability and maintenance strategies {{in connection with the}} failure database. This thesis was constructed of three main parts to handle such problems. In the first part, the failure modes and effects analysis method was applied to determine the risks of components of HV <b>circuit-breakers.</b> The second part was to develop the probabilistic models to investigate the reliability of HV <b>circuit-breakers</b> and failure development. In the last part the cost structure of HV <b>circuit-breakers</b> was determined. In addition, the optimal maintenance strategies during useful and wear-out period were established. The failure database of HV <b>circuit-breakers</b> collected by the Institute of Power Systems, Darmstadt University of Technology had been implemented in all parts...|$|R
