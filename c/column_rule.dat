Design expressions for simply-supported beams braced regularly along their span with elastic restraints, based on analytically-derived formulae, are presented herein. These include the minimum restraint stiffness required to force the beam to buckle in between the restraint nodes and the forces induced in the restraints, along with a brief treatment of the critical moment of the beam. It is demonstrated that there is close agreement between the values obtained from the design formulae and their original analytical counterparts. These are also compared with the results from design formulae based on analogous column behaviour, an approach commonly used in design codes.

This paper using Bernoulli's transformation examines an elastic uniform <b>column</b> <b>ruled</b> by the generalized Hooke’s law and subjected to axial surface tractions at its free end or a free axial vibration, and shows that the above differentiability assumptions underlying classical analysis are equivalent and actually constitute a limitation to the class of the response functions.

Removing the limitation through nontermwise differentiability of Bernoulli’s transformation results in a damped response of the elastic column, which indicates that damping actually complies with the generalized Hooke’s law as applied to elastic continua...|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} {{analyses}} the lateral stability of imperfect discretely-braced steel beams using variational methods. To facilitate the analysis, Rayleigh-Ritz approximations {{are used to}} model the lateral deflection and the angle of twist. The applicability of the methods is initially demonstrated for the cases of unrestrained and continuously restrained beams by comparison with both analytical and numerical solutions of the governing differential equations of the respective systems. The method is then applied in full {{to the case of}} a discretely-braced beam. Initially, it is assumed that the degrees of freedom (DOFs) can be represented by single harmonics; this is then compared to the more accurate representation of the DOFs as full Fourier series. After carrying out a linear eigenvalue analysis of the system, it is found that the beam can buckle into two separate classes of modes: a finite number of modes, equal to the number of restraints provided, which involve displacement of the restraint nodes and interaction between distinct sets of harmonics, and an infinite number of single harmonic internodal buckling modes where the nodes remain undeflected. Expressions are derived for the elastic critical moment of the beam, the forces induced in the restraints and the threshold stiffness, i. e. the minimum stiffness required to enforce the first internodal buckling mode, whereupon the beam attains its maximum achievable critical moment. The analytical results for the critical moment of the beam are validated by the finite element program LTBeam, while the results for the deflected shape of the beam are validated by the numerical continuation software Auto- 07 p, with very close agreement between the analytical and numerical results. Design formulae, from which practical design rules can be developed, are given for the critical moment, restraint force and threshold stiffness. The design rules return values close to those predicted from theory. When compared against equivalent design rules developed based on analogies with column behaviour, it is found that the <b>column</b> <b>rules</b> are generally overly conservative for restraints attached close to the compression ange and considerably unsafe for restraints attached close to the shear centre.

40|$|A {{direction-finding}} system with multiple direction finders (DFs) {{is a military}} intelligence system designed to detect the positions of transmitters of radio frequencies. This dissertation studies three decision {{problems associated with the}} {{direction-finding system}}. The first part of this dissertation is to prescribe DF deployment to maximize the effectiveness with which transmitter positions are estimated in an area of interest (AOI). Three methods are presented to prescribe DF deployment. The first method uses Stansfield?s probability density function to compute objective function coefficients numerically. The second and the third employ surrogate measures of effectiveness as objective functions. The second method, like the first, involves complete enumerations; the third formulates the problem as an integer program and solves it with an efficient network-based label-setting algorithm. Our results show that the third method, which involved use of a surrogate measure as an objective function and an exact label-setting algorithm, is most effective. The second part of this dissertation is to minimize the number of DFs to cover an AOI effectively, considering obstacles between DFs and transmitters. We formulate this problem as a partial set multicover problem in which at least -fraction of the likely transmitter positions must be covered, each by at least direction finders. We present greedy heuristics with random selection rules for the partial set multicover problem, estimating statistical bounds on unknown optimal values. Our results show that the greedy heuristic with <b>column</b> selection <b>rule,</b> which gives priority for selecting a column that advances more rows to k-coverage, performs best on the partial set multicover problems. Results also show that the heuristic with random row and <b>column</b> selection <b>rules</b> is the best of the heuristics with respect to statistical bounds. The third part of this dissertation deals with the problem of deploying direction finders with the goal of maximizing the effectiveness with which transmitter positions can be estimated in an AOI while hedging against enemy threats. We present four formulations, considering the probability that a direction finder deployed at a location will survive enemy threats over the planning horizon (i. e., not be rendered inoperative by an attack). We formulate the first two as network flow problems and present an efficient label-setting algorithm. The third and the fourth use the well-known Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) risk measure to deal with the risk of being rendered inoperative by the enemy. Computational results show that risk-averse decision models tend to deploy some or all DFs in locations that are not close to the enemy to reduce risk. Results also show that a direction-finding system with 5 DFs provides improved survivability under enemy threats...|$|R

The study was conducted {{over a wide range}} of concrete cube strengths ranging from 30 to 110 MPa. The external diameter of the steel tube-to-plate thickness (D / t) ratio ranged from 15 to 80 covering compact steel tube sections. An accurate finite element model was developed to carry out the analysis. Accurate nonlinear material models for confined concrete and steel tubes were used. The column strengths and load-axial shortening curves were evaluated. The results obtained from the finite element analysis were verified against experimental results. An extensive parametric study was conducted to investigate the effects of different concrete strengths and cross-section geometries on the strength and behaviour of concrete-filled compact steel tube circular stub columns. The column strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American, Australian and European specifications.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{methods to}} compile {{recursive}} function free Horn clause programs, called DATALOG, {{have been proposed}} in the literature. Most of them perform a rewriting of the rules using MAGIC or PROBLEM predicates in order to push selections before recursion. Rewritten rule systems are generally complex and difficult to translate in optimized relational algebra programs. Moreover, they generally generate too many results; thus, the query must {{be applied to the}} generated results to eliminate nonrelevant answers. After a survey of the existing compilation techniques which point out their limitations, we develop the magic function method. It is based on an interpretation of the query as a function which maps one column of a relation to another <b>column.</b> The <b>rules</b> are first translated into a connection graph and then, by a traversal of the associated graph, rewritten into a fixpoint functional equation. The resolution of this fixpoint equation using Tarski's theorem leads to efficient computations of the query answer. In particular, the derived algorithms push selections through recursion, because selections appear as function arguments. They generate only relevant answers to a given query. The {{purpose of this paper is}} mainly the introduction of a generalized method to obtain the fixpoint functional equation. The method is general enough to handle all binary rules, cyclic rules and function symbols. The main advantages of the method are: (1) It generates directly an optimized relational algebra program. (2) It performs a symbolic pre-computation which permits rule redundancy elimination. (3) It fully supports function symbols and range queries. Finally, an efficient execution algorithm working both on symbolic magic functions and data is proposed to evaluate recursive queries...|$|R

40|$|The pool of {{knowledge}} {{available to the}} mankind depends on the source of learning resources, which can vary from ancient printed documents to present electronic materials. The rapid conversion of material available in traditional libraries to digital form needs {{a significant amount of}} work for format preservation. Most of the printed documents contain not only characters and its formatting but also some associated non text objects such as tables, charts and graphical objects. Since most of the existing optical character recognition techniques face challenges in detecting such objects and do not concentrate on the format preservation of the contents while reproducing them, we attempt to locate all type of tables in scanned documents with heterogeneous layout. Generally all the documents with multi columns are not purely divided by the inter column space. Long headings, centered aligned page numbers, lengthy text in headers and footer and horizontal lines extremely interfere the inter column space which was commonly used in layout analysis. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm using specific threshold to eliminate the interfering parts in inter column space and using local thresholds for word space and line height to detect and extract all categories of tables from scanned documents. From the experiment performed in 50 documents, we conclude that our algorithm has an overall accuracy of about 73 % in detecting tables from multi-column layout. Even though complex layout document still have some problem, the system could treat some of these kind of documents as well. Since the algorithm does not completely depend on number of columns, inter <b>column</b> spaces, <b>rule</b> lines which bound the tables, it can detect all categories of tables in a range of different layout scanned documents...|$|R

We argue more advanced scheduling methods can help, depending on circumstances. We introduce three basic scheduling approaches (insertion, combined and column generation) for the static problem. We then extend these to a dynamic, real-time setting with rolling horizons. We propose two further real-time scheduling approaches: dynamic assignment with and without look-ahead, respectively. The performances of the above five scheduling approaches are compared with two of the best performing look-ahead dispatching rules known from literature. The performance of the various approaches depends on the facility layout and work distribution. However, column generation, the combined heuristic, and the assignment approach with look-ahead consistently outperform dispatching <b>rules.</b> <b>Column</b> generation can require substantial calculation time but delivers very good performance if sufficient look-ahead information is available.

If we needed to change the training set at any point of our research, we would have to do the entire task again. The task was hence a time taking one. To eliminate the manual addition of rules, a function was written to make the process of rule building easy and replicable for any training set. It was called the RuleMatrix method. The function takes a training set as parameter and returns a rule matrix for that training set.
