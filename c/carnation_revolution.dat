5|$|In {{a prelude}} to the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{in the early morning}} of 16 March 1974, the Fifth Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria 5), based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants (Escola de Sargentos do Exército), {{attempted}} to stage a coup d'état against the country's authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4:00a.m., heading for Lisbon, where they planned to occupy the airport. On approaching the capital, the Caldas regiment found themselves alone, realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined the upheaval. The regiment turned back and reached their Caldas quarters at around 10:00a.m., locking themselves in and awaiting a siege. The compound was surrounded by various forces, which penetrated the base at about 5:00p.m. The revolters were arrested and sent to various military prisons, where they were held until the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> on 25 April 1974, 40 days later.|$|E
5|$|Under the Constitution of Portugal {{adopted in}} 1976, {{in the wake}} of the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the President is elected to a five-year term; there is no limit to the number of terms a {{president}} may serve, but a president who serves two consecutive terms may not serve again in the next five years after the second term finishes.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal had allowed {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US subprime mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies to succumb, and was affected very deeply.|$|E
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were {{better able to}} create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution.</b> The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in Lisbon, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, {{and the new}} head of government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held {{the upper hand}} during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces. Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> backed by portions {{of the military in}} Portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the military coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's military coup, and, on the other hand, the pressure of the international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's Lisbon mission {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key {{link between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered {{the closure of the}} Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Portuguese <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{against the}} authoritarian Estado Novo {{returned}} Portugal to a multi-party system and facilitated {{the independence of}} the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor. In Africa, where Angolan rebels had waged a multi-faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961, a two-decade civil war replaced the anti-colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Cubans and the Soviets, and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), backed by the United States, the People's Republic of China, and Mobutu's government in Zaire. The United States, the apartheid government of South Africa, and several other African governments also supported a third faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Without bothering to consult the Soviets in advance, the Cuban government sent a number of combat troops to fight alongside the MPLA. Foreign mercenaries and a South African armoured column were deployed to support UNITA, but the MPLA, bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance, eventually gained the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of Luanda, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. Zaire, in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards Zaire. The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital Luanda.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> in 1974, the Portuguese society, {{after several}} decades of repression, regained freedom of speech.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{the regions}} and provinces were {{abolished}} and the districts became {{the second level}} administrative regions.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{following}} the anti-colonialist <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Portugal relinquished all claims over Macau and proposed to return Macau over to Chinese sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The {{brutality}} of the PIDE/DGS is dramatised in the 2000 film April Captains (about {{the events of the}} day of the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution).</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the {{dictatorship}} in Portugal with the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> of 1974, the old 1938 format of the competitions needed some changes.|$|E
25|$|Education {{has been}} a subject of {{controversy}} in Portugal due {{to a number of}} erratic policies and the state of flux it has experienced by several long periods, particularly between the <b>carnation</b> <b>revolution</b> coup of 1974 to the Bologna process of 2007.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> on April 25, 1974, Portugal {{started its}} {{decolonization}} process and withdrew its military forces from its oversea territories. With {{this change in}} policy and strategy the acquisition of the Mirage III stopped being a priority and the new political regime did not continue the negotiation process.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{that same}} music {{was used to}} support left-wing parties. Political ideas and causes, like the agrarian reform, socialism, equality, {{democratic}} elections, free education and many other were a constant presence in these songs lyrics, often written by well-known poets like José Barata-Moura, Manuel Alegre or Ary dos Santos.|$|E
25|$|Since 1946 {{the final}} game has been played at the Estádio Nacional near Lisbon in Jamor, except in 1961 (albeit Estádio das Antas being the home of FC Porto, an {{agreement}} was made between the two sides, since it was also quite nearer for Leixões to play), {{in the three years}} following the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> and in the season 1982/83, due to FC Porto pressure. In the years after the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the venue of {{the final game}} would be played at the home ground of the team that won the Portuguese Cup the previous year (note that when Boavista won the Cup two times in a row, the final of the next years were in Estádio das Antas (FC Porto's home ground at the time), since the Estádio do Bessa (Boavista's home ground) was too small to host the final.|$|E
25|$|From the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> onwards the {{adoption}} of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both {{the adoption}} and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen {{in the majority of}} cases in recent years (60%). Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife's surname(s), but this practice is rare.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s to the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{secondary}} and university education experienced the fastest growth of Portuguese education's history. After 1974 {{the number of}} basic and secondary schools {{as well as of}} higher education institutions, increased {{until the end of the}} century, sometimes without the necessary allocation of quality material and qualified human resources.|$|E
25|$|The post <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{period was}} {{characterized}} by chaos and negative economic growth as industries were nationalised and {{the negative effects of}} the decoupling of Portugal from its former territories were felt. Heavy industry came to an abrupt halt. All sectors of the economy from manufacturing, mining, chemical, defence, finance, agriculture and fishing went into free fall.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 the Portuguese had 79,000 in arms—58,000 in the Army, 8,500 in the Navy and 12,500 in the Air force (Cann, 1997). These numbers grew quickly. By {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} in 1974, due to the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> (a military coup in Lisbon), the total in the Portuguese Armed Forces had risen to 217,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} war {{came with}} the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{military}} coup of April 1974. The withdrawal resulted in the exodus {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Portuguese citizens plus military personnel of European, African and mixed ethnicity from the former Portuguese territories and newly independent African nations. This migration is regarded as one of the largest peaceful migrations in the world's history.|$|E
25|$|During {{the events}} of the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> the convent was encircled by {{military}} rebels, who opposed the Estado Novo regime. The regime's last President, Marcelo Caetano, and forces loyal to his regime were holed-up in the garrison, and eventually surrendered to the future democratic President António de Spínola. The old convent was eventually transformed into the headquarters of the Republican Guard (Guarda Republicana).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century the Portuguese {{government}} encouraged white emigration to Angola and Mozambique, and by the 1970s, there were up to 1 million Portuguese settlers living in their overseas African provinces. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975, after the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> while others moved to Brazil and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{the powers}} of the {{presidency}} varied widely; some presidents were virtual dictators (such as Pais, and Carmona in his early years), while others were little more than figureheads (such as Carmona in his later years, Craveiro Lopes, and Américo Thomaz; during their administrations, supreme power was held by President of the Council of Ministers António de Oliveira Salazar).|$|E
25|$|Only the {{elections}} since the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> of 1974 are listed here. During the period encompassing the Constitutional Monarchy and the First Republic {{there were also}} elections, {{but only for a}} limited universe of voters. During the Estado Novo regime, from 1926 to 1974, the few elections held were not up to the democratic standards of their time and never resulted in power transfer.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a guerrilla}} {{war in which}} the Portuguese armed and {{security}} forces waged a counter-insurgency campaign against armed groups mostly dispersed across sparsely populated areas of the vast Angolan countryside. Many atrocities were committed by all forces involved in the conflict. In the end, the Portuguese achieved overall military victory, and before the <b>carnation</b> <b>revolution</b> in Portugal most of Angola's territory was under Portuguese control.|$|E
25|$|Portugal's right-wing governments {{cracked down}} on the {{language}} from 1936 until the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> of 1974. After the Spanish Civil War, Francoist Spain {{cracked down on}} the Anarchists and Catalan nationalists among whom the speaking of Esperanto had been quite widespread; but in the 1950s, the Esperanto movement was tolerated again, with Francisco Franco accepting the honorary patronage of the Madrid World Esperanto Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{forces of}} the MPLA, the UNITA, and the FNLA succeeded in their rebellion not because of their success in battle, {{but because of the}} Movimento das Forças Armadas' coup in Portugal. The MFA was an organisation of lower-ranked officers in the Portuguese Armed Forces which was responsible for the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> of 25 April 1974, which ended the Portuguese Colonial War and led to the independence of the Portuguese overseas territories.|$|E
25|$|Six {{months after}} the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> on 20 October 1974, the party's seventh {{congress}} took place. More than a thousand delegates and hundreds of Portuguese and foreign guests attended. The congress set forth important statements that discussed the ongoing revolution in the country. The 36 members of the elected central committee had in the aggregate experienced more than 300 years in jail. On 26 December 1974, the PCP became the first legally recognized party.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> <b>revolution</b> in Portugal, Paulo Portas {{was briefly}} sent {{to school in}} France but {{returned}} in 1975 to study at Lisbon's top private high school (Colégio S. João de Brito). In 1984 he got {{a law degree from}} the Portuguese Catholic University, where he met Manuel Monteiro who, 10 years later, would serve as Portas's stepping stone into the CDS-PP and national politics. He {{is said to be a}} Church-going Catholic.|$|E
25|$|Under the Portuguese Constitution {{adopted in}} 1976, {{in the wake}} of the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the President is elected to a five-year term; there is no limit to the number of terms a {{president}} may serve, but a president who serves two consecutive terms may not serve again in the next five years after the second term finishes or in the following five years after his resignation. The official residence of the Portuguese President is the Belém Palace.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Portugal and its {{overseas}} territories {{on the eve}} of the <b>Carnation</b> <b>Revolution</b> (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new capital equipment and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable consumer goods. The Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large business conglomerates.|$|E
