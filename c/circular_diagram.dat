We analyze real RNA structures from the databases wwPDB and Pseudobase, and classify them according to their topological genus. We compare the results of our statistical survey with existing theoretical and numerical models.

40|$|Preschoolers {{can often}} rattle off a long {{sequence}} of numbers in order, but have problems in reporting {{the exact number of}} objects even in a small set, and have trouble in comparing numerical relation of two sets that differ by exactly 1 item. The present study showed that representing and highlighting sets by showing a circular, enclosed diagram around them with or without a grouping gesture helps children to enhance their understanding of cardinality and to improve their overall math competence. Nighty-three preschool students, ages ranging from 3 years- 10 months to 4 years- 9 months (M= 51. 82 months, SD= 3. 56 months), from three public schools in Harlem, New York participated in this study. Children from each school were ranked based on their pre-test score on the Test of Early Mathematics Ability (TEMA- 3), and were then assigned randomly to one of the three math comparison groups or the reading control group. Children in diagram-plus-gesture math group, were asked to draw a bubble by making a grouping gesture around each of the two sets on a touch screen device, indicate the number of fish in each bubble, and judge whether there were the same number of fish in each bubble, and in case the number was not the same, indicate which set had more fish. Children in the diagram only condition simply saw bubbles around sets without the need to do a grouping gesture around them. Children in the no diagram- no gesture condition neither saw a bubble nor did a grouping gesture. All participants played on the software for 4 sessions within a two-week time period and the data were examined microgenetically. Results showed that all children in the math comparison groups improved in their math scores during the game-play and improved in their overall math competence from pre- to post-test, unlike the children in the reading control group. More importantly, children who saw the <b>circular</b> <b>diagram</b> (bubbles) around sets with or without the grouping gesture outperformed children who never saw bubbles nor made a grouping gesture in their accuracy, understanding of cardinality, and overall math competence from pre to post. Further, children with lower executive functioning skills benefitted from performing the grouping gesture in addition to seeing the <b>circular</b> <b>diagram.</b> Gestures can have the same form as diagrams, and hence, they may carry information that is redundant with diagrams. Such redundancy reinforces the message by presenting information in two modalities [...] a redundancy that may not be necessary for some, but beneficial to others (i. e. children with low executive functioning skills). Finally, over the course of game-play children who did the grouping gesture never counted the two sets together as one set when asked to compare their numerical relation [...] a mistake many preschoolers make; children in the other groups made that mistake occasionally. Because gestures are actions and dynamic by nature, they appear to be especially suited for changing actions and promoting early counting skills...|$|E

40|$|Cattle on {{smallholder}} {{farms are}} kept for socio-economic reasons, rather than physical production, {{which explains why}} farmers favour low input and discontinuous management. To find out how this form of livestock husbandry relates to the other main farming sub-systems, cattle-keeping was compared with cassava and black pepper production. Data was collected from 37 cattle-keeping, mixed smallholdings, during 15 visits, at monthly intervals. The three sub-systems were studied in terms of productive efficiency of resource use, socio-economic contribution, and ecosystem-friendliness, using cash flow, non-market output and non-parametric rankings. Their relative performances in each domain were ranked and put on an AMOEBA diagram, "a general method of system description and assessment". The markings connected across functions produced an outline of a polygon, reminding {{the shape of an}} amoeba. It was found that productive efficiency was lowest in cattle, benefit:cost ratio was highest in cassava, while return to labour was especially strong in black pepper production. The highest status, lowest production risk, highest liquidity and ease of sale, related to cattle. Cattle and pastures ranked worst in terms of biodiversity, damage to and pollution of water courses. Nutrient losses were highest in cassava, due to the large amount harvested. The differences in function meant that the three polygons occupied different segments of the <b>circular</b> <b>diagram.</b> Nevertheless, together they formed a well-rounded shape. The amoeboid nature of these polygons can be used to predict the effect of a shift of activity on the farm, making the diagram a useful illustrative tool for planning and teaching.

40|$|Since ancient times, {{philosophical}} and religious thinkers have made attempts {{to understand the}} nature of the mind. Today, new developments in technology enable scientists and researchers to explore the brain’s complex physical activity, revealing a deeper mental reality. Moreover, the emergence of low-cost biometric devices gives nonscientific communities an ability to explore usage of biometric data in variety of ways. This project explores visualization of human brain activity using electroencephalogram neural interface to create a visually engaging and meaningful user experience. The implementation of the project takes a form of an interactive installation. It projects the visual form, whose visual parameters are changed in real-time based on the participant’s brain wave signal values. The brain activity is monitored by the electroencephalogram (EEG) neural interface, which transmits the brain wave signal data of the participant’s brain activity to the computer program. The program analyzes signal values and manipulates the visual form. In order to create a meaningful and useful experiences, the research was conducted in areas of cognitive science, philosophy, symbolism and visual design. The visual form was designed based on the Kalachakra Mandala, a <b>circular</b> <b>diagram</b> used in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. It was selected as a reference because of its deep philosophical meaning and purpose. The user experience was evaluated based on qualitative methods that consisted of interviews and written questionnaires. It provided insights into the user’s experience and helped to determine potential applications. The method of recording and analyzing mathematical data of the brain activity was used to determine a credible quantitative evaluation method to be used in the future. The evaluation showed the majority of participants who tested the installation had a calming and relaxing experience.
