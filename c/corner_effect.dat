As {{a result of}} some fabrication-process limitations (as nonideal anisotropic overetch) some FinFETs have inclined surfaces, which results in trapezoidal cross sections instead of rectangular sections, as expected. This geometric alteration results in some device issues, like carrier profile, threshold voltage, and <b>corner</b> <b>effects.</b> This work analyzes these consequences based on three-dimensional numeric simulation of several dual-gate and triple-gate FinFETs.

Corners were found to accumulate and deplete more electrons than the flat sides or the channel center, when above (local accumulation) and below (local depletion) the flat-band voltage, respectively. On the contrary to the <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> in the inversion mode (IM) devices, there is no major contribution of corners in the subthreshold current, and therefore, there is no subthreshold device behavior degradation (only one threshold voltage in the system). N-type channel doping levels of 1 × 10 19, 5 × 10 18,and 1 × 10 18 cm− 3 were used for quasi-stationary device simulations of JL and AM MOSFETs, and <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> was studied for 5, 10, and 15 nm wide equilateral triangular Si NW MOSFETs with a 2 nm SiO 2 gate oxide thickness (VDS = 0 V;T = 300 K). While the local quantum and classical electron density peaks {{are located in the}} corner regions above the flat-band voltage, reducing the channel doping and the channel cross-section was found to slightly suppress the normalized total accumulation electron density per unit length, N acc t /(CWeff), in strong accumulation regime.

40|$|A direct {{numerical}} simulation of a fully developed, low-Reynolds-number turbulent flow in a square duct is presented. The numerical scheme employs a time-splitting method to integrate the three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using spectral/high-order finite-difference discretization on a staggered mesh; the nonlinear terms are represented by fifth-order upwind-biased finite differences. The unsteady flow field was simulated at a Reynolds number of 600 based on the mean friction velocity and the duct width, using 96 x 101 x 101 grid points. Turbulence statistics from the fully developed turbulent field are compared with existing experimental and numerical square duct data, providing good qualitative agreement.

Mechanisms responsible for the generation of the stress-driven secondary flow are studied by quadrant analysis and by analysing the instantaneous turbulence structures. It is demonstrated that the mean secondary flow pattern, the distorted isotachs and the anisotropic Reynolds stress distribution can be explained by the preferred location of an ejection structure near the corner and the interaction between bursts from the two intersecting walls. <b>Corner</b> <b>effects</b> are also manifested in the behaviour of the pressure-strain and velocity-pressure gradient correlations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Efficient handoff {{algorithms}} are {{a cost-effective}} way of enhancing the capacity and QoS of cellular system. The higher value of hysteresis effectively prevents unnecessary handoffs but causes undesired cell dragging. This undesired cell dragging causes interference or {{could lead to}} dropped calls in microcellular environment. The problems are further exacerbated by the <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> phenomenon which causes the signal level to drop by 20 - 30 dB in 10 - 20 meters. Thus, {{in order to maintain}} reliable communication in a microcellular system new and better handoff algorithms must be developed. A fuzzy based handoff algorithm is proposed in this paper as a solution to this problem. Handoff on the basis of ratio of slopes of normal signal loss to the actual signal loss is presented. The fuzzy based solution is supported by comparing its results with the results obtained in analytical solution. handoff decision time must be significantly reduced. In addition, there is <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> phenomenon in microcells (Fig. 1). The <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> causes the reduced signal strength at a mobile station (Ms) to drop off by 20 dB or more in few meters when turning a corner.

Moreover, detection is faster for a probe presented in a region adjacent {{to the corner of}} a stimulus, compared to a probe adjacent to the straight edge. This corner enhancement effect is believed to show that probes near corners receive enhanced processing (Cole et al 2007, Attention, Perception and Psychophysics 69, 400 – 412). We tested the <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> for convex and concave corners for surfaces arranged in depth. We used coloured regions with cast shadows to specify foreground and background and a square stimulus that could be perceived as either an object or a hole (a figure-ground reversal). The probe was a small red line that could appear near a corner or a straight edge 100 msec after the stimulus onset. We asked the participants to discriminate the orientation of the probe (horizontal or vertical). The <b>corner</b> <b>effect</b> was found for both convex (Experiment 1) and concave (Experiment 2) vertices but only when the probe was near the corner of the foreground surface (the pattern reversed for objects and holes).
