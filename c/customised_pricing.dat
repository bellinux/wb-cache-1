When {{there is no}} market or for <b>customised</b> <b>pricing,</b> the willingness-to-pay concept seems to be interesting. This article aims at presenting a synthesis of the marketing research stream relative to willingness to pay. First, a definition of the concept is given and compared to other similar concepts, notably reference price and acceptable price. Then the methods of measurement are presented, compared to those used to measure elasticity and criticized. Furthermore, the research on external determinants of willingness to pay is commented.

40|$|Estimation {{of price}} {{sensitivity}} from real world data is typically complicated by a dependence between price and demand, or endogeneity of price, since prices are regularly varied {{in anticipation of}} changes to demand. This problem is particularly severe in <b>customised</b> <b>pricing</b> environments, where sellers have some freedom to quote different prices for different orders, based on information about each customer and their order. When endogeneity is left untreated and price is modelled as an independent predictor, this leads to underestimation of price sensitivity and sub-optimal pricing strategies. Endogeneity bias is corrected by the inclusion of instrumental variables in the model; these are variables which are correlated with price and independent of demand, and allow us to separate the direct and indirect effects of price on demand. Whilst instrumental variable estimation {{has been well documented}} for retail pricing problems, their use in <b>customised</b> <b>pricing</b> is relatively under-represented in marketing literature. Here we present a probit model of purchasing behaviour for these environments, whereby the price offered to a customer and their corresponding price threshold are represented by a bivariate Gaussian random variable. Recorded or known sources of dependence between the two are introduced via covariate effects on the mean and unrecorded sources of dependence are captured by a residual correlation parameter. The parameters are identified by the inclusion of instrumental variables in the model. Using a two-stage estimation procedure, the model is fitted to telesales data for heating oil, and price sensitivity estimates are compared to those of a naive model, which does not correct for endogeneity bias. Bayesian estimation of the model is then performed via MCMC, and the resulting sample of parameters are used to examine the impacts of various price changes on profit...|$|E

POA gives these sellers the freedom to come up with a <b>customised</b> <b>price</b> for each potential buyer. For example a well-dressed businessman who comes from abroad to view the property will be told a higher price than a known local farmer.|$|R
5000|$|Reuters grew rapidly {{after its}} 1984 IPO, {{widening}} {{the range of}} its business products and global reporting network for media, financial and economic services. In 1988, Reuters formed a joint-venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to build an automated futures trading system named [...] "Globex" [...] {{at a cost of}} over US$100 million. Key product launches include Equities 2000 (1987), Dealing 2000-2 (1992), Business Briefing (1994), Reuters Television for the financial markets (1994), 3000 Series (1996) and the Reuters 3000 Xtra service (1999). In the mid-1990s, the Reuters company engaged in a brief foray in the radio sector - with London Radio's two radio stations, London News 97.3 FM and London News Talk 1152 AM. A Reuters Radio News service was also set up to compete with the Independent Radio News. In 1995, Reuters established its [...] "Greenhouse Fund" [...] to take minority investments in start-up technology companies, initially in the USA, only. In October 2007, Reuters Market Light, a division of Reuters, launched a mobile phone service for Indian farmers to provide local and <b>customised</b> commodity <b>pricing</b> information, news, and weather updates.|$|R
40|$|While {{product and}} service {{customisation}} strategies are employed {{by a growing}} number of successful companies on and off the Internet, <b>customised</b> <b>pricing</b> may offer greater potential profit. The basic idea of price customisation is simple: Charge every customer the (individual) price he is willing to pay based on the (individual) value he places on the product. However, identifying that value for each individual customer is often an impossible task. Thus, you {{have to find a way}} to bundle customers into segments according to their value perception and then fence off these segments from one another. Managers must therefore first determine the different values customers place on their product and what that value is worth to each in monetary terms. Once this is done and customers are divided into segments, managers can choose among five innovative techniques to implement price customisation (multi-dimensional pricing, multi-person pricing, price bundling, multi-product strategies and normal or Dutch auctions). A possible profit gain of 10 - 40 per cent could make it well worth investigating this innovative approach to pricing.

40|$|IPTV (Internet Protocol TeleVision) {{is being}} hailed by {{industry}} experts as the "future of television" {{and as such}} this dissertation looks into the business environment within which it operates. Seminal literature in the business field was reviewed to yield concepts that facilitated analysis of IPTV and the stakeholders therein. Using {{the internet as a}} transmission medium to broadcast media was found to present a unique set of opportunities and threats that differ from traditional TV transmission mediums. The opportunity for a novel revenue stream based around increased targeting of adverts within the programming was found through primary and secondary research. This increased targeting is made possible due to the customisation and break from linear programming that IPTV already facilitates. The crux of the novel revenue stream comes from customising the advertising that users of IPTV see by utilising information about the users. Primary research has shown that people are not adverse to the concept of volunteering increased amounts of information for the purpose of targeting adverts, especially when incentives such as reduced price were given. The IPTV industry {{has been found to be}} of two fundamental types; public internet IPTV and telecommunications IPTV. The distinctions between them are on many levels and the main similarity is that they both use the internet as a transmission medium. Telecommunications IPTV is more like traditional TV and as a result it will be more challenging to implement the novel revenue stream. The exact technical issues that would occur when implementing the novel revenue stream are not explored in great depth. The purpose of this dissertation is to generate a novel revenue stream that is possible within the IPTV industry that could be implemented, and to study the business implications rather than hardware and software needed to facilitate it. The implications of <b>pricing</b> <b>customised</b> adverts are explored and the proposed methods are analogous to internet advertising pricing and divergent from traditional TV advertising pricing...|$|R
