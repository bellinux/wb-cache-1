Conclusions from this testing include the following: (1) Testing with the bench-scale <b>coalescer</b> showed an increase in pressure drop from solid particles, but the increase was not as large as observed at MCU. (2) Cleaning the bench-scale <b>coalescer</b> with nitric acid reduced the pressure drop and removed a large amount of solid particles (11 g of bayerite if all aluminum is present in that form or 23 g of sodium aluminosilicate if all silicon is present in that form). (3) Based on analysis of the cleaning solutions from bench-scale test, the 'dirt capacity' of a 40 inch <b>coalescer</b> for the NAS solids tested is calculated as 450 - 950 grams. (4) Cleaning the full-scale <b>coalescer</b> with nitric acid reduced the pressure drop and removed a large amount of solid particles (60 g of aluminum and 5 g of silicon). (5) Piping holdup in the full-scale <b>coalescer</b> system caused the pH to differ from the target value.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>coalescer</b> {{process is}} one of the methods for oily water {{treatment}} by increasing the oil droplet size in order to enhance the separating velocity and thus effective separation. However, the presence of surfactants in an oily emulsion can limit the obtained mechanisms due to the small oil size related with stabilized emulsion. In this regard, the purpose of this research is to improve the efficiency of the <b>coalescer</b> process for treating the stabilized emulsion. The effects of bed types, bed height, liquid flow rate and stage <b>coalescer</b> (step-bed) on the treatment efficiencies in term of COD values were studied. Note that the treatment efficiency obtained experimentally was estimated by using the COD values and oil droplet size distribution. The study has shown that the plastic media has more effective to attach with oil particles than the stainless one due to their hydrophobic properties. Furthermore, the suitable bed height (3. 5 cm) and step bed (3. 5 cm with 2 steps) were necessary in order to well obtain the <b>coalescer</b> performance. The application of step bed <b>coalescer</b> process in reactor has provided the higher treatment efficiencies in term of COD removal than those obtained with classical process. The proposed model for predicting the area under curve and thus treatment efficiency, based on the single collector efficiency (ηT) and the attachment efficiency (α), provides relatively a good coincidence between the experimental and predicted values of treatment efficiencies in this study.

40|$|A solvent was {{developed}} at Oak Ridge National laboratory (ORNL) for a caustic-side solvent extraction (CSSX) process that removes cesium from Savannah River Site (SRS) tank waste. After treatment, {{a small fraction}} of the solvent is entrained in the caustic raffinate at a level of 100 - 300 ppm, well above the solubilities for the various solvent components. Recovery of this solvent can produce a potential cost saving in excess of $ 5 M per annum based on a processing rate of 20 gpm. In this study we examined the issues associated with the use of a <b>coalescer</b> for solvent recovery and measured the physical properties of the solvent and simulant. The density, surface, and interfacial tension, and viscosity of the optimized solvent and a full-component SRS waste simulant were determined as a function of temperature.

The equipments considered {{for the purpose of}} this research are a gravity settler (liquid-liquid) separator, heater-treater system and electrostatic <b>coalescer.</b> Case studies present the effect of crude oil properties and operating conditions on the right decision of equipment selection. The selection is based on mathematical equations that characterize the choices of the separation system through the determination of the required size and expected efficiency. The results of this study showed that the gravity settler is most suitable for dehydration of light density (less than 850 kg/m 3) and low water-cut (less than 40 %) crudes. The heater-treater system is found to be most suitable when dehydration of viscous and high water cut crudes is considered. Furthermore the study concludes that the electrostatic <b>coalescer</b> is most suitably used for dehydration of crude oil with water cut 20 % or less, as expected, because short circuiting occurs above this limit; In the cases where crude water cut is less than 20 %, the electrostatic <b>coalescer</b> showed the highest expected efficiency with the lowest equipment size requirements...|$|R

Following {{the end of}} operations for the first Macrobatch campaign and soon after start of the second Macrobatch campaign, personnel removed the coalescer media and provided to Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) for diagnostic investigation of the causes of reduced flow. This report summarizes those studies. Two Strip Effluent (SE) <b>coalescers</b> were delivered to the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL).

Both <b>coalescers</b> underwent the same general strip acid flush program to reduce the dose and were delivered to SRNL for analysis of potential occluding solids. Analysis of Coalescer Alpha indicates the presence of aluminum hydroxide solids and aluminosilicate solids, while analysis of Coalescer Beta indicates the presence of aluminum hydroxide solids, but no aluminosilicates.

40|$|Seafloor {{pipeline}} transport of viscous crude oil may be problematic {{because of high}} oil viscosity. This problem is compounded when water cut increases and stable emulsions form that have apparent viscosities significantly exceeding the oil itself. Reducing such high viscosity requires better understanding of emulsion properties. This study focuses on the characterization of water-in-oil emulsions by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and their rheological behavior with and without demulsifiers present. Experimental data from NMR experiments show that the emulsion is very stable and needs demulsifier that can enhance the coalescence between droplets and hence aid separation.
