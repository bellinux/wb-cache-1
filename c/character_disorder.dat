5000|$|A half-century later, in {{the wake}} of Kohut's {{innovative}} pronouncement that the age of [...] "normal narcissism" [...] and normal narcissistic entitlement had arrived - the age, that is, of the normative parental provision of narcissistic supply - the concept of its inverse appeared: narcissistic abuse. According to Kohut, maternal misrecognition amounts to a failure to perform the narcissistic selfobject functions of [...] "mirroring"...the cause of a narcissistic disturbance. Paternal misrecognition could produce the same result: Kohut explored for example a son's transference reproaches directed at the non mirroring father who was preoccupied with his own self-enhancement and thus refused to respond to his son's originality. Karen Horney had already independently highlighted the <b>character</b> <b>disorder</b> - particularly the compulsive striving for love and power - resulting from the childhood hurts bred of parental narcissism and abuse.

It asserts that instead, the necessary issue of greater social concern in an era of permissiveness and entitlement is <b>character</b> <b>disorder,</b> which manifests itself not so much in bizarre psychosomatic symptoms, but rather in distorted thinking patterns, problematic attitudes, and irresponsible behaviors, and Simon asserts further that these can neither be adequately understood, nor effectively dealt with, via traditional approaches.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the psychological profile, as measured by the MMPI- 2, of 921 clients assessed after five weeks admission to a Therapeutic Community (TC). Overall, the profile of the sample showed prominent peaks reflecting <b>character</b> <b>disorder</b> (high Pd) and disturbed thinking and affect (high Sc). The validity scales suggested that the sample was admitting to personal and emotional difficulties and requesting assistance with these problems. The psychotic triad was somewhat more elevated than the neurotic triad indicating distress about behaviours or symptoms related to psychotic disorders. Psychopathology was greater for women, who reported significantly higher scores on confusion (F), hypochondriasis (Hs), <b>character</b> <b>disorder</b> (Pd), and hysteria (Hy) than men, although the shape of male and female MMPI- 2 profiles was similar. Those aged up to 35 years scored significantly higher on five clinical scales (depression (D), <b>character</b> <b>disorder</b> (Pd), paranoia (Pa), psychopathic deviate (Pd) and schizophrenia (Sc)) than an older (over 35) group; they also significantly differed on all the validity scales from their older counterparts. Clients who completed the MMPI- 2 at five weeks but stayed less than four months at the TC were more likely to be younger, female and admit to psychopathology (lower K-defensiveness scores, higher mania) than those who went on to complete the first phase of treatment.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 130 - 131) An emotional {{trauma that}} happens to the young child at any age from birth to {{four or five years}} causes Narcissistic injury if other factors in the mother-infant relationship are detrimental to the welfare of the infant. Of the factors which can cause such a Narcissistic injury to the infant, the most significant is the presence of an unhealthy form of the Narcissistic <b>character</b> <b>disorder</b> in the mother. Should such an injury occur, the infant or child becomes fixated at the developmental stage during which the injury occurred. The etiology of Narcissism, then, must be understood within the context of Freudian developmental stages, both because Narcissism can develop during any stage and because the later expression of the child's Narcissism will reflect the stage at which the injury occurred. The Narcissistic character traits range from the healthy and normal to the severely incapacitating and pathological; these traits are referred to in the following fashion in this thesis: Healthy, Neurotic, Phallic, Narcissistic, Narcissistic Character, Narcissistic Investment in Thinking, the Borderline Personality, the Normal Suppliant Personality, Schizophrenic Personality, Pathological Personality, and Paranoid Personality.

40|$|T REQUIRES no {{more than}} a cursory {{consideration}} of “as if ” phe-nomena to open up a multitude of vistas for investigation. Be- I fore introducing this venture by way of a survey of the literature-which I intend to present under a somewhat unconventional plan-I should like to call attention to certain semantic and con-ceptual ambiguities concerning this subject, and perhaps to intro-duce some clarity into them. With regard to the former, the semantic question, this will not afford us much difficulty. When Helene Deutsch (5) first pub-lished her classical paper on the “as if ” personality, she made cer-tain to define the term she was using as having “nothing to do with Vaihinger’s system of ‘fictions ’ and the philosophy of ‘As If ‘ ” (p. 263). It has been used ever since in the psychoanalytic literature in her restricted sense, as applying to certain individuals suffering from a <b>character</b> <b>disorder,</b> which “forces on the observer the in-escapable impression that the individual’s whole relationship to life has something about it which is lacking in genuineness and yet outwardly runs along ‘as if ‘ it were complete ” (p. 263). To elabo-rate further upon the clinical picture presented by such individ-uals, Deutsch observed that they {{did not seem to be}} aware of their defect in feeling; to all outward appearances they had good intelli-gence, displayed well-ordered emotional expressiveness, might even be talented, and often impressed others as establishing in-tense, loving, friendly, and sympathetic relationships. Nevertheless, sooner or later, people acquainted with these “as if ” personalities would become aware of something which intangibly and indefin-ably obtruded itself in their contact with people, and would ask...|$|E
