He states he will be doing his own personal investigation of the break-ins and is later seen questioning the victims. Unser is seen again apologizing for the death of Roosevelt's wife Rita and gets angry at Gemma for only using people when she needs them, and states she has no friends. In [...] "Toad's Wild Ride" [...] Unser is visited by Jax and Bobby. It's revealed he lost his land and is parked on the premises of Unser Trucking in exchange for working security. Unser shows them all the evidence he has collected, and the three conclude the three Nomads recently patched into SAMCRO - Gogo, Greg, and Frankie - are responsible for the break-ins and Rita's death, and Clay most likely put them up to it. Unser visits Gogo and Greg, and notices the long scratches on Gogo's neck. He is later visited by Clay, and the two discuss their relationship and the ties between them, when Gogo and Greg break down the door. Unser shoots Gogo with a double-barreled shotgun, and Clay kills Greg with a shot to the head from his pistol. Unser covers up the killings to hide Clay's involvement and is visited by the police and Gemma, whom he makes amends with. Later, Unser is shown to have been kicked off the premises of Unser Trucking, as [...] "double murder is bad for business", and he resorts to parking his Airstream on Teller Morrow grounds.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The morphology, genesis, and {{classification}} of soils forming in multiple tephra deposits of recent age from Mt. St. Helens volcano in southwestern Washington Cascade Mountains was studied. Soils which occupied well drained and poorly drained {{positions on the}} landscape were characterized according to their morphology {{and the results of}} analyses of particle size, clay mineralogy, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable bases, organic carbon, total nitrogen, extractable iron and aluminum oxides, exchangeable acidity, pH, and bulk density. The results reveal that there are greater differences within the profiles than between soils themselves. The main difference was that the organic carbon contents were higher in the poorly drained soils than in the well drained ones, Cation exchange capacity tended to follow the pattern of organic matter content. Particle size results showed the dominance of sand size particles in these horizons. An interesting bimodal distribution of the sand size fractions is present in all soils examined. In soils dominated by amorphous gels the results obtained for the percent <b>clay</b> <b>separation</b> is of questionable value due to incomplete dispersion. Electron micrographs showed a higher degree of weathering in the buried A horizons of both paleosols. The x-ray diffraction patterns however do not reveal any significant difference between the clay mineralogy of each horizon. All horizons were dominated by amorphous constituents. The vegetation at each site is a better indicator of the internal moisture relations of these soils than are morphological properties. The well drained sites consisted of depauperate understories of Vaccinium membranceum and Xerophyllum tenax. The poorly drained soils typically had a much richer understory which consisted of species such as Vaccinium bValitolium, Menziesia ferruginea, Streptopus roseus, and Tiarella unifoliata to name a few. The {{classification of}} these soils was difficult due to inherited characteristics, buried soils, and the incompleteness of the soil classification system used in the United States on volcanic soils The dry sites were classified as-ashy over ashyskeletal, mixed Andeptic Cryorthents. The wet sites were tentatively classified as ashy over ashy-skeletal, mixed Andaqueptic Cryaquents. :Secondary classifications were also presented where these soils may have better fit the Inceptisol rather than the Entisol soil order. Deficiencies in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1975) occur in classifying these soils and brief discussion is included where these deficiencies occur...|$|R

The aim of this project was to study oxygen-isotope fractionation in iron ferric oxides and clay minerals during regolith weathering in southern Australia. For this study, samples with high iron ferric oxide content were separated from clay-rich samples. Many physical, chemical and technical procedures including physical abrasion on sample exteriors, crushing, high gradient magnetic <b>separation,</b> <b>clay</b> settling analysis, and chemical treatments have been employed to ensure that the iron ferric oxides and associated clays are as pure as possible.

40|$|Sustainable {{rates of}} lipid {{secretion}} were measured on the foreheads of 24 children, ages 6 – 8. The {{method of measurement}} involved absorption of skin surface lipid into bentonite <b>clay</b> and subsequent <b>separation</b> and measurement of the various lipid classes by quantitative thin-layer chromatography. In 9 of the children, sebum secretion appeared to be virtually nonexistent, judging by the low amounts of lipid recovered and the low percentages of wax esters and squalene, which are purely sebaceous lipid classes. An effect of age on sebum secretion rates was observed with median rates of wax ester secretion, being 7, 28 and 48 μg/ 10 cm 2 / 3 h for 6 -, 7 - and 8 -year-olds, respectively. These values are well below those of most young adults. The relation between wax ester secretion rate and skin surface lipid composition on the forehead was investigated and found {{to conform to the}} formula: μg wax esters/ 10 cm 2 / 3 h = 28 x wax esters/(cholesterol + cholesterol esters), with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 94...|$|R
40|$|Potassium {{fixation}} {{and release}} by phillosilicate clay minerals in soils {{are very important}} processes influencing the availability of K to plants. This investigation was conducted to determine the potassium fixation capacity and charge characteristics of soil clays of 15 surface soils (0 - 30 cm) from central and northern Iran. After <b>clay</b> particle <b>separation,</b> both total and tetrahedral cation exchange capacity of soil clays were determined. Tetrahedral CEC was measured after saturation with Li and heating at 300 C to reduce octahedral charge to near zero. Potassium fixation was obtained in both wet (1 : 10 soil:solution, 16 h on a shaker) and dry conditions (after drying for 24 h at 70 °C) using three different levels of added K The total CEC in soil clays of Isfahan, Char-Mahal and Gilan provinces ranged from 22. 1 - 36. 0, 33. 0 - 55. 8 and 31. 3 - 47. 9 cmol kg- 1, respectively. Tetrahedral CEC in soil clays of Isfahan, Char-Mahal and Gilan provinces ranged from 17. 9 - 4504, 26. 2 - 32. 5 and 8. 3 - 23. 8 cmol kg- 1, respectively, which consisted of 81. 0 - 98. 4, 58. 5 - 95. 8 and 24. 7 - 72. 5 % of their total charge, respectively.

Mean potassium fixation by soil clays (except for soil clays of Gilan) best correlated with total CEC. In the soil clays of Isfahan, mean potassium fixation correlated with tetrahedral CEC, whereas no correlation was observed in soil clays from other places.

40|$|The pollen {{preparation}} technique {{consists of}} a sequence of steps that allow {{for the removal of}} organic and inorganic matter from a sample, with the aim of rendering the grains visible under the microscope and enabling easy identification and counting. No special equipment is required, but particular care is needed to avoid contamination of fossil with fresh pollen, and in the use of hazardous chemical products. It is also desirable that all the samples from a stratigraphic sequence be processed using the same procedure in order to avoid different preparation techniques affecting the final results and interpretation of pollen data. Here we describe the standard minimum procedure necessary to extract pollen from archaeological sediments, based on successive treatments with HCl, HF, and NaOH, and a number of modules that can be additionally applied, depending on the composition of the analyzed material. Sieving will be used if the sample composes of a large fraction of sediment coarser than 200 μm or finer than 8 μm. Deflocculation will be applied if the sediment is especially high in <b>clay</b> content. Gravity <b>separation</b> is convenient when samples are poor in pollen and contain very high amounts of mineral fragments. Acetolysis is the last step of the pollen preparation if the samples still contain significant amounts of undissolved organic matter that may affect pollen identification and counting...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} of selenium in the Boom Clay is of major interest. The Boom Clay is investigated as host rock for nuclear waste repositories and radioactive selenium {{is a major}} fission product with very high biological activity. Selenite and selenate (50 μM) were contacted over 2. 5 months with sterile and non-sterile slurries (50 g/l) of Boom Clay from Zeeland, the Netherlands, an its isolated silt and <b>clay</b> fractions. The <b>separation</b> of the Boom Clay material by grain size successfully segregated two main redox active phases, pyrite in the silt fraction and clay minerals in the clay fraction. Both selenite and selenate were quantitatively removed from solution with the whole Boom Clay material showing the fastest removal rates. The whole BC material and the clay fraction showed continuous fast decrease in aqueous selenium concentration. In the clay fraction experiments the Se concentration reached a constant value of 0. 4 μM after two weeks, which most probably corresponded to adsorption equilibrium concentration. In the silt fraction Se was removed from solution following a slower pathway with 3 distinguishable phases of different removal rates. However the behaviour of selenite and selenate was {{not consistent with the}} reported reactivities towards pyrite, the clay minerals or whole BC material. Further Se was removed from solution by the same mechanisms in the sterile and the non-sterile experiments. Thus the sterilization was probably not fully successful and microbial activity played an important role for the removal of selenite and selenate from solution...|$|R
40|$|Nanocomposites {{have been}} widely {{reported}} to enhance performance in polymers, in both mechanical and physical properties. An increasing amount of research has resulted in many nanocomposite polymers being applied to various consumer products from motorcars to golf balls. Yet, at this time, there are no structural applications despite {{a large number of}} reports claiming improved mechanical properties. Carbon nanotubes are renowned for their specific mechanical properties as well as their thermal and electrical properties. Researchers have put a considerable amount of effort in adopting these nano-materials to structurally enhance an epoxy composite matrix. Though considered very promising many issues such as the dispersion and the bonding interface have been identified and there remains still no guaranteed structural improvement. The potential of epoxy/clay nanocomposite processing and application has been explored incorporating a study of composite processing methods and characterisation techniques. The key goals were to reliably achieve full dispersion and exfoliation of nanoclay without inducing air into the composite system. Two mechanical processes were used for comparison; a high shear rotary mixing and a laboratory bead mill. Microscopic observations of the resin before curing shows agglomerated nanoclay visible in the samples which decreases as the shearing time. Comparing the processing methods showed greater dispersion in the bead mill processed samples. TEM and X-ray diffraction were used to measure the exfoliation of the nanoclay. The analysis showed that the nanoclays had become intercalated, with the <b>clay</b> layer <b>separation</b> increasing from 2 - 4 nm. Further testing looked at the mechanical and thermal properties of the nanoclay composites, comparing the nanoclay processing in amine hardener or solvent. The effect of changing the amount of nanoclay present in the epoxy was also recorded. Testing showed that a solvent processing II method gave best results, with a nanoclay loading of 2 wt% processed with a solvent in a bead mill. The performance of CNTs in epoxy composites was also assessed looking at different bonding mechanisms (covalent and Vander Waals) of the carbon nanotube to the resin. The rheological, mechanical and fracture toughness properties were tested in epoxy resin with different nanotube loadings. These properties were explored in a brittle and a flexible resin, achieved by using two amine curing agents. The covalently bonded tubes showed Newtonian rheological properties and the greatest enhancement in tensile compressive and flexural strength and modulus as well as K 1 c fracture toughness. MWNT resins incorporating non-covalent bonds displayed shear thinning rheological behaviour and showed greatest improvement in Charpy impact toughness. Fibre reinforced composites laminates have also been investigated by enhancing a formulated pre-preg material. Compressive properties and interlaminar shear stress were tested in a woven carbon fibre composite and some increased properties have been seen which shows potential for further research.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades the {{scientific}} interest to understand the interactions of organic contaminates with naturally occurring organic material increased. Emphasis was laid on the toxicity, bioavailability and transport of xenobiotics within the environment. Numerous publications have shown that high portions of anthropogenic substances could not be released by conventional extraction procedures from soils. It was assumed, that these non-extractable residues are incorporated in the organic matter or constituents of soils as both, the applied parent compound or a transformation product. Incorporation of the so called "bound residues" depends on several factors such as system characteristics (e. g. soil composition, pH-value), microbial activity and even the performed extraction method. So far, publications had predominantly dealed with extractable and hydrolytically cleavable contaminants. However, for {{the understanding of the}} incorporation behavior, knowledge of the binding mode of non-extractable substances is required. In terms of the performed work, numerous authors revealed organo-clay complexes as one of the major compartments in soil responsible for the formation of non-extractable residues. To enhance the knowledge of the formation of non-extractable (bound) residues and to understand and explain the re-mobilization potential as well as the environmental behavior of low molecular weight, organic contaminates, distinct experiments were performed with 13 C and 14 C-labeled substances. Both applied compounds differed in their biochemical properties and degradation behavior in soil. The first approach showed, that both 353 -Nonylphenol (4 -(3, 5 -dimethylhept- 3 -yl) phenol) and MCPA (4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid) rapidly (48 h) formed non-extractable residues, especially in the <b>clay</b> fraction. A <b>separation</b> of organo-clay complexes in distinct sub-fractions by means of the MIBK method showed, that nonylphenol (NP) was predominantly incorporated into humic acids and MCPA into fulvic acids. In the following experiments, the mode of incorporation of both xenobiotics into organo-clay complexes was investigated in more detail. The performance of a sequential chemical degradation procedure facilitated the selective cleavage of chemical bonds and thus, revealed information on the mode of incorporation and the resulting relevance of non-extractable residues for the environment. Invasive chemical degradation of humic sub-fractions and the identification and quantitation of liberated compounds by GC-MS, revealed only NP as non-extractable substance. Moreover, the preferred mode of incorporation was determined as ester (amide) linkages, whereas ether and C-C-bonds were only of minor importance for the incorporation. During the incubation period, portions of chemically releasable residues decreased, which pointed to ageing processes either of the incorporated compounds, the humic material or the incorporation mode. In case of the MCPA-approach, two different concentrations of MCPA were separately applied to soil samples. The high concentration (1, 000 mg MCPA/kg soil) led to a considerable decrease of the soil microbial activity as compared to the control samples without application and the low level assay (8. 5 mg MCPA/kg soil). With increasing microbial activity, the amount of releasable non-extractable residues decreased, indicating a microbially induced mode of incorporation which could not be traced by the executed degradation methods. Equal to the NP-approach, the highest amount of radioactivity was liberated after cleavage of ester (amide) bonds (alkaline hydrolysis) and only the parent compound, MCPA, was found as non-extractable substance. In summary, we showed that ester (amide) bonds were of significant importance in the formation of non-extractable NP and MCPA residues. However, among the distinct humic sub-fractions, radioactive balancing indicated different modes of incorporation. It could be assumed that both xenobiotics were on the one hand directly linked to functional groups of the humic matter via covalent bonds or on the other hand sequestrated (entrapped) in cavities of the macromolecular structure. In terms of the behavior in the environment, reversible ester (amide) bonds can be cleaved rather easily under natural conditions (e. g. enzymatically catalyzed hydrolysis) resulting in a potential risk to be re-mobilized and thus both the non-extractable parent compound and their transformation products are still of great importance for the environment. Additionally to the results of the NP-approach, incubation experiments under biotic and abiotic conditions revealed a stereoselective separation of both NP-diastereomers when shifting from the extractable to the non-extractable (bound) state. Besides already know stereoselective processes e. g. microbial transformation, this is the first evidence of such a process induced by the formation of non-extractable residues...|$|R
