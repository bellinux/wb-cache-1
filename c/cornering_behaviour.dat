Using {{the method of}} moments to numerically solve such an equation a matrix equation is obtained. The entries of the matrix are given as multidimensional integrals which in general have to be calculated numerically. This paper presents an efficient method to approximate the main Part of these integrals. The free space Green function is expanded in scalar spherical wave functions. The translation properties of these wave functions then imply that the matrix elements can be expressed {{as a series of}} multipole moments. The method is illustrated by an implementation in the static case and the computation of the capacitance of a square plate. Basis functions with the correct edge and <b>corner</b> <b>behaviour</b> are used. The calculations of the multipole moments are done analytically.

40|$|The upper {{free surface}} z = u(x, y) of a static fluid with gravity {{acting in the}} z direction, occupying a volume V, {{satisfies}} the Laplace-Young equation. The fluid wets the vertical boundaries of V so that the usual capillary contact conditions hold. This paper considers wedge-shaped volumes V with corner angle 2 α, that belong to the intermediate corner angle case of π/ 2 - γ < α < π/ 2, where γ is the contact angle and determines explicitly a regular power series expansion for the height u(r, θ) of the fluid near the corner, r = 0, to all orders in r. Miersemann (1988, Pacific J. Math., 134, 99 - 311), shows {{that it is possible}} to have logarithmic terms for a general corner expansion of the Laplace-Young equation, with appropriate boundary conditions. However, we suggest that the usual practical cases do not possess any singular terms near the corner, and we analytically and explicitly produce a non-singular series to any order in r, and propose that near the corner the far-field effects are lost through any 'interior or inner flat' region in exponentially small terms. We give computational solutions for these regular (energy minimizing) cases based on a numerical finite volume method on an unstructured mesh, which fully support our assertions and our analytical series results, including the (minor) influence of the far field on local <b>corner</b> <b>behaviour.</b> © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved...|$|R

Introduction. The notion of pure infiniteness has proved key {{in the theory of}} operator algebras since its conception in the early eighties by J. Cuntz (see [27]).

40|$|Skew bridges with separation/expansion joints {{are one of}} {{the most}} common types of {{existing}} bridges worldwide. Earthquake reconnaissance reports indicate that skew bridges often rotate in the horizontal plane, increasing the chances of unseating at their acute <b>corners.</b> This <b>behaviour</b> is triggered by the oblique, in-deck, contact which leads in coupling of the longitudinal and the transverse response, binding in one of the obtuse corners and subsequently rotation in the horizontal plane, in such a way that the skew angle increases. Despite the recorded evidence from previous earthquakes, and most empirical vulnerability methodologies, which acknowledge skew as a primary vulnerability factor of bridges, the relevant literature lacks a thorough theoretical study and is mostly confined to empirical descriptions of the phenomenon. This study examines both the case of deck-abutment impact, as well as, the impact between adjacent deck segments, of skew bridges. It shows that the coupling, and hence the unseating during an earthquake excitation, after deck-abutment collisions is not a factor of the skew angle alone, but rather of the total geometry in plan plus the contact parameters. Finally, it offers closed-form solutions for all physically feasible post-impact states observed in skew bridges...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of predator-prey pursuit appears complex, making {{the development of}} a framework explaining predator and prey strategies problematic. We develop a model for terrestrial, cursorial predators to examine how animal mass modulates predator and prey trajectories and affects best strategies for both parties. We incorporated the maximum speed-mass relationship with an explanation of why larger animals should have greater turn radii; the forces needed to turn scale linearly with mass whereas the maximum forces an animal can exert scale to a 2 / 3 power law. This clarifies why in a meta-analysis, we found a preponderance of predator/prey mass ratios that minimized the turn radii of predators compared to their prey. It also explained why acceleration data from wild cheetahs pursuing different prey showed different <b>cornering</b> <b>behaviour</b> with prey type. The outcome of predator prey pursuits thus depends critically on mass effects and the ability of animals to time turns precisely. Royal Society (2009 /R 3 JP 090604) and NERC (NE/I 002030 / 1).

40|$|Traditional chassis {{technologies}} {{still play}} an important role in the racing and sports car market. The design of such a specialist vehicle is a matter of finding a compromise between performance, safety and manufacturing costs. Performance mainly means a high torsional stiffness which directly affects the <b>cornering</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the vehicle. Safety issues regard the impact absorbing capability of the structure. On the cost side it should be underlined that racing cars are usually hand-made in very small numbers. The production of low power, low cost racing cars in particular is heavily affected by workmanship costs. The paper aims to present a project currently under development at the University of Brescia with the co-operation of Metra, one of the leading European companies in the field of aluminium alloy extrusion. A single-seater chassis has been designed with the main target of matching reduced manufacturing costs with high safety and structural performance levels. The chassis sidewalls are one-piece, closed section light alloy extrusions which provide bending and torsion stiffness as well as energy absorption properties for either front and side impacts. The two beams directly support the front suspension and engine. A casting and traditional steel tube rollbars connect the beams, together with a few honeycomb panels bonded into rails designed in the section. Purposely designed extrusions also replace traditional castings for components like wheel uprights and clutch bell allowing for relevant scale economy...|$|E

40|$|Technical University of Liberec {{prepares a}} {{functional}} car {{model with a}} four-wheel steering in a reduced scale (1 : 5). For years, reduced scale models have been a valuable tool (especially in the aircraft and ship industry) for analyses of properties and experimenting. Consequently, experiments, which would be otherwise unrealistic, can be made, the system functionality can be verified {{and the impact of}} slight changes and design modifications can be analysed. All of this within {{a relatively short period of}} time and at low costs. The paper presents the application of a reduced scale car model for the 4 WS (Four-Wheel Steering) system development and practical assignment necessary for set up. Also shows the use of individual components for functional implementation of this system. The 4 WS system pursues the target of enhanced overtaking stability, elimination of positional variances towards its vertical axis, lower sensitivity to side wind, neutral <b>cornering</b> <b>behaviour</b> etc., thus higher active safety. On the basis of results of driving tests of the scale model and after evaluation of parameters of steering behaviour and driving stability, the computer simulation model of the vehicle could be refined.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to use numerical optimisation to investigate the on-limit behaviour of an open wheel downforce type race car using the best compromise of modelling accuracy and computational effort. The current state of lap simulation methods are identified, and the GG speed diagram is described. The use of constrained optimisation, which is a form of optimal control, is used to develop the methods described in this thesis. A seven degree of freedom vehicle model validated by other researchers is used for method validation purposes, and is extended, where possible, to make the modelling of vehicle components more physically significant, without adversely affecting the computational time. This research suggests a quasi steady state approach that produces a GG speed diagram and circuit simulation tool that is capable of optimising vehicle parameters and subsystems in addition to the prevailing control vector of steer and throttle response. The use of numerical optimisation to optimise the rear differential hydraulic pressure and the roll stiffness distribution to maximise vehicle performance is demonstrated. The optimisation of the rear differential hydraulic pressure showed a very small improvement in vehicle performance in combined high speed braking and cornering, but highlighted the ability of the differential to affect the <b>cornering</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the vehicle. The optimisation of the roll stiffness distribution research showed that a significant improvement in the lateral acceleration capability of the vehicle could be achieved at all vehicle speeds between 20 and 80 m/s, especially in combined braking and cornering. In addition, a parameter sensitivity study around a realistic Formula One vehicle setup was conducted, looking at the sensitivity of vehicle mass, yaw inertia, tyres, centre of gravity location and engine torque to vehicle performance.

40|$|Large-eddy {{simulations}} {{are conducted}} to uncover physical aspects of sidewall-induced three-dimensionality for a moderately separated oblique shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SWBLI) at M= 2. 7. Simulations are run for three different aspect ratios {{of the interaction}} zone. The swept SWBLI on the sidewalls and the <b>corner</b> flow <b>behaviour</b> are investigated, along with the main oblique SWBLI on the bottom wall. As the aspect ratio decreases to unity, the separation and reattachment points on the central plane are observed to move upstream simultaneously, while the bubble length initially increases and then stabilizes to a length 30 % larger than for the infinite-span quasi-two-dimensional case. A distorted incident shock and a three-dimensional (3 D) bottom-wall separation pattern are observed, with a patch of attached flow between the central and corner separations. The 3 D flow structure {{is found to be}} induced by the swept SWBLI formed on the sidewalls. The location of the termination point of the incident shock near the sidewall is limited by a sweepback effect, allowing the definition of a penetration Mach number Mp that is shown to correlate well with the spanwise extent of the core flow. The structure and strength of the incident shock are modified significantly by the swept SWBLI on the sidewalls, along with a compression wave upstream and a secondary sidewall shock downstream, leading to a highly 3 D pressure field in the main flow above the main SWBLI on the bottom wall. The reflection of the swept SWBLI from the bottom wall leads to a corner compression wave and strong transverse flow close to the bottom wall. A physical model based on the quasi-conical structure of the swept SWBLI on the sidewall is proposed to estimate the 3 D SWBLI pattern on the bottom wall, in which the swept SWBLI features and the aspect ratio of the interaction zone are considered to be the critical factor...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{response of the}} cytoneural junction was studied in the frog labyrinth posterior canal by recording EPSPs in response to sinusoidal rotation at various frequencies (0. 02 - 1 Hz) {{in the presence of}} tetrodotoxin. Peak accelerations ranged from 3 to 63 deg/s 2 but were kept constant (15 deg/s 2) in some units by changing rotation amplítudes and frequencies. EPSP waveform was evaluated from power spectra and EPSP rate was determined by means of a fluctuation analysis procedure devised to study re¬sponses as fast as the changes in EPSP rate during rotation at 1 Hz. At all rotation frequencies the responses were asymmetric, the increase in EPSP rate for excitatory acceleration being 1. 2 - 2. 5 larger than the decrease during the corresponding inhibitory acceleration. Asymmetrical sinusoids well fit all responses. Frequency responses were obtained for each unit in terms of: 1) GAIN (change in EPSP rate vs. acceleration);. 2) PHASE (phase lead vs. angular velocity); 3) ASYMMETRY (ratio between positive and negative responses). At constant acceleration the relation of gain vs. frequency was described by a low-pass filter function (corner frequency range 0. 05 - 0. 14 Hz). This is in agreement with the behaviour predicted by the cupula-endolymph system. When peak accelerations were changed the responses, normalized to peak acceleration, displayed the same <b>behaviour</b> (<b>corner</b> frequency 0. 05 ¬ 0. 19 Hz); phase leads were generally in agreement with the model. Asymmetry in the response did not exhibít any clear-cut frequency dependence. In conclusion, these data indicate that most of the static and dynamic properties usually described for the spike discharge pattern directly derive from the properties of neurotransmitter release at the cytoneural junction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} fluid-structure {{interaction}} of an elastically mounted square cross-section cylinder {{immersed in a}} free stream. The cross-section is mounted such that its sides are at 45 to the free stream direction, in a "diamond" configuration, and its motion is constrained to the transverse direction relative to the flow direction. Apart from the cross-section, this setup {{is the same as}} the majority of single-degree-of-freedom vortex-induced vibration studies of cylinders. Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of this system have been performed. The Reynolds number based on the point-to-point distance of the cross-section has been fixed at Re= 200). Simulations at this Reynolds number allow a direct comparison with previous results from circular cylinders, and therefore focus directly on the impact of the geometry. The sensitivity of the flow, and therefore the motion of the cylinder, to geometrical effects is considered. This is done by rounding the two side corners (those pointing across the flow) at a given radius. For well-rounded <b>corners,</b> the flow <b>behaviour</b> resembles that of a circular cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibration. However, below a critical radius, the dynamics are considerably altered. Highly disordered and irregular wakes and body motions are observed, as well as a synchronized, periodic P+S wake mode (Williamson and Roshko, 1988), which consists of a pair of vortices on one side, and a single vortex on the other side, shed per oscillation cycle, which results in a non-zero mean lift force. A period-doubled version of this P+S wake is also presented. The spatial structure, and the spatio-temporal symmetries of each of these modes is reported. The results show that even though the spatio-temporal symmetry of the flow is unaffected by the geometry when the body is rigidly mounted (the flow always saturating to a Karman vortex street) geometric features such as sharp corners can induce a number of spontaneous symmetry breaking bifurcations when the body is elastically mounted. Which of these various modes is observed is shown to be a function of both the corner radius and the spring stiffness, expressed through the reduced velocity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine ways to overcome Shariah objections to derivatives in Islamic finance, through comparative analysis with conventional law. In Islamic finance, derivatives are still at the stage of infancy, where {{there is a lot of}} resistance from scholars against its usage. This research uncovered that these Shariah objections are very similar to earlier legal objections in conventional finance that attempted to ban or render illegal derivatives because they were considered to be, inter alia, instruments of gambling. Various laws, rules and regulations were enacted in conventional finance which eventually led to the legalisation of derivatives. This research attempts to focus on the laws that were enacted in the UK and US, to overcome or reduce the objections therein, and explore whether these laws can overcome similar objections in Islamic finance. This research followed the qualitative inquiry paradigm where two methods were used to collect data – the historical and the case study methodologies. Under the first stage the historical method was used to review laws in the UK and US from the 17 th century to the 20 th century. From the laws that were reviewed, only relevant provisions that may overcome the objections in Shariah against derivatives were selected, analysed and discussed. The second stage followed the case study methodology. Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who had expertise in Islamic finance and conventional finance and/or law. The participants were asked on the need for derivatives in Islamic finance, the applicability of conventional laws in Islamic finance, and other recommendations on risk management solutions in Islamic finance. The transcribed interviews were analysed and interpreted using the qualitative software tool NVivo version 8. The findings of this research unveiled that the underlying objection in conventional finance against derivative usage was the prohibition of gambling, whereas in Shariah it is gharar. Gambling and gharar are not different types of objections, they are actually related. Analysis of the relationship between gambling and gharar led to the unearthing of the fact that maisir or gambling falls within the definition of gharar; in other words, gambling is a subset of gharar. Thus Islamic finance may learn from the legal history of derivative development in conventional law in relation to objections which relate to excessive speculation and gambling. Further, from the responses of the participants it was gathered that Islamic finance can turn towards conventional finance to use the laws therein as long as it complies with Shariah principles. Results also unveiled that derivative instruments such as futures and options, that have hedging properties, are needed in the Islamic financial industry today. Participants believed that futures and options are more useful than harmful to the economy. However, the participants opined that futures and options as they exist in their present form are not acceptable in Islamic finance. At the same time when the participants were queried whether, if all the objections towards derivatives could be overcome they would be accepted in Islamic finance, the participants answered that this was possible. The laws that have been enacted in conventional finance deal with issues of speculation, gambling and other abuses in the futures and options exchange such as dishonest <b>behaviour,</b> <b>cornering</b> and set-offs. These laws that were enacted in conventional finance may be used in Islamic finance to address similar issues...|$|R
40|$|Good skid {{resistance}} of a pavement surface {{is essential for}} road safety. Loss of {{skid resistance}} can lead to property damage and loss of lives. Ever increasing need of driver safety poses challenges to the highway authorities to evaluate pavement conditions even more precisely under different conditions. Environmental variables like temperature, water, snow etc. can {{have a significant effect}} on the skid resistance apart from the vehicle and pavement related factors. The temperature increase in the tire-pavement contact region results in a complex relationship between the temperature and the friction and constitutes one of the main sources of uncertainty in interpreting the data of continuous field measurements. Likewise, very low friction coefficients can be observed between the tire and pavement surface under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the phenomena have not been adequately quantified yet within the skid resistance evaluation engineering community. The road agencies use correlation factors to estimate frictional characteristics of the road. These correlation factors are based on the experience and field test measurements which have a very limited scope in terms of reliability and transferability. It is the aim of this research is to study the effect of temperature and water on the frictional performance of the asphalt surface, when a pneumatic tire is traversing at given operating conditions. The tire operating temperature is a very important concern to the tire manufacturers, highway agencies and users due to its major influence on the traction performance of a tire. Tire rubber hysteresis is considered to play a major role in countering skidding of a vehicle travelling at high speed. Past studies showed that the contribution from the hysteresis component in comparison to adhesion has a larger influence on the friction measurements. This research aims to develop a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical model in the finite element (FE) framework to determine the progressive temperature development in a pneumatic tire rolling over a simulated asphalt pavement surface mesh and its eventual effect on the hysteretic friction. This research also studies the hysteretic frictional behavior of a test tire under different surrounding temperature conditions. In this methodology, first, the tire is tested under static loading conditions to obtain its overall deformation characteristics and in particular the relation tire load - inflation pressure – foot print. In the second step, rubber material tests are performed to determine the rheological characteristics of the tire tread rubber. The test results are used for the determination of rheological parameters of a tire rubber material in the form of Prony’s coefficients. The Prony’s coefficients are later utilized in the development of a 3 D FE test tire. In the third step, the tire is modelled in the FE framework, accounting for the different components of a tire like tread, side wall, carcass, belts, plies, inner liner, rim etc. The FE simulation results corresponding to the footprint and the deformation are compared with the measurements of static load deflection tests. The FE mesh of a given asphalt pavement surface is developed based on scanned asphalt surface data obtained by a Laser Profilometer and an X-ray tomographer. A dynamic analysis of a tire rolling at a definite slip ratio over a simulated asphalt pavement surface is performed. The results obtained from this analysis are used in the subsequent energy dissipation analysis to determine the heat fluxes. These heat fluxes are the input of a heat transfer analysis to determine the temperature development in the body of a tire. Many past experimental studies showed that the tire-pavement friction values are related to the tire surrounding conditions such as pavement temperature, ambient temperature, contained air temperature and surface characteristic of pavement. Therefore, in this research, the effect of pavement temperature, ambient temperature and contained air temperature on friction measurements is studied. By using the developed FE model, practical test conditions of fully and partially skidding tires traversing over different asphalt pavement surfaces, namely, Porous Asphalt, Ultra-Thin Surface and Stone Mastic Asphalt and AC- 10 are analysed. Emphasis is placed on the determination of tire tread temperature as a critical combination of pavement temperature and ambient temperature. An attempt has also been made to determine the time required for different regions of a rolling tire to reach an effective temperature equilibrated state. Such kind of analysis gives insight into the effect of thermal behaviour of different components of tire on the tire hysteresis which eventually decides its frictional performance. This research also deals with the <b>cornering</b> frictional <b>behaviour</b> of a pneumatic tire. By utilizing the developed FE model, the cornering friction was computed for inflation pressure, wheel load, vehicle speed, side-slip angle, surface texture and mix design. Good pavement macrotexture has a direct influence on the vehicle safety during wet weather conditions by improving its traction/braking ability. Apart from the macrotexture, there are several factors that affect the wet friction, such as, environmental, tire and pavement related characteristics. In recent years, development of powerful finite element tools made it possible to simulate complex wet tire-pavement interaction as close as possible to the actual field conditions. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, none of the past analytical/numerical studies were able to include the asphalt pavement surface texture in their analysis. In the next part of this thesis, the loss of friction under wet/flooded pavement conditions is studied. This research presents an FE approach to study the effect of surface morphology of asphalt pavements on the wet friction coefficient. The wet friction performance of different asphalt surface morphologies of open-graded mix to close-graded mix are studied by using the developed FE model. The tire-wet asphalt surface interaction FE model is duly calibrated with the field investigations conducted by using the state-of-art field equipment. The extreme loss of wet friction which ultimately leads to risk of hydroplaning is also studied. The FE simulations are performed on different water film thicknesses, tread pattern and different tire slip ratios and yaw angles. The results from the current study can be used as safety indicators of in-service asphalt pavements under wet/flooded conditions. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
