5000|$|The <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-off</b> {{permitted}} <b>for</b> {{tax purposes}} may also diverge from so-called [...] "economic depreciation" [...] or [...] "real" [...] depreciation rates. Economic depreciation rates are calculated {{on the basis}} of the observed average market prices that depreciated assets at different ages actually sell for. Sometimes statisticians try to estimate the average [...] "service lives" [...] of fixed assets as a basis <b>for</b> calculating <b>depreciation</b> and scrap values, based on the observed length of time that fixed assets are actually held and used by their owners who own the business.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{depreciation}} schedules {{imposed by}} tax departments {{may differ from}} the actual depreciation of business assets at market rates. Often, governments permit <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-offs</b> higher than true depreciation, to provide an incentive to enterprises for new investment. But {{this is not always}} the case; the tax rate might sometimes be lower than the real market-based rate. Furthermore, businesses might engage in creative accounting and deliberately state their assets and liabilities held at a balance date, or interpret the figures in some other way, {{to increase the amount of}} <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-offs,</b> and thus boost their income (how this is done will depend a lot on tax law).|$|R

50|$|Almost always, {{the capital}} stock {{estimate}} which statisticians arrive at is a theoretical estimate {{based on a}} variety of data sources, and it does not correspond to the historical cost of fixed assets nor to actual <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-offs.</b> However, it is believed to be a more accurate representation of the true value of the fixed capital stock.|$|R
5000|$|The net {{valuation}} method views [...] "depreciation" [...] as the {{compensation for the}} cost of replacing fixed equipment used up or worn out, which must be deducted from the total investment volume to obtain a measure of the [...] "real" [...] value of investments; the <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-off</b> compensates and cancels out the loss in capital value of assets used due to wear & tear, obsolescence, etc.|$|R
2500|$|Normally, true {{gross profit}} {{is larger than}} the profit {{component}} of value-added shown in official statistics, because true profit typically contains net property income, part of corporate officer's earnings and part of the <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-off.</b> The logical possibility exists that although the profit rate can indeed fall, if aggregate profit is measured only as the profit component of value-added, in reality it does not fall, or not as much, because: ...|$|R

The government may give tax incentives, provide guaranteed minimum prices, various economic subsidies etc. The statistical concept of [...] "economic depreciation" [...] (consumption of fixed capital) diverges considerably from actual depreciation – thus, economic depreciation is only an imputation, and is not directly derived from real gross revenue. If the total actual write-off is larger than economic <b>depreciation,</b> <b>for</b> example because of tax incentives for new fixed investment, {{it is likely that}} a component of profit income is being ignored in the statistical measure (there exists no other way to verify what the value of total net output is, than adding together the various components of factor income/expenditure).|$|R
50|$|A {{business}} {{executive who}} invests in or accumulates fixed capital is tying up {{money in a}} fixed asset, hoping to make a future profit. Thus, such an investment usually implies a risk. Sometimes <b>depreciation</b> <b>write-offs</b> are also viewed partly as a compensation for this risk. Often leasing or renting a fixed asset (such as a vehicle) rather than buying it is preferred by enterprises because the cost of using it is lowered thereby, and the real owner {{may be able to}} obtain special tax advantages.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{critically}} analyze {{the relationship that}} professors Dornbusch and Fischer establish among the concepts of GNP, NNP and aggregate income. In principle, aggregate income is NNP; indeed, {{the whole point of}} introducing the concept of NNP is to determine what is the income of the economy in the aggregate. The definition of NNP excludes depreciation from aggregate income. But depreciation must be made good, and it must be so out of current production. On the ground that the factors that produce the goods that make up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> must be paid, Dornbusch and Fischer conclude that the value of the portion of current output that makes up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> becomes income in the aggregate. Since it is indubitable that the value of the other portion of output (that which consists of the goods not required to make up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation)</b> becomes income too, then it follows that aggregate income is GNP, not NNP. Then, Dornbusch and Fischer hold contradictory views. The cause, which I attempt at diagnosing in this paper, is a miscomprehension of the nature of capitalistic production. national accounting, accounting identities, capital accounting, national income accounting...|$|R
