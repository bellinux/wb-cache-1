5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} <b>capitulum.</b> When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and <b>capitulum</b> fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E
5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks {{by a combination of}} a projecting <b>capitulum</b> at the front and a soft, leathery skin. Other distinguish characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry them away to their burrows {{to feed on}} the egg's <b>capitulum,</b> while leaving {{the rest of the}} egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The Ixodidae {{contains}} over 700 {{species of}} hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contains about 200 species; the genera accepted as of 2010 are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, Ornithodoros and Otobius. They have no scutum, and the <b>capitulum</b> (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The family Nuttalliellidae contains {{only a single}} species, Nuttalliella namaqua, a tick found in southern Africa from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the <b>capitulum</b> of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
25|$|The {{mouthparts}} {{section of}} the tick {{is known as the}} <b>capitulum</b> (Latin: 'little head'). The <b>capitulum</b> is not really a true 'head' {{in the sense that the}} structures one normally associates with the head (primitive brain, salivary glands) are not contained within it - these structures are located in the 'body' of the tick. Incidentally, Ixodes holocyclus has no eyes.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: <b>Capitulum</b> with slender palpi, hypostome rounded apically, {{dentition}} 2/2; scutum {{about as}} long as wide, with faint lateral carinae; all coxae with small, external spurs.|$|E
25|$|The female does engorge. The shield (scutum) covers {{only the}} front {{part of the}} dorsal body. The {{mouthparts}} section (the <b>capitulum)</b> is very long because it is required for feeding.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: <b>Capitulum</b> as in female, hypostome {{dentition}} mainly 2/2, 3/3 distally; scutum {{about as}} long as wide with lateral carinae; sternal plate present, oval; anal grooves converging posteriorly but remaining narrowly open; legs as in female.|$|E
25|$|The Hour of Compline, {{such as it}} {{appeared}} in the Roman Breviary prior to the Second Vatican Council, may be divided into several parts, viz. the beginning or introduction, the psalmody, with its usual accompaniment of antiphons, the hymn, the <b>capitulum,</b> the response, the evangelical canticle, the prayer, and the benediction.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all members}} of the Asteraceae family, Senecio squalidus has a {{composite}} flower head known as a <b>capitulum.</b> What look like single flowers are actually a cluster of florets, each petal or ligule being a flower, or floret, possessing its own stamen and capable of producing the specialized seed of the family Asteraceae, the parachute-like achene.|$|E
25|$|Haemaphysalis leporispalustris is {{extremely}} {{similar to the}} 155 other members of its genus. It lacks eyes and has palpi that are wider than they are long. The scutum lacks ornamentation on both males and females. The basis of its <b>capitulum</b> is of rectangular shape, rather than a hexagonal shape. The adult rabbit tick is approximately 1 millimeter in length and contains festoons or wrinkles {{at the base of}} its body.|$|E
25|$|St. Aurelian {{follows the}} same {{tradition}} in his Rule Ad virgines, but he imposes twelve psalms at each {{hour on the}} monks. St. Columbanus, St. Fructuosus, and St. Isidore adopt the system of three psalms. Like St. Benedict, most of these authors include hymns, the <b>capitulum</b> or short lesson, a versicle, and an oratio. In the 9th and 10th centuries we find some additions made to the Office of Nones, in particular litanies, collects, etc.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: A {{very large}} tick when fully engorged; scutum {{about as long}} as broad and {{broadest}} a little posterior to mid length, with strong lateral carinae; <b>capitulum</b> relatively long porose areas deep, cornua usually absent, but when present at most only mild and rounded; auriculae present; hypostome lanceolate, dentition mainly 3/3; no sternal plate; anal grooves meeting at a point behind; all coxae with an external spur decreasing in size posteriorly; trochanters III and IV usually with small, pointed ventral spurs.|$|E
25|$|Only the capitula, tubercula, {{and part}} of the {{anterior}} and posterior processes of the cervical ribs are preserved. The ribs are fused to their respective vertebrae. The cervical ribs are pendant, extending ventrally for a distance subequal to the height of the centrum, as in several other East Asian Cretaceous sauropods. In both cervical vertebrae, the tuberculum is notably slender anteroposteriorly, especially in comparison with the <b>capitulum.</b> The cervical ribs are currently broken, but the original description notes that at least some originally exceeded centrum length.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{peat moss}} plants {{consist of a}} main stem, with tightly {{arranged}} clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting {{of two or three}} spreading branches and two to four hanging branches. The top of the plant, or <b>capitulum,</b> has compact clusters of young branches. Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes, named stem leaves; the shape varies according to species. The leaves consist of two kinds of cells; small, green, living cells (chlorophyllose cells), and large, clear, structural, dead cells (hyaline cells). The latter have the large water-holding capacity.|$|E
25|$|The male {{does not}} engorge. The shield (scutum) covers the entire dorsal body. It has a {{tortoiseshell}} pattern. The mouthparts section (the <b>capitulum)</b> is very short {{because it is}} not required for feeding from the host (though it may be used to feed from the female tick). The male tick does not pose a medical risk to humans or animals - the significance of finding a male is that it is looking for a female - so humans and animals should be checked fully for the possible presence of an adult female tick somewhere.|$|E
25|$|Mites are arachnids and, as such, {{evolved from}} a {{segmented}} body with the segments organised into two tagmata: a prosoma (cephalothorax) and an opisthosoma (abdomen). However, only the faintest traces of primary segmentation remain in mites; the prosoma and opisthosoma are fused, and a region of flexible cuticle (the cirumcapitular furrow) separates the chelicerae and pedipalps {{from the rest of}} the body. This anterior body region is called the <b>capitulum</b> or gnathosoma and, according to some works, is also found in Ricinulei. The remainder of the body is called the idiosoma and is unique to mites.|$|E
25|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae had well-developed cervical ribs, {{fused to}} the vertebral body. The ribs were elongated, with a forward-pointing process on the <b>capitulum,</b> the main rib head. The neural spines {{of the rear}} cervicals and front dorsals are transversely expanded at their upper ends due to rugosities serving as an attachment for tendons. This expanded sector projects to the front also, creating a notch on the lower front edge. Additionally the neural spine base is transversely constricted. Ridges extend to the rear {{from the sides of}} the neural spine base, over the upper sides of the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses. These postzygapophyses themselves project far beyond the rear facet of the vertebral body, a derived trait. The prezygapophyses to the contrary, are much shorter; they have a notch at the front upper edge.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Liturgy {{the office}} of Nones is {{likewise}} constructed after {{the model of the}} Little Hours of the day; it is composed of the same elements as in the Rule of St. Benedict, with this difference: that instead of the three psalms (125-127), the three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118 are always recited. There is nothing else characteristic of this office in this liturgy. The hymn, which was added later, is the one already in use in the Benedictine Office—Rerum Deus tenax vigor. In the monastic rules prior to the 10th century certain variations are found. Thus in the Rule of Lerins, as in that of St. Caesarius, six psalms are recited at Nones, as at Terce and Sext, with antiphon, hymn and <b>capitulum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historic {{records from}} 1210 {{describe}} {{the region as}} a part of Požega County and the medieval Kingdom of Croatia, with Požega as the county seat, a fortress (1227) and a royal estate belonging to queens of Hungary. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Franciscans and Dominicans established abbeys in Požega. Cistercians established an abbey in Kutjevo and initiated the region's winegrowing and winemaking traditions. The Cistercian wine cellar in Kutjevo has continuously supported winemaking since it was completed in 1232, making it the oldest continuously-operated winery in Croatia. In the early 13th century, the <b>capitulum</b> of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pécs was established in Kaptol, containing a public archive of the region. The archive operated until 1536, when it was evacuated to Hungary ahead of the Ottoman army. The archive was returned to the Croatian State Archives in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the faintest}} traces of primary {{segmentation}} remain in mites, the prosoma and opisthosoma being insensibly fused, and {{a region of}} flexible cuticle (the cirumcapitular furrow) separates the chelicerae and pedipalps {{from the rest of}} the body. This anterior body region is called the gnathosoma (or <b>capitulum)</b> and is also found in the Ricinulei. The remainder of the body is called the idiosoma and is unique to mites. Most adult mites have four pairs of legs, like other arachnids, but some have fewer. For example, gall mites like Phyllocoptes variabilis (superfamily Eriophyioidea) have a wormlike body with only two pairs of legs; some parasitic mites have only one or three pairs of legs in the adult stage. Larval and prelarval stages have a maximum of three pairs of legs; adult mites with only three pairs of legs may be called 'larviform'.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} members of the {{composite}} family, the actual flowers appear in two different froms: as ray florets, which have strap-like appendages that look like petals and project around the outside of the <b>capitulum,</b> and as disc florets, which appear {{at the center of the}} flower head and are very small. The ray florets number between 5 and 10, though as many as 12 may be present. Their straps are white and measure 6 to 12mm long by 1.5 to 2.2mm wide. The disc florets number from 12 to 19 and up to 25 and have yellow corollas (i.e. petals, though they are fused into a tube) that are 4.1 to 4.8 and exceptionally 5.5mm long. Their corollas are abruptly ampliate, or enlarged, with tubes that are longer than their campanulate throats. The tubes measure 2.3 to 2.6mm while the throats are typically only 0.9 to 1.2mm long. The lobes, i.e. the friges of the throat, are reflexed and lanceolate in shape, measuring 0.7 to 1.4mm.|$|E
500|$|Ticks, like mites, are {{arthropods}} {{that have}} lost the segmentation of the abdomen that their ancestors had, and there has subsequently been a fusion of the abdomen with the cephalothorax. The tagmata typical of other Chelicera {{have been replaced by}} two new body sections, the anterior <b>capitulum</b> (or gnathosoma), which is retractable and contains the [...] mouthparts, and the posterior idiosoma which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The <b>capitulum</b> is a feeding structure with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood; it is only the front of the head and contains neither the brain nor the eyes. The ventral side of the idiosoma bears sclerites, and the gonopore is located between the fourth pair of legs. In the absence of segmentation, the positioning of the eyes, limbs and gonopore on the idiosoma provide the only locational guidance.|$|E
500|$|In nymphs {{and adults}} {{of the family}} Ixodidae, the [...] is {{prominent}} and projects forwards from the body, a feature not present in the Argasidae. The eyes {{are close to the}} sides of the scutum, and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard, protective scutellum, characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the <b>capitulum</b> in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.|$|E

2500|$|Terce, Sext and None have an {{identical}} structure, each with three psalms or portions of psalms. These {{are followed by}} a short reading from Scripture, once {{referred to as a}} “little chapter” (<b>capitulum),</b> and by a versicle and response. The Lesser Litany (Kyrie and the Lord’s Prayer) of Pius X’s arrangement have now been omitted. Current Roman Catholic practice refers to Terce as [...] "Mid-morning Prayer".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} century the Rule of St. Benedict gives the {{detailed}} composition of this Office.

2500|$|Some {{barnacles}} {{are considered}} edible by humans, including Japanese goose barnacles (e.g. <b>Capitulum</b> mitella), and goose barnacles (e.g. Pollicipes pollicipes), a delicacy in Spain and Portugal. The resemblance of this barnacle's fleshy stalk to a goose's neck gave rise {{in ancient times}} {{to the notion that}} geese, or at least certain seagoing species of wild geese, literally grew from the barnacle. Indeed, the word [...] "barnacle" [...] originally referred to a species of goose, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis, whose eggs and young were rarely seen by humans because it breeds in the remote Arctic.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} century the Office of Vespers in the Latin Church was almost {{the same as it}} has been {{throughout}} the Middle Ages and up to the present day. In a document of unquestionable authority of that period the Office is described as follows: The evening hour, or vespertina synaxis, is composed of four psalms, a <b>capitulum,</b> a response, a hymn, a versicle, a canticle from the Gospel, litany (Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison), Pater with the ordinary finale, oratio, or prayer, and dismissal (Regula Sancti Benedicti, xvii). The psalms recited are taken from the series of psalms from Pss. 109 to 147 (with the exception of the groups 117 to 127 and 133 to 142); Pss. 138, 143, 144 are each divided into two portions, whilst the Pss. 115 and 116 are united to form one. This disposition is almost {{the same as that of}} the [...] "Ordo Romanus", except that the number of psalms recited is five instead of four. They are taken, however, from the series 109 to 147. Here, too, we find the <b>capitulum,</b> versicle, and canticle of the [...] "Magnificat". The hymn is a more recent introduction in the Roman Vespers; the finale (litanies, Pater, versicles, prayers) seems all to have existed from this epoch as in the Benedictine cursus. Like the other hours, therefore, Vespers is divided into two parts; the psalmody, or singing of the psalms, forming the first part, and the <b>capitulum</b> and formulæ the second. Vesper time varied according to the season between the tenth hour (4 p.m.) and the twelfth (6 p.m.). As a matter of fact it was no longer the evening hour, but the sunset hour, so that it was celebrated before the day had departed and consequently before there was any necessity for artificial light (Regula S. Benedicti, xli). This is a point to be noted, as it was an innovation. Before this epoch this evening synaxis was celebrated with all the torches alight. The reason of this is that St Benedict introduced in the cursus, another hour—that of Compline—which was prescribed to be celebrated in the evening, and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the Office of Lucernarium.|$|E
2500|$|The capitula, or flower heads, are {{arranged}} in relatively flat-topped corymbiform arrays. The capitula number anywhere from 4 to 50 and up to 100 or more in exceptional cases. The peduncles, i.e. the flower stalks, are up to [...] in length and are densely covered with non-glandular hairs. Bracts, modified leaves that appear at the axil of a peduncle, are typically absent, though in some cases up to two are present. The involucres, which are the whorls of small, scale-like modified leaves that appear {{at the base of}} the <b>capitulum,</b> are in between cylindric and campanulate (i.e. bell-shaped) in shape and measure [...] long, making them much shorter than the pappi.|$|E
2500|$|Already {{in medieval}} Latin palaeography, {{the sign that}} in Spanish {{came to be called}} virgulilla (meaning [...] "little comma") was used over a vowel to {{indicate}} a following nasal consonant (n or m) that had been omitted, as in tãtus for tantus or quã for quam. This usage was passed on to other languages using the Latin alphabet although it was subsequently dropped by most. Spanish retained it, however, in some specific cases, particularly to indicate the palatal nasal, the sound that is now spelt as ñ. The word tilde comes from Spanish, derived by metathesis of the word título as tidlo, this originally from Latin TITULUS [...] "title" [...] or [...] "heading"; compare cabildo with Latin <b>CAPITULUM.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Practices {{varied from}} monastery to monastery. At first some {{tried to do}} the entire Psalter (150 Psalms) each day, but {{eventually}} that was abandoned for a weekly cycle built around certain hours of the day. In the Rule of St. Benedict the four Little Hours of the day (Prime, Terce, Sext and Nones) were conceived on the same plan, the formulae alone varying. The Divine Office began with the Invitatory, like all the Canonical Hours; then follows a hymn, special to Nones; three psalms, which do not change (Psalm 125, 126, 127), except on Sundays and Mondays when they are replaced by three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118; then the <b>capitulum,</b> a versicle, the Kyrie, the Lord's Prayer, the oratio, and the concluding prayers.|$|E
