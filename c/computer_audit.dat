In this study, we apply, test, and compare two EWMA techniques to detect anomalous changes in event intensity for intrusion detection: EWMA for autocorrelated data and EWMA for uncorrelated data. Different parameter settings and their effects on performance of these EWMA techniques are also investigated to provide guidelines for practical use of these techniques.

First the paper identifies {{the environment in which}} the course operated, the resources available to it and the objectives to be achieved. Particular recognition is given to the pervasive effects of diverse and complex Information Technology on auditing. Next, the teaching components consisting of topics, mode of instruction and grading are outlined. General Systems Theory (GST) provided the hallmarks for identifying the range of topics for the course. As part of its evaluation, the course was compared with advanced IS auditing courses at other universities, both in Australia and Northern America. Students in Australian courses appear to have spent more time on cases and problems and in computer laboratories and less time on the <b>computer</b> <b>audit</b> process than students in the USA/Canada.

However, multivariate control charts based on conventional statistical distance measures, {{such as the one}} used in the Hotelling’s T 2 control chart, cannot scale up to large amounts of complex process data, e. g. data with a large number of variables and a high rate of data sampling. In our previous work we developed a multivariate statistical process monitoring procedure based on a more scalable chi-square distance measure and tested this procedure for detecting out-of control anomalies—intrusions—in a computer process using <b>computer</b> <b>audit</b> data. The testing results demonstrated the comparable performance of the scalable chi-square procedure to that of Hotelling’s T 2 control chart.

30|$|Our study adds {{reliability}} to {{the findings}} of earlier studies [11 – 15] and the generally held view of many surgeons and anaesthetist that operating theatres are less efficient than they could be. Moreover, we have shown that these inefficiencies are costly and represent a waste of resources that could be better spent on reducing waiting lists and improving opportunities for staff training. In particular, we have highlighted a key problem area, the arrival of the first patient to theatres which resulted in 93 % (N[*]=[*] 43) of the morning lists analysed (N[*]=[*] 46) starting late. This translated to a mean wait by the surgical team after the agreed start time of 22  min at an average cost of £ 88 per list. These findings are not isolated to gynaecology theatres, Ricketts et al. in a review of 151 elective orthopaedic lists found late starts in 94 % of lists and an average start delay in morning lists of 24  min [13]. While Narain et al. in a <b>computer</b> <b>audit</b> of the use of theatre time reported 97 % late starts in general surgery [15]. Both of these studies were carried out in the early 1990 s, showing clearly the problem of late starts is a persistent one.|$|E
40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} is used {{to monitor}} and capture intrusions into computer and network systems, which attempt to compromise the security of computer and network systems. To protect information systems from intrusions and thus assure the reliability and quality of service of information systems, it is highly desirable to develop techniques that detect intrusions into information systems. Many intrusions manifest in {{dramatic changes in the}} intensity of events occurring in information systems. Because of the ability of exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts to monitor the rate of occurrences of events based on the their intensity, we apply three EWMA statistics to detect anomalous changes in the events intensity for intrusion detections. They include the EWMA chart for autocorrelated data, the EWMA chart for uncorrelated data and the EWMA chart for monitoring the process standard deviation. The objectives of this paper are to provide design procedures for realizing these control charts and investigate their performance using different parameter settings based on one large dataset. The early detection capability of these EWMA techniques is also examined to provide the guidance about the design capacity of information systems. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Abstract—Intrusions into {{computer}} systems have caused many quality/reliability problems. Detecting intrusions {{is an important}} part of assuring the quality/reliability of {{computer systems}} by quickly detecting intrusions and associated quality/reliability problems in order to take corrective actions. In this paper, we present and compare two methods of forecasting normal activities in computer systems for intrusion detection. One forecasting method uses the average of long-term normal activities as the forecast. Another forecasting method uses the EWMA (exponen-tially weighted moving average) one-step-ahead forecast. We use a Markov chain model to learn and predict normal activities used in the EWMA forecasting method. A forecast of normal activities is used to detect a large deviation of the observed activities from the forecast as a possible intrusion into computer systems. A Chi square distance metric is used to measure the deviation of the observed activities from the forecast of normal activities. The two forecasting methods are tested on <b>computer</b> <b>audit</b> data of normal and intrusive activities for intrusion detection. The results indicate that the Chi square distance measure with the EWMA forecasting provides better performance in intrusion detection than that with the average-based forecasting method.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Low pelvic anastomoses are {{associated}} with a high leak rate. Therefore, defunctioning loop ileostomies are being increasingly fashioned to protect against the consequences of a leak. However, the reported complication rates of such stoma creation and closure is between 5. 7 - 69 %. AIMS: To determine the outcome associated with construction and side-to-side closure of loop ileostomies in one specialist unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from a <b>computer</b> <b>audit</b> and case note analysis. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 1998, 71 patients (41 M, 30 F) with a median age of 51 years (range 19 - 88 years) had a loop ileostomy constructed for: (i) 26 ileoanal pouches; (ii) 36 left colonic and rectal resections; and (iii) 9 for other reasons. Side-to-side stoma closure was achieved using a GIA linear stapler through a parastomal incision. The median hospital stay following stoma creation was 12 days (range 7 - 63 days) and stoma closure was 7 days (range 6 - 16 days). The median time to closure was 140 days (range 10 - 790 days). There were no ileostomy-related deaths. There were 10 (13. 8 %) ileostomy-related complications, 4 following creation and 6 following closure. CONCLUSIONS: Loop ileostomy is easy to create and close and is associated with a low morbidity. Therefore, we recommend a defunctioning ileostomy as a procedure of choice for temporary faecal diversion for complex colorectal surgery...|$|E

Theoretical constructs of interest included: 1) IS problem-solving support, 2) task domain knowledge, and 3) decision-making behavior. It was theorized that task domain knowledge influences the type of IS most functionally appropriate for usage by that individual. IS task presentation served as the treatment variable. Task domain knowledge was investigated as a moderating factor of task accomplishment Task accomplishment, the dependent variable, was defined as search control strategy and quality of task performance. A subject's task domain knowledge was assessed over seven theoretical domains. Subjects were assigned to higher or lower task domain knowledge groups based on performance on professional competency examination questions. Research hypothesis one investigated the effects of task domain knowledge on task accomplishment behavior. Several task domain knowledge bases were found to influence both search control strategy and task performance. Task presentation ordering effects, hypothesis two, were not found to significantly influence search control strategy or task performance. The third hypothesis investigated interaction effects of a subject's task domain knowledge and task presentation ordering treatments on task accomplishment behavior. An interaction effect was found to influence the subject's search control strategy. The computer-specific knowledge base and task presentation ordering treatments were found to interact as joint moderators of search control strategy. Task performance was {{not found to be}} significantly influenced by interaction effects. Users' task accomplishment was modeled based upon problem-solving behavior. A subject's level of task domain knowledge was found to serve as a moderating factor of IS usage.

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Business Information Systems) [...] Tshwane University of Technology 2011. Information systems {{are defined as}} a group of {{interconnected}} components (people, organisation and technology) that function together to extract, regain, route, accumulate and distribute information, with the aim of business decision making and operational activities in an organisation and other business. As a result, nformation systems are being deployed by organisation to help assure that their daily activities are completed seamlessly. Thus, organisational stakeholders invest a vast amount of money in the deployment of these systems. Furthermore, volumes of organisational data stored within these systems increases on regular basis. As the volume of data and the complexity of information systems increase, business managers expect information systems auditors to become even more relevant and rigorous as these auditors have to ensure that possible risks that these nformation systems may inherent are mitigated. International Auditing standards and best practices emphasise the use of <b>Computer</b> Aided <b>Audit</b> Techniques by IS auditors, within their audit engagements. However, the level of compliance to these international auditing standards and best practices by the South African information systems auditors is still questionable. An empirical study conducted by Vasile-Daniel (2010) indicated that even if technology is accepted, few (if not all) of nformation systems auditors still deploy traditional audit methods within their audit engagements. Currently, auditors were observed to use <b>Computer</b> Aided <b>Audit</b> Techniques only to select random test samples but not necessarily to <b>audit</b> entirely using <b>Computer</b> Aided <b>Audit</b> Techniques. That is, they often revert to executing their audit engagements following the traditional methods. To the preceding point, the present study sought to explore factors that could be influencing the nformation systems auditors not to utilize <b>Computer</b> Aided <b>Audit</b> Techniques fully.
