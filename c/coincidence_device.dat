40|$|Abstract—The second-order {{statistical}} {{properties of}} point processes (PPs) are {{described by the}} coincidence function which can be measured by a <b>coincidence</b> <b>device,</b> but such measurements are long and complicated. We propose another method of measurement, and we analyze its performances. The starting {{point is that the}} coincidence function can be deduced from the probability density functions of the life times (the distances between points) of the process. The idea is to transform the PP into a positive signal whose values are these distances. From an appropriate processing of this signal, we deduce the coincidence function. For the validation of the method, we use PPs for which the coincidence function is known. The agreement between theory and experiment is, in general, excellent. Finally, the method is applied to measure the coincidence functions of some PPs for which no theoretical result is available. Index Terms—Point processes (PPs), signal processing, signal representation, statistical measurements. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{measures}} the sample to sample {{variation in the}} light yield non-proportionality of NaI:Tl, and so explores whether this is an invariant characteristic of the material {{or whether it is}} dependent on the chemical and physical properties of tested sample. In this work we report on the electron response of nine crystals of NaI(Tl), differing in shape, volume, age, manufacturer and quality. The non-proportionality has been measured at the SLYNCI facility in the energy range between 3. 5 to 460 keV. The Scintillation Light Yield Non-proportionality Characterization Instrument (SLYNCI) is a next generation Compton <b>Coincidence</b> <b>device,</b> explicitly designed to study the 'non-proportionality' of the electron response in scintillators and the contribution of this effect to the intrinsic energy resolution. We also discuss the gamma response, x-ray excited emission spectra and decay times for the nine crystals, in order to provide a complete characterization of their physical properties and determine whether the mechanism of scintillation varies between samples...|$|E
40|$|A close {{relationship}} {{exists between the}} advances of cosmic-ray physics and technical developments. Thus the development of highly sensitive ionization chambers, eventually to become self-recording instruments, was an essential prerequisite of the observations which first suggested, then proved the extraterrestrial origin of the radiation. The invention of the Geiger- Müller counter and of the associated <b>coincidence</b> <b>devices</b> {{opened the door to}} the investigation of the physical properties of the local radiation. Also "c. r. telescopes," made of G. M. counters, discovered the E-W effect, showing that primary c. r. are positively charged particles. The development of cloud-chambers suitable for c. r. observations, and the development of nuclear emulsions were responsible for the discovery of "new" elementary particles in the local radiation (the positive electron, the µ-meson, the π-meson, the "strange" particles). New techniques involving the use of very large detector arrays produced important advances in the study of air showers showing that the primary spectrum extends beyond 1020 e. v. Finally, the availability of space vehicles, coupled with the development of new suitable detectors made it possible to determine the chemical and isotopic composition of the incident radiation...|$|R

Various pedagogical methodologies {{to be used with}} mobile technology will be discussed. Additionally, an overview of context-aware strategies to be used in <b>coincidence</b> with mobile <b>devices</b> will be provided. To capitulate this elaborate overview, an idea will be put forth that for mLearning to be effective, it must be integrated within the entire system in a context-aware manner.

40|$|A {{new data}} {{acquisition}} system, ToF-DAQ, {{has been developed}} for a ToF-ERDA telescope and other ToF-E and ToF-ToF measurement systems. ToF-DAQ combines an analogue electronics front-end to asynchronous time stamped data acquisition {{by means of a}} FPGA <b>device.</b> <b>Coincidences</b> are sought solely in software based on the timestamps. Timestamping offers more options for data analysis as coincidence events can be built also in offline analysis. The system utilises a National Instruments R-series FPGA device and a Windows PC as a host computer. Both the FPGA code and the host software were developed using the National Instruments LabVIEW graphical programming environment. Up to eight NIM ADCs can be handled by a single FPGA. The host computer and the FPGA can process total continuous count rates of over 750000 counts/s with a timestamping resolution of 8. 33 ns...|$|R
40|$|The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research of Taiwan has {{developed}} a dynamic <b>coincidence</b> detection <b>device</b> for positron emitted radiotracer pharmacodynamic study in small mice models. In this study, we set up an experimental paradigm by determining [fluorine- 18]- 2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-D-glucose ([18 F]FDG) dynamic uptake in tumors and inflammations in nude mice {{as the foundation for}} future applications in therapy development. Histopathology and micro-autoradiography of these tumors and inflammations were obtained for confirmation. Dynamic coincidence planar images of six tumors and two inflammations in nude mice were acquired over 4 hours immediately after injection of 25. 9 MBq of [18 F]FDG into the right thigh of each animal. After image reconstruction, the lesion-to-background ratios were calculated in regions of interest over the lesion and contralateral thigh to determine the equilibrium status of the radiotracer. All mice were sacrificed for histopathologic examination and six of the mice were examined with micro-autoradiography. [18 F]FDG uptake in tumors and inflammations both reached equilibrium about 3 hours after injection. At equilibrium, [18 F]FDG uptake into tumors was two to four times higher than the background. Uptake into the 4 -day and 8 -day inflammations was 2. 3 and 5. 5 times higher than the background, respectively. Histopathology showed macrophage and neutrophil infiltration around the tumors and in the inflammations. Micro-autoradiography showed dense silver grains in the granulation tissue surrounding the tumors and inflammations. The preliminary results suggested that dynamic [18 F]FDG coincidence planar imaging can help in determining the suitable time for static [18 F]FDG imaging in nude mice models. The optimal time for static [18 F]FDG positron emission tomography imaging was around 3 hours after injection. The paradigm for determining a dynamic [18 F]FDG uptake pattern was demonstrated for future new therapeutic drug experimental use...|$|R
40|$|Verifying the {{authenticity}} or otherwise of printed documents {{is one of}} the most important aspects of questioned document examination and plays a vital role in the field of forensic science. In recent years, continued developments in the quality of impression combined with ever-cheaper toner printers have allowed this technology to spread. It is now used in an increasing number of homes for all types of documents, including for criminal aims. Here, the factors that influence the printed features in text files are studied in relation to the operating system and the word processing software. The Net Application report in October 2014 showed that the market shares of Windows 7 and Windows XP were 53. 05 % and 17. 18 %, respectively. The Forrester report in October 2013 showed that the market share of Microsoft Office was more than 85 %, the top three word processors being Microsoft Word 2003, 2007, and 2010. In this study, Windows XP (shortened to XP), Windows 7 (shortened to Win 7), Microsoft Word 2003 / 2007 / 2010, WPS Office 2013, and the PDF format are chosen as the most common operating systems and word processing software. WPS Office was developed by the Chinese company Kingsoft Co., Ltd. and is widely used in China. A particular text file was designed and edited and was printed on a laser printer. The features of the printed characters were captured using an Anyty 3 R digital microscope, Printer Expert, and X-printer <b>devices.</b> <b>Coincidence</b> comparison and outline feature extraction were used to evaluate the differences. It is shown that XP and Win 7 have no effect on the printed features of text files. However, the printed features do depend to a certain extent on the word-processing software, with the PDF format having the greatest influence...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear shell {{effects in}} neutron-rich nuclei around N= 20 and N= 32, 34 were studied {{by means of}} reduced {{transition}} probabilities, i. e. B(E 2) and B(M 1) values. To this end a series of Coulomb-excitation experiments, employing radioactive 31 Mg and 29, 30 Na beams, {{as well as a}} precise lifetime experiment of excited states in 56 Cr were performed. The collective properties of excited states of 31 Mg were the subject of a Coulomb-excitation experiment at REX-ISOLDE, CERN, employing a radioactive 31 Mg beam at a beam energy of 3. 0 MeV/u. The beam intensity amounted to 3000 ions/s on average. The highly efficient MINIBALL setup was employed, consisting of eight HPGe cluster detectors for gamma-ray detection and a segmented Si-detector for coincident particle detection. The level scheme of 31 Mg was extended. Spin and parity assignment of the observed 945 keV state yielded 5 / 2 + and its de-excitation is dominated by a strong collective M 1 transition. Comparison of the transition probabilities of 30, 31, 32 Mg establishes that for the N= 19 magnesium isotope not only the ground state but also excited states are largely dominated by a deformed pf intruder configuration. This implies that 31 Mg is part of the so-called "island of inversion". Coulomb-excitation experiments of radioactive 29, 30 Na were carried out at REX-ISOLDE, CERN, at a final beam energy of 2. 85 MeV/u. De-excitation gamma rays were detected by the MINIBALL gamma spectrometer in coincidence with scattered particles in a segmented Si-detector. Despite rather low beam intensities transition probabilities to the first excited states were deduced. Results of very recently published experiments at MSU and TRIUMF could be largely confirmed and extended. The measured B(E 2) values agree well with shell-model predictions, supporting the idea that in the sodium isotopic chain the ground-state wave function contains a significant intruder admixture already at N= 18, with N= 19 having an almost pure 2 p 2 h deformed ground-state configuration. Excited states in 56 Cr have been populated after 48 Ca(11 B,p 2 n) reactions at a beam energy of 32 MeV, provided by the Cologne FN tandem accelerator. The Cologne <b>coincidence</b> plunger <b>device</b> surrounded by a gamma-ray detector array of one EUROBALL cluster detector and five Ge detectors was employed to determine lifetimes with the recoil distance Doppler-shift method. gamma-gamma-coincidence data were analyzed using the differential decay curve method and precise lifetimes for the first 2 + and 4 + states were extracted. The corresponding B(E 2, 2 + -> 0 +) value quantifies with a high accuracy the puzzling discrepancy between experimental B(E 2) values in N= 32 isotones and theoretical results from large-scale shell-model calculations employing modern effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. ...|$|R
