5|$|Following the {{signature}} of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement in 2001, Croatia applied for European Union (EU) membership in 2003, the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004, and the European Council granted <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> status to Croatia in mid-2004. Accession negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, began in October of that year. Croatia completed the accession negotiations on 30 June 2011; on 9 December 2011 it signed the Treaty of Accession, changing its status from a candidate to an acceding country as it prepared to become the 28th EU member state. The ratification process by the Parliaments of all 27 current EU member states {{was expected to be}} concluded by the end of June 2013, and Croatia's accession to the EU was expected to take place on 1 July 2013. In addition to ratification by the current EU member states, Article 142 of the Constitution of Croatia requires that a binding referendum be held on sovereignty issues such as Croatian EU membership.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} regional unemployment rates, wages, participation rates, migration and employment in seven <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> for accession to the European Union (EU) in the 1990 's. We compare these countries to a core set of EU member states and find persistent regional disparities in both regions. However, persistence of unemployment rates is lower in the first-round <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> than in the member states. Furthermore, in both first-round and second-round <b>candidate</b> <b>countries,</b> persistence in participation rates is lower. Migration {{seems to be an}} ineffective labor market adjustment mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{various aspects}} of industrial restructuring across all ten Central and East European (CEE) <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> for EU membership {{during the last decade}} and provides also some comparisons with current EU Member States. The impressive structural adjustments that have taken place in CEE industries since the beginning of transition brought the structure of manufacturing industry in the majority of CEE <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> fairly close to the European pattern both in terms of production and employment. Technology-driven industries account for a growing share of exports in nearly all <b>candidate</b> <b>countries,</b> while labour-intensive industries have growing export shares only in less advanced candidates such as Bulgaria, Romania and in the Baltic states. The initial export specialization pattern of the more advanced CEE <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> has thus nearly completely reversed; a remarkable upgrading towards more sophisticated and less capital-intensive industries has occurred. foreign direct investment, EU <b>candidate</b> <b>countries,</b> industrial restructuring, trade specialization, integration...|$|R

500|$|Many {{economists are}} sceptical about the {{economic}} benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such [...] "mega-events" [...] often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong {{positive effect on the}} philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.|$|E
2500|$|Croatia {{applied for}} EU {{membership}} in 2003, and the European Commission recommended {{making it an}} official candidate in early 2004. <b>Candidate</b> <b>country</b> status was granted to Croatia by the European Council (the EU's heads of state and/or government) in mid-2004, but the date {{for the beginning of}} entry negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, was put off. In early March 2005, Croatia was formally warned by the EU that its failure to arrest the war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina would jeopardise the country's chances of starting the accession talks, in spite of Croatia insisting it was doing everything it could to find and arrest the fugitive and claiming that Gotovina was no longer in Croatia. In fact, the talks started in October 2005, shortly before Gotovina's arrest, which occurred in early December that year and was hailed by the EU as an important turning point for the whole region, as it turned [...] "the page from the nationalist past to a European future".|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a {{data set}} {{covering}} 9 EU 15 member states and 7 <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> and {{new member states}} to compare inter-regional migration patterns in the 1990 s. We find that migration is lower in <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> and new member states than in EU 15 member states. Also {{in contrast to the}} EU 15 member states migration has fallen in <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> and new member states. This casts doubt on the viability of migration as an adjustment mechanism. Estimating place to place models of migration we find that migration is less reactive to regional disparities in <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> and new member states than in EU 15 member states. If reaction to labor market disparities were similar to EU 15 states net migration should increase by a factor of 2 to over 10...|$|R

Furthermore, adjustment mechanisms partly explain high regional unemployment. High unemployment regions exhibit a lower capability to absorb region-specific shocks through mechanisms other than higher unemployment. Copyright RSAI 2005. ...|$|R
