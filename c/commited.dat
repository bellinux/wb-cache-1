50|$|This {{goes back}} to the notion of the fag discourse. Pascoe states “becoming a fag has {{as much to do with}} failing at the {{masculine}} tasks of competence, heterosexual prowess, and strength or in any way revealing weakness or femininity as it does with a sexual identity. This fluidity of the fag identity is what makes the specter of the fag such a powerful disciplinary mechanism. It is fluid enough that boys permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it”. No homo is a deflective mechanism used to avoid the identity of fag being placed upon the speaker. When the speaker adds no homo to the end of their sentence, it is because “the problem is not necessarily that they <b>commited</b> a sexual transgression, but that they have committed a gender transgression”.|$|E

50|$|Several known {{deaths have}} been {{associated}} with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. Olson, a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and <b>commited</b> suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.|$|E
5000|$|The {{control of}} the press that the Iranian {{government}} had {{was a result of}} the [...] "dysfunctional dualism of political and ideological institutions". The struggle between conservative and moderate reform administration resulted in restriction the press. During this time period, Iran experienced an apparent struggle of power between reformist president Muhammad Khatami and the conservative leader of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In efforts to decrease support for the president’s liberalization agenda, the judiciary closed down newspapers that expressed reformative views. The judiciary justified the closure of several publications on the basis of [...] "factional issues …The hardline judiciary closed reformist publications, while hardline ones that <b>commited</b> similar violations were rarely punished". The judiciary used press policies as a tool to promote conservative views. The judiciary was able to do this because press policies were vague and used to their benefit. Consequently, on 7 July 1999 the Salam daily was closed. The basis of the closure was because of a report revealing plans by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security to restrict the press. The editor of the newspaper faced [...] "charges of spreading fabrications, disturbing public opinion, and publishing classified documents". The judicial sector of the Iranian government had clear objectives to eradicate the spread of reformative views by closing down publications that spread truth to the public however the judiciary distorted the information to enable their {{control of the}} press.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2017, Brown started prosecuting murder suspect Jason Marshall who {{was arrested}} after murder victim's {{relative}} found hidden footage of killing on his laptop.Peter Fasoli, 58 years old IT expert from Northolt was terrorised and murdered in 2013 at his own house by Marshall who posed as a policeman. On {{the opening day of}} his trial at the Old Bailey, Marshall was described as a [...] "calculated and determined" [...] killer. Prosecuting, Mr Brown warned jurors that they would be asked to view the video, which showed the actual killing itself. The court heard that during sexual roleplay, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a government laptop, the court heard. Fasoli was threatened with a knife and forced to hand over his cash card pin numbers, the court heard. Marshall subsequently set fire to Fasoli's home in attempt to make Fasoli's death look like an accident. [...] "The fire, {{in the early hours of}} January 7, 2013, had been intended to hide a terrible crime. The fire was set by this defendant in an attempt to disguise what truly happened, and the defendant Jason Marshall very nearly succeeded in escaping justice. Peter Fasoli was killed, intentionally. He had been subjected to a calculated and determined attack, by this defendant whom he invited into his home. In the end he literally fought for his life but by the time Mr Fasoli fully understood the true motives of the person who had tricked his way into his home, it was too late. Desperate as his attempts were, he could do nothing - as you will all too graphically come to understand. [...] " [...] — Edward Brown QC, Prosecutor. But two years later when Fasoli's nephew was sorting through his belongings, he was horrified to discover a computer file containing CCTV footage of the entire event.The court heard how Marshall, who denies murder, first got in contact with Mr Fasoli in December 2012 through gay social networking site called Badoo, inviting to set up a treesome and inventing the persona of a policeman.Prosecuting, Mr Brown told jurors: There is a telling feature of this case - whilst the defendant sought to tempt the deceased into thinking their encounter that night was to be sexual in nature, the sexual element of the night’s events played only a short part early on and soon was superseded by physical domination and then violence. The Old Baily heard that Marshall arrived at the Fasoli's home at around 7pm on January 6, 2012, pretending to be a police officer kitted out with a police utility belt, handcuffs and a pistol holster.During sexual role play, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a Government laptop, the court heard.After Marshall fled the scene, he sent a “calculated and cynical” message to Fasoli on the Badoo chat line apologising for not seeing him the night before. He allegedly withdrew £400 in cash from the Fasoli's bank account and used his card to buy a flight to Rome. In February 2016 Marshal was arrested in Italy and extradited to United Kingdom to face trial for murder of Fasoli he <b>commited</b> four years ago. A Metropolitan Police spokesman commented: [...] Detectives investigating the murder of a man in Northolt in 2013 have arrested and charged a man on suspicion of his murder. He will appear in custody at Hendon Magistrates' Court today. The investigation into Mr Fasoli's murder was started on 10 November 2014 by officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, after new evidence was passed to the MPS. Mr Fasoli, aged 58, died on Monday, 7 January 2013 after he was brought out of his burning flat in Rubens Road, Northolt. The court has heard that Fasoli accidentally filmed his own bondage sex session murder at the hands of a fake policeman. Jurors at the Old Bailey watched footage of Fasoli begging for his life as he was attacked by fantasist Marshall while classical music played in the background. Camera footage showed Fasioli becoming visibly distressed as he was gagged and bound on his bed. He was threatened with a large hunting knife and forced to hand over his cash card pin numbers, the court heard. Prosecuting, Brown told the jury: [...] Fasoli's postmortem examination initially gave the cause of death as inhalation of fire fumes, but a re-examination found that Fasoli was still alive when the fire was set. Restraint and asphyxia also contributed to Fasoli's death.|$|E
