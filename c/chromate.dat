5|$|In the <b>chromate</b> {{conversion}} coating process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates {{are used to}} deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This passivation and the self-healing properties by the <b>chromate</b> stored in the <b>chromate</b> {{conversion coating}}, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method. Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.|$|E
5|$|Since the Middle Ages, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} {{produced}} as a {{raw material for}} the production of coloured pigments in lead paints, such as chrome yellow (lead(II) <b>chromate),</b> chrome orange (lead(II) hydroxide <b>chromate)</b> and similar lead compounds. These pigments were used for dyeing and printing calico and other textiles.|$|E
5|$|Sodium <b>chromate</b> is {{produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (<b>chromate)</b> to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium <b>chromate.</b> At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
50|$|Both {{insoluble}} salts of {{lead and}} barium <b>chromates</b> {{as well as}} soluble <b>chromates</b> were negative in the implantation model of lung carcinogenesis.

5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of <b>chromate</b> dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a <b>chromate</b> dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E
50|$|Chemical pre-treatments {{involve the}} use of {{phosphates}} or <b>chromates</b> in submersion or spray application. These often occur in multiple stages and consist of degreasing, etching, de-smutting, various rinses and the final phosphating or <b>chromating</b> of the substrate. The pre-treatment process both cleans and improves bonding of the powder to the metal. Recent additional processes have been developed that avoid {{the use of}} <b>chromates,</b> as these can be toxic to the environment. Titanium zirconium and silanes offer similar performance against corrosion and adhesion of the powder.|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} containing Cr(VI), Cr(NO 3) 3 and its complex with an organic acid {{as well as}} several commercial solutions containing Cr(III) complexes with an organic acid and additionally CO 2 +, F-, SO 42 - ions were used for the studies. Results of the studies obtained in the following commercial solutions: Likonda 2 AT, Cr(NO 3) 3 + malonic acid; Likonda 3 Cr 5 and Likonda 3 CrMC are discussed. Steel coated with <b>chromated</b> Zn coatings was contaminated by some microscopic fungi. The variety of fungi on <b>chromated</b> plates diminished, however the propagules of fungi did not disappear completely. The Likonda 3 Cr 5 solution diminishes fungi contami-nation on <b>chromated</b> steel most effectively. In water used to rinse the surface of <b>chromated</b> plates the number of fungi propagules was detected to be higher as compared to that on the plate surface. The least quantity of fungi propagules was detected in water used to rinse plates coated in the Likonda 3 Cr 5 solution. The main part of fungi detected on <b>chromated</b> plates treated in the Likonda 3 Cr 5 solution were the fungi of Cladospo-rium species (C. herbarum, C. cladosporioides). The latter species also dominated on <b>chromated</b> plates coated with zinc and treated with the other solution. It should be mentioned, that on these plates <b>chromated</b> in this solution, Actinomycetes of the Streptomyces group were abundant. After comparison of surfaces of the plates treated in four solutions it has been determined that the surface of the plates treated in the Likonda 3 Cr 5 pas...|$|R

5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead <b>chromate</b> PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead <b>chromate</b> (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important <b>chromate</b> pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc <b>chromate,</b> now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) <b>chromate),</b> discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4). Chromite is now the principal source of chromium for pigments.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, anecdotal sources {{attribute}} {{the naming of}} the bombs to a pumpkin color: While the bombs were painted olive drab or khaki in the field, photographs show that at least the units delivered to Tinian were shipped in the same yellow zinc <b>chromate</b> primer color worn by Fat Man.|$|E
40|$|Hexavalent <b>chromates</b> {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as the "gold standard " in corrosion protection. However, increasingly stringent health and environmental regulations are restricting the use and disposal of <b>chromates.</b> The primary mechanism by which <b>chromates</b> arrest corrosion on aerospace aluminum alloys is through inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at copper-based cathodic half-cells. Other inorganic anions and inorganic cations are much less effective than <b>chromates.</b> Recent studies for example have shown that Ce 3 + (an often touted replacement for <b>chromates)</b> is 1000 times less effective than CrO 42 - at inhibiting the ORR, whereas certain organic thiols (e. g. 2, 5 -dithiol- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole) are ten times more effective than Ce 3 + as inhibitors for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at copper containing cathodic half-cells. We have used a rotating disc copper electrode and computational modeling to develop Quantitative Structure Property Relationships for organic inhibitors of the ORR. In our studies we have identified organics that are highly active for ORR inhibition. We will present {{the results of these}} studies and discuss the relationships between the organic structures and inhibition of the ORR for developing improved organic corrosion inhibitors for aerospace aluminum alloys...|$|R

5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by <b>chromate</b> salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Chromium {{minerals}} as pigments came to {{the attention}} of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the mineral was in fact crocoite (lead <b>chromate)</b> with a formula of PbCrO4.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The <b>chromate</b> is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5000|$|Chromium {{can end up}} as <b>chromates</b> (CrVI) in cement, {{particularly}} when the clinker is high in sulfate. <b>Chromates</b> cause allergic contact dermatitis in cement users, {{and for this reason}} cement CrVI content is limited in many standards to 0.0002%. Typical natural rawmixes contain around 0.01% Cr2O3, and at this level, CrVI formation can be controlled. Chromium present in the cement as CrIII is of no consequence.|$|R

When used alone the <b>chromates</b> required concentrations above 200 ppm as Na 2 Cr 0,. In combination with poly. phosphates the total level of treatment is reduced to only 40 - 60 ppm. <b>Chromates</b> owe their protective action {{to their ability to}} form a thin, passivating film directly on the anodic portion of metal...|$|R
5|$|Iron(II) sulfate {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce <b>chromate</b> in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia.

5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of <b>chromate</b> salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead <b>chromate</b> to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the <b>chromate</b> ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 two No. 38 Squadron King Airs were {{deployed}} to Vanuatu {{as part of}} Australia's aid effort following Cyclone Pam.

In February 2016 it was reported that the RAAF was considering consolidating its two squadrons equipped with King Airs into a single squadron located at RAAF Base East Sale. All of the RAAF's King Airs were grounded from 30 June 2016 after the hazardous chemical strontium <b>chromate</b> was detected in the aircraft; in the period immediately before the grounding No. 38 Squadron had been involved in flying politicians during the 2016 federal election.
