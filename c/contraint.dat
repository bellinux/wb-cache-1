50|$|These {{problems}} remain PSPACE-complete {{even for}} and/or constraint graphs that form planar graphs. The {{proof of this}} involves the construction of crossover gadgets that allow two independent signals to cross each other. It is also possible to impose an additional restriction, while preserving the hardness of these problems: each vertex with three blue edges can be required {{to be part of}} a triangle with a red edge. Such a vertex is called a protected or, and it has the property that (in any valid orientation of the whole graph) it is not possible for both of the blue edges in the triangle to be directed inwards. This restriction makes it easier to simulate these vertices in hardness reductions for other problems. Additionally, the <b>contraint</b> graphs can be required to have bounded bandwidth, and the problems on them will still remain PSPACE-complete.|$|E

In this paper, the access control thinking and principle of RBAC model are illustrated first. It consructs network security control model by abstracting five basic data objects which are user, role, object, operation and permission respectively inn building the relationship among them. Then the disadvantages of RBAC in processing time-constraint access control are analysed. Secondly, we retrospect the studying status quo of temporal RBAC model and analyse the existing problem of RBAC during authorizing in temporal system. It constraints the permission only in role level and does not consider fully the details during authorizing and role assignmeng. Finally a model named GTRBAC and its thinking are prospected. GTRBAC is a well defined access control model in temporal environment by now.

These integrity <b>contraints</b> describe conditions under which the agent’s goals must be reduced to plans that can be executed. For instance, a rule such as if A then B, will indicate to the agent that whenever it can prove that A is the case, it then should pursue goal B. B is normally the description of a task that must be reduced to a set of low-level, primitive actions that the agent can execute. ...|$|R
