5|$|A book by {{the same}} name was written by Ray and Valerie Vallese and {{released}} by Wizards of the Coast in 1999. The book's plot follows the game's only loosely; for example, in the game, the main character's lack of a name {{is a sign of}} his incomplete state and a source of protection in being anonymous. In the book, the protagonist <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> proper name. For the game's re-release on GOG.com a second, more accurate, novelization produced by Rhyss Hess was bundled with the game, based on the game script by Chris Avellone and Colin McComb.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{the body}} {{responsible}} for designating SSSIs is Natural England, which <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> site {{because of its}} fauna, flora, geological or physiographical features. Natural England took {{over the role of}} designating and managing SSSIs from English Nature in October 2006, when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency, and the Rural Development Service. , there are 41 sites designated in this Area of Search; of these, 26 have been designated for their biological interest, 4 for their geological interest, and 11 for both.|$|E

5|$|In the Puppet Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that it makes sense. If the player <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|The backstory is {{explained}} progressively through the player's acquisition of audio logs and encounters with ghostly apparitions. At {{the beginning of}} the game, the player <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> career in a branch of the Unified National Nominate, a fictional military organization. Each branch of service gives the player a set of starting bonuses composed of certain skills, though may thereafter freely develop as the player chooses. The Marine begins with bonuses to weaponry, the Navy officer is skilled in repairing and hacking, and the OSA agent gets a starting set of psionic powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} stories were both seen in Medieval- and Renaissance {{theology}} as prefiguring the Crucifixion of Jesus. In {{the story of}} the Brazen Serpent, the people of Israel become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a plague of venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set it up on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E
5|$|The story follows three friends, Arjun, Kabir, and Imraan {{who have}} been inseparable since childhood. They set off to Spain on a {{bachelor}} trip and meet Laila, {{who falls in love}} with Arjun and helps him overcome his problem of workaholism. Kabir and his fiancée experience significant misunderstanding in the meanwhile, which they soon overcome. As part of the trip, each friend <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> dangerous sport for the group to partake.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies {{in a straight line}} or <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E

5|$|B. Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the {{production}} of Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958), the latter's directorial debut in Kannada cinema. As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> mentally challenged person as her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju; {{it was the first time}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After the script was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy. Pullaiah was not appreciative of Narasa Raju's treatment of the script and Nagi Reddy met his partner Aluri Chakrapani to develop the script further.|$|E
5|$|During {{character}} creation, {{the player}} <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> class: fighter, ranger, paladin, thief, bard, mage, cleric, druid, barbarian, monk, or sorcerer; {{the last three}} of which are new for the sequel. Different classes have different special abilities and restrictions; a thief character, for instance, can find and remove traps, but thieves have limitations on which weapons and armor they may use, and cannot be of lawful good alignment. Most classes also have a subset of kits, or specializations within a class, from which to choose. Kits have special advantages and, usually, disadvantages; for example, one of the kits of the paladin class, the cavalier, specializes in fighting monsters such as dragons and demons, but cannot use missile weapons. At {{some point in the}} game, the player may join or take over a stronghold. The type of stronghold is determined by the protagonist's class.|$|E

5|$|In England {{the body}} {{responsible}} for designating SSSIs is Natural England, which <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> site {{because of its}} fauna, flora, geological or physiographical features. Natural England took {{over the role of}} designating and managing SSSIs from English Nature in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the 19741996 county system and as such the same approach is followed here, rather than, for example, splitting these sites between the Lancashire and Cheshire lists. The data in the table is taken from English Nature's website in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E
5|$|Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is {{the second}} {{installment}} in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D fighting games. It utilizes the same one-on-one tag team format previously employed in X-Men vs. Street Fighter. The player <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> team of two fighters, each sporting their own life gauge; {{at the start of}} the match, the first selected character is controlled by the player, while the second character remains off-screen and acts as support. Using a combination of joystick movements and button presses, the player must execute various moves to deplete the opposing team's life gauges. The first player to completely drain the opponent's health is declared the winner. If the timer reaches zero, the player that possesses the most health wins.|$|E

40|$|UK firms {{going public}} {{have a choice}} between public offers and placings. This choice has {{important}} implications {{in terms of who}} bears the risk of the issue failing and of its costs. We find that firms with higher "ex ante" uncertainty <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> placing contract. Highly reputable sponsors and creditor screening serve as signals of firm quality, enabling such firms to <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> public offer. Large and multinational firms usually <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> public offer whereas {{there is some evidence that}} very small issues <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> placing. Finally, the 'hotness' of the IPO market increases the probability of placings. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2006. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{first player}} <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> card to play. If the second player has {{one or more}} cards of higher value of the same suit as this card, one of them must be played, and the second player wins the trick. If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played; in this case, the second player loses the trick. If the second player {{does not have any}} cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played; the second player wins the trick. If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played, and the second player loses the trick.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation {{in which to}} lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of Australia and {{on the west coast}} of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.|$|E
5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E
