5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, {{as it has}} been suggested that the <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> could be used as a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons.

40|$|Media {{scrutiny}} of <b>criminal</b> <b>trials</b> is commonplace. Newspapers give extensive attention to <b>criminal</b> <b>trials</b> of celebrities such as Martha Stewart and those, such as Scott Peterson, accused of terrible crimes. And television, through Court TV, provides coverage and commentary on <b>criminal</b> <b>trials</b> of even obscure defendants. The lawyer {{and the client}} have limited ability to control such coverage-whether in print media or oil television-and it is usually limited to what an observer sitting in the court- room would see. The Constitution requires public <b>criminal</b> <b>trials,</b> and newspapers and television cameras extend public access to open courtroom proceedings beyond the {{relatively small number of}} spectators a typical courtroom holds. Two recent cases, though, demonstrate that television may be poised to expand the scope and intrusiveness of its coverage of <b>criminal</b> <b>trials</b> raising challenging questions of legal ethics...|$|R

5|$|The {{attorneys}} {{who represented the}} LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and {{that members of the}} Alexandria prosecution team from the second <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to detain people for the purposes of <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal <b>criminal</b> <b>trial,</b> verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.|$|E

5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b> The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} <b>criminal</b> <b>trial,</b> and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Thompson was {{involved}} in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore’s <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b> Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>criminal</b> <b>trial,</b> all {{the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began {{proceedings}} and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
5|$|In {{search of}} a fair trial, Carrouges {{traveled}} to Paris {{to appeal to the}} King himself. Knowing that his case depended solely on his wife's testimony and was therefore weak, Carrouges developed a plan: Instead of proceeding with a normal <b>criminal</b> <b>trial,</b> Carrouges would challenge Le Gris to a judicial duel, the survivor of which would thus have been deemed by God to have been the rightful claimant. Such trials-by-combat, once common in France, were rare by 1386 and the chance of one being permitted by the King unlikely. Nevertheless, Carrouges saw this scheme as his best option of procuring justice and redeeming his wife's reputation. A few days after his arrival in Paris, Carrouges was presented to the King at the Château de Vincennes {{in order to make the}} first official appeal in the lengthy trial process. In doing so, he captured the imagination of the French court, which later become so fascinated with the Carrouges-Le Gris trial that it would shape its schedule around watching the culminating combat.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{team was}} largely that which had opposed the Claimant {{in the civil}} case, minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew, both future judges. The Claimant's team was significantly weaker; he would not reengage Ballantine, and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly because they knew {{they would have to}} present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld. Kenealy's task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown's lawyers. Other key witnesses from the civil case, including Moore, Baigent and Lipscombe, likewise would not give evidence at the <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|The <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> {{continued}} {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E
