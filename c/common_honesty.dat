40|$|This article {{examines}} commercial norms of behaviour in two contexts: those business norms which are self-imposed by commercial {{parties in the}} context of successful long-term business relationships, and which were identified by Professor Stewart Macaulay and Beale and Dugdale in their empirical studies of the 1960 s and 1970 s, and the various doctrinal norms by which the law now imposes and reinforces standards of good behaviour in general commercial dealings. Although underpinned by diametrically opposed rationales (self interest and profit-maximisation in the former case, regulation of market abuse and promotion of market integrity in the latter), the standards of behaviour set by relational business norms and legal doctrine reveal strikingly similar strands. Indeed the thesis of the article is that doctrinal law has moved closer to the behavioural norms of the commercial and 'relational' world. In particular there is evident in both contexts, a strong emphasis on concepts of fairness, <b>honesty,</b> <b>common</b> decency and giving effect to the commercial realities of the situation...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of values in Technology Education {{has become a}} major concern as technology curriculum documents are designed and implemented. The Technology Years 1 to 10 Syllabus (QSA, 2003) in Queensland places emphasis on aspects of appropriateness as students develop and examine design solutions through working technologically. This paper reports the findings of an investigation of student teachers' confidence and preparedness in being able to consider the ethical appropriateness and the strategies they would employ to promote student considerations of ethical design solutions to design challenges. Consistent with Fleer and Jane's citation of Levinson's conclusion that "few teachers, whatever their specialism, can handle the ethical aspects of contemporary science and technology issues with much confidence or experience", an analysis of student teacher responses revealed an array of strategies including avoidance of controversial or 'touchy' issues, use of a(n) (un) <b>common</b> sense approach, <b>honesty,</b> a search for 'truth', and a respect for personal values and beliefs. The key implication which emerged from the student teacher responses was that technology education requires values-based pedagogical approaches to enable student teachers to confidently deal with the ethical appropriateness of design solutions.

Of the parent project respondents (N = 364), 14 % returned syllabi for the present study. General information (e. g., objectives, honor code, academic <b>honesty,</b> <b>common</b> policy, and classroom expectations), assignments, APA format, and teaching sources were coded. Coding of objectives were developed from McKeachie and Svinkicki (2011) definition and de las Fuentes (2005) conceptualization of specific objectives (awareness, skill, and knowledge). A little over half (56. 6 %) of syllabi stated clear objectives, only 52. 8 % covered academic honesty, and 16 (30. 2 %) did not include a section to address accommodations for students with disabilities. Most syllabi used APA format to cite sources, however, most sources used were 5 years or older. Overall, syllabi were quite varied in the information they included. Greater consistency in syllabus content would make future evaluations on the state of graduate ethics education more accurate.

40|$|In {{response}} to limited physician adoption of various healthcare initiatives, {{we sought to}} propose and assess a novel approach to policy development where one first characterizes diverse physician groups' common interests, using a medical student and constructivist grounded theory. In 6 months, a medical student completed 36 semi-structured interviews with interventional radiologists, gynecologists, and vascular surgeons that were systematically analyzed according to constructivist grounded theory to identifying common themes. Common drivers of clinical decision making and professional values across 3 distinct specialty groups were derived from physicians' descriptions of their clinical decision making, stories, and concerns. Common drivers of clinical decision making included patient preference/benefit, experience, reimbursement, busyness/volume, and referral networks. <b>Common</b> values included <b>honesty,</b> trustworthiness, loyalty, humble service, compassion and perseverance, and practical wisdom. Although personal gains were perceived as important interests, such values were easily sacrificed {{for the good of}} patients or other non-financial interests. This balance was largely dependent on the incentives and security provided by physicians' environments. Using a medical student interviewer and constructivist grounded theory is a feasible means of collecting rich qualitative data to guide policy development. Healthcare administrators and medical educators should consider incorporating this methodology early in policy development to anticipate how value differences between physician groups will influence their acceptance of policies and other broad healthcare initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{perception}} {{is considered one}} of the first senses used as a communication system between living organisms. Such communication is based on the emission of signals between a sender and a receiver; if the communication is chemical, these signals are called pheromones. These signals have evolved via natural selection through a mechanism known as ritualization, which converts cues (which are not adapted to communication and which the receiver picks up regardless of the interests of the sender) into signals (information that the sender transmits as an adaptative response to its previously developed perception of the receiver). When communication has evolved between actors (sender and receiver) with <b>common</b> interests, the <b>honesty</b> of the signal is taken for granted, since both want the same thing (i. e., there is no reason to deceive). If the actors have conflicting interests, however, then the possibility of deception seeps into the possible array of adaptations. This can be observed in the case of communicative mimicry. However, in other situations natural selection imposes conditions that screen the possible signals, allowing only those that meet the requirement of honesty to stabilize. These include indices and added-cost signals. The emission of pheromones plays a variety of roles in the life processes of living beings. It facilitates encounters between individuals of the same species and is heavily involved in the mechanisms of recognition of relatives. It also fosters behaviours such as altruism (cooperation between individuals that share a percentage of their genetic inheritance). In many species, including humans, chemical communication works behind the scenes to guide the choice of a sexual partner...|$|R

The highest-placed {{individual in}} the most cultivated age and population of the world,--he has not the merit of <b>common</b> truth and <b>honesty.</b> He is unjust to his generals; egotistic, and monopolizing; meanly stealing the credit of their great actions from Kellermann, from Bernadotte; intriguing to involve his faithful Junot in hopeless bankruptcy, in order to drive him to a distance from Paris, because the familiarity of his manners offends the new pride of his throne. He is a boundless liar. The official paper, his [...] "Moniteurs," [...] and all his bulletins, are proverbs for saying what he wished to be believed; and worse,--he sat, in his premature old age, in his lonely island, coldly falsifying facts, and dates, and characters, and giving to history, a theatrical eclat. Like all Frenchmen, he has a passion for stage effect. Every action that breathes of generosity is poisoned by this calculation. His star, his love of glory, his doctrine of the immortality of the soul, are all French. [...] "I must dazzle and astonish. If I were to give the liberty of the press, my power could not last three days." [...] To make a great noise is his favorite design. [...] "A great reputation is a great noise; the more there is made, the farther off it is heard. Laws, institutions, monuments, nations, all fall; but the noise continues, and resounds in after ages." [...] His doctrine of immortality is simply fame. His theory of influence is not flattering. [...] "There are two levers for moving men,--interest and fear. Love is a silly infatuation, depend upon it. Friendship is but a name. I love nobody. I do not even love my brothers; perhaps Joseph, a little, from habit, and because he is my elder; and Duroc, I love him too; but why?--because his character pleases me; he is stern and resolute, and, I believe, the fellow never shed a tear. For my part, I {{know very well that}} I have no true friends. As long as I continue to be what I am, I may have as many pretended friends as I please. Leave sensibility to women; but men should be firm in heart and purpose, or they should {{have nothing to do with}} war and government." [...] He was thoroughly unscrupulous. He would steal, slander, assassinate, drown, and poison, as his interest dictated. He had no generosity; but mere vulgar hatred; he was intensely selfish; he was perfidious; he cheated at cards; he was a prodigious gossip; and opened letters; and delighted in his infamous police; and rubbed his hands with joy when he had intercepted some morsel of intelligence concerning the men and women about him, boasting that [...] "he knew everything;" [...] and interfered with the cutting the dresses of the women; and listened after the hurrahs and the compliments of the street, incognito.

It does not appear that he listened at keyholes, or, at least, that he [...] "was caught at it".

60|$|VIII. It {{is almost}} {{impossible}} for us to conceive, in our present state of doubt and ignorance, the sudden dawn of intelligence and fancy, the rapidly increasing sense of power and facility, and, in its proper sense, of Freedom, which such wholesome restraint would instantly cause throughout the whole circle of the arts. Freed from the agitation and embarrassment of that liberty of choice which {{is the cause of}} half the discomforts of the world; freed from the accompanying necessity of studying all past, present, or even possible styles; and enabled, by concentration of individual, and co-operation of multitudinous energy, to penetrate into the uttermost secrets of the adopted style, the architect would find his whole understanding enlarged, his practical knowledge certain and ready to hand, and his imagination playful and vigorous, as a child's would be within a walled garden, who would sit down and shudder if he were left free in a fenceless plain. How many and how bright would be the results in every direction of interest, not to the arts merely, but to national happiness and virtue, it would be as difficult to preconceive as it would seem extravagant to state: but the first, perhaps the least, of them would be an increased sense of fellowship among ourselves, a cementing of every patriotic bond of union, a proud and happy recognition of our affection for and sympathy with each other, and our willingness in all things to submit ourselves to every law that would advance the interest of the community; a barrier, also, the best conceivable, to the unhappy rivalry of the upper and middle classes, in houses, furniture, and establishments; and even a check to much of what is as vain as it is painful in the oppositions of religious parties respecting matters of ritual. These, I say, would be the first consequences. Economy increased tenfold, as it would be by the simplicity of practice; domestic comforts uninterfered with by the caprice and mistakes of architects ignorant of the capacities of the styles they use, and all the symmetry and sightliness of our harmonized streets and public buildings, are things of slighter account in the catalogue of benefits. But it would be mere enthusiasm to endeavor to trace them farther. I have suffered myself too long to indulge in the speculative statement of requirements which perhaps we have more immediate and more serious work than to supply, and of feelings which it may be only contingently in our power to recover. I should be unjustly thought unaware of the difficulty of what I have proposed, or of the unimportance of the whole subject as compared with many which are brought home to our interests and fixed upon our consideration by the wild course of the present century. But of difficulty and of importance it is for others to judge. I have limited myself to the simple statement of what, if we desire to have architecture, we MUST primarily endeavor to feel and do: but then it may not be desirable for us to have architecture at all. There are many who feel it to be so; many who sacrifice much to that end; and I am sorry to see their energies wasted and their lives disquieted in vain. I have stated, therefore, the only ways in which that end is attainable, without venturing even to express an opinion as to its real desirableness. I have an opinion, and the zeal with which I have spoken may sometimes have betrayed it, but I hold to it with no confidence. I know too well the undue importance which the study that every man follows must assume in his own eyes, to trust my own impressions of the dignity of that of Architecture; and yet I think I cannot be utterly mistaken in regarding it as at least useful {{in the sense of a}} National employment. I am confirmed in this impression by what I see passing among the states of Europe at this instant. All the horror, distress, and tumult which oppress the foreign nations, are traceable, among the other secondary causes through which God is working out His will upon them, to the simple one of their not having enough to do. I am not blind to the distress among their operatives; nor do I deny the nearer and visibly active causes of the movement: the recklessness of villany in the leaders of revolt, the absence of common moral principle in the upper classes, and of <b>common</b> courage and <b>honesty</b> in the heads of governments. But these causes themselves are ultimately traceable to a deeper and simpler one: the recklessness of the demagogue, the immorality of the middle class, and the effeminacy and treachery of the noble, are traceable in all these nations to the commonest and most fruitful cause of calamity in households--idleness. We think too much in our benevolent efforts, more multiplied and more vain day by day, of bettering men by giving them advice and instruction. There are few who will take either: the chief thing they need is occupation. I do not mean work in the sense of bread,--I mean work in the sense of mental interest; for those who either are placed above the necessity of labor for their bread, or who will not work although they should. There is a vast quantity of idle energy among European nations at this time, which ought to go into handicrafts; there are multitudes of idle semi-gentlemen who ought to be shoemakers and carpenters; but since they will not be these so long as they can help it, the business of the philanthropist is to find them some other employment than disturbing governments. It is of no use to tell them they are fools, and that they will only make themselves miserable in the end as well as others: if they have nothing else to do, they will do mischief; and the man who will not work, and who has no means of intellectual pleasure, is as sure to become an instrument of evil as if he had sold himself bodily to Satan. I have myself seen enough of the daily life of the young educated men of France and Italy, to account for, as it deserves, the deepest national suffering and degradation; and though, for the most part, our commerce and our natural habits of industry preserve us from a similar paralysis, yet it would be wise to consider whether the forms of employment which we chiefly adopt or promote, are as well calculated as they might be to improve and elevate us.|$|R
