5|$|Haroutune Krikor Daghlian Jr., of Armenian-American extraction, {{was born}} in Waterbury, Connecticut, on May 4, 1921, one of three {{children}} of Margaret Rose (née Currie) and Haroutune Krikor Daghlian. He had a sister, Helen, and a brother, Edward. Soon after his birth the family moved across state to the coastal town of New London, Connecticut. He was educated at Harbor Elementary School, where he played violin in the school orchestra, and at Bulkeley High School. In 1938, {{at the age of}} 17, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, intending to study mathematics, but became interested in physics, particularly particle physics, then emerging as an exciting new field. This led him to transfer to the West Lafayette, Indiana, campus of Purdue University, which graduated him in 1942 with a bachelor of Science degree. He then commenced work on his doctorate, assisting Marshall Holloway with the cyclotrons. In 1944, while still a graduate student, he joined Otto Frisch's <b>Critical</b> <b>Assembly</b> Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory of the Manhattan Project.|$|E

40|$|One {{legacy of}} the Soviet nuclear program is great {{quantities}} of high enriched uranium (HEU) {{that were used in}} different research programs.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>assemblies</b> are exquisitely {{sensitive}} to {{details of the}} microscopic nuclear reactions that govern neutron multiplication. For this reason experimental studies of <b>critical</b> <b>assemblies</b> represent a cornerstone {{in the process of}} validating nuclear data. Several different characteristics of a critical system can be measured. The most commonly considered is the so-called effective k eigenvalue, k{sub eff}. Another well-measured property of these systems is {alpha}{sub 0 }, the inverse e-folding time of the neutron population in the absence of {beta}-delayed neutrons. Through Monte Carlo calculations and appear to perturbation theory they show that for fast critical systems {alpha}{sub 0 } and k{sub eff} can be viewed as lying on a single straight line for any reasonable assumptions about the underlying nuclear data. This means that the two quantities provide the same constraint on nuclear data. In principle, {alpha}{sub 0 } could be associated with a very small uncertainty, and this would make the measurements for neutron multiplication rates more useful than k{sub eff} for constraining nuclear data. In practice, though, uncertainties in k{sub eff} and {alpha}{sub 0 } are dominated by uncertainties in the representation of the critical system, and not by pure measurement errors for these quantities. This, together with the linear relation between {alpha}{sub 0 } and k{sub eff}, implies that the two measured quantities provide exactly the same constraint on nuclear data. They do not consider other measured or inferred characteristics of <b>critical</b> <b>assemblies,</b> such as neutron generation times or spectral indices, that may be valuable in the validation process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{analysis}} of measurements of criticality, central reaction rate ratios, reaction rate distributions and reactivity coefficients {{performed at the}} BFS <b>critical</b> <b>assemblies</b> is important both for obtaining information required to refine neutron data and assessing the accuracy of neutron-physical characteristics. The high core heterogeneity of <b>critical</b> <b>assemblies</b> dictates the need for using codes capable of reproducing an accurate description of the geometry and detailed representation of the energy dependence of neutron data. At the same time, serial verification tests of evaluated nuclear data libraries and processing and transport codes require significant computer time to obtain results of sufficient precision. In such cases, {{it is possible to}} achieve the required accuracy in measuring neutron-physical characteristics by using non-analogous calculation methods (variance reduction methods). The paper presents the algorithms for improving the efficiency of calculations based on non-analogous methods implemented in the MCNP code as exemplified by an {{analysis of}} experiments on measuring reaction rates in critical multiplying systems with a complex heterogeneous composition.
