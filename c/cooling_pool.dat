40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} compares two simulations, one using a bulk {{and the other a}} {{detailed}} bin microphysical scheme, of a long-lasting, continental mesoscale convective system with leading convection and trailing stratiform region. Diagnostic studies and sensitivity tests are carried out in Part II to explain the simulated contrasts in the spatial and temporal variations by the two microphysical schemes and to understand the interactions between cloud microphysics and storm dynamics. It is found that the fixed raindrop size distribution in the bulk scheme artificially enhances rain evaporation rate and produces a stronger near surface <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> compared with the bin simulation. In the bulk simulation, <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> circulation dominates the near-surface environmental wind shear in contrast to the near-balance between <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> and wind shear in the bin simulation. This is the main reason for the contrasting quasi-steady states simulated in Part I. Sensitivity tests also show that large amounts of fast-falling hail produced in the original bulk scheme not only result in a narrow trailing stratiform region but also act to further exacerbate the strong <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> simulated in the bulk parameterization. An empirical formula for a correction factor, r(q(sub r)) = 0. 11 q(sub r) (exp - 1. 27) + 0. 98, is developed to correct the overestimation of rain evaporation in the bulk model, where r is the ratio of the rain evaporation rate between the bulk and bin simulations and q(sub r) (g per kilogram) is the rain mixing ratio.

Gait variables included spatiotemporal data, peak joint angles and joint excursions in the lower extremities. All participants walked on a 10 -meter walkway at their maximum speed for 3 trials with 30 -second rest in between. The Vicon Motion Analysis system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) was used to capture and process gait data, applying the Plug-in-Gait model. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance showed greater increases in ankle peak plantarflexion and ankle excursion on the less affected limb in the aquatic group as compared to the home-based group. There were no significant between-group differences found in gait speed, stride length, cadence and hip and knee kinematics. Both groups showed a positive trend of maintaining or improving their gait efficiency in all other dependant variables.

Our contribution is three-fold. First we analyze the problem symmetries and define an abstract state which groups together equivalent states, making the goal state unique. This first step uses the equivalence between interchangeable clusters and the equivalence between non-reloaded bundles. It allows to reason in terms of equivalent sets rather than in terms of bundles and clusters, and hence reduces the number of equivalent search paths.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The PBMR is {{the first}} High Temperature Reactor being {{designed}} for commercial power generation in South Africa. It makes use of spherical fuel elements, containing coated uranium oxide particles encapsulated in a graphite matrix. The spent fuel generated from the reactor is stored in a storage system before final disposal. Such storage systems are called interim storage facilities, and normally make use of small transportable containers. The PBMR design makes use of bulk storage containers, capable of holding {{more than half a}} million spent fuel spheres. This is a unique concept for nuclear spent fuel storage. Also, most nuclear reactors make use of an intermediate <b>cooling</b> <b>pool</b> before the fuel is transferred to the storage facility. For the PBMR, the spent fuel is discharged directly into the interim storage facility, thus eliminating the intermediate <b>cooling</b> <b>pool.</b> All interim storage facilities have to comply with five basic requirements, namely: fuel sub-criticality; decay heat removal; radioactive material containment; fuel integrity protection; and radiation protection of the workers and the public. The solution for each requirement depends upon the type of fuel, as well as the philosophical criteria of the reactor design. For the PBMR, it involves a storage life of 80 years, passive cooling and bulk storage tanks. In addition to the basic requirements, the PBMR storage facility should also be able to store used fuel during reactor maintenance, and to transfer it back to the reactor or to another storage tank when required. During the four years of the development of the storage system, the design has undergone several changes. These changes were brought on by changes of the reactor design, and also due to developments and improvements on immature areas. The result is an integrated solution, retaining virtually none of the original concept, but still complying with all requirements. The containment design solution is a vertically suspended ASME VIII pressure vessel (or storage tank) with a loading point and an unloading device. All radioactive material is captured inside the pressure boundary, and the tank is completely sealed off when not in use. New devices were developed to systematically load the tank, and to remove the spheres from the tank. Scale tests were done to verify the performance of the new devices and to ensure proper sphere flow inside the tank. Sub-criticality of the fuel volume is achieved by adding hollow tubes to the inside of the storage tank, thereby creating a sub-critical geometry. Bum-up credit is also taken for the fuel at 20 % below the average core bum-up. The fuel is therefore passively safe even if the full contents of the reactor is transferred into a storage tank. In order to ensure that the tank lasts for 80 years in a cost-effective manner, the tanks are cooled in a closed loop system. The closed loop air is continuously dried to a very low relative humidity, which minimises corrosion on even normal carbon steel. Corrosion tests have been performed to investigate the effect of radiolysis products that may build up in the closed loop. These tests are still under way. The decay heat is removed from the fuel spheres by means of air convection around the tank surface. The tubes inside the tank also allow air to pass through, creating a very strong chimney effect. A new method was developed to calculate the fuel temperatures for a given cooling flow. The technique makes use of FEA and analytical equations. Solutions are obtained at a fraction of the time it takes to perform a full CFD analysis, and within 5 % compared to CFD results. Full-scale tests are planned to measure and verify the heat transfer properties of the cooling tubes in order to boost the credibility of the FEA and CFD analyses. The storage tank design is integrated into a storage unit, which performs all the nuclear functions. The storage unit can operate in four different cooling modes, namely closed loop active cooling; open loop passive cooling; open loop active cooling and closed loop conditioning. There is an automatic fallback from the active cooling mode to a passive cooling mode. The active cooling is thus only needed to prevent excessive corrosion of the tanks. A scale model has been built to demonstrate the passive cooling ability of a storage unit, and the results agree well with CFD analyses. Also, a new method was developed to calculate the passive cooling characteristics using pipe network simulation software. This method is significantly faster than CFD analyses, and allows one to easily incorporate fan characteristics and to perform sensitivity studies. Twelve storage units make up the Sphere Storage System of the PBMR. An intricate sphere pipe system allows one to transfer fuel spheres from the reactor to any tank, from any tank back to the reactor or to another tank, or to a decommissioning cask. All maintenance intensive components are placed at accessible areas, thus protecting the workers from the radiation coming from the tanks. Measures are incorporated to detect any contamination leakage, and also to enable the IAEA to verify the nuclear inventory of the storage system. The Sphere Storage System is a fully integrated, yet modular design that complies with all nuclear and process requirements. It presents a unique solution to the interim fuel storage of the PBMR, and is believed to be a cost-effective solution for 80 years of storage. Some future tests and developments are required to finalise immature areas, but overall, the system is sufficiently engineered such that detail design can continue. Doctora...|$|E

Pools are an especially practical and aesthetically appealing execution of a cooling system – provided appropriate temperature modes and external air temperature during the operational season. In centralised heat supply conditions, heat production companies choose to install cogeneration engines to increase energy production efficiency and profitability, allowing both electricity and heat to be produced from one type of fuel. However, the world at large has also seen trigeneration systems: such large urban areas as New York and Tokyo have long been using one type of fuel to produce electricity and, adjusting to weather patterns, either heat or cold energy. Of course, these enormous cities and their energy delivery patterns cannot be compared to those of small cities and rural towns which are common in the Baltic and CIS countries. Conversion of heat into cold energy takes place at heat absorption cooling facilities. Heat absorption facilities require a fluid overcooling cycle to store a concentrated fluid. The temperature modes of this cycle (which vary between producers) produce low-potential heat which cannot be reused to produce heat energy, e. g. 35 - 29 *C. To support such a temperature schedule, producers generally recommend installing heat evaporation towers, but they are expensive and will often clash visually with the landscape. A <b>cooling</b> <b>pool</b> may be used instead for both practical and aesthetic reasons, using water sprayers to promote evaporation. Water spraying is necessary to increase the surface area of water-to-air contact: this way, the surface area is equal to the combined areas of all water droplets. The depth of a pool must be no less than 1. 5 m, preventing heating by sun rays. Pool cooling properties improve with finer droplet size, although this carries higher electricity expenses to produce adequately high pressure before pulverisation. Such pools may use fountains which serve both as a cooling facility and an attractive landscaping piece. An evaporation pool is also significantly cheaper to build than an evaporation tower, although water loss may be higher. In consideration of the facts described above, a pool with a water spraying device was built for this research project. With appropriate air temperature, pressure and relative humidity, heat yield and yield changes were measured. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the research and experimental parts of the project to similar studies performed previously, in order to determine the practical viability of using heat evaporation pools as well as to develop a complete prototype which may be used as the basis for building similar structures...|$|E
50|$|Security {{measures}} in power plants fail. The {{equipment in the}} spent fuel buildings adjoining nuclear power plants that maintain the temperature level of the spent nuclear fuel rods will shut down. Spent nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants is generally stored in pools in on-site facilities. Because the fossil fuel powered back up, power generators will run out. At that time, the <b>cooling</b> <b>pools</b> that prevent the spent nuclear fuel from overheating will start to boil since this water is not replenished.|$|R
5000|$|Pacific salmon rely on {{near-shore}} waters and estuaries for survival during {{a part of}} their life cycle. Salmon use estuaries and near-shore areas for migration, juvenile rearing, refuge, and feeding. Large trees in rivers are no longer common. The Nisqually River was in pristine condition when it was layered with log jams. It turns out, logjams actually help salmon, partly by slowing the speed of the river and by creating <b>cool</b> <b>pools</b> and channels that are good places for adult and juvenile fish to hide, feed and spawn. [...] When 90% of wetlands were lost, 90% of salmon was also lost.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{extensive}} airborne expendable bathythermograph {{survey of}} the South China Sea (SCS) conducted in May 1995 and historical data are used to analyze and infer the upper layer (300 m) synoptic structure and general circulation. The primary thermal feature observed was a central SCS warm pool surrounded by several <b>cool</b> <b>pools.</b> The size of the warm pool decreased with depth from approximately 200, 000 km • at 50 m depth to about 70, 000 km • at 300 m depth. The maximum temperature of the warm pool was 30 øC, appearing near the surface. At the depth of 50 m, {{the temperature of the}} central SCS warm pool was 29 øC, and the temperature of the five surrounding <b>cool</b> <b>pools</b> ranged from 26 øC to 22 øC. A three-dimensional estimate of the absolute velocity field was obtained from the observed temperature field and a climatological salinity field using the/ • spiral method. Striking circulation features were the existence of dual anticyclonic eddies in the central SCS warm pool and the existence of cyclonic eddies associated with the coo! pools. In the upper layer the tangential velocity of the dual central SCS anticyclonic warm-core eddies is around 30 - 40 cm/s and that of the five cyclonic cool-core ddies varies from 10 cm/s to 40 cm/s. The tangential velocity of all the eddies decreased with depth. At 300 m depth, it became less than 5 cm/s for all the eddies. 1...|$|R
