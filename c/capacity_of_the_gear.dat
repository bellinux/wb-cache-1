40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for surface fatigue life of gear, pinion, or entire meshing gear train is given. The theory {{is based on}} a previous statistical approach for rolling-element bearings. Equations are presented which give the dynamic <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> set. The dynamic capacity is the transmitted tangential load which gives a 90 percent probability of survival of the gear set for one million pinion revolutions. The analytical results are compared with test data for a set of AISI 9310 spur gears operating at a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 billion N/sq m and 10, 000 rpm.

For low-strength materials such as flame-hardened steel, damage due to contact pressure is expected for all forms of gears and the greatest torque capacity was at a pressure angle of 45 °.

However, increasing the load bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> teeth, without increasing size, places stringent requirements upon metallurgy, dimensional control, and {{surface finish of}} the final products. In order to operate the mating parts near the upper bounds of their theoretical design envelope, manufacturing processes are required {{that are capable of}} improving the fatigue life and load bearing capacity of precision parts, while producing the required geometric accuracy. Results of the recent experimental studies indicate that the super finishing process is able to achieve these goals. This paper will review the results of our continuing evaluation of the super finish process as applied to aerospace gearing. Two separate evaluations were performed on gears {{to examine the effects of}} super finishing on resistance to both pitting and contact fatigue. For the reported experiments, both conventional and super finished test gears were simultaneously manufactured using the same process and the same heat lot of materials. This paper will also provide a brief description of the manufacturing technology used to achieve the results and will compare the results with other published data. In addition, this paper presents a couple of off-the-shelf manufacturing technologies that have been successfully used to super finish test specimens and will provide a glimpse of other emerging super finishing technologies.

First, a systematic methodology is developed for <b>the</b> dynamic analysis <b>of</b> <b>geared</b> robotic mechanisms. <b>The</b> formulation <b>of</b> dynamic equations is based on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> an equivalent open-loop chain. It is shown that reaction force analysis of such mechanisms can be efficiently carried out by a forward evaluation along its transmission lines followed by a backward evaluation along the equivalent open-loop chain. Then, two methodologies are developed for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>gearing</b> configuration and <b>gear</b> ratios. <b>The</b> first methodology considers the design from both kinematics and dynamics points of view. It is shown that, through proper choice of gear ratios, certain gear-coupled manipulators can be designed to possess kinematic isotropy and maximum acceleration capacity (KIMAC) conditions at a given reference point while individual-joint drive manipulators can not be designed to possess such conditions. <b>The</b> train values <b>of</b> those gear-coupled manipulators {{can be thought of as}} a product of two- stage <b>gear</b> reductions. <b>The</b> second-stage <b>gear</b> reduction is used to define the kinematic isotropic condition while <b>the</b> first- stage <b>gear</b> reduction is used to optimize the acceleration capacity.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{specific}} character <b>of</b> sphere-spatial motion {{used in the}} precessional transmissions makes impossible <b>the</b> utilization <b>of</b> involute profiles of classical teeth. This fact requires <b>the</b> elaboration <b>of</b> new non-standard profiles, which in conditions <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> sphere-spatial motion with an immovable point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite would assure constancy transfer function, <b>the</b> multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precessional <b>gear</b> and consequently high carrying <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precessional transmission in general...|$|R
40|$|The face {{load factor}} {{is a common}} {{coefficient}} used in gear design standards {{that takes into account}} <b>the</b> uneven distribution <b>of</b> load across <b>the</b> face width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> caused by <b>the</b> mesh misalignment. In this paper, a finite element model that includes <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding shafts is proposed. The results obtained from <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> finite element analysis to this model are compared with those obtained from application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISO Standard 6336 coefficient-based method (Method C). <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> shafts, <b>the</b> face width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> relative position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> over their shafts, the ratio between <b>the</b> pitch radii <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> and <b>the</b> radii <b>of</b> their shafts, and the relation between the mesh misalignment and the face load factor, have been investigated.

2500|$|<b>The</b> Sun <b>gear</b> is {{operated}} from the hand-operated crank (connected to <b>gear</b> a1, driving <b>the</b> large four-spoked mean sun gear, b1) {{and in turn}} drives <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> sets. <b>The</b> sun <b>gear</b> is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there {{may have been a}} second, [...] "true sun" [...] pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume <b>the</b> input rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> b1 <b>gear</b> <b>of</b> 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> named.|$|R
