40|$|International audienceHearing loss {{may lead}} to {{major changes in the}} social and {{emotional}} aspects of daily life. This follow-up study investigated the effect <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> use on emotional experience in adults with hearing impairment. Thirteen individuals with impaired hearing were tested before and after 6 months <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> use, and were compared with 19 individuals who had worn hearing aids for many years. The participants reported their daily emotional experiences, by completing questionnaires relating to sensory and social pleasure. After 6 months <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> use, individuals experienced more physical and social pleasure, whereas individuals using hearing aids {{for long periods of time}} reported similar levels of pleasure at the beginning and at the end of a 6 -month interval. The participants also performed a visual task, in which they rated the intensity of pleasure they experienced in response to emotionally positive and neutral pictures differing in luminance contrast. In this task, pleasure typically decreases with decreasing contrast of the positive images displayed. Once they had been fitted with hearing aids, the participants reported lower levels of pleasure, especially at low contrast. These findings highlight that the anhedonia scales provide a measure sensitive to emotional improvements that accompany the partial restoration of hearing function, although these scales were not specifically designed for hearing-impaired populations. In contrast, the surprising decrease in pleasure ratings for pictures after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> use may be because of the compensation of hearing loss by changes in visual attention functions...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{feedback}} {{is a problem}} in hearing aids that contain a substantial amount of gain, hearing aids that are used in conjunction with vented or open molds, and in-the-ear hearing aids. Acoustic {{feedback is}} both annoying and reduces the maximum usable gain <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> devices. This paper studies analytically the steady-state convergence behavior of LMS-based adaptive algorithms when operating in continuous adaptation to reduce acoustic feedback. A bias is found in the adaptive filter's estimate <b>of</b> the <b>hearing-aid</b> feedback path. A method for reducing this bias and producing an improved estimate of the feedback path is analyzed.

40|$|Acoustic {{feedback}} {{is a phenomenon}} that is both annoying to hearingaid users and reduces the maximum usable gain <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> devices. To avoid acoustic feedback, continuous adaptation systems have been proposed in the past. This paper studies analytically, for the first time, the steady-state convergence behavior of adaptive algorithms when operating in continuous adaptation to reduce acoustic feedback when delays {{are used in the}} cancellation path.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{identify}} epidemiological, socioeconomic, audiometric {{and environmental}} factors {{of success and failure}} <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> prescription, and to assess hearing-aid efficacy at 6 – 9 months after prescription. Patients and methodsA prospective nationwide survey was conducted in France on 184 patients with age-related hearing loss. Inclusion data were collected by a questionnaire filled out by the ENT specialist and patient, and with a second questionnaire filled out by telephone contact with the patient 6 – 9 months later. ResultsOne-third of patients failed to fulfill the prescription, either for financial reasons or for lack of interest in correcting their disability. For the other two-thirds, the factors favoring consultation with a hearing-aid fitting specialist seemed to be: leisure activity requiring good hearing, living in a couple or family, spontaneous initial ENT consultation, strong motivation, monthly income greater than € 1200, longstanding hearing impairment, and difficulty in listening to television and following a conversation in noise. Eighty percent <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> trials were successful; 60 % of prescriptions were thus followed by hearing-aid purchase. The main three criteria determining purchase were the advice <b>of</b> the <b>hearing-aid</b> fitting specialist, and the price and the effectiveness of the apparatus on trial. In the four daily life situations presented in the questionnaire, the hearing-aid was worn for 8 hours or more in 90 % of cases, found useful in 70 % and proved satisfactory in 70 %. Age-related hearing loss, whether metabolic or sensorineural, benefited from hearing-aid correction in 86 % of cases. ConclusionsIndications for hearing-aid prescription should take account of the patient's degree of motivation, awareness of disability, and income. The advice of the ENT and hearing-aid fitting specialists {{plays a key role in}} the patient's acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>hearing-aid.</b> Hearing-aids seem to enhance quality of life significantly in age-related hearing loss subjects...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A scoping review {{focused on}} {{background}} sounds and adult hearing-aid users, including aspects of aversiveness and interference. The {{aim was to}} establish the current body of knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest possible future directions for research. Design: Data were gathered using a systematic search strategy, consistent with scoping review methodology. Study sample: Searches of public databases between 1988 and 2014 returned 1182 published records. After exclusions for duplicates and out-of- scope works, 75 records remained for further analysis. Content {{analysis was used to}} group the records into five separate themes. Results: Content analysis indicated numerous themes relating to background sounds. Five broad emergent themes addressed the development and validation of outcome instruments, satisfaction surveys, assessments <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> technology and signal processing, acclimatization to the device post-fitting, and non-auditory influences on benefit and satisfaction. Conclusions: A large proportion <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> users still find particular hearing-aid features and attributes dissatisfying when listening in background sounds. Many conclusions are limited by methodological drawbacks in study design and too many different outcome instruments. Future research needs to address these issues, while controlling for hearing-aid fitting...|$|R
40|$|Objective: While the {{benefits}} of hearing aids among older adults with presbycusis have been well documented, there is limited research on hearing-aid usage. The aim of this review is to synthesize current evidence to identify the determinants <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> adoption and use among the elderly. Design: Systematic review. Study sample: Articles were identified through systematic searches in the Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and a manual search. Studies that explore the potential determinants <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> usage were to be included. Results: A total of twenty-two articles were reviewed. Four audiological determinants (the severity of hearing loss, the type of hearing aids, background noise acceptance, and insertion gain) and seven non-audiological determinants (self-perceived hearing problems, expectation, demographics, group consultation, support from significant others, self-perceived benefit, and satisfaction) were identified as affecting the adoption and use of hearing aids. Conclusions: There {{is a need to}} explore the influence of significant others, health professionals, and user demographics on hearing rehabilitation for future research.

40|$|Objectives: {{to observe}} and analyse the range and nature of {{behaviour}} change techniques (BCTs) employed by audiologists during hearing-aid fitting consultations to encourage and enable hearing-aid use. Design: non-participant observation and qualitative thematic analysis using the behaviour change technique taxonomy (version 1) (BCTTv 1). Study sample: Ten consultations across five English NHS audiology departments. Results: audiologists engage in behaviours to ensure the hearing-aid is fitted to prescription and is comfortable to wear. They provide information, equipment, and training in {{how to use a}} hearing-aid including changing batteries, cleaning, and maintenance. There is scope for audiologists to use additional BCTs: collaborating with patients to develop a behavioural plan for hearing-aid use that includes goal-setting, action-planning and problem-solving; involving significant others; providing information on the benefits <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> use or the consequences of non-use and giving advice about using prompts/cues for hearing-aid use. Conclusions: this observational study of audiologist behaviour in hearing-aid fitting consultations has identified opportunities to use additional behaviour change techniques that might encourage hearing-aid use.

This article presents a control procedure and evaluates its effectiveness. We increased the similarity <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> recordings in three steps and used both an objective quality metric and listening tests to investigate if the recordings from different hearing aids were perceptually similar. Neither was it sufficient to manually adjust the hearing-aid insertion gain, nor was it sufficient to add an additional bandwidth limitation to the recordings. Only after the application of an inverse filter the perceptual differences between recordings were removed adequately. It was possible to level the ground between different hearing devices, so to speak. This will allow future research to evaluate the sound quality of nonlinear signal processing feature...|$|R

40|$|Full text: Since the ultimative goal <b>of</b> <b>hearing-aid</b> {{development}} is the (subjective) judgment of the individual hearing-impaired listener, time-consuming tests with the end user are indispensable. However, time- and effort-saving objective methods to assess the potential benefit of different versions and parameter sets of hearing aid algorithms are gaining importance. This contribution reviews perception-model-based approaches to predict the hearing-impaired judgement and speech reception performance achieved with various noise reduction schemes. The perceptual similarity measure PSM evaluates the similarity between a tested condition and an "ideal" reference condition not on the physical level, but rather on the perceptual level at the output of a perception model for the individual hearing-impaired listener. The binaural extention of the SII approach uses a binaural preprocessing stage followed by a speech intelligibility index (SII) - based prediction scheme capable of predicting the relative benefit of binaural signal presentation and signal enhancement in complex spatial signal and noise source configurations. Both model-based schemes can be combined to assess the effect of noise reduction algorithms (such as adaptive beamformers) and to optimize their respective performance for different acoustical situations...|$|R
