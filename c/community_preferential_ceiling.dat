After {{accounting}} for size and distance effects, the Andean <b>Community</b> <b>preferential</b> trade agreements had a significant effect on both the differentiated and reference products, in particular capital intensive goods. In contrast, Mercosur preferential trade agreements only had a positive effect on the capital intensive subcategory of the reference products. ...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation {{and soil}} {{sampling}} were undertaken in 47 relevés {{in two different}} sites in Beni Bousera (northern Morocco), 32 relevés were on ultramafic sites (peridotite) and 15 were on adjacent non-ultramafic soils (mica-schist). Soil composition of exchangeable elements (nickel, calcium, magnesium, calcium : magnesium ratio, iron, copper) and physicochemical characteristics (e. g. pH, cation exchange capacity, conductivity, carbonate) were investigated and the species composition and cover were recorded. Although {{there was a significant}} difference between the two types of soil shown by Student’s t-test and principal component analysis, the ‘serpentine factor’ can be considered moderate on the basis of the observed heavy metal concentrations and of the related calcium : magnesium ratio. Correspondence and canonical analysis were used to detect the principal factors associated with gradients in species composition. This analysis showed a clear differentiation of vegetation among the plant <b>communities.</b> <b>Preferential</b> or strict serpentinophyte species were recognised, whereas no hyperaccumulator species have yet been found...|$|R
30|$|The Erdős- Rnyi model generates graphs {{that are}} lacking some {{important}} properties of real-world data, {{in particular the}} power law of the degree distribution [1]. Next we introduce a random graph generation model using a preferential attachment mechanism that generates a random graph in which degrees of each node are known. Our preferential attachment random graph generation model (PA model) {{is closely related to}} the modularity measurement that evaluates the community structure in a graph. Newman defines the modularity value as the difference of the actual number of edges and the expected number of edges of two communities [22]. The way of calculating the expected number of edges between two <b>communities</b> follows <b>preferential</b> attachment mechanism instead of using the Erdős- Rényi model. In the Erdős- Rényi model, each node is picked with the same probability. However, by the preferential attachment mechanism, the nodes with high degrees are picked with high probabilities. Thus an edge is more likely to link nodes with a high degree.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{philosophy}} and sociology of science have progressively stressed the non-neutral character of scientific knowledge and the social connotation of the scientific community. They have also questioned the fact that, as it takes on a tangible shape in laboratories, industries and institutions, science is {{a special kind of}} knowledge. Oddly enough, legal scholars have continued to have a more traditionally positivist vision of science. Starting with the origins of modern thought, the philosophical-political and legal disciplines saw the statute of science as having bases of neutrality and objectivity, which appeared irremediably lacking in political and legal systems. From the logical constructions of legal scholars to the political use which conceptions of a liberal matrix have made of the ideal of the ‘republic of science’ - the level of democracy intrinsic to the scientific <b>community</b> - the <b>preferential</b> possibility which scientific method has offered social sciences to emancipate themselves from value judgements and subjective opinions has been widely explored...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{exercise}} efficient emergency management, states susceptible to wildfires have collaborated {{to develop the}} Firewise Communities USA Recognition Program. The Firewise Communities Program focuses on reducing {{the loss of life}} and property, in terms of wildfires, by providing resources to allow communities to build responsibly in natural surroundings and assist one another in preparing for as well as recovering from wildfire. Communities enrolled in the Firewise Communities Program are bound to mitigation guidelines, which require firewise communities to develop and implement action plans to make properties safer from wildfire. Firewise communities organize community members in scheduled meetings to connect citizens to fire fighters, wildfire researchers, and state forestry personnel to educate citizens in terms of wildfire risks. Thereby, informing citizens of risk factors for the development of wildfires and how to prevent as well as prepare for a wildfire. In terms of recovery, firewise <b>communities</b> receive <b>preferential</b> treatment and tend to acquire additional resources and emergency assistance after a wildfire. To be eligible for a membership in the FireWise Communities Program, a community must verify susceptibility to wildfire by acquiring a wildfire risk assessment from the local fire department or forest service. Then, the community must form a firewise committee and action plan as well as contribute two dollars per capita toward firewise activities. Finally, the community submits a membership application to a firewise associate to be considered for recognition as a firewise community. There are currently 40 states with communities recognized as members of the Firewise Communities Program, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and North Carolina.|$|R
40|$|A {{gene for}} a {{recessive}} form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD 2 A) has been localized to chromosome 15. A physical {{map of the}} 7 -cM candidate 15 q 15. 1 -q 21. 1 region has been constructed {{by means of a}} 10 – 12 -Mb continuum of overlapping YAC clones. New microsatellite markers developed from these YACs were genotyped on large, consanguineous LGMD 2 A pedigrees from different origins. The identification of recombination events in these families allowed the restriction of the LGMD 2 A region to an estimated 1 -cM interval, equivalent to ∼ 3 – 4 Mb. Linkage disequilibrium data on genetic isolates from the island of Réunion and from the Amish <b>community</b> suggest a <b>preferential</b> location of the LGMD 2 A gene in the proximal part of this region. Analysis of the interrelated pedigrees from Réunion revealed the existence of at least six different carrier haplotypes. This allelic heterogeneity is incompatible with the presumed existence of a founder effect and suggests that multiple LGMD 2 A mutations may segregate in this population...|$|R
40|$|As a {{representation}} of relational data over time series, longitudinal networks provide opportunities to study link formation processes. However, networks at scale often exhibits community structure (i. e. clustering), which may confound local structural effects {{if it is not}} considered appropriately in statistical analysis. To infer the (possibly) evolving clusters and other network structures (e. g. degree distribution and/or transitivity) within each community, simultaneously, we propose a class of statistical models named Temporal Hierarchical Exponential Random Graph Models (THERGM). Our generative model imposes a Markovian transition matrix for nodes to change their membership, and assumes they join new <b>community</b> in a <b>preferential</b> attachment way. For those remaining in the same cluster, they follow a specific temporal ERG model (TERGM). While a direct MCMC based Bayesian estimation is computational infeasible, we propose a two-stage strategy. At the first stage, a specific dynamic latent space model will be used as the working model for clustering. At the second stage, estimated memberships are taken as given to fit a TERG model in each cluster. We evaluate our methods on simulated data in terms of the mis-clustering rate, as well as the goodness of fit and link prediction accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Non-native herbivores may alter plant <b>communities</b> {{through their}} <b>preferential</b> {{consumption}} of seedlings of different species. We assessed seedling herbivory by two invasive gastropod species in Hawaii, the giant African snail (Achatina fulica) and the Cuban brown slug (Veronicella cubensis). We hypothesized that six native species would suffer greater gastropod herbivory than four non-native species, and that species with short stature, thin leaves, and lacking physical defenses would suffer the greatest mortality from gastropods. Herbivory was measured during 13 -day preference trials using enclosures that each contained four different woody species (two native, two non-native) and {{were assigned to}} one of three treatments: giant African snail, Cuban brown slug, or control (no gastropod). Discriminant function analysis was used to predict gastropod-induced seedling mortality from a suite of seedling characteristics. Native species did not always experience greater herbivory than non-natives species, and seedling mortality was 0 – 100 %. Native Pipturus albidus and Clermontia parviflora suffered 100 % mortality from V. cubensis herbivory, and P. albidus, Psychotria hawaiiensis, and Myrsine lessertiana suffered C 80 % mortality from A. fulica. Two non-natives (Fraxinus uhdei, Clidemia hirta), and two natives (Metrosideros polymorpha, Diospyros sandwicensis), suffered little damage and no mortality. Non-native Ardisia elliptica suffered 10 – 30 %gastropod mortality, and non-native Psidium cattleianum mortality was 0 – 50 %. Leaf thickness best predicted species mortality caused by slugs and snails; some thicker-leaved species suffered most. Invasive snails and slugs threaten some native and non-native seedlings by directly consuming them. Current and future plant community structure in Hawaii may in part reflect the feeding preferences of invasive gastropods...|$|R
40|$|Shifting {{markets can}} cause unexpected, {{stochastic}} changes in rural landscapes {{that may take}} local <b>communities</b> by surprise. <b>Preferential</b> siting of new industrial facilities in poor areas or in areas with few regulatory restrictions can have implications for environmental sustainability, human health, and social justice. This study focuses on frac sand mining— the mining of high-quality silica sand used in hydraulic fracturing processes for gas and oil extraction. Frac sand mining gained prominence in the 2000 s in the upper midwestern United States where nonmetallic mining is regulated primarily by local zoning. I asked whether frac sand mines were more commonly sited in rural townships without formal zon-ing regulations or planning processes than in those that undertook zoning and planning before the frac sand boom. I also asked if mine prevalence was correlated with socioeco-nomic differences across townships. After creating a probability surface to map areas most suitable for frac sand mine occurrence, I developed neutral landscape models from which to compare actual mine distributions in zoned and unzoned areas at three different spatial extents. Mines were significantly clustered in unzoned jurisdictions at the statewide level and in 7 of the 8 counties with at least three frac sand mines and some unzoned land. Sub-sequent regression analyses showed mine prevalence to be uncorrelated with land value, tax rate, or per capita income, but correlated with remoteness and zoning. The predicted mine count in unzoned townships was over two times higher than that in zoned townships. However, the county with the most mines by far was under a county zoning ordinance, per-haps indicating industry preferences for locations with clear, homogenous rules over patch-work regulation. Rural communities can use the case of frac sand mining as motivation to discuss and plan for sudden land-use predicaments, rather than wait to grapple with unfa-miliar legal processes {{during a period of}} intense conflict...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the soil organic status (SOS) on the {{dynamics}} and impact of a copper contamination was investigated in a coupled field and mesocosm study with a loamy vineyard soil that had been amended with conifer compost (CC) or not amended (NA) during a previous long-term field experiment. Soil mesocosms were contaminated at 240 mg Cu kg- 1 and incubated for 24 months. Cu distribution and dynamics were assessed in the solid matrix at the microscale by size fractionation of soils and in the soil solution by measuring total and free exchangeable copper concentrations (Cu 2 +). Copper bioavailability, CuBio, was also measured with a whole-cell biosensor. The impact of copper on soil bacterial community was evaluated through the monitoring {{of the amount of}} copper-resistant bacteria and through the variations in bacterial community structure using ARISA (Automated-Ribosomal-Intergenic-Spacer-Analysis). Results showed that copper distribution, speciation and bioavailability are strongly different in the NA and CC soils, demonstrating that the organic status of soils largely controls the solid and liquid speciation of copper as well as its availability to microorganisms. Cu was shown to be dominantly distributed in the smallest size fractions (250 µm) of the CC soil. The coarser and finest size fractions of the soil are also the ones that release more Cu 2 + and CuBio, explaining thus the important amount of Cu-resistant bacteria inhabiting these fractions and the differentiated temporal impact on the structure of soil bacterial community. The distribution of cultivable bacteria varied strongly between the two soils and was found to be well correlated with the distribution of added OM that controls thus bacterial <b>community</b> structure. The <b>preferential</b> impacts of copper observed in the smallest size fractions of the non amended soil demonstrate that copper toxicity and impact is also controlled by the reactivity of the soil fractions. This reactivity controls especially the release and the liquid speciation of Cu and thus bacteria-metal contact. A clear relationship between copper speciation, bioavailability, distribution and impact was established in the present study and will permit better predicting the fate and impact of metals in soils, by accounting for microscale control of metal impac...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the economy of Hungary. The paper highlights that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976 – 80), actual growth rates for almost all major plan aggregates remained below the targets. The lower targets set for the increase in both consumption and investment in the 1976 – 80 plan relative to the rates achieved during 1971 – 75, reflected the government’s policy of moderating the growth of domestic demand. The actual average annual growth rate for investment closely approximated, whereas that of private consumption fell far short of the plan targets.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the legal regime of {{provision}} of services in the EU Market by Non-EU Providers. This {{is one of the more}} neglected topic for what concerns the liberalization of services in the EU Internal Market, mainly because of the co-existence of various norms regulating the issue, with very different sources. The essay analyzes in a coherent framework those norms, at the three relevant levels of a) Treaty of European <b>Community,</b> b) EU <b>Preferential</b> Trade Agreements, c) GATS. The starting point is the study of EU norms that define - on the “subjective” side - the field of application of EU Freedom to provide services, with the conditions of EU citizenship (or nationality for legal persons) and of the establishment in one of the EU Member States. This issue is examined mainly focusing on the freedom that pertains to Companies owned by non-EU citizens and incorporated in accordance with the law of a Member State and owing an effective link with the economy of one EU Member State (paras 2 - 5). Moreover, the research deals with Regional Trade Agreements of the EU with Third Parties, that provide for a trade liberalization on a conventional basis (see art. XXIV GATT). Those EU Agreements could be a basis for preferential treatment in the field of services, consistently with art. V GATS, but there are clear signs of EU's reluctance to conclude treaties at a bilateral level for the liberalization of trade in services (paras 6 - 7). Due to the lack of relevant EU preferential agreements in the field of Services, the legal regime for non-EU service providers is fundamentally governed by the GATS Agreement, in the framework of the World Trade Organization. The final part of the essay is devoted to the Commitments taken by the EU at the multilateral level of the GATS. The analysis of those Commitments leads to interesting considerations: the most important Commitments (and their limits) are still decided by EU Member States uti singuli, with different degrees of attitude to trade liberalization concerning services. This is a clear reflex of the persisting lack of achievement of a Single Market in services; furthermore, another interesting topic is the lack of relevant EU Commitments in the most sensitive ambits, that are “public services” and movement of natural persons providing services (paras 8 - 9) ...|$|R
