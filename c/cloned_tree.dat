The experimental {{results showed that the}} <b>clone</b> <b>tree</b> requires milder cooking conditions and exhibits higher pulp yield. The pulp fibres obtained from the clone have higher fibre length and fibre width and lower coarseness, which give higher fibre flexibility and collapsibility. In consequence, structural, mechanical and optical properties of paper are significantly different. In addition, we observed that the fibres from the <b>clone</b> <b>tree</b> are weaker than the corresponding fibres from the industrial sample...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the stock}} of 'Bramley's Seedling' commercially {{available}} is slightly different in its growth habit and other characteristics from the original tree, probably because of a chance mutation (or mutations) that occurred unnoticed over the years. Plants produced from the still-surviving (then 180-year-old) tree by tissue culture in 1990 {{have proved to be}} much more compact and free-branching than the widely available commercial stock. The cloning work was done by scientists at the University of Nottingham, because the original tree was suffering from old age and was under attack by honey fungus.

40|$|For many years, {{breeding}} of Pinus radiata for structural wood relied on improving basic density assessed at age 7 or 8 years old, with little progress. Current efforts {{have moved to}} acoustic screening for stiffness at similar age. Breeding cycles are still too long. An alternative is to screen out the worst trees even earlier: shorter breeding cycles should outweigh the lower accuracy due to early selection. Besides genetic effects, {{there is also evidence}} that wood stiffness is affected by wind, particularly for stands with low stocking and trees in forest margins. A glasshouse experiment was setup for early selection considering two factors: <b>tree</b> position and <b>clone.</b> <b>Tree</b> positions were straight (control), leaning (30 ° from the vertical) and rocked (15 minutes every hour, simulating 10 km h- 1 wind). Four clones were used covering a range of wood stiffness and replication was 12 plants per treatment.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{growth rates}} among mature interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) trees showing resistance or susceptibility to defoliation caused by {{western spruce budworm}} (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman), and among clones and half-sib seedling progeny of these trees in a greenhouse. We also investigated bud burst phenology and photosynthetic responses of clones to budworm defoliation in greenhouse experiments. Resistant mature trees had a higher radial growth rate than susceptible trees, especially during periods of budworm defoliation. <b>Clones</b> from resistant <b>trees</b> grew larger crowns than <b>clones</b> from susceptible <b>trees,</b> whereas stem base diameter at the ground line and height did not differ. Half-sib seedling progeny from resistant trees had larger stem diameter, height, and total biomass than progeny from susceptible trees. Mean 5 -year radial growth increment of mature trees was more strongly correlated with growth of seedlings than with growth of clones. <b>Clones</b> from resistant <b>trees</b> had later bud burst than <b>clones</b> from susceptible <b>trees,</b> and budworm defoliation of clones depended {{on the degree of}} synchrony between bud burst phenology and budworm larval feeding. Clones of resistant and susceptible mature trees showed similar responses of net photosynthetic rate to 2 years of budworm defoliation. We conclude that phenotypic differences in crown condition of Douglas-fir trees following western spruce budworm defoliation are influenced by tree genotype and that high growth rate and late bud burst phenology promote tree resistance to budworm defoliation...|$|R

40|$|Comparative genomic {{hybridization}} {{studies have}} revealed elevated copy number (CN) at the reticulocyte-binding protein 1 gene (PfRh 1) in fast growing lab-adapted parasites, while genetic manipulation demonstrates a causal link between cell invasion and PfRh 1 CN. We therefore examined PfRh 1 copy number variation (CNV) in 202 single clone parasite isolates from four countries {{to quantify the}} extent of CNV within natural populations. Surprisingly, we found that no natural parasite infections showed elevated CN. In contrast, 4 / 28 independent laboratory reference strains show elevated CN. One possibility is that amplification of PfRh 1 (or neighboring loci) is selected during laboratory culture. In the case of FCR 3 group of parasites, <b>clone</b> <b>trees</b> show that PfRh 1 amplification arose in laboratory lines following establishment in culture. These data show that CNV at PfRh 1 is rare or non-existent in natural populations, but can arise during laboratory propagation. We conclude that PfRh 1 CNV is not an important determinant of gene expression, cell invasion or growth rate in natural parasite populations...|$|R

40|$|The initiation, progression, {{and natural}} {{variation}} of autumn senescence in European aspen (Populus tremula) was investigated by monitoring chlorophyll degradation in (1) trees growing in natural stands and (2) <b>cloned</b> <b>trees</b> growing in a greenhouse under various light regimes. The main trigger for {{the initiation of}} autumn senescence in aspen is the shortening photoperiod, {{but there was a}} large degree of variation in the onset of senescence, both within local populations and among trees originating from different populations, where it correlated with the latitude of their respective origins. The variation for onset of senescence with a population was much larger than the variation of bud set. Once started, autumn senescence was accelerated by low temperature and longer nights, and clones that started to senescence late had a faster senescence. Bud set and autumn senescence appeared to be under the control of two independent critical photoperiods, but senescence could not be initiated until a certain time after bud set, suggesting that bud set and growth arrest are important for the trees to acquire competence to respond to the photoperiodic trigger to undergo autumn senescence. A timetable of events related to bud set and autumn senescence is presented...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) crop may {{accumulate}} {{significant amounts}} of carbon either in biomass or in the soil. However, a comprehensive understanding of {{the potential of the}} C stock among different rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clones</b> is still distant, since clones are typically developed to exhibit other traits, such as better yield and disease tolerance. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} address differences among different areas planted to rubber clones. We hypothesized that different rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clones,</b> developed to adapt to different environmental and biological constrains, diverge in terms of soil and plant biomass C stocks. Clones were compared in respect to soil C stocks at four soil depths and the total depth (0. 00 - 0. 05, 0. 05 - 0. 10, 0. 10 - 0. 20, 0. 20 - 0. 40, and 0. 00 - 0. 40 m), and in the different compartments of the tree biomass. Five different plantings of rubber clones (FX 3864, FDR 5788, PMB 1, MDX 624, and CDC 312) of seven years of age were compared, which were established in a randomized block design in the experimental field in Rio de Janeiro State. No difference was observed among plantings of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clones</b> in regard to soil C stocks, even considering the total stock from 0. 00 - 0. 40 m depth. However, the rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clones</b> were different from each other in terms of total plant C stocks, and this contrast was predominately due to only one component of the total C stock, tree biomass. For biomass C stock, the MDX 624 rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clone</b> was superior to other clones, and the stem was the biomass component which most accounted for total C biomass. The contrast among rubber clones in terms of C stock is mainly due to the biomass C stock; the aboveground (tree biomass) and the belowground (soil) compartments contributed differently to the total C stock, 36. 2 and 63. 8 %, respectively. Rubber trees did not differ in relation to C stocks in the soil, but the right choice of a rubber clone is a reliable approach for sequestering C from the air in the biomass of trees...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of Grafting {{for three}} Gathered Fruit Species of Sahelo-Sudanese Areas: Balanites aegyptaica, Detarium senegalense and Tamarindus indica. Balanites aegyptiaca, Detarium senegalense and Tamarindus indica are three forest species {{producing}} fruits traditionally picked and much enjoyed by Sahelo-Sudanese populations. They consume the pulp either fresh or transformed into drinks. To {{struggle against the}} diminishing resources of gathered fruits {{as well as the}} genetic erosion, a domestication program is being carried out in Senegal. It aims at selecting and <b>cloning</b> <b>trees</b> of a superior phenotype before introducing them into local populations. Some tests have been tried out so as to develop and optimise techniques of grafting adapted to theses species. The tested factors have been the age of the source plants, the time for grafting, as well as the type of graft. The best dates to graft have been defined as follows: end of dry season for D. senegalense, during rainy season for B. aegyptiaca, beginning of dry season for T. indica. For these three species the apical grafts (cleft graft and splice graft) gave better results than other types. A narrow relationship has been established between the survival percentage of juvenile and mature materials. However, the development of these techniques is not to be taken into consideration without the preliminary application of protocols concerning the rejuvenation of mature material...|$|R
40|$|Resistance {{of rubber}} <b>tree</b> <b>clones</b> to South American Leaf Blight (SALB) {{caused by the}} fungus Microcyclus ulei is {{normally}} assessed in specific large-scale clone trials, which in general entail {{a considerable amount of}} work. Four variables are observed monthly on each tree over many years: disease severity and conidial sporulation intensity on young leaves, and severity and stroma density on mature leaves. In order to simplify this field assessment method, we tested the resistance of eight rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clones</b> to M. ulei in Ecuador in a Fisher block design with four replicates per treatment. Three months after planting, monthly observations were made for a period of 12 months on the foliage focusing on the four variables, in order to quantify disease development. Given the correlations between the four variables, assessment of conidial sporulation intensity on young leaves and stroma density on mature leaves should be sufficient. The most suitable period to start the assessment was 6 months after planting, for a duration of six to nine months. As repeated observations on the same trees were autocorrelated, it was possible to reduce the assessment frequency to once every 2 months. To conclude, assessing the resistance of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>clones</b> to SALB in large-scale clone trials can be optimized {{to reduce the number of}} observation times by 50 %.
