40|$|One of the poorly {{understood}} impacts of a <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> cut {{is that there}} is little benefit to domestic investors because the way that <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> payments are credited against the tax payable by Australian owners of companies. The system of crediting <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> paid against the income tax liability of shareholders is known as 2 ̆ 7 dividend imputation 2 ̆ 7. Under dividend imputation <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> is treated as a pre-payment of the tax ultimately payable by the domestic owner of the company. The domestic owner has to pay personal income tax according to the normal <b>tax</b> scale. But <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> paid before dividends are distributed is treated as an offset against any personal tax liability. Any saving from a <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> cut is nullified by a reduction in the offset received by the domestic investor. Hence a cut in the <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> rate from 30 per cent (28. 5 per cent for small business) to 25 per cent increases the amount available for the company to pay out in dividends but reduces the franking credits that domestic taxpayers can apply against their personal tax liability. There is, however, one important exception to this rule. The tax offsets (franking credits) can only be used to reduce tax payable to the Australian government and, in turn, are worthless to foreign owners of Australian companies. Put another way, the only potential beneficiaries of a cut to the Australian <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> rate are foreign shareholders...|$|R

25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> rate divided by (1 - <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|R

At its appraisal in 1989, it was to cost $167 million USD (2011) and after another redesign in 2005, that cost rose to $935 million USD (2011). Currently costs have risen to $2.89 billion USD (2011). The project is being constructed {{under the supervision of}} the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and funding is being achieved through the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower <b>Company,</b> <b>taxes,</b> bond offerings, Middle Eastern and Chinese banks. WAPDA has successfully secured loans from a consortium of Chinese banks and from Middle East. Tunnel-boring machines (TBM) were brought to help speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels. They became operational in February 2013. [...] The project was 66 percent complete as of August 2013 while at the same time the diversion tunnel was 75 percent complete. US$475 million in funding was still not secured by the Economic Affairs Division at that time. In mid-2014 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the construction site and expressed the hope that at least one generator would be operational by mid-2015. On 24 December 2014 a wall near the diversion tunnel's intake collapsed, killing four workers including a Chinese engineer. On November 05, 2016, the project entered into terminal phase with 100 percent perfect design while achieving 85.5 percent progress and is heading towards completion despite all delays in release of funds, weather conditions, non-availability of power during early stage of construction and delays in land acquisition.|$|E

Since then, the debate has effectively shown that there is nothing in it that would increase the incentive to invest. This reflects the role of dividend imputation which acts like a withholding tax for dividend recipients. That means that any cut in <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> would thereby reduce the amount withheld on behalf of dividend recipients and so increase the amount shareholders will have to ‘top up’ at tax time. These arguments do not apply to foreigners who will unambiguously benefit from Australian <b>company</b> <b>tax</b> cuts.

We identify three causes for different strategies: political institutions, preferences for redistribution and equality, and the position in globalisation and growth. Small countries, high growth rates, and federal structure with high tax autonomy stand for countries with lower tax burdens, especially on companies. Large countries, representative democracies with coalitions, and a high preference for redistribution are likely to induce higher tax burdens.

40|$|The 'double taxation' of {{corporate}} income {{is often used}} as an argument {{in support of the}} integration of company and shareholder taxes, as occurred with the introduction of tax imputation in 1987 in Australia. These arguments are based, often implicity, on the premise that the economic incidence of <b>company</b> <b>taxes</b> falls on shareholders receiving dividend income. However, a review of the available theoretical and empirical literature fails to provide an unambiguous answer to the corporate income tax incidence question. Empirical results presented in this paper suggest the existence of significant forward shifting of the tax in to consumers though higher prices in the case of Australian manufacturing corporations. A more informed discussion of tax reform must therefore consider more carefully the implications arising from the likely existence of significant forward shifting if the corporate income tax.

The mean value of the tax rate elasticity in the literature is around 3. 3, i. e. a 1 %-point reduction in the host-country tax rate raises foreign direct investment in that country by 3. 3 %. There exists substantial variation across studies, however. By performing a meta analysis, the paper aims to explain this variation by the differences in characteristics of the underlying studies. Systematic differences between studies are found with respect to the type of foreign capital data used, and the type of tax rates adopted. We find no systematic differences in the responsiveness of investors from tax credit countries and tax exemption countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{enterprise}} {{is a natural}} outcome of capitalism {{in the course of}} economic development. The underwriter firms and banks etc. initially meet the capital requirements of such enterprise. Later on it is the stock exchange that carries out redistribution of shares of the enterprise. Corporate decisions on capital structure policy have long been a subject of debate and still remain an unresolved issue. The traditional view of capital structure was that it results in the weighted average cost of capital being U-shaped, which means that there exists as an optimal mix between debt and equity, at which point a firm’s value is maximised. However, Modigliani-Miller (1958), in a world of no tax and no financial distress, proved that capital structure is irrelevant to explaining firm values. When <b>company</b> <b>taxes</b> are considered, the benefits from tax shield leads Modigliani-Miller (1963) to conclude that the value maximising capital structure is extreme leverage. In a subsequent paper Miller (1977), by introducing both corporate tax and personal taxes into the model, points towards irrelevance of capital structure for any particular firm. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} literature provides evidence for an impact of <b>company</b> <b>taxes</b> on investments. Practitioners, however, have a skeptical {{view on the}} meaning of this effect. This paper builds the bridge between research and the interested practice by providing detailed descriptives and clearly showing how the effects are derived.

Starting from the analysis of the basic tax effect, the paper also covers current research topics when analyzing the impact of existing loss carryforwards and when tracing holding structures. The descriptive statistics already show that cross-border investments have increased strongly. The development of Baden-W mainly corresponds to that of Germany. The impact of taxation on investments is negative. A ten percentage points higher corporate tax rate leads to about five percent lower investments, measured by fixed assets. This effect is smaller for those companies which show loss carryforwards.
