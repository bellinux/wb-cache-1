25|$|In {{light of}} the fact that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and {{exhibited}} with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery, introduced to Picasso by Max Jacob and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire), and in view of the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's Bathers was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike Albert Gleizes), his intention was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or visa versa). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own lived experience.|$|E

2500|$|... "Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946) {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} figure in the history of visual arts in America. That is <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say that he was the greatest artist America has ever produced. Rather, through his many roles – as a photographer, as a discoverer and promoter of photographers and of artists in other media, and as a publisher, patron, and collector – he had a greater impact on American art than any other person has had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ahad Ha'am's {{influence}} in the political realm can be ascribed to his charismatic personality and spiritual authority rather than his official functions. For the [...] "Democratic Faction", the party that propagated cultural Zionism (founded in 1901 by Chaim Weizmann), he served [...] "as a symbol for the movement's culturalists, the faction's most coherent totem. He was, however, not – <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent to which}} members of this group, especially Chaim Weizmann, would later contend – its chief ideological influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "To {{whom are}} these [...] useful? <b>Certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> all men. There are {{conditions}} {{of life to}} which they must be forever estranged, and there are epochs of life, too, after which the endeavor to attain them {{would be a great}} misemployment of time. Their acquisition should be the occupation of our early years only, when the memory is susceptible of deep and lasting impressions, and reason and judgment not yet strong enough for abstract speculations."—Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819.

2500|$|Considering {{the losses}} that both teams had sustained, {{it was only}} natural that many felt this series was merely a battle for Test cricket's Wooden spoon. [...] Australia had managed a tie in Madras and many {{commentators}} felt that Australia's batting had strengthened somewhat. The performances of Victorian batsmen Dean Jones and the new opening pair of David Boon and Geoff Marsh had been noted. Young NSW all-rounder, Stephen Waugh, was also beginning to make his presence felt, although <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the level that many expected him. The bowling was still problematic, although Bruce Reid had begun to perform well.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{much remains}} of the Medici Bank's records; {{mentions}} of it and its activities are rife {{in the writings of}} outsiders, but outsiders necessarily had little access to the balance books which could truly {{tell the story of the}} bank's rise and fall, and <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the confidential business correspondence and the secret books. Some of the most copious documentation, derived from archived tax records such as the [...] records, are largely useless since the various principals of the bank were not above flagrantly lying to the taxman.

2500|$|At first, [...] Indonesian Armed Forces {{started out}} as the BKR (Badan Keamanan Rakyat – People's Security Agency), which was formed in the 3rd PPKI meeting, on August 29, 1945; this was an {{organisation}} of militias in a united nationwide force to ensure the security remained intact across the newly declared independent Indonesia; it was created more as a civil defence force than an armed forces. The decision to create a [...] "security agency" [...] and not an army, was taken to lessen the probability of the allied forces viewing it as an armed revolution and invading in full force. During their capitulation, one {{of the terms of}} surrender to Japan was to return the Asian domains they had conquered to the previous nation of the Allies, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> liberate them independently.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Britain's {{greatest}} {{houses have}} frequently been {{open to the}} paying public. Well-heeled visitors could knock {{on the front door}} and a senior servant would give a guided tour for a small remuneration. In the early 19th century, Jane Austen records such a trip in chapter 43 of , where Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle are given a guided tour of Mr Darcy's Pemberley by the housekeeper. Later in the century, on days when Belvoir Castle was open to the public, the 7th Duke of Rutland was reported by his granddaughter, the socialite Lady Diana, to assume a [...] "look of pleasure and welcome." [...] Here and elsewhere, however, that welcome did not extend to a tea room and <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> chimpanzees swinging through the shrubbery; that was all to come over 50 years later. At this time, admittance was granted in patrician fashion with all proceeds usually donated to a local charity.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the same}} reason that humans excel at {{additive}} operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations: [...] "if two machines each individually produce a [...] level of, say, 90dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93dB, but <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> 180dB!" [...] "suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83dBA. ... the machine noise [...] may be obtained by 'subtracting' the 83dBA background noise from the combined level of 87dBA; i.e., 84.8dBA." [...] "in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated. (...)
