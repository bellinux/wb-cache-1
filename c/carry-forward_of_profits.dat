Seventeen medical and nursing students from two different universities participated in the study.

Three themes emerged from the data: the great divide, learning means content, and breaking the ice. The findings suggest that the experience of interprofessional collaboration within learning events is influenced by the natural clustering of shared interests among students.

2500|$|As {{regards the}} first criticism, the Japanese {{economist}} Nobuo Okishio (see Okishio's theorem) famously argued, [...] "if the newly introduced technique satisfies the cost criterion [...] {{and the rate}} of real wage remains constant", then the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> must increase. Assuming constant real wages, technical change would lower the production cost per unit, thereby raising the innovator's rate <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> The price <b>of</b> output would fall, and this would cause the other capitalists' costs to fall also. The new (equilibrium) rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> would therefore have to rise. By implication, the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> could in that case fall, only if real wages rose in response to higher productivity, squeezing profits. This theory is sometimes called neo-Ricardian, because David Ricardo also claimed that a fall in the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> can only be brought about by rising wages.|$|R
2500|$|However, Sraffa {{then pointed}} out that this {{accurate}} measuring technique still involved the rate of profit: the amount of capital depended on the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> This reversed the direction of causality that neoclassical economics assumed between the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> {{and the amount of}} capital. Further, Sraffa showed that a change in the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> would change the measured amount of capital, and in highly nonlinear ways: an increase in the rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> might initially increase the perceived value of the truck more than the laser, but then reverse the effect at still higher rates <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> See [...] "Reswitching" [...] below. The analysis further implies that a more intensive use of a factor of production, including other factors than capital, may be associated with a higher, not lower price, of that factor.|$|R

Laibman claimed {{that if there is}} any depreciation or premature scrapping of old, less productive, fixed capital: (1) productivity will increase, which will cause the temporally determined value rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> to rise; (2) this value rate <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> will therefore [...] "converge toward" [...] Okishio's material rate of profit; and thus (3) this value rate [...] "is governed by" [...] the material rate <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|R
