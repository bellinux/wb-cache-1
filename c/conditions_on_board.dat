5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him not guilty of personally killing anyone and not guilty of overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for the dreadful <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

He spent seven years reforming the Naval Department, altering laws and reorganizing training of recruits, and successfully managed to transform the previous, often-grim <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> most vessels to meet modern standards and expectations. Corporal punishment was abolished in 1863 and the traditional system of naval recruitment was drastically altered.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{a number}} of European {{countries}} agreed in The Hague on a memorandum that agreed to audit whether the labour <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> vessels were {{according to the rules}} of the ILO. After the Amoco Cadiz sank that year, it was decided to also audit on safety and pollution. To this end, in 1982 the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (Paris MoU) was agreed upon, establishing Port State Control, nowadays consisting of 24 European countries and Canada. In practice, this was a reaction on the failure of the flag states - especially flags of convenience that have delegated their task to classification societies - to comply with their inspection duties.|$|E

30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been made on the {{relationships}} between cyclic boil-dry treatment and board properties [6 – 8], but very few have detailed the effects of water-soaking <b>condition</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> properties. For example, when we compare 2  h water soaking at 70  °C (A test in JIS) and 2  h water soaking at 100  °C (B test in JIS), obviously the latter is more severe than the former, decreasing the latter properties more than the former [4]. Comparing 6  h water soaking at 70  °C with 2  h water soaking at 100  °C, {{it is very difficult}} to predict which condition decreases the board properties. In order to develop an optimum accelerated aging test, it is paramount to determine the effects of soaking temperature and time <b>on</b> <b>board</b> properties. Thereby, the purpose of this study is to clarify the roles played by soaking temperature and time.|$|R

25|$|James only in late August seriously {{began to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a Dutch invasion and then overestimated the size of the naval force the Dutch would bring against him. He assumed they would equip their full battle fleet, which he himself would be unable to match for financial reasons: in October about thirty English ships-of-the-line had been assembled, all third rates or fourth rates, while heavier vessels remained laid up. Fearing a surprise attack, he declined to position this fleet at The Downs, for striking into the southern North Sea or the Channel the most convenient location, but also a very vulnerable one. When Admiral George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth decided to place his fleet at the Gunfleet near the Medway, in a rather withdrawn location, James therefore merely suggested to bring the fleet farther out, though he well understood it otherwise risked becoming locked up in the Thames estuary by the same easterly wind that would allow the Dutch to cross. This was influenced by his belief the Dutch might well attack France instead and his expectation that they would first seek a naval victory before daring to invade – and that it thus would be advantageous to refuse battle. Indeed, it had originally been the Dutch intention to defeat the English first to free the way for the transport fleet – though they too, to lower the cost of the invasion, had not activated any heavier ships – but because it was now so late in the season and <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> deteriorated rapidly, they decided to sail in convoy and, if possible, avoid battle.|$|E

500|$|In June 1944, the {{men were}} {{transferred}} to Singapore aboard the SS Van Warwyck, renamed to the Harukiku Maru by the Japanese.

When he boarded the ship, Judy climbed into a sack and Williams slung it {{over his shoulder to}} take on board. For three hours {{the men were}} forced to stand on deck in the searing heat, and for the entire time Judy remained still and silent in the bag on Wiliams's back. The <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the ship were cramped with more than 700 prisoners. On 26 June 1944, the ship was torpedoed by HMS Truculent. Williams pushed Judy out of a porthole in an attempt to save her life, even though there was a [...] drop to the sea. He made his own escape from the ship, not knowing if Judy had survived. Over five hundred of the passengers did not survive.|$|E

500|$|The Ditton Laboratory, a short {{distance}} from the research station, was opened in 1930 by the Empire Marketing Board as a part of Cambridge University's Low Temperature Research Station. The purpose of the laboratory was to carry out experiments on the shipping of fruit across the high seas, in order to extend its life over long, seaborne journeys. This led to an experiment being carried out to simulate, as far as was possible, <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a cargo ship, the so-called [...] "ship on land" [...] experiment. One focus of research was the Cox's Orange Pippin Apple, which had the reputation of being a difficult fruit to transport over long distances. In 1969 the laboratory was incorporated into the East Malling Research Station as the fruit storage section. After the building was boarded up, a fish farm and fruit distribution business continued at its rear. It has since been demolished and replaced by a modern housing estate.|$|E
2500|$|Speke {{inspected}} the slave ship and bore witness {{in his writings}} regarding the appalling and inhumane <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> When Speke boarded Manuela as she lay in Pomoni Harbor, he saw half-starved people below decks, mostly children, {{along with a few}} old women who lay dying in [...] "the most disgusting ferret box atmosphere." [...] Other slaves who had the strength were ripping open the ship’s hatches and scrambling for the salted fish packed beneath.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reaching}} the South Orkney Islands, the expedition headed {{directly to the}} South Shetland Islands and the Bransfield Strait. [...] In spite of thick fog they located some land only sketched on the maps, which Dumont named Terre de Louis-Philippe (now called Graham Land), the Joinville Island group and Rosamel Island (now called Andersson Island). [...] <b>Conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> had rapidly deteriorated: most of the crew had obvious symptoms of scurvy and the main decks were covered by smoke from the ships fires and bad smells and became unbearable. [...] At the end of February 1838, Dumont accepted {{that he was not}} able to continue further south, and he continued to doubt the actual latitude reached by Weddell. [...] He therefore directed the two ships towards Talcahuano, in Chile, where he established a temporary hospital for the crew members affected by scurvy.|$|E

60|$|Although {{he found}} no fault and made no criticisms, Bonnet was very much disgusted. Such a disorderly vessel, such an {{apparently}} lawless crew, excited his most severe mental strictures; and, although the great Blackbeard was to-day a very well-behaved person, Bonnet could not understand how a famous and successful captain should permit his vessel and his crew to get into such an unseamanlike and disgraceful <b>condition.</b> <b>On</b> <b>board</b> the Revenge, as his sailing-master had remarked, there was the neatness of his kitchen and his store-houses; and, {{although he did not}} always {{know what to do with}} the nautical appliances which surrounded him, he knew how to make them look in good order. But he made few remarks, favourable or otherwise, and held himself loftier than before, with an air as if he might have been an admiral entire instead of resembling one only in clothes, and with ceremonious and even condescending politeness followed his host wherever he was led, above decks or below.|$|R

2500|$|After being {{captured}} {{and held in}} the factories, slaves entered the infamous Middle Passage. Meltzer's research puts {{this phase of the}} slave trade's overall mortality at 12.5%. Their deaths were the result of brutal treatment and poor care from the time of their capture and throughout their voyage. Around 2.2 million Africans died during these voyages where they were packed into tight, unsanitary spaces on ships for months at a time. Measures were taken to stem the onboard mortality rate, such as enforced [...] "dancing" [...] (as exercise) above deck and the practice of force-feeding enslaved persons who tried to starve themselves. The <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> also resulted in the spread of fatal diseases. Other fatalities were suicides, slaves who escaped by jumping overboard. The slave traders would try to fit anywhere from 350 to 600 slaves on one ship. Before the African slave trade was completely banned by participating nations in 1853, 15.3 million enslaved people had arrived in the Americas.|$|E
2500|$|Since their {{beginning}} in the 19th century, ocean liners must meet growing demands. The first liners were small and thus overcrowded, leading to unsanitary <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> Eliminating these phenomenons required larger ships, to reduce the crowding of passengers, and faster ships, to reduce the duration of transatlantic crossings. The iron and steel hulls and steam power allowed for these advances. Thus, [...] (1,340 GRT) and [...] (18,915 GRT) were constructed in 1838 and 1858 respectively. The record set by the Great Eastern was not beaten until 43 years later in 1901 when [...] (20,904 GT) was completed. The tonnage then grew profoundly: the first liners to have a tonnage that exceeds 20,000 were the Big Four of the White Star Line. The Olympic-class liners, first completed in 1911, {{were the first to}} have a tonnage that exceeds 45,000. , completed in 1935, had a tonnage of 79,280. In 1940, [...] raised the record of size to a tonnage of 83,673. She was the largest passenger ship ever constructed until 1997. In 2003, [...] became the largest, at 149,215 GT.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the ports}} of Quebec, Saint John, St Andrews, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Charleston and New Orleans, [...] Miramichi {{did not receive}} large numbers of {{destitute}} and starving Irish during the famine years. Fewer than four so-called coffin ships made it to Miramichi between 1844 and 1849 with less than three hundred people on board. [...] They were ships plying to Quebec with sick and dying passengers, stricken with cholera and other diseases. They diverted to 'Miramichi in desperation and on arrival were quarantined at Middle Island where they were treated in appalling conditions. There was great fear of them and some Miramichers including the Irish referred to them as yellow mealers believing all they had had to eat was corn. The arrival of the famine ship Looshtauk on June 2, 1847, was a major tragedy at Miramichi. She left Liverpool for Quebec with 462 passengers on board. During {{the first two weeks}} at sea more than 100 died of sickness and the majority of the crew contracted severe fever and were unfit for duty. With only a few able seamen available to man the ship and few other options, the captain headed to the nearest port - Miramichi. When news of the dire <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> became known she was forbidden by the port authorities to dock even at Middle Island. The captain could not get permission to land the sick and dying or to bury the dead for over six days in which further severe anguish and the loss of forty more lives occurred. The arrival of two more famine ships the Richard White and the Bolivar further exacerbated the problem. The authorities finally but reluctantly constructed temporary shelters on the island and allowed the sick passengers and crew to land. A further fifty or so people died in the makeshift facilities provided, including the young Chatham doctor John Vondy who volunteered to stay full-time to administer to the sick and dying and within a few days succumbed to the fever himself.|$|E
