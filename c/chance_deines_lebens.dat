5000|$|The first German version [...] "Die <b>Chance</b> <b>deines</b> Lebens" [...] {{hosted by}} Kai Pflaume {{did not have}} the case game as the final round (they played a trivia game instead), however this was the show the {{original}} [...] "Deal or No Deal" [...] version (the Dutch [...] "Miljoenenjacht" [...] hosted by Linda de Mol) was actually based on. Miljoenenjacht started in November 2000 and introduced the case game in December 2002 after a 15-month hiatus of the show.|$|R
40|$|Heute ist der letzte Tag vom Rest <b>deines</b> <b>Lebens</b> is an autobiographical graphic {{novel by}} the Austrian author Ulli Lust. Ulli, {{who is a}} rebellious seventeen-year old “punk” girl and the protagonist of the book, went for a hitchhiking trip across Italy. Although Ulli enjoyed the journey and the new sense of freedom, she also ran into many difficulties. Italy is {{depicted}} as a male-dominant society, where women are regarded as sexual objects. During her trip Ulli had to face molestations, sexual assaults and even rape. Some of the comic’s most dramatic pages represent the effects of violence on the protagonist, such as feelings of shame and nightmares. This article focuses on the verbal and graphic  representation of a trauma. With the support of trauma studies, I will analyze the sequence of images representing rape and argue {{that this is an}} illustration of a "post-traumatic stress disorder". Usually narrating a traumatic event represents a great challenge, because of the incommunicable and unutterable nature of traumas. I will argue that comics can overcome the difficulties of narrating a traumatic event thanks to the combined use of text and images. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{final round}} of Miljoenenjacht {{was based on the}} {{final round of}} the German game show format [...] "Die <b>Chance</b> <b>deines</b> Lebens" [...] ("Your Chance of a Lifetime"): The winning player is sitting in a red armchair which is situated on a platform rising towards the ceiling as the final game begins. (S)he will be guaranteed at least ƒ1, but can turn it into ƒ10,000,000. To do so, Linda will ask seven multiple-choice questions, each one with seven possible answers of which only one is correct. The player has to answer each of the questions within 30 seconds. For each question the contestant answers correctly, a zero will be added to their winnings. They are asked the questions back-to-back however. After answering all seven questions, the platform gets lowered again, Linda joins the player on stage and the finalist gets notified which and how many questions they got right and their total winnings. Here is the ladder for the amount of winnings: ...|$|R
5000|$|An item of {{the show}} known by fans as the [...] "Random Remote of Doom" [...] has almost become a {{trademark}} {{of the show}}. Sometimes, de Mol has the remote in her hand, which seemingly appears from nowhere. She presses one of its buttons, a red light flashes on it and someone from the audience is selected randomly. Mostly this is done by selecting one of the 10 audience sections. After that, {{one of the two}} blocks (prior to 2002: five blocks) of that section gets chosen. Finally, a seat number from that block gets selected, the person sitting on this seat is the contestant which gets awarded whatever is on the line. This might be a (cash) prize or the opportunity to join the game as an additional contender. The Random Remote of Doom was first introduced in the German original version [...] "Die <b>Chance</b> <b>deines</b> Lebens" [...] in April 2000 and also became {{an important part of the}} Dutch version. It has been used from the beginning of the show in late 2000 until 2010 when the production moved from the former Endemol studios in Aalsmeer to the new Endemol headquarters in Amsterdam.|$|R
