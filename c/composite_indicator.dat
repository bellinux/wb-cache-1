5000|$|Sehnbruch has {{consistently}} {{worked on the}} subject of the quality of employment. Her work argues that employment conditions such as income levels, job stability, occupational status, social security contributions, and access to quality vocational training are extremely important to an individual's capabilities and well-being. Still, these conditions are often neglected by labour market experts and policy makers in developing countries, who tend to focus mostly on the quantity of available jobs. [...] Influenced by Amartya Sen's capability approach and by the design of human development and multidimensional poverty indicators by the United Nations Development Programme, Sehnbruch argues that conceptualising and measuring the quality of employment, preferably by means of a <b>composite</b> <b>indicator,</b> is essential to attracting more policy attention to employment issues in developing countries.|$|E
5000|$|To {{address the}} {{perceived}} inadequacies of those four indices, in 2007 the OECD Development Centre introduced a Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), a <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> of gender equality that solely focuses on social institutions {{that affect the}} equality between men and women, {{as well as on}} the four dimensions of family code, physical integrity, ownership rights and civil liberties. Social institutions comprise norms, values and attitudes that exist in a society in relation to women. SIGI's authors argue that it is [...] "the only index that focuses on the underlying sources of gender inequality", through they note it is indented to supplement, not replace, the aforementioned other existing measures; they also note that this topic is likely too complex for a single indicator, and recommend a multi-indicator approach for any studies that want to aim to be more comprehensive. The tool has been praised for being a valuable measure for developing countries, but criticized as less applicable for the developed ones.|$|E

5000|$|The {{data sources}} used for {{constructing}} the Gender Equality Index are Eurostat, Eurofound and the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice.The {{construction of a}} statistical measurement framework, for a robust <b>composite</b> <b>indicator,</b> necessitates a solid methodology which entails different steps. Among those, three are the most critical: imputation (estimation of missing data), aggregation (groups data according to the structure provided by the measurement framework) and weighting (assigns a relative importance to variables, sub-domains and domains). These steps involve several alternatives, such as for example in the aggregation process, the arithmetic, geometric or harmonic mean, which produce a different result of the Index. The selection of one particular alternative introduces subjectivity in the process. The calculation of the Gender Equality Index relies on eliminating as much subjectivity as possible, by applying the multi-modelling approach: computing a wide set of potential indices, based on the considered alternatives, from which to select the best index. Methodologically this index {{is defined as the}} most robust [...] because, among the 3 636 possible indices that were computed its result relies more on the variables used rather than on the alternatives chosen in its formula.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} paper, we define and test an ELECTRE III-based {{approach to the}} construction of non-compensatory <b>composite</b> indicators; these <b>indicators</b> are used for the evaluation of environmental and social performances of urban and regional planning policies. We tested the methodology for the construction of the Land-Use Policy Efficiency Index (LUPEI) on the municipal scale applied to a sample of municipalities in the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Based on the literature review concerning <b>composite</b> <b>indicators,</b> we found that linear aggregation rules are the most widely applied aggregation procedures for <b>composite</b> <b>indicators.</b> However, their applicability depends on a set of strong theoretical and operational conditions. If these conditions do not hold, then other aggregation and weighting procedures must be applied to construct the <b>composite</b> <b>indicators.</b> We tested the ELECTRE III via a fruitful interaction with three experts who were participating in a focus group. We found that <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> are powerful tools {{when it comes to the}} assessment of multidimensional planning issues. Since each sub-indicator provides different information and responds to different goals, rankings and assessment based on mono-indicator frameworks can lead to incomplete or even biased results that do not consider an integrated approach to land-use policy efficiency. Moreover, both experts and decision-makers appreciated the role of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> in increasing knowledge and providing deeper insights into complex phenomena in the domains of urban and regional planning...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an early warning system that can predict the likelihood of the occurrence of financial stress events within a given period of time. To achieve this goal, the signal extraction approach proposed by Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1998) is used to monitor the evolution of a number of economic indicators that tend to exhibit an unusual behaviour in the periods preceding a financial stress event. Based on the individual indicators, we propose three different composite indicators, the summed <b>composite</b> <b>indicator,</b> the extreme <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> and the weighted <b>composite</b> <b>indicator.</b> In-sample forecasting results indicate that the three composite indicators are useful tools for predicting financial stress events.

40|$|The {{right way}} to measure the degree and extent of the {{different}} aspects of fiscal decentralization has been a long-debated, yet underdeveloped issue. There has been little consensus on the right approach to developing a single indicator which is sometimes needed to show a general trend in fiscal decentralization and reveal relationship to other variables in empirical studies. In particular, several <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> of fiscal decentralization have been proposed, but {{there are very few}} attempts to evaluate and compare these measures in terms of implicit biases and different weights between revenue and expenditure decentralization. Critically reviewing and comparing various types of fiscal-relation indicators in a systematic way, this paper proposes two criteria to classify similar-looking <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> for fiscal decentralization while it also presents two new composite measures. The new fiscal decentralization indicators are symmetric in terms of the relative effects of revenue and expenditure decentralization on the value of the <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> {{at the same time that}} they are weighted for/against fiscal gaps and imbalances. It is argued that different <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> reflect different perspectives on which aspect of fiscal decentralization is more important and whether a growing fiscal gap means less fiscal decentralization or not. ...|$|R
