40|$|Since {{only the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditions</b> at the {{photosphere}} can be routinely observed in current observations, {{it is of}} great significance to determine the influences of photospheric <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditions</b> on solar eruptive activities. Previous studies about catastrophe indicated that the magnetic system consisting of a flux rope in a partially open bipolar field is subject to catastrophe, but not if the bipolar field is completely closed under the same specified photospheric conditions. In order to investigate {{the influence of the}} photospheric <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditions</b> on the catastrophic behavior of this system, we expand upon the 2. 5 -dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic model in Cartesian coordinates to simulate the evolution of the equilibrium states of the system under different photospheric flux distributions. Our simulation results reveal that a catastrophe occurs only when the photospheric flux is not concentrated too much toward the polarity inversion line and the source regions of the bipolar field are not too weak; otherwise no catastrophe occurs. As a result, under certain photospheric conditions, a catastrophe could take place in a completely closed configuration, whereas it ceases to exist in a partially open configuration. This indicates that whether the background field is completely closed or partially open is not the only necessary condition for the existence of catastrophe, and that the photospheric conditions also {{play a crucial role in}} the catastrophic behavior of the flux rope system...|$|R

30|$|The {{test results}} reveal that {{increases}} of the amplitude of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>magnetic</b> field cause the PST signal {{response from the}} surface of the magnetostrictive material to raise. Such increase is likely attributed to magnetocaloric heating as the specimen was not restrained and was free to deform. However, if residual stresses were locked in the material, the thermoelastic effect maybe at play as the localized stresses are changed during the <b>cyclic</b> <b>magnetic</b> field application. It is not completely certain whether the MCE was at its maximum since this study was conducted at room temperature and to the best of authors’ knowledge; the MCE of Terfenol-D has not been studied before. A study conducted by Nikitin et al. on Tb-Dy alloys of similar composition showed a maximum temperature change of 0.7  K when testing for MCE around 194  K (Nikitin et al. 1989). In another study conducted by Tereshina et al., a TbDyHoCo alloy was studied. When iron was added to the composition, the maximum temperature change dropped from 1.75  K to 0.5  K. In addition, the temperature at which this greatest change occurs shifted from 140  K up to 280  K. The addition of the iron reduced the maximum change of temperature and shifts the operating temperature at which this peak occurs closer to room temperature. In the case of TbDy, we can expect the addition of iron to reduce the peak temperature change down to the values measured in this study. We can also expect the operating temperature at which this occurs to become closer to room temperature. The measured temperature change in this study was probably operating near the range of maximum MCE. Further study will need to be conducted to verify this.|$|R

40|$|Background Zebra finches can {{be trained}} to use the {{geomagnetic}} field as a directional cue for short distance orientation. The physical mechanisms underlying the primary processes of magnetoreception are, however, largely unknown. Two hypotheses of how birds perceive magnetic information are mainly discussed, one dealing with modulation of radical pair processes in retinal structures, the other assuming that iron deposits in the upper beak of the birds are involved. Oscillating magnetic fields in the MHz range disturb radical pair mechanisms but do not affect magnetic particles. Thus, application of such oscillating fields in behavioral experiments {{can be used as}} a diagnostic tool to decide between the two alternatives. Methods In a setup that eliminates all directional cues except the geomagnetic field zebra finches were trained to search for food in the magnetic north/south axis. The birds were then tested for orientation performance in two <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditions.</b> In condition 1 the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field was shifted by 90 degrees using a helmholtz coil. In condition 2 a high frequently oscillating field (1. 156 MHz) was applied in addition to the shifted field.

Results The zebra finches could be trained successfully to orient in the geomagnetic field for food search in the north/south axis. They were also well oriented in test condition 1, with the magnetic field shifted horizontally by 90 degrees.

This is of potential importance since (i) it is, as far as we are aware, the first time such a behaviour has been produced internally by a mean field dynamo model in a spherical shell, without requiring any additional assumptions or truncations, and (ii) it may be characteristic of the type of behaviour observed in the long term record of the solar activity, such as Maunder minima. We also show that these types of behaviour persist when the functional form of the alpha quenching is altered and also occur over intervals of the shell thickness and the dynamo number.

40|$|Composed of a soft {{polymer matrix}} and {{magnetic}} filler particles, ferrogel {{is a smart}} material responsive to magnetic fields. Due to the viscoelasticity of the matrix, the behaviors of ferrogel are usually rate-dependent. Very few models with coupled magnetic field and viscoelasticity exist in the literature, and even fewer are capable of reliable predictions. Based {{on the principles of}} non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a field theory is developed to describe the magneto-viscoelastic property of ferrogel. The theory provides a guideline for experimental characterizations and structural designs of ferrogel-based devices. A specific material model is then selected and the theory is implemented in a finite-element code. As numerical examples, the responses of a ferrogel in uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are analyzed. The dynamic response of a ferrogel to <b>cyclic</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields is also studied, and the prediction agrees with our experimental results.

40|$|International audienceElectrons can be {{accelerated}} to ultrarelativistic energies at strong (high Mach number) collisionless {{shock waves}} that form when stellar debris rapidly expands after a supernova. Collisionless shock waves also form {{in the flow of}} particles from the Sun (the solar wind), and extensive spacecraft observations have established that electron acceleration at these shocks is effectively absent whenever the upstream magnetic field is roughly parallel to the shock-surface normal (quasi-parallel conditions). However, it is unclear whether this magnetic dependence of electron acceleration also applies to the far stronger shocks around young supernova remnants, where local <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditions</b> are poorly understood. Here we present Cassini spacecraft observations of an unusually strong solar system shock wave (Saturn's bow shock) where significant local electron acceleration has been confirmed under quasi-parallel <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditions</b> for the first time, contradicting the established magnetic dependence of electron acceleration at solar system shocks. Furthermore, the acceleration led to electrons at relativistic energies (about megaelectronvolt), comparable to the highest energies ever attributed to shock acceleration in the solar wind.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the measurements of mid-eclipse times of V 839 Oph, collected from literature sources. Our analysis indicates a period increase of 3. 2 × 10 − 7 day/yr. This period increase of V 839 Oph can be interpreted in terms of mass transfer of rate 1. 76 × 10 − 7 M¯/yr, from the less to the more massive component.

A major result of this timing analysis is the discovery of an extreme variation of the nominal 4. 6 -hour orbital period P_ orb over time, showing alternating epochs of decrease and increase.
