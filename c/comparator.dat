5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink <b>comparator</b> {{were used}} in {{astronomy}} to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink <b>comparator</b> to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Flanders and his brother, Ernest, were {{instrumental}} in developing screw thread grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical <b>comparator)</b> and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They had improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink <b>comparator,</b> the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5000|$|A flash {{converter}} {{requires a}} huge number of <b>comparators</b> compared to other ADCs, especially as the precision increases. A flash converter requires [...] <b>comparators</b> for an n-bit conversion. The size, power consumption and cost of all those <b>comparators</b> makes flash converters generally impractical for precisions much greater than 8 bits (255 <b>comparators).</b> In place of these <b>comparators,</b> most other ADCs substitute more complex logic and/or analog circuitry that can be scaled more easily for increased precision.|$|R
25|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, <b>comparators</b> can also be {{classified}} as open drain or push–pull. <b>Comparators</b> with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain <b>comparators</b> {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain <b>comparators</b> {{can also be used to}} connect multiple <b>comparators</b> on to a single bus. Push pull output does not need a pull up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|R

5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the <b>comparator</b> antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink <b>comparator,</b> which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink <b>comparator,</b> he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E

25|$|A <b>comparator</b> circuit compares two {{voltages}} and outputs {{either a}} 1 (the voltage at the plus side; VDD in the illustration) or a 0 (the voltage at the negative side) to indicate which is larger. Comparators are often used, for example, to check whether an input has reached some predetermined value. In most cases a <b>comparator</b> is implemented using a dedicated <b>comparator</b> IC, but op-amps {{may be used}} as an alternative. <b>Comparator</b> diagrams and op-amp diagrams use the same symbols.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>comparators</b> {{have only}} two output states, their outputs are near zero or near the supply voltage. Bipolar {{rail-to-rail}} <b>comparators</b> have a common-emitter output that produces a small voltage drop between the output and each rail. That drop {{is equal to the}} collector-to-emitter voltage of a saturated transistor. When output currents are light, output voltages of CMOS rail-to-rail <b>comparators,</b> which rely on a saturated MOSFET, range closer to the rails than their bipolar counterparts.|$|R
25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier can, if necessary, {{be forced to}} act as a <b>comparator.</b> The smallest difference between the input voltages will be amplified enormously, causing the output to swing to nearly the supply voltage. However, it is usually better to use a dedicated <b>comparator</b> for this purpose, as its output has a higher slew rate and can reach either power supply rail. Some op-amps have clamping diodes on the input that prevent use as a <b>comparator.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{this type}} of detector, a <b>comparator</b> detects each time an ac pulse changes polarity. The output of the <b>comparator</b> changes state each time the pulse changes its polarity, that is the output is HI (high) for a {{positive}} pulse and LO (low) for a negative pulse squares the input signal.|$|E
25|$|That is, the op-amp {{is being}} used as a voltage <b>comparator.</b> Note that a device {{designed}} primarily as a <b>comparator</b> may be better if, for instance, speed is important or a wide range of input voltages may be found, since such devices can quickly recover from full on or full off ("saturated") states.|$|E

This contribution stemmed from Hartness' work as the Chairman of the U.S. National Screw-Thread Commission and from his familiarity with optics in astronomy and telescope-building.

40|$|Abstract. Sorting Networks (SN) are {{efficient}} {{tools to}} sort an input data sequence. They are composed {{by a set}} of comparison-exchange operations called compara-tors. The <b>comparators</b> are a priori fixed for a determined input size. The <b>comparators</b> are independent of the input configuration. SN with a minimal number of <b>comparators</b> results in an optimal manner to sort data; it is a classical NP-hard problem studied for more than 50 years. In this paper we adapted a biological inspired heuristic called Artificial Immune System to evolve candidate sets of SN. Besides, a local strategy is proposed to consider the information regarding <b>comparators</b> and sequences to be ordered at a determined building stage. New optimal Sorting Networks designs for input sizes from 9 to 15 are presented. ...|$|R

25|$|Without {{negative}} feedback, {{and perhaps}} with positive feedback for regeneration, an op-amp {{acts as a}} <b>comparator.</b> If the inverting input is held at ground (0V) directly or by a resistor Rg, and the input voltage Vin applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if Vin is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an open-loop circuit acting as a <b>comparator.</b>|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, several {{methods have been}} used to compare the {{performance}} of fire danger indices in an effort to find the most appropriate indices for particular regions or circumstances. Various authors have proposed <b>comparators</b> and demonstrated different responses of indices to their tests, but rarely has much effort been put into demonstrating the validity of the <b>comparators</b> themselves. We present a demonstration that many of the published <b>comparators</b> are sensitive to the different frequency distributions, that may be inherent in the performance of the different indices, and outline a non-parametric method that may be useful for future work. We compare four hypothetical fire danger indices, three of which are simple mathematical transformations of each other. The hypothesis tested is that the <b>comparators</b> often used in such studies may indicate spurious performance differences between these indices, which is found to be the case. Non-parametric methods are robust to differences in index value frequency distribution and may allow more valid comparisons of fire danger indices. The new comparison method is shown to have advantages over other non-parametric <b>comparators...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{clipping circuit}} {{was comprised of}} four <b>comparators</b> whose job was {{to ensure that the}} state variable function w(t) did not go beyond its limits. The <b>comparators</b> clipped w(t) at its top and bottom boundaries. It basically acts as a switch in which if the <b>comparators</b> detect a certain value in the device they activate a switch and set the device at a particular voltage. So, when w(t) reached the upper boundary of the device, the device is connected to a voltage source of value D, which effectively clips w(t) at D. This operation occurs when the voltage bias is positive.|$|R
