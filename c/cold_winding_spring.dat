60|$|They all sat in {{thoughtful}} {{silence for}} a little while the scarlet streaks turned to carmine, and the grey shadows deepened, and the wild-fowl flew past in dark straggling V's over the dull metallic surface of the great smooth-flowing Nile. A <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> had <b>sprung</b> up from the eastward, and some of the party rose to leave the deck. Stephens leaned forward to Sadie.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not meet}} with all the sympathy he expected. Lady Merrifield said that Coalham had not agreed with her own son Harry, and that little Lena {{ought not to be}} taken there till after the <b>cold</b> <b>winds</b> of <b>spring</b> were over; and her daughters all chimed in with a {{declaration}} that Angela Underwood was perfectly devoted to the little one, and that no one else could make her happy.|$|R
60|$|Blake {{called him}} to help in {{dragging}} the sled over an obstacle, and the difficulties of the way afterward occupied his attention. When they found clearer ground they made good progress, and, late in the afternoon, seeing a rocky spur running out from the hillside, they headed for it {{to look for a}} sheltered camping place. There was still some daylight, but a <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> had <b>sprung</b> up, blowing the loose snow into their faces.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} we would read {{that it was going}} to be a “warm, fine to set-fair day; much heat;” and we would dress {{ourselves}} in flimsy things, and go out, and, half-an-hour after we had started, it would commence to rain hard, and a bitterly <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> would <b>spring</b> up, and both would keep on steadily for the whole day, and we would come home with colds and rheumatism all over us, and go to bed.|$|R
60|$|By and by {{they found}} clearer ground and made good {{progress}} {{until late in}} the afternoon when, seeing a rocky spur running out from the hillside, they headed for it to look for a sheltered camping place. There was still some daylight, but a <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> had <b>sprung</b> up, blowing the loose snow into their faces, and when, as they neared the spur, the dogs swerved as if attracted by something, the half-breed struck the nearest beast and drove them on.|$|R
5000|$|Appleton died on April 17, 1884. His friend Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a {{memorial}} to him in The Atlantic Monthly: [...] "The city seems grayer and older since he left us, the <b>cold</b> <b>spring</b> <b>wind</b> coming from the bay, harsher and more unfriendly." [...] He is buried in a family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{had hidden}} behind clouds all {{the latter part}} of that day, an unusual {{occurrence}} for that region even in winter. And now, as the light waned suddenly, telling of the hidden sunset, a <b>cold</b> dry, penetrating <b>wind</b> <b>sprang</b> up and blew in Gale's face. Not at first, but by imperceptible degrees it chilled him. He untied his coat {{from the back of the}} saddle and put it on. A few cold drops of rain touched his cheek.|$|R
60|$|There {{were signs}} {{of a change in}} the weather when Vane walked down to the wharf with his passengers, for a <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> which had <b>sprung</b> up struck an eerie sighing from the somber firs and sent the white mists {{streaming}} along the hillside. There was a watery moon in the sky, and when they reached the water's edge Vane fancied that the singer hesitated; but Mrs. Marvin laid her hand on the girl's arm reassuringly, and she got into the canoe. A few minutes later Vane ran the craft alongside the sloop and saw the amazement in Carroll's face by the glow from the cabin skylight. He fancied, however, that his comrade would rise to the occasion, and he helped his guests up.|$|R
500|$|York has a {{temperate}} climate with four distinct seasons. As {{with the rest}} of the Vale of York the city's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the Yorkshire and Humberside region. Because of its lowland location York is prone to frosts, fog, and <b>cold</b> <b>winds</b> during winter, <b>spring</b> and very early summer. [...] Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts. From May to July, York experiences the most sunshine, an average of six hours per day.

60|$|A few stars {{came out}} hesitatingly above Deadwood Slope. A <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> that had <b>sprung</b> {{up with the}} going down of the sun fanned them into {{momentary}} brightness, swept the heated flanks of the mountain, and ruffled the river. Where the fallen man lay there was a sharp curve in the stream, {{so that in the}} gathering shadows the rushing water seemed to leap out of the darkness and to vanish again. Decayed drift-wood, trunks of trees, fragments of broken sluicing,--the wash and waste of many a mile,--swept into sight a moment, and were gone. All of decay, wreck, and foulness gathered in the long circuit of mining-camp and settlement, all the dregs and refuse of a crude and wanton civilization, reappeared for an instant, and then were hurried away in the darkness and lost. No wonder that as the wind ruffled the yellow waters the waves seemed to lift their unclean hands toward the rock whereon the fallen man lay, as if eager to snatch him from it, too, and hurry him toward the sea.|$|R

[...] A <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> went sweeping by, and the Rhone was rushing far below, discernible {{only in the}} distance as a rivulet of flashing foam.

I replied, not without some scruples of conscience, [...] "Oui, monsieur, c'est moi," [...] though the name did not sound exactly like the one to which I had been wont to respond.

According to the microscopic cutter wear and surface roughness generated in the experiments of using different media (such as: <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> oil-mist, <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> and normal temperature oil-mist) to cut the alloy, the influences of different media cutting conditions on cutter wear and the surface roughness of a workpiece in the high-speed cutting Ni-base superalloy are studied, and the rule {{to improve the quality of}} surface processing of Ni-base superalloy under the condition of the <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> high-speed cutting is revealed...|$|R
