50|$|Wolf-Hirschhorn {{syndrome}} (WHS), {{also known}} as <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> Dillan 4p syndrome, Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome (PRDS) or Pitt syndrome, was first described in 1961 by Americans Herbert L. Cooper and Kurt Hirschhorn and, thereafter, gained worldwide attention by publications by the German Ulrich Wolf, and Hirschhorn and their co-workers, specifically their articles in the German scientific magazine Humangenetik. It is a characteristic phenotype resulting from a partial deletion of chromosomal material of the short arm of chromosome 4 (del(4p16.3)).|$|E

Its name is a French term (cat-cry or call of the cat) referring to the characteristic cat-like cry of affected children. It was first described by Jérôme Lejeune in 1963.

40|$|Constitutional <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletions</b> {{result in}} wide ranging {{morbidity}} and often fatality. Information about risks and {{causes of death}} in these patients is important for counselling, and may illuminate {{the functions of the}} part of the chromosome deleted. There have been no cohort studies analysing mortality risks in persons with specific deletions compared with general population rates. We therefore conducted a cohort study following cause-specific mortality in 2, 561 patients with autosomal <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletions</b> diagnosed by light microscopy or fluorescence in situ hybridisation at cytogenetic laboratories across Britain, 1965 - 2002. The commonest deletions were of 22 q (544 patients), 15 q (460) and 7 q (210) and the least common 19 q (0) and 20 q (2). The prevalence of visible <b>deletions</b> of different <b>chromosome</b> arms was significantly inversely correlated with gene density of the arm (p 10 for deletions of 1 p, 1 q, 3 p, 4 p, 5 q and 22 q. Overall, 29 % of deaths were due to congenital anomalies; significantly raised mortality occurred also from many other causes, varying by chromosome and arm of deletion. The data imply that viability of foetuses with visible <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletions</b> may be inversely related to gene density, and that all visible and fluorescence in situ hybridisation-detectable deletions lead to much raised mortality, but the extent and causes of mortality vary according to the specific deletion...|$|R

50|$|Rather {{than the}} typical linear pattern of a <b>{{chromosome}},</b> <b>deletion</b> of the endings of a chromosome can lead to ring formation.

Therefore, some gene loss from the terminal segment could be responsible for the manifestation of epilepsy in ring chromosome 20 syndrome. The most common breakpoint in patients is in the q13.33 region of chromosome 20.|$|E

40|$|The fast {{accumulation}} of mutant mouse strains {{in recent years}} has provided an invaluable resource for phenotype-based genetic screens. However, study of lymphoid phenotypes can be obscured or impractical if homozygous mutations cause early embryonic defects. To aid phenotype screening of germ line mutations in the lymphoid system, we developed a method to induce loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in developing lymphocytes through <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion.</b> <b>Chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> was triggered by Cre/loxP-mediated inverse sister chromatid recombination in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle, leading to the generation of daughter cells missing part of or the entire recombinant chromosome. We show that the resulting cells were viable and capable of additional rounds of cell division, thus providing raw materials for subsequent phenotypic assessment. We used the recombination system to induce LOH at the E 2 A locus in developing B cells. A significant loss of pro-B and pre-B cells was observed when the wild-type allele was removed by <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> from the E 2 A heterozygous mice, a result consistent with the required role for E 2 A in B cell development. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of Cre-mediated <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> in the LOH assay for HEB function in T cell development.

This significantly hampers ordering of markers, contigs of physical maps and sequence scaffolds and impedes obtaining of high-quality reference genome sequence. Here {{we report on the}} construction of high-density and high-resolution radiation hybrid (RH) map of chromosome 4 A supported by high-density <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> map. A total of 119 endosperm-based RH lines of two RH panels and 15 <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> bin lines were genotyped with 90 K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 2316 and 2695 markers were successfully mapped to the 4 A RH and deletion maps, respectively. The <b>chromosome</b> <b>deletion</b> map was ordered in 19 bins and allowed precise identification of centromeric region and verification of the RH panel reliability. The 4 A-specific RH map comprises 1080 mapping bins and spans 6550. 9 cR with a resolution of 0. 13 Mb/cR. Significantly higher mapping resolution in the centromeric region was observed as compared to recombination maps. Relatively even distribution of deletion frequency along the chromosome in the RH panel was observed and putative functional centromere was delimited within a region characterized by two SNP markers...|$|E

Genetic complementation of the deletion using a chromosome duplicated for the Df 1 DNA segment corrects the heart defects, indicating that they are caused by reduced dosage of genes located within Df 1.
