Introduction In conventional robots the pose of the tool tip is inferred from the measured joint angles, {{and knowledge of the}} kinematic structure of the robot. The accuracy of a robot is the error between the measured and <b>commanded</b> <b>poses.</b> Discrepancies between the kinematic model assumed by the controller, and the actual robot serve to reduce accuracy which fundamentally limits the usefulness of location data derived from a CAD model.

40|$|Interaction {{control is}} a mature, but still, current area of {{research}} in robotics. Various approaches {{have been developed for}} passive and active force regulation and tracking, e. g. impedance control, direct force and hybrid force-position control. The latter method implements a force feedback outer loop on top of a position controller inner loop, where commands are issued with respect to a compliant frame. However, if the compliant frame undergoes a rigid transformation, e. g. in order to specify the same task relative to another reference frame, then commands can be rendered non-compliant with the task at hand. As a consequence, the robot can be damaged or hurt somebody, this is further aggravated by the rigidness of a position controller. In the present paper, we propose a unified impedance and hybrid force-position control scheme to address such issues. The unified controller benefits from the impedance control compliance while an explicit force value can be achieved. Furthermore, we augment the designed controller with a kinestatic filter, which ensures that the <b>commanded</b> <b>pose</b> and wrench are consistent with a given task model. We validate the designed system through experiments with a lightweight robot (LWR). The proposed approach finds applications in industrial settings where interactions with the environment are required in order to fulfill a task and the system must be robust w. r. t. input commands...|$|R

40|$|The high {{complexity}} of the human posture and movement control system represents challenges for diagnosis, therapy, and rehabilitation of neurological patients. We envisage that engineering-inspired, model-based approaches will help {{to deal with the}} high {{complexity of}} the human posture control system. Since the methods of system identification and parameter estimation are limited to systems with only a few DoF, our laboratory proposes a heuristic approach that step-by-step increases complexity when creating a hypothetical human-derived control systems in humanoid robots. This system is then compared with the human control in the same test bed, a posture control laboratory. The human-derived control builds upon the identified disturbance estimation and compensation (DEC) mechanism, whose main principle is to support execution of <b>commanded</b> <b>poses</b> or movements by compensating for external or self-produced disturbances such as gravity effects. In previous robotic implementation, up to 3 interconnected DEC control modules were used in modular control architectures separately for the sagittal plane or the frontal body plane and successfully passed balancing and movement tests. In this study we hypothesized that conflict-free movement coordination between the robot's sagittal and frontal body planes emerges simply from the physical embodiment, not necessarily requiring a full body control. Experiments were performed in the 14 DoF robot Lucy Posturob (i) demonstrating that the mechanical coupling from the robot's body suffices to coordinate the controls in the two planes when the robot produces movements and balancing responses in the intermediate plane, (ii) providing quantitative characterization of the interaction dynamics between body planes including frequency response functions (FRFs), as they are used in human postural control analysis, and (iii) witnessing postural and control stability when all DoFs are challenged together with the emergence of inter-segmental coordination in squatting movements. These findings represent an important step toward controlling in the robot in future more complex sensorimotor functions such as walking...|$|R

The algorithm, called End-Effector Position Error Compensation (EPEC) is robust to visual occlusion of the end-effector {{and does not}} require high fidelity calibration of either the arm or stereo camera. The algorithm works by calculating an error vector between the locations of a fiducial on the arm’s end-effector as predicted by arm kinematics and detected by a stereo camera triangulation. With this knowledge, the <b>commanded</b> target <b>pose</b> is adjusted to compensate for positioning errors. A simulation environment where arbitrary error can be introduced into arm-camera systems is introduced and used to provide {{an assessment of the}} performance of the algorith...|$|R

The creation of combined-arms forces poses particular challenges to command, {{especially if they}} are attached during a battle. To this end (in and before WW2) the German General Staff cross-posted officers and NCOs between the different branches of the Army. It was therefore not unusual to find an armor commander with experience of artillery and infantry command. Similarly, NCOs with cross-branch tactical experience ensured that these combined-arms teams did operate in an integrated fashion. The German High Command (OKH) ran multiple exercises, or war games, in the 1930s, starting with small operations and in later years involving very large formations and major movements to ensure doctrinal coherence and the opportunity to revise and learn. The General Staff played a vital role in assuring the quality of these exercises and in ensuring lessons were learnt and much of the philosophy was incorporated in their 1933 Field Manual Truppenführung.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain high {{precision}} path tracking for a dual-arm space robot, a trajectory planning method with pose feedback is proposed to be introduced into the design process in this paper. Firstly, pose error kinematic models are derived from the related kinematics and desired <b>pose</b> <b>command</b> for the end-effector and the base, respectively. On this basis, trajectory planning with pose feedback is proposed from a control perspective. Theoretical analyses show that the proposed trajectory planning algorithm can guarantee that pose error converges to zero exponentially for both the end-effector and the base when the robot is out of singular configuration. Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can lead to higher precision path tracking for the end-effector. Furthermore, the algorithm renders the system good anti-interference property for the base. Simulation results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed trajectory planning algorithm...|$|R

In experiments with real and simulated manipulator arms, we show that our system is able to quickly learn compact and accurate models and to robustly deal with noisy observations. I...|$|R

40|$|Hundreds or even {{thousands}} of international legal instruments on "the environment" are in existence. What happens to international environmental agreements once they are signed, and how does the process of implementing such agreements influence their effectiveness? These are the questions that motivate the IIASA project "Implementation and Effectiveness of International Environmental Commitments (IEC) ". Research teams are examining these questions from many angles and with different methods. In this paper, the author examines {{the ways in which}} international environmental agreements are implemented in the former Soviet Union, especially Russia. The massive transformation under way in the former <b>command</b> economies <b>poses</b> interesting questions and many difficulties for scholars. Transformation affects behavior in all sectors of the society, and implementation of international environmental agreements is also intended to affect behavior. How can scholars disentangle the influences on behavior due to transformation and those due to implementation of international environmental agreements? Kotov examines the major elements of the transformation under way in Russia and focuses on how implementation of international environmental agreements might affect and be affected by the transformation. In doing so, he lays one foundation for disaggregating these different influences on behavior. Transformation is marked by the relative absence of planning and implementation because the old system of commands has collapsed and a new system has not yet effectively emerged. A major challenge for the new system is to manage the decentralization of authority and decision-making that accompanies the organization of society around markets rather than commands. Kotov notes that during the transformation process much more of the activity and policy planning that is relevant for implementation of international environmental agreements now takes place at the local level. Direct implementation of plans and standards has decreased markedly; the role of negotiation has increased, leading to widely varied outcomes. Under the command system, when the planning process was mobilized to implement an agreement, implementation was easier. Many decisions made during the transformation period will have long-term consequences for the implementation of international environmental agreements. Among these are choices about distribution and control over property rights. The IEC project is now sponsoring several in-depth case studies [...] notably on the European acid rain agreement (including a study of implementing acid rain controls on the Kola Peninsula) and the agreements to control pollution in the Baltic Sea. Those empirical studies employ some of the concepts and questions elaborated in this paper...|$|R
