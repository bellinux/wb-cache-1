40|$|Clustering {{algorithms}} {{are highly}} dependent on the features used {{and the type of}} the objects in a particular image. By <b>considering</b> <b>object</b> similar surface variations (SSV) as well as the arbitrariness of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm for pixel location, a fuzzy image segmentation <b>considering</b> <b>object</b> surface similarity (FSOS) algorithm was developed, but it was unable to segment objects having SSV satisfactorily. To improve the effectiveness of FSOS in segmenting objects with SSV, this paper introduces a new fuzzy image segmentation using suppressed fuzzy c-means clustering (FSSC) algorithm, which directly <b>considers</b> <b>object</b> SSV and incorporates the use of suppressed-FCM (SFCM) using pixel location. The algorithm also perceptually selects the threshold within the range of human visual perception. Both qualitative and quantitative results confirm the improved segmentation performance of FSSC compared with other algorithms including FSOS, FCM, possibilistic c-means (PCM) and SFCM for many different images...|$|R

The probability that one object is occluded by another, providing that both objects have not been involved in previous occlusion events, is expressed by a Gaussian function {{that depends on the}} distance between the two <b>considered</b> <b>objects.</b> And in the same conditions, the probability that it is not occluded is determined by the probability density dvis. In the case that any of the <b>considered</b> <b>objects</b> have been involved in previous occlusion events, the occlusion restrictions are applied to avoid non-realistic situations.|$|R
5000|$|Approaches of {{this type}} are also called [...] "depth from defocus" [...] and [...] "depth from blur". On [...] "depth from defocus" [...] (DFD) approaches, the depth {{information}} is estimated based {{on the amount of}} blur of the <b>considered</b> <b>object,</b> whereas [...] "depth from focus" [...] (DFF) approaches tend to compare the sharpness of an object over a range of images taken with different focus distances in order to find out its distance to the camera. DFD only needs 2 to 3 images at different focus to properly work, whereas DFF needs 10 to 15 images at least but is more accurate than the previous method.|$|E
50|$|Other {{authors were}} {{unsatisfied}} {{with the idea}} that torques and counter-torques arise only because different inertial frames are chosen. Their aim was to replace the standard expressions for momentum and force and thus equilibrium by manifestly Lorentz covariant ones from the outset. So when there is no torque in the rest frame of the <b>considered</b> <b>object,</b> then there are no torques in other frames as well. This is in analogy to the 4/3 problem of the electromagnetic mass of electrons, where similar methods were employed by Enrico Fermi (1921) and Fritz Rohrlich (1960): In the standard formulation of relativistic dynamics the hyperplanes of simultaneity of any observer can be used, while in the Fermi/Rohrlich definition the hyperplane of simultaneity of the object's rest frame should be used. According to Janssen, deciding between Laue's standard model and such alternatives is merely a matter of convention.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, the {{capacity}} or disposition {{that allows the}} practical reason to apprehend intuitively the principles or laws that preside over its discursive reasoning regarding human action is called synderesis. Just as [...] "being" [...] is the first notion apprehended absolutely, so also [...] "good" [...] {{is the first thing}} that is apprehended by the practical reason, since everything that acts does so for an end which possesses the quality of goodness. That is why the first principle or law of the practical reason is [...] "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided". Also the precepts of natural law can be <b>considered</b> <b>object</b> of synderesis insofar as all the things towards which the human being has a natural inclination are naturally apprehended by the intellect as good and therefore as objects to be pursued, and their opposites as evils to be avoided.|$|E

By means of this technique the image points in a low-dimensional embedding space can be found whose inter-point distances fit the given dissimilarities between the <b>considered</b> <b>objects.</b> In this paper dependence of relative visualization error on the dimensionality of embedding space is investigated. Both artificial and practical data sets have been used. The images in three-dimensional embedding space normally show the structural properties of sets of <b>considered</b> <b>objects</b> with acceptable accuracy, and widening of applications of stereo screens makes three-dimensional visualization very attractive...|$|R

Although the original method is only suited for distance calculations, the proposed method is capable of finding the colliding triangle pairs between two continuously deforming virtual objects in real time. Furthermore, it handles all deformation types at no extra time cost and it allows the client application to add, or remove triangles from the <b>considered</b> <b>object</b> meshes at run time with no extra overhead for the collision detection. The proposed method is very exible in many aspects, making it an ideal choice for virtual reality and haptic applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} of a spherically symmetric braneworld configuration is performed when the intrinsic curvature scalar {{is included in the}} bulk action. In the case when the electric part of the Weyl tensor is zero, all the exterior solutions are found; one of them is of the Schwarzschild-(A) dS 4 form, which is matched to a modified Oppenheimer-Volkoff interior solution. In the case when the electric part of the Weyl tensor is non zero, the exterior Schwarzschild-(A) dS 4 black hole solution is modified receiving corrections from the non-local bulk effects. A non-universal gravitational constant arises, depending on the density of the <b>considered</b> <b>object</b> and the Newton’s law is modified for small and large distances; however, the conventional limits are easily obtained...|$|E
40|$|In special {{relativity}} theory the physical quantities are generally expressed as {{function of the}} velocity. In the particular case of an extended object, the factor 1 /gamma of Lorentz contraction of its length {{in the direction of}} motion is written {{as a function of the}} velocity of the extended object. The same happens with the Lorentz factor gamma of time interval dilation of a moving clock. In this paper we show that when gamma is written as a function of the relativistic energy of the <b>considered</b> <b>object</b> the resulting expressions for the length and for the time interval suggest that the contraction of length as well as the dilation of the time interval are manifestations of the wave behavior of matter.

40|$|The {{transport}} of slightly deformable chiral objects {{in a uniform}} shear flow is investigated. Depending on the equilibrium configuration one finds up to four different asymptotic states that can be distinguished by a lateral drift velocity of their center of mass, a rotational motion about the center of mass and deformations of the object. These deformations influence the magnitudes of the principal axes of the second moment tensor of the <b>considered</b> <b>object</b> and also modify a scalar index characterizing its chirality. Moreover, the deformations induced by the shear flow are essential for the phenomenon of dynamical symmetry breaking: Objects that are achiral under equilibrium conditions may dynamically acquire chirality and consequently experience a drift in the lateral direction.
