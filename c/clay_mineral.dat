25|$|Recent {{observations}} and modeling are producing information {{not only about}} the present climate and atmospheric conditions on Mars but also about its past. The Noachian-era Martian atmosphere had long been theorized to be carbon dioxide–rich. Recent spectral observations of deposits of clay minerals on Mars and modeling of <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> formation conditions have found that there is little to no carbonate present in clay of that era. Clay formation in a carbon dioxide–rich environment is always accompanied by carbonate formation, although the carbonate may later be dissolved by volcanic acidity.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the long}} half-life, the {{technique}} is most applicable for dating minerals and rocks more than 100,000 years old. For shorter timescales, {{it is unlikely that}} enough argon-40 will have had time to accumulate in order to be accurately measurable. K–Ar dating was instrumental {{in the development of the}} geomagnetic polarity time scale. Although it finds the most utility in geological applications, it plays an important role in archaeology. One archeological application has been in bracketing the age of archeological deposits at Olduvai Gorge by dating lava flows above and below the deposits. It has also been indispensable in other early east African sites with a history of volcanic activity such as Hadar, Ethiopia. The K–Ar method continues to have utility in dating <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> diagenesis. Clay minerals are less than 2 micrometres thick and cannot easily be irradiated for Ar–Ar analysis because Ar recoils from the crystal lattice.|$|E

While it is acknowledged that <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> can cause problems in mineral flotation, the literature contains conflicting evidence, {{particularly with respect to}} the effect of clays on froth stability. It is well known that achieving and maintaining optimum froth stability is an influential factor in determining froth flotation performance. However, the presence of <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> in the ore is a major challenge to obtaining a stable froth. In fact, <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> could reduce froth flotation performance by both decreasing or increasing froth stability.

2500|$|In the {{southern}} United States in the 1800s, geophagia {{was a common}} practice among the slave population. Geophagia {{is a form of}} pica in which the person consumes earthly substances such as clay, and is particularly prevalent to augment a mineral-deficient diet. [...] Noteworthy is the fact that Kaolin was consumed by west Africans enslaved in the South-eastern United States, particularly the Georgia belt, due to the anti-diarrheal qualities in the treatment of dysentery and other abdominal ailments. The practice of consuming Kaolin rocks was thereafter studied scientifically, the results of which led to the subsequent pharmaceutical commercialization of Kaolinite, the <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> contained in Kaolin. Kaolinite became the active ingredient in drugs like Kaopectate and Pepto-Bismol, although the formulations have since found additional active ingredients to replace Kaolinite.|$|E
2500|$|The samples {{examined}} {{were probably}} once mud that for millions {{to tens of}} millions of years could have hosted living organisms. [...] This wet environment had neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. These types of iron and sulfur could have been used by living organisms. C, H, O, S, N, and P were measured directly as key biogenic elements, and by inference, P is assumed to have been there as well. The two samples, John Klein and Cumberland, contain basaltic minerals, Ca-sulfates, Fe oxide/hydroxides, Fe-sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites (a type of clay). Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby aeoliandeposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite plus magnetite, so Fe-forsterite (type of olivine) was probably altered to form smectite (a type of clay) and magnetite. [...] A Late Noachian/EarlyHesperian or younger age indicates that <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time; therefore, in this location neutral pH lasted longer than previously thought.|$|E
2500|$|Pica is the {{ingestion}} of non-nutritive substances and {{has so far}} been poorly documented. In non-human animals in the laboratory it has been examined through the {{ingestion of}} kaolin (a <b>clay</b> <b>mineral)</b> by rats. Rats were induced to intake kaolin by administering various emetic stimuli such as copper sulfate, apomorphine, cisplatin, and motion. Rats are unable to vomit when they ingest a substance that is harmful thus pica in rats is analogous to vomiting in other species; it is a way for rats to relieve digestive distress. [...] In some animals pica seems to be an adaptive trait but in others {{it seems to be a}} true psychopathology like in the case of some chickens. Chickens can display a type of pica when they are feed-deprived (feeding restriction has been adopted by the egg industry to induce molting). [...] They increase their non-nutritive pecking, such as pecking structural features of their environment like wood or wire on fences or the feathers of other birds. It is a typical response that occurs when feeding is restricted or is completely withdrawn. Some of the non-nutritive pecking may be due to a redirection of foraging related behavior. [...] Another animal that has displayed a more complex pica example are cattle. Cattle eat bones when they have a phosphorus deficiency. However, in some cases they persist on eating bones even after their phosphorus levels have stabilized and they are getting adequate doses of phosphorus in their diet. In this case evidence supports both a physical and psychological adaptive response. Cattle that continue to eat bones after their phosphorus levels are adequate do it because of a psychological reinforcer. [...] "The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult." ...|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{physical}} and chemical properties of some clays (such as the Lias Group) large swelling occurs when water is absorbed. Conversely when the water dries up these clays contract (shrink). The presence of these <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> is what allows soils to have the capacity to shrink and swell. Some of these <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> are: smectite, nontronite, bentonite, chlorite, montmorillonite, beidellite, attapulgite, illite and vermiculite. The amount of these minerals in a particular soil will also determine the severity of the shrink-swell capacity. For instance, soils {{with a small amount of}} expansive <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> will not expand as much when exposed to moisture as a soil with a large amount of the same <b>clay</b> <b>minerals.</b> If a soil is composed of at least 5 percent of these <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> by weight, it could have the ability to shrink and swell.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> adsorb and {{immobilize}} extracellular enzymes of microorganisms and increase soil enzymes stability. This study aims {{to clarify the}} relative importance of soil organic matter and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> on the cellulolytic activities of soils. Fluca prepared cellulase was immobilized on some agricultural residues and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals,</b> avicel and a sample of soil. Immobilized exoglucanase and endoglucanase were assayed at different times. Activities of the immobilized enzymes were strikingly dependent on the kind of sorbent. After 20 days of storing in refrigerator at 4 oC, the deactivation of immobilized enzymes on the organic substances (as avicel) was very low but deactivation of immobilized enzymes on the soil and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> was relatively high. On the other hand, the activities of immobilized enzymes on the agricultural residues and avicel were significantly higher than the soil and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals.</b> So it may be concluded that a large part of cellulolytic activity of soil is related to immobilized enzymes on agricultural residues. Coating of the <b>clay</b> <b>minerals,</b> soil and avicel with 4 mmol of Al (OH) x per mg of them significantly increased their immobilization capacity and activities of immobilized enzymes. Activities of immobilized exoglucanase and endoglucanase on the Ca- homoionized soil and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> were significantly higher than the K- homoionized soil and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals.</b> However, these effects {{may be related to the}} specific effects of cations on the method of enzyme assay or enzymes activities.

40|$|Solubilization of soil {{phosphate}} accumulated {{during the}} last decades in fertilized soils can be profitably used to decrease phosphate (PO 4) fertilization while maintaining crop production. In this respect, {{it is important to}} clearly identify and rank the different soil constituents regarding their importance for the control of PO 4 sorption. However, the relative importance of <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> versus Fe oxide-hydroxides is still controversial. Indeed, some researchers only considered the influence of Fe oxide-hydroxides, while others also included <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> in their PO 4 sorption models. Through this communication our main objective is to present a set of evidences issued from the literature and also based on original data which support the significant influence of <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> on PO 4 sorption in soils. The first evidence is based on the adsorption capacity of minerals and on the mineralogical composition of soils. Second, we showed that the adsorption properties of <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> versus pH do not resemble to that of Fe oxide-hydroxides, thus precluding the consideration of Fe oxide-hydroxides as a surrogate for <b>clay</b> <b>minerals.</b> Last, preliminary results of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the phosphorus K-edge showed that PO 4 binding to <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> substantially involves structural Al-O sites and not only Fe-O sites. To conclude, both Fe oxide-hydroxides and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> should be considered in PO 4 retention modelling in soils as they considerably influence sorption processes...|$|R

A synergistic interaction was evident between saline water and <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> in stabilising the froth and recovering combustible matter by true flotation.
