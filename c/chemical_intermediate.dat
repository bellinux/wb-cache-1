25|$|Sorbitol is {{identified}} as a potential key <b>chemical</b> <b>intermediate</b> for production of fuels from biomass resources.

25|$|Furfural is an {{important}} renewable, non-petroleum based, chemical feedstock. Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA) which is a useful <b>chemical</b> <b>intermediate</b> in for example the manufacture of furan resin prepolymers exploited in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) which {{is used as a}} nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure. Furfural is used to make other furan chemicals, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation. Furfural is also {{an important}} chemical solvent.|$|E

25|$|In 2012 {{researchers}} {{developed a}} method for storing electrical energy as chemical energy in higher alcohols (including butanol). These alcohols can then be used as liquid transportation fuels. The team led by James C. Liao genetically engineered lithoautotrophic microorganism known as Ralstonia Eutropha H16 to produce isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol in an electro-bioreactor. Carbon dioxide is the sole carbon source for this process and electricity is used as the energetic component. The process they developed effectively separates the light and dark reactions that occur during photosynthesis. Solar panels are used to convert sunlight to electrical energy which is then converted using the microorganism to a <b>chemical</b> <b>intermediate.</b> The team {{is now in the}} process of scaling up the operation and believes this process will be more efficient than the biologic process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of acrylamide {{is used to}} manufacture various polymers. In the 1970s and 1980s, the proportionately largest use of these polymers was in water treatment.

2500|$|A {{by-product}} of the transesterification {{process is the}} production of glycerol. For every 1 tonne of biodiesel that is manufactured, 100kg of glycerol are produced. Originally, there was a valuable market for the glycerol, which assisted {{the economics of the}} process as a whole. However, with the increase in global biodiesel production, the market price for this crude glycerol (containing 20% water and catalyst residues) has crashed. Research is being conducted globally to use this glycerol as a chemical building block (see <b>chemical</b> <b>intermediate</b> under Wikipedia article [...] "Glycerol"). One initiative in the UK is The Glycerol Challenge.|$|E

It is also a significant sulfur-containing impurity in synthesis gas.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, 45 {{thousand}} {{metric tons}} of isopropyl alcohol {{were used in the}} United States. The vast majority of isopropyl alcohol was used as a solvent for coatings or for industrial processes.

Isopropyl alcohol in particular is popular for pharmaceutical applications, it is presumed due to the low toxicity of any residues.

2500|$|Minor uses of {{ethylene}} glycol include {{the manufacture of}} capacitors, as a <b>chemical</b> <b>intermediate</b> {{in the manufacture of}} 1,4-dioxane, as an additive to prevent corrosion in liquid cooling systems for personal computers, and inside the lens devices of cathode-ray tube type of rear projection televisions. Ethylene glycol is also used in the manufacture of some vaccines, but it is not itself present in these injections. [...] It is used as a minor (1–2%) ingredient in shoe polish and also in some inks and dyes. Ethylene glycol has seen some use as a rot and fungal treatment for wood, both as a preventative and a treatment after the fact. It has been used in a few cases to treat partially rotted wooden objects to be displayed in museums. It is one of only a few treatments that are successful in dealing with rot in wooden boats, and is relatively cheap. Ethylene glycol may also be one of the minor ingredients in screen cleaning solutions, along with the main ingredient isopropyl alcohol. Ethylene glycol is commonly used as a preservative for biological specimens, especially in secondary schools during dissection as a safer alternative to formaldehyde. It can also be used in killing jars. It is also used as part of the water-based hydraulic fluid used to control subsea oil and gas production equipment.|$|E
