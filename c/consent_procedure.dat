40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of passive versus active parental <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> on response rates and nonresponse bias when recruiting 9 th grade students for a school-based alcohol intervention. Results indicated {{a significant difference in}} response rates when using passive parental <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> (91. 8 %) compared to active parental <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> (30. 4 %). Additionally, students recruited with active parental <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> reported lower rates of alcohol use and lower levels of alcohol-related consequences than those recruited with passive parental <b>consent</b> <b>procedures.</b> There were no differences in demographic variables between the two groups. Findings indicate active parental <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> may result in an underrepresentation of students reporting alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences, compromising the generalizability of findings in school-based alcohol intervention research.

40|$|Three main {{claims are}} made in this paper. First, {{it is argued that}} Onora O'Neill has {{uncovered}} a serious problem in the way medical ethicists have thought about both respect for autonomy and informed consent. Medical ethicists have tended to think that autonomous choices are intrinsically worthy of respect, and that informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> are the best way to respect the autonomous choices of individuals. However, O'Neill convincingly argues that we should abandon both these thoughts. Second, it is argued that O'Neill's proposed solution to this problem is inadequate. O'Neill's approach requires that a more modest view of the purpose of informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> be adopted. In her view, the purpose of informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> is simply to avoid deception and coercion, and the ethical justification for informed consent derives from a different ethical principle, which she calls principled autonomy. It is argued that contrary to what O'Neill claims, the wrongness of coercion cannot be derived from principled autonomy, and so its credentials as a justification for informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> is weak. Third, it is argued that we do better to rethink autonomy and informed consent in terms of respecting persons as ends in themselves, and a characteristically liberal commitment to allowing individuals to make certain categories of decisions for themselves...|$|R

5000|$|Under section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982, {{changes to}} the office of the monarch require {{unanimous}} consent of all the provinces and the federal parliament. If {{changes to the}} line of succession to the Canadian throne were found to fall under this provision, it is possible that any single provincial legislature—such as Quebec's—could hinder any attempts at change. In the aforementioned court decision, Justice J. Rouleau determined that [...] "unilateral changes by Canada to the rules of succession" [...] would be [...] "a fundamental change in the office of the Queen" [...] requiring authorizations pursuant to section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The precedent in question does not specify whether non-unilateral alterations to the rules of succession would also be considered a fundamental change in the office of Queen, requiring a constitutional amendment under the unanimous <b>consent</b> <b>procedure.</b> The judge stated that [...] "a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch is shared with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is, in his view, at the root of Canada's constitutional structure".|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of children's samples in biobanks brings forward specific ethical issues. Guidelines indicate that {{children should be}} involved in the <b>consent</b> <b>procedure.</b> It is, however, unclear how to allocate an appropriate role for children. Knowledge of current practice will be helpful in addressing this issue. Therefore, we conducted an international multiple-case study on the child's role in consent procedures in pediatric biobanks. Four biobanks were included: (1) LifeLines, (2) Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA), (3) Young-HUNT 3 and (4) the Oxford Radcliffe Biobank contribution to the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group tissue bank (ORB/CCLG). Four themes linked to the child's role in the <b>consent</b> <b>procedure</b> emerged from the multiple-case study: (1) motives to involve the child, (2) informing the child, (3) the role of dissent, assent and consent and (4) voluntariness of children to participate. We conclude that biobank characteristics influence the biobank's motives to include children in the <b>consent</b> <b>procedure.</b> Moreover, the motives to include children influence how the children are involved in the <b>consent</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{and the extent to which}} children are able to make voluntary decisions as part of the <b>consent</b> <b>procedure.</b> This insight is valuable when designing pediatric biobank governance...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} {{that the quality of}} informed consent in clinical research is often sub-optimal. Aims: To explore the conformity of patient recruitment with recommended informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> among patients who were invited to participate in a clinical study at a general teaching hospital, and to examine the association between <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> and the patients' decision to participate. Design and Methods: All inpatients discharged during a 1 -month period were invited to complete a mailed survey in which they reported whether they were invited to participate in a study and whether 13 recommended elements of informed consent actually occurred. Results: Among 1303 respondents, 265 (20. 3 %) reported that they had been invited to participate in a study, and 191 (72. 1 %) accepted. While the majority of potential participants were fully informed about practical issues related to the study (e. g. what their participation would consist in), < 50 % were informed of possible risks or benefits, and only 20 % about the origin of the study funds. Only 60 % reported satisfactory answers to items assessing the overall information process (e. g. explanations were easy to understand). Older and sicker patients reported lower levels of conformity with informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures,</b> as did patients who refused to participate in a study. Conclusions: Our results confirm that informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> fail to meet standards for many patients. In particular, consent information should be adapted to the needs of older and sicker patients.

40|$|In {{psychiatric}} practice, pharmacogenetics has {{the potential}} to identify patients with an increased risk of unsatisfactory drug responses. Genotype-guided treatment adjustments may increase benefits and reduce harm in these patients; however, pharmacogenetic testing is not (yet) common practice and more pharmacogenetic research in psychiatric patients is warranted. An important precondition for this type of research is the establishment of biobanks. In this paper, we argue that, for the storage of samples in psychiatric biobanks, waiving of consent is not ethically justifiable since the risks cannot be considered minimal and the argument of impracticability does not apply. An opt-out <b>consent</b> <b>procedure</b> is also not justifiable, since it presumes competence while the decisional competence of psychiatric patients needs to be carefully evaluated. We state that an enhanced opt-in <b>consent</b> <b>procedure</b> is ethically necessary, i. e. a procedure that supports the patients' decision-making at the time when the patient is most competent. Nevertheless, such a procedure is not the traditional exhaustive informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedure,</b> since this is not feasible in the case of biobanking. © 2012 CINP...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in the heritable aspects of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The ethical implications {{of this kind of}} research are also attracting attention. However, relatively few open-ended qualitative studies have been carried out to study these aspects. OBJECTIVE: To explore and analyse ethical issues raised by genetic research into AD. METHODS: A modified focus group technique. RESULTS: Participants stressed the importance of relatives in genetic research and suggested a family <b>consent</b> <b>procedure.</b> The <b>consent</b> <b>procedure</b> ought to be more uniform within Europe and should allow for variation in the types of research being done. The long-term results of genetic research into AD are expected to be positive while the short-term results seem likely to be negative. The perception of AD as a disease could be changed by the results from genetic research into AD, and this could have effects at the individual level (feelings of guilt and responsibility for one's own health). CONCLUSIONS: (1) The role of the family in genetic AD research differs from its role in other biomedical research into AD. The development of a family <b>consent</b> <b>procedure</b> might solve some informed consent problems. (2) Negative social consequences of genetic AD research are expected in the short term, but there are hopes of positive consequences in the long term...|$|E

40|$|Information {{technology}} {{suffers from}} a distinct lack of care with respect to adequate informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures.</b> Computer users are commonly asked to consent to various things that could threaten their personal identity, privacy, and property, yet little care is taken in assessing whether the consent is truly informed. Some software even {{takes advantage of the}} confusion rife in informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures</b> in order to install otherwise unwanted software on users’ computers (such as adware or spyware). End user licence agreements (EULAs) are a common example of these poorinformed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures,</b> which have their basis in the inappropriate use of medical informed <b>consent</b> <b>procedures,</b> instead of being based on concepts that have been developed specifically for IT. In this paper, I outline {{some of the problems that}} need to be overcome in informed consent in IT, and present a more appropriate theory for informed consent (based on the Manson and O’Neill waiver of normative expectations theory). I will then look at some current and recent suggestions for improvements or practical implementations of mechanisms to deal with informed consent. Then, in the third section, I will firstly identify the normative expectations, establish a communication framework, and then suggest an agreement mechanism that greatly improves the potential for informed consent decisions for EULAs. Examples will be used to illustrate the process, but will not cover the details of the actual legal agreement. It will, instead, focus on delivering the content of this agreement in a way that improves the user experience and focuses on changing the approach for informed consent in EULAs. Finally, I demonstrate two models that show examples of practical implementation of these concepts and make some conclusions about their feasibility...|$|R
