40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in <b>Transhipment</b> <b>Container</b> Terminal (TCT) management is to have fairly reliable and affordable predictions about vessel arrival. Terminal operators need to estimate the actual time of arrival in port {{in order to determine the}} daily demand for each work shift with greater accuracy. In this way, the resources required (human resources, equipment as well as spatial resources) can be allocated more efficiently. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 24 hours before arrival, ship operators often have to revise it due to unexpected events like weather conditions, delay in a previous port and so on. For planners the decision-making processes related to this topic can sometimes be so complex without the support of suitable methodological tools. Specific models should be adopted, in a daily planning scenario, to provide a useful support tool in TCTs. In this study, we discuss an exploratory analysis of the data affecting delays registered at a Mediterranean TCT. We present some preliminary results obtained using data mining techniques and propose a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model to reduce the range of uncertainty of ship arrivals in port. This approach is compulsory to manage vast amounts of unstructured data involved in estimating of vessel arrivals...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the realisation of a computer tool. The function of the tool is to estimate the required dimensions and quantities of essential container, dry and liquid bulk terminal elements, in an early design phase. As well as to give an estimate of the construction costs of these marine terminals. Terminal element dimensions are for instance the quay length and storage area. Examples of terminal element quantities are the number of berths and the number of ship-unloading equipment. The spear point of the tool is the probabilistic approach, in which uncertainties -concerning design rule variables- are taken into account. This approach results in probability distributions for the dimensions and quantities. The aim of the tool is to aid terminal or port designers by allowing them to easily consider a vast amount of input combinations. The designer therefore does not have to make exact assumptions that could lead to certain important combinations not being considered. The computations that the tool performs are based on research in this study. This research concerns terminal design rules and guidelines, common values of design rule variables and unit costs. For two variables -of which no common values could be found- Expert Judgement Elicitation (EJE) on uncertainty is applied. The results are weighted combinations of uncertainty distributions elicited from the experts. A different EJE on dependence is applied to estimate the relationships between average import, export and <b>transhipment</b> <b>container</b> dwell times. Finally, the tool is applied to the EMO terminal in Rotterdam. The EMO terminal is the largest dry bulk terminal in Europe. This application makes it possible to compare the tool’s results to the actual terminal properties. For the same terminal a sensitivity analysis is performed on the estimated total construction costs, to certain variables. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ISE 2015 WangZxx, 189 pages :color illustrationsTerminal {{operations}} {{are known to}} be among the most challenging operational research topics because the field is full of theories with applications to real-life practice. In the last decade, terminal operations research has been carried out on such topics as berth allocation, quay crane scheduling, yard planning, container locating and internal tractors assignment and scheduling (ITAS). The latter is a particularly important topic since it directly affects the overall performance of container terminals, involving terminal productivity, equipment utilization and service rate, as well as associated seaside operations with yard-side operations. It involves the scheduling of internal tractors to transport different loading and unloading containers between vessels at the quayside and the yard side. The idea of ITAS is to improve the internal traffic flow in the container terminal. It mainly deals with the problem of assigning different internal tractors to pick-and-drop different exporting containers from the yard side to the quayside, and importing containers from the quayside to the yard side. However, many container terminal companies are still not able to efficiently and effectively cope with ITAS in the terminal logistic. There are a few challenging problems with respect to planning and managing a container transportation network that trouble terminal operators in terminal industry. In fact, the experience of an operator plays a crucial role in making the decision for exact number of internal tractors and transportation routes in daily operations. This is due to that the number of containers and storage locations are so large that the job of assigning and scheduling internal tractors to maximize terminal efficiency and enhance service level is extremely complicated. Moreover, allocating suitable storage locations for inbound containers requires a jointly consideration of managing internal tractors. It is difficult to decide which storage locations should be reserved for a certain vessel and where an inbound container should be stored, and this situation becomes even more complicated when transhipment is required. Although ITAS has been thoroughly researched, most of the studies lack consideration of practical issues, such as terminals outsourcing a number of internal tractors to perform a set of container delivery requests, and the transportation of <b>transhipment</b> <b>containers.</b> Due to a highly competitive business environment, container terminals are facing a tradeoff between container transportation efficiency and cost. Terminals strive to increase the efficiency of container delivery, which may need good transportation schedules and internal tractor deployment strategies. The scheduling and assignment of internal tractors is critical for maintaining high terminal performance in the overall container terminal system. In this connection, this study considers ITAS integration with the internal tractor deployment strategy and transhipment operations, and new models are developed. The ultimate goal is to maximize the terminal operation efficiency. Heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve these integrated and complicated models. Computational results show that solving the integration problem as a whole can significantly improve the terminal operation efficiency. This research is not only pioneering in the area of container terminal operations, but the findings also provide a vital reference for future research on ITAS. The study has generated the following five deliverables: (i) ITAS is enriched by formulating and modeling all potential available storage locations; (ii) a novel ITAS system integrating container storage allocation and yard truck deployment strategy is identified and modeled; (iii) a two-level heuristic optimization methodology is developed to deal with the novel ITAS system, which is shown to obtain better results compared with other algorithms; (iv) a new ITAS system for <b>transhipment</b> <b>container</b> delivery and transportation in transhipment hubs is detailed demonstrated and modeled; and (v) a decomposition iterative algorithm optimization methodology for the proposed ITAS system in transhipment hubs is proposed.

40|$|Applications of Information Technology in {{the cargo}} {{handling}} business {{in general and the}} container shipping industry in particular are numerous and have grown rapidly in recent past. Software systems for cargo manifesting, operation planning, container tracking, plant operation and billing for the services provided have been developed by reputed software companies and such systems are in place in many leading ports throughout the world. The Port of Colombo started its container operation business as far back as 1979 and it is a pioneer in the Asian region. The Port of Colombo has two container terminal operators, namely Jaya Container Terminal, which is owned and operated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the South Asia Gateway Terminal, which is owned by a consortium of P & O Shipping Line, John Keells Holdings and few other private organizations. Port of Colombo has maintained prominent rank (between 2 1 s t and 3 8 t h in the world) on the basis of container volume handled annually. As a result of continuous development works carried out in the past {{with the assistance of the}} Japanese Government, total revenue of the Port of Colombo has increased from a mere Rs. 650 million in 1979 (about US$ 26 million at 1979 rate) to Rs. 16 billion at 2003 (about US $ 160 million at today's rates) and this makes SLPA the most profitable institution in Sri Lanka. Almost all major container shipping lines use the Port of Colombo facilities; few examples, Mearsk Sealand Shipping Line (world largest container shipping line), P & O Shipping Line, Evergreen Shipping Line. Terminal Operators today face challenges in providing speedy services requested by shipping lines that operate very large ships with capacity more than 8, 000 TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units). Few examples are, limitations of infrastructure (e. g. depth of the port), providing quay cranes, which can handle many rows of containers across the ship, and providing high berth productivity levels (in moves per hour), so that ship will stay a short time in the port. To provide those service requirements container terminals have to invest on information technology systems such as automated container location and positioning, wireless LAN, efficient yard operation software etc. The Port of Colombo depends on <b>transhipment</b> <b>containers</b> to maintain its current status as a recognised "Mega Container Port". But it has to face stiff competition form regional ports which are developing fast while Port of Colombo development work stagnating due to scarcity of capital. Also due to slow pace of development work, Port of Colombo finds that, it is very difficult to provide service levels requested by shipping lines. One way to improve service levels is by using an efficient information system and it will help to increase current low level of yard utilisation and vessel productivity levels to industry norm levels. This will help to increasing annual throughput capacity of the JCT from current 1. 7 million TEUs to 2. 8 million TEUs. In addition, such a system can support better flow of information with clients (e. g. using industry standard EDI messages), and online information to the shipping community. Also this will help to increase the satisfaction level of the shipping community, which is at a low ebb now...|$|R

5000|$|Many of Kerala's export-based {{industries}} that use Kochi port to route their shipments can grow considerably if they tap {{the potential of}} the State's inland water transport system. Kochi port is connected to Kerala's hinterland through inland waterways which run virtually parallel to the Arabian Sea and link major trading centres. [...] Future potentiality of business improves with improvements in external and internal factors. International Container Trans-shipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam at Cochin Coast is one of such external factor which will create lot of future potential for IWAI in Kerala. The expectations from ICTT are to attract more international cargo movement through India and to reduce the freight cost of India’s international trade. IWAI has already taken steps to utilize such opportunity. Two special terminals, which support the interchange of containers by LO-LO (Lift On, Lift Off) and RO-RO (Roll On, Roll Off) barges, are constructed on NW3, near Kochi port.Traffic will, in all likelihood, come to a halt in Kochi when hundreds of container-laden lorries take to the city roads and highways when the Vallarpadam <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> terminal becomes functional.Presuming that a container will be loaded and another one unloaded every minute, 2,880 lorries will pass through Kochi’s highways daily.

In the mean time ECT became {{the biggest and most}} advanced <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> company in Europe. ECT has two locations of transhipment in the port of Rotterdam. The first location is in the 'Eemhaven', the 'Home Terminal'. The second location of transhipment is the 'Maasvlakte', the 'Delta Terminal'. In the 'Eemshaven' the <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> takes place in a conventional way with manned equipment. The 'Delta Terminal' contains four terminals. The Delta Multi User terminal is a conventional terminal. The remaining three terminals (the Delta Dedicated North terminal, the Delta Dedicated East terminal and the Delta Dedicated West terminal) use a mainly automatic system. The quay transport and the stack are fully automatic. The landside still uses manned equipment. The partly automatic system that is described above does not always perform at the required level. The performance is expressed in terms like port time of vessels, the quay crane productivity, the waiting time of the truck drivers etcetera. Alternative terminal concepts have to be designed {{in order to be able}} to reach te desired level. The setting during this research is the second 'Maasvlakte'. The improved terminal concept design is studied here from a stacking system point of view. The various stacking systems used in the <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> and also new concepts of stacking systems are studied. By means of a multi criteria analysis, three stacking systems are selected. These systems are: the Autmatic Stacking (ASC) Crane System, the Overhead Bridge Crane (OHBC) System and the high bay warehouse. After this a comparison has been made between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system with use of the criteria use of space, transfer capacity, flexibility, reliability and costs. The comparison not only contains the two systems, but also the various lay-outs (particulary the placing of the transferpoints) of the systems. Because of the variety of concepts and the superficial research of these concepts, it was not possible to compare the high bay warehouse with the ASC- and OHBC-system on the same level. A quick scan has been made of the various concepts of the high stacking system. The comparison between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system shows that there is no obvious preference for one of the systems above. Higher cost of ground shows an increasive attractiviness of the OHBC-system. The comparison does show clearly that a stack lay-out with the transferpoints as a transport lane in the stack, offers great benefits in relation to the present lay-out with the transferpoints on top of the stackarea's. The lay-out with the transferpoints in the stacking area, stacks more containers per substack than the present lay-out. The waterside and landside transport takes place with the Automatic Lifting Vehicle (self unloading Automatic Guided Vehicle). Rough it was found that the all the concepts of the high bay warehouse are much more space effective than the ASC- and OHBC-system.

40|$|Persistent {{development}} in global trade has significantly increased {{the demand for}} liner shipping, of which the industry is now being characterised by larger vessel size, comprehensive geographical coverage and frequent restructuring of shipping lines like transhipment. In turn, {{this has led to}} tense port competition, and port attractiveness is playing a pivotal role in this aspect. Understanding this and using <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> as a case study, this paper investigates the attractiveness of the major ports in Northern Europe acting as transhipment hubs. Through a Likert-style questionnaire directed towards the top 30 shipping lines, it was found that Hamburg and Rotterdam are the most attractive options acting as transhipment hubs within Northern Europe, with Antwerp and Bremerhaven closely behind. Felixstowe and Le Havre are the least attractive options requiring substantial improvements to change the current situation. In general, the opinion of shipping lines in port attractiveness seems to be in accordance to their decisions on transhipment hub choices. It is believed that this paper can shed some light on the attractiveness of major North European ports and the methodology of assessing port attractiveness, as well as providing a springboard for further research related to port competition.

The use of low-carbon and zero-sulphur fuel (liquefied natural gas) and improvements in operational efficiency (cargo handling and scheduling) mean predicted Green house gas emissions should fall by 42 % and 40 % in the two selected operational regions. The adoption of a Multi-wing sail system reduces power requirement by up to 6 % at the lower ship speed of 15 knots.

40|$|Traditionally, {{maritime}} economists, {{ports and}} shipping lines have considered <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> {{to be more}} expensive than direct call services, mainly {{by virtue of the}} extra feeder costs and container lift charges involved. This seems contrary to ongoing industry developments, with transhipment hubs now quite common in most major regions. Here, modelled costs for transhipment in northern Europe have been estimated and compared with an alternative multiport service. The conclusion is that transhipment can offer substantial operating and capital cost advantages compared with multiport direct call services. The explanation for transhipment advantages relates to diseconomies both at sea and in port associated with multiport style itineraries, coupled with container handling cost and productivity advantages pertaining to pure transhipment terminals, added to enhanced feedership economies of scale. In line with a move towards hub–hub shuttles and associated feeder services, these results indicate that further developments might be expected in regard to offshore transhipment hub terminals being provided as low-cost container transfer points for very large vessels. Policy makers {{need to be aware of}} the net benefits, both ecological and economic, resulting from increased use of offshore transhipment terminals as an alternative to continued artificial development (and duplication) of big ship container terminal capacity within constrained traditional port locations, and any requirement for support thereof.

Apart from providing a theoretical framework, Port Competitiveness Model, to future port research, this thesis also aims to identify the major factors affecting port attractiveness, to assess port choice behaviour, to investigate the current port competitiveness and to forecast their future prospects in the market. Research methodology involves various quantitative modelling techniques including generalized cost calculations (to assess port attractiveness), Multinomial Logit Model (to assess port choice behaviours of liners and the current competitive positions of ports) and Logistic Regression (to predict port competitiveness in the future), while data collection includes a questionnaire survey of major liners and various in-depth interviews with port and shipping experts in Europe. Findings indicate that money and time are not sufficient to explain the choices of liners and other less-quantifiable factors like geography, quality of services, values and perceptions, inertia, limitations of liners are also significant. Rotterdam is currently the overall market leader in the North European transhipment market but may be fragile in resisting challenges from competitors while Hamburg is a regional leader in the Scandinavia-Baltic market. On the other hand, Bremerhaven is currently an underachiever but possesses potential if it changes its current competitive strategies while Antwerp also possesses potential but faces different problems in its developments. For poor performing ports like Felixstowe and Le Havre, they need to improve significantly before they can really compete. Also, results suggest that ports should not only focus on expensive physical improvements (like infrastructure) but should also pay attention to software aspects in port operations e. g. management, marketing, etc. The key to achieve port competitiveness does not depend on port's administrative system but on how it executes the system and makes things work.

40|$|The {{container}} traffic growth worldwide continues to increase. To {{keep up with}} the growth, shipping companies keep enlarging container ship size. The handling speed of the terminal will especially be a critical factor for the largest vessels. Terminals {{have to be able to}} serve these ships as best as possible. To keep the dwell time of the ships visiting a terminal to a minimum, the handling capacities on the terminal must get bigger. To achieve a maximum effectiveness of portainer productivity in relation to the land side of the terminal, the horizontal transportation and the stacking of the containers must be optimised. The amount of land available for expanding an existing terminal or creating a new terminal is scarce. When designing a terminal this is a very important factor to take into account. To minimise operating costs and maximise efficiency, automation of the terminal also is a factor to take into account. The goal of this study has been to design a <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> terminal capable of handling mega container vessels and analysing the logistic processes that take place on this terminal. The analysis will be performed by a computer simulation in the simulation language PROSIM. The designed transhipment terminal consists of three berths, two feeder berths and one mega vessel berth. The ship to shore container handling takes place by using portainers. The horizontal transportation takes place by rail mounted automated guided vehicles (rgv's) that use linear motor based transfer technology as their source of propulsion. The rgv's take corners by having their wheels rotated by four disks integrated in the rail system. Container storage takes place by stacking containers in racks placed in warehouses. This allows random access to the containers eliminating the time consuming shuffling. With these components a terminal layout has been designed. Based on this layout a computer simulation has been carried out in order to analyse the logistic processes on the terminal. Having assumed an average portainer capacity of 1 move per minute the achieved handling rates lie between 194 moves per hour and the 236 moves per hour for the feeder vessel berths, where the handling takes place by four portainers. The handling rates on the mega vessel berth lie between the 300 moves per hour and the 352 moves per hour. Here the vessel handling takes place by 6 portainers. Portainer occupancy rates of 95 - 98 % have been achieved during the unloading process of the container vessels. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|After events 9 / 11 the {{unpredictable}} changes {{have affected the}} global container flows in international affairs. In order to define and explore the trade-off between international security requirements and reasonably practicable measures for business, the analysis {{of one of the}} application of e-seal technology, promising to improve container transportation processes, have been evaluated in this doctoral research. The intent of this research is to investigate the impact of container detection intrusion technology on dynamics of container logistics processes at container terminals and on the complete network. In this study a model for <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> between two continents through several see ports consisting of several maritime terminals and customs gates is developed. In this scenario we compare transhipment processes for three different types of container seals. One type is when containers are equipped with conventional mechanical seals, the next one is an e-seal without decision making, and the last one is an e-seal with a possibility to make routing decisions. These three cases are compared and the difference in dynamics of the transport processes is investigated. First we apply the methods of queuing theory as a most suitable mathematical tool for the analysis of the dynamics. We show that this theory works effectively in case of small number of nodes. However it turns out that we arrive at its limitations when the number of nodes becomes large. For this reason we continue our investigations with help of simulation technique by means of MATLAB that has been applied to a generic container logistic network. Further we also have estimated the economical effectiveness of investments in new container secure devices. It is evaluated whether the electronic seals bring more security for container flows. As well we have investigated their influence on the business efficiency for private sector. The evaluation and analysis of modifications in dynamics of physical container flows have been accomplished through the global container supply network {{in the first part of}} the thesis. In the second main part of the doctoral research the cost-benefit analysis shows the possible costs and benefits through the implementation and use of secure container electronic seals in global container network. In this work we have determined the most feasible advantages of application of e-seals technology and the framework of its application. The influence of different types of e-seals on the dynamics of container logistics flows has been investigated, simulated and modelled analytically in the global network; various scenarios have been developed and considered to include the most happened situations in the practical cases. An evaluation model based on the cost-benefit analysis has been proposed and approved by different business cases for adoption of different types of e-seals in container system. The returns on investment index have been calculated to compare the investments in security electronic devices under different initial conditions...|$|E
40|$|A fast sail {{assisted}} feeder {{container ship}} concept {{has been developed}} for the 2020 container market in the South East Asian and Caribbean regions. The design presented has met the requirements of an initial economic study, with a cargo capacity of 1270 twenty-foot equivalent unit containers, meeting the predictions of container throughput derived from historical data. In determining suitable vessel dimensions, account has also been taken for port and berthing restrictions, and considering hydrodynamic performance. The vessel has been designed for a maximum speed of 25 knots, allowing it {{to meet the demand}} for trade whilst reducing the number of ships operating on the routes considered. The design development of the fast feeder concept has involved rigorous analyses {{in a number of areas}} to improve the robustness of the final design. Model testing has been key to the development of the concept, by increasing confidence in the final result. This is due to the fact that other analysis techniques are not always appropriate or accurate. Two hull forms have been developed to meet requirements whilst utilising different propulsor combinations. This has enabled evaluation of efficiency gains resulting from different hydrodynamic phenomena for each design. This includes an evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance when utilising the sail system. This has been done using a combination of model test results and data from regression analysis. The final propulsor chosen is a contra-rotating podded drive arrangement. Wind tunnel testing has been used to maximise the performance of a Multi-wing sail system by investigating the effects of wing spacing, stagger and sail-container interactions. This has led to an increase in lift coefficient of 32 % from initial predictions. The savings in power requirement due to the sail system are lower than initially predicted. However, another benefit of their installation, motion damping, has been identified. Whilst this has not been fully investigated, additional fuel savings are possible as well as improved seakeeping performance. The design is shown to be environmentally sustainable when compared to existing vessels operating on the proposed routes. This is largely due to the use of low-carbon and zero-sulphur fuel (liquefied natural gas) and improvements in efficiency regarding operation. This especially relates to cargo handling and scheduling. Green house gas emissions have been predicted to fall by 42 % and 40 % in the two regions should the design be adopted. These savings are also due to the use of the Multi-wing sail system, which contributes to reductions in power requirement of up to 6 % when the vessel operates at its lower speed of 15 knots. It is demonstrated that the fast feeder is also economically feasible, with predicted daily cost savings of 27 % and 33 % in the South East Asian and Caribbean regions respectively. Thus the fast feeder container ship concept is a viable solution for the future of <b>container</b> <b>transhipment.</b> <br/...|$|E
30|$|Research on modelling, and {{optimization}} of {{the operational}} and economic {{performances of the}} liner shipping networks has generally dealt with explaining the factors influencing growth in the container ship size means by the liner service cash flow model. The results have shown that economies of scale have {{and will continue to}} be one of the main driving forces behind deployment of the larger container ships. In addition, the optimal ship size has been dependent of the characteristics of port terminals and trade route(s)/market(s) it has been deployed (Christa et al. 2008). The additional research has investigated viability of the mega-container ships operating in H&S compared to that of the conventional ships operating in MPC shipping networks by using a non-zero sum two-person game. The results have indicated that the viability of mega container ships operating in the H&S case-based network(s) has been strongly influenced by the relationships between ship size, the level and structure of costs of ship operator(s), and the freight rate influenced by the market competition (Imai et al. 2006). In addition, estimating the quality of liner shipping operations and particularly those at ports and their container terminals has also been highly on the research agenda. The corresponding research has resulted in developing the methodology based on the measures of the given port’s time and cost performances and their balancing indicating the need for eventual investments (in additional berths and/or terminals). The methodology has expected to be useful for the decision/policy makers in the given context (Bassan 2007). As well, the research has been carried out embracing: estimating and modelling possible ways of shortening if not optimizing the door-to-door delivery time of TEU flows - through shortening the ships’ sailing and berth time including use of the alternative routes; reducing the <b>container</b> <b>transhipment</b> time by applying different transhipment policies (existing forward and many-to-one and new backward and many-to-one); and through the innovative stacking and reshuffling strategies in the port container terminals. The developed empirical, analytical, and optimization models and their results have been expected to contribute to improvement of the route design, development of ship fleet, optimization of sailing speed, and disruption management (Grida et al. 2018). The research results have also indicated potential contribution to reducing the total costs of delivering TEU flows thanks to sailing along the alternative routes (Furuichi and Otsuka 2018), applying innovative transhipment policies (Du et al. 2017) and the innovative stacking and reshuffling strategies of containers (Gharehgozli et al. 2017). These all would substantively reduce the transhipment time of TEU flows and other cargo, in the former case at very low costs, and in the latter case by improving efficiency of handling mega ships at the port container terminals. Last but not least, the most recent research has dealt with different aspects of consideration including predominantly simulation and analytical approach to analyzing and modelling of the national and international maritime transport networks regarding their past and present development, topology and spatial distribution (particularly emergence and strengthening of the global container shipping networks), and influence on the regional development (Ducruet 2018).|$|E
