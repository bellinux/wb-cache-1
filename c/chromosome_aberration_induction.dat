40|$|The early {{pronucleus}} {{stage of}} the mouse zygote has been characterised in vitro as radiosensitive, due to {{a high rate of}} induction of chromosome-type chromosome abnormalities (CA). We have investigated the repair of irradiation induced double strand DNA breaks in vivo by γH 2 AX foci and first cleavage metaphase analysis. Breaks were induced in sperm and in the early zygote stages comprising sperm chromatin remodelling and early pronucleus expansion. Moreover, the role of PARP 1 in the formation and repair of spontaneous and radiation-induced double strand breaks in the zygote was evaluated by comparing observations in C 57 BL/ 6 J and PARP 1 genetically ablated females. The results confirmed in vivo that the rate of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> <b>induction</b> by X-rays was approximately 3 -fold higher in the zygote than in mouse lymphocytes. This finding was related to a diminished efficiency of double strand break signalling, as shown by a lower rate of γH 2 AX radiation-induced foci compared to that measured in most other somatic cell types. The spontaneous frequency of CA in PARP 1 depleted zygotes was slightly but significantly higher than in wild type zygotes. Also, these zygotes showed some impairment of the radiation-induced DNA Damage Response when exposed closer to the start of S-phase, revealed by a higher number of γH 2 AX foci and a longer cell cycle delay. The rate of chromosome aberrations, however, was not elevated over that of wild type zygotes, possibly thanks to backup repair pathways and/or selection mechanisms against damaged cells. When comparing with the literature data on irradiation induced CA in mouse zygotes in vitro, the levels of induction were strikingly similar as was the frequency of misrepair of double strand breaks (γH 2 AX foci). This result can be reassuring for in vitro human gamete and embryo handling, because it shows that culture conditions do not significantly affect double strand DNA break repair...|$|E

The incidence of induced embryonic abnormalities {{as a consequence of}} irradiation in these various stages was 26 percent, 100 percent, 88 percent, and 0 percent respectively.

It is not well {{understood}} how different radiation sources induce genetic instability in cells with different genetic background. Here we report our studies on genetic instability, particularly chromosome instability using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), in human primary lymphocytes, normal human fibroblasts, and transformed human mammary epithelial cells in a temporal manner after exposure to high energy protons and Fe ions. The chromosome spread was prepared 48 hours, 1 week, 2 week, and 1 month after radiation exposure. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were analyzed with whole chromosome specific probes (chr. 3 and chr. 6). After exposure to protons and Fe ions of similar cumulative energy (??), Fe ions induced more chromosomal aberrations at early time point (48 hours) in all three types of cells. Over time (after 1 month), more <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were observed in cells exposed to Fe ions than in the same type of cells exposed to protons. While the mammary epithelial cells have higher intrinsic genetic instability and higher rate of initial <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> than the fibroblasts, the fibroblasts retained more chromosomal aberration after long term cell culture (1 month) in comparison to their initial frequency of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration.</b> In lymphocytes, the <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency at 1 month after exposure to Fe ions was close to unexposed background, and the <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency at 1 month after exposure to proton was much higher.

40|$|Investigation of {{radiation}} induced damage in mutant strains of mammalian cells which show a {{defect in the}} rejoining of DNA double strand breaks provides an unique opportunity to examine the role of double strand breaks and the mechanisms of double strand break rejoining {{in the production of}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> This is particularly important, because there is increasing evidence that the DNA double strand break is the major lesion responsible for the formation of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> To address this issue, we studied the <b>induction</b> of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in xrs- 5 cells, an x-ray sensitive strain of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which shows a defect in the rejoining of double strand breaks and their wild-type parent CHO-cells. Because radiosensitivity depends strongly on cellular age, the experiments were performed with synchronous cells...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal {{studies in}} {{peripheral}} lymphocytes from 63 residents near the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, at ages of 52 – 63 years old, were performed in 2001 – 2002. A {{higher rate of}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> was observed in the two contaminated villages, Dolon and Sarjal, compared with the control village, Kokpekti. Moreover, a relationship of frequency of cells with radiation induced <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> and the previously estimated exposure dose was observed. Furthermore, apparent nuclear abnormalities (ANA) of thyroid follicular cells were studied in 30 out of 63 residents, who were examined for <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> A higher rate of ANA was {{also found in the}} residents in the exposed villages compared with those in the control village. These results suggest radiation effects both on the chromosomes in peripheral lymphocytes and on the follicular cells in the thyroid...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{regret that}} a mistake {{occurred}} in Section 4. 2. 3 of the discussion, in the summary (Section 5) {{and in the}} abstract, when comparing their own results with data from the literature (Yasui 2004; Sedelnikova et al., 2002). The argumentation that every 125 I-induced dsb is converted into a <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> is wrong. We made an incorrect calculation when correlating the decays per cell with the resulting <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> After reconsideration, our data (based on nine experiments) indicate that it takes on average 250 decays to induce one <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> (CA). Thus, the comparison of our CA data with the DSB data from Yasui [18] and Sedelnikova et al. [17] seems to be not adequate anymore. The {{authors would like to}} apologise for any inconvenience caused...|$|R
40|$|While {{autosomal}} numeric chromosome abnormalities are phenotipically visible (abnormal body conformation) {{and easily}} eliminated during the normal breeding selection, sex numeric abnormalities (including {{the cases of}} free-martinism), {{as well as the}} structural <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations,</b> especially the balanced ones, are more tolerate by the animals (normal body conformation) but are often responsible of low fertility (structural abnormalities) or sterility (sex <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations),</b> especially in the females.

40|$|FISH, mFISH, mBAND, {{telomere}} and centromere probes {{have been}} used to study <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> induced in human cells exposed to low-and high-LET radiation in vitro. High-LET induced damages are mostly a single track effect. Unrejoined chromosome breaks (incomplete exchanges) and complex type aberrations were higher for high-LET. Biosignatures may depend on the method the samples are collected. Recent mBAND analysis has revealed more information about the nature of intra-chromosome exchanges. Whether space flight/microgravity affects radiation-induced <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> frequencies is still an open question...|$|R

Three parameters were studied: (1) root elongation, (2) the mitotic index, and (3) <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The effects of increasing concentrations of surfactants were: (1) reduction in root length; (2) decrease in mitotic index and (3) induction of {{a high level of}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The effects of ABS and Citowett suggest caution with regard to inappropriate use of these substances...|$|R
