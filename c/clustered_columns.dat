These materials were worked into 700 carved elements by a number of different artists and sculptors under the direction of Ira Lake, who desired to tell not only the complete story of Canada's participation in the First World War, but also to commemorate military units {{as far back as the}} 17th century regime of New France.|$|E

500|$|The cathedral {{is widely}} {{considered}} a masterpiece of Armenian architecture. It is {{the largest and most}} impressive structure of Ani, and has been described by Armen Kazaryan as the most significant structure of the entire Bagratid period. The cathedral is known for its novel design features. Authors of Global History of Architecture wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the principal monuments of the time because of its pointed arches and <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> and piers." [...] Josef Strzygowski argued that the cathedral is the most valuable achievement of Armenian architecture from the European viewpoint. David Marshall Lang wrote that the cathedral's building techniques are [...] "far ahead of the contemporary Anglo-Saxon and Norman architecture of western Europe." [...] H. F. B. Lynch wrote: [...] "The impression which we take away from our survey of these various features is that we have been introduced to a monument of the highest artistic merit, denoting a standard of culture which was far in advance of the contemporary standards in the West." [...] Sirarpie Der Nersessian wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the important examples of medieval architecture." [...] The New International Encyclopedia characterized it as the [...] "most interesting church of Armenia." [...] David Roden Buxton suggested that the cathedral deserves far more fame than it actually has. Richard Phené Spiers wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911): ...|$|E

Its interior features date from the early 19th century. The room is crossed by two screens, each flanked with <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> whose [...] "delicate" [...] capitals are decorated with lilies and leaves, described as acanthus or lotus. Similar columns also flank the room's marble chimneypiece. The leaf design is repeated on the coving of the modern entrance hall and internal passage.

40|$|A {{new family}} of low-complexity array codes is {{proposed}} for correcting 4 column erasures. The new codes are tailored {{for the new}} error model of <b>clustered</b> <b>column</b> erasures that captures the properties of highorder failure combinations in storage arrays. The model of <b>clustered</b> <b>column</b> erasures considers the number of erased columns, together {{with the number of}} clusters into which they fall, without pre-defining the sizes of the clusters. This model addresses the problem of correlated device failures in storage arrays, whereby each failure event may affect multiple devices in a single cluster. The new codes correct essentially all combinations of clustered 4 erasures, i. e. those combinations that fall into three or less clusters. The new codes are significantly more efficient, in all relevant complexity measures, than the best known 4 -erasure correcting codes. These measures include encoding complexity, decoding complexity and update complexity...|$|R

60|$|We have endeavoured {{slightly}} to sketch St. Geneviève {{as it appeared}} to our friends from Beaumanoir, winding into the valley the day after Mr. Lyle had dined with them. The valley opened for about half-a-mile opposite the mansion, which gave to the dwellers in it a view over an extensive and richly-cultivated country. It was through this district that the party from Beaumanoir had pursued their way. The first glance at the building, its striking situation, its beautiful form, its brilliant colour, its great extent, a gathering as it seemed of galleries, halls, and chapels, mullioned windows, portals of <b>clustered</b> <b>columns,</b> and groups of airy pinnacles and fretwork spires, called forth a general cry of wonder and of praise.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{beautiful}} cloister, a double walk with <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> running down the centre and a vaulted roof, and with a fountain {{in the midst of}} the quadrangle. There was a chapel on one side, the buildings of the Priory on the others. It was only a Priory, for the parent Abbey was in the country; but the Prioress was a noble lady of the house of Stafford, a small personage as to stature, but thoroughly alert and business-like, and, in fact, the moving spring, not only of the actual house, but of the parent Abbey, manager of the property it possessed in the city, and of all its monastic politics.|$|E
60|$|The castle is Tudor, but {{the cathedral}} is beyond all other English cathedrals, I believe, Norman, though {{to the naked}} eye it looks so Gothic, and {{probably}} is. Here I will leave the reader with any pictures or memories of it which he happens to have, for I have always held it a sin to try describing architecture, or if not a sin, a bore. What chiefly remains to me of my impression of Durham Cathedral is, strangely enough, an objection: I did not like those decorated pillars, alternating with the <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> of the interior, and I do not suppose I ever shall: the spiral furrows, the zigzag and lozenge figures chiselled in their surfaces, weakened them to the eye and seemed to trifle with their proud bulk.|$|E

60|$|Without reply, {{the knight}} hastily muffled the recluse's {{head in the}} veil, and the latter began to ascend the {{staircase}} as one too much accustomed to the way to {{require the use of}} light, {{while at the same time}} he held the lamp to the Scot, who followed him for many steps up the narrow ascent. At length they rested in a small vault of irregular form, in one nook of which the staircase terminated, while in another corner a corresponding stair was seen to continue the ascent. In a third angle was a Gothic door, very rudely ornamented with the usual attributes of <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> and carving, and defended by a wicket, strongly guarded with iron, and studded with large nails. To this last point the hermit directed his steps, which seemed to falter as he approached it.|$|E
60|$|My {{last visit}} was paid after I had {{seen so many}} other English cathedrals that I had begun to say, if not to think, that England was overgothicized, and that I should be glad, or at least relieved, by {{something}} classicistic. But I found that I was mistaken. That architecture is alien to the English sky and alien to the English faith, which continues the ancient tradition in terms not ceremonially very distinct from those of Rome; and coming freshly from the minster in York to the cathedral in London, I was aware of differences which were all {{in favor of the}} elder fane. The minster now asserted its superior majesty, and its mere magnitude, the sweep of its mighty nave, the bulk of its <b>clustered</b> <b>columns,</b> the splendor of its vast and lofty windows, as they held their own in my memory, dwarfed St. Paul's as much physically as spiritually.|$|E
60|$|The {{interior}} disappointed us; not {{but what}} it was very beautiful, but I think the excellent repair that it was in, and the Puritanic neatness with which it is kept, does much towards effacing the majesty and mystery that belong to an old church. Every inch of every wall and column, and all the mouldings and tracery, and every scrap of grotesque carving, had been washed with a drab mixture. There were likewise seats {{all up and down}} the nave, made of pine wood, and looking very new and neat, just such seats as I shall see in a hundred meeting-houses (if ever I go into so many) in America. Whatever might be the reason, the stately nave, with its high-groined roof, the <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> and lofty pillars, the intersecting arches of the side-aisles, the choir, the armorial and knightly tombs that surround what was once the high altar, all produced far less effect than I could have thought beforehand.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, {{during the}} tenure of the Rev.

A framework of steel was put in to support both gallery and roof. A new organ, having parts in chancel and gallery, was installed. This structural reworking required the complete removal of Rector Harwood’s stenciled nave ceiling. Visually strong gilt plaster groins rising from the limestone column surrounds formed the new nave ceiling, providing an effect reflective of a High Gothic cathedral.|$|R
50|$|Architect William Washburn {{designed}} the church building in 1835. In 1851, Isaac Smith Homans said:The interior is beautifully painted by M. Bragaldi. The {{exterior of the}} building, including the towers (which are of the octagonal form), is 87 feet; breadth 68 feet. The basement is divided into 2 large rooms for lectures, Sunday-schools, &c. The height from the main floor above the basement to {{the centre of the}} main arch, is 45 feet; an arch is thrown over each of the side galleries, which is intersected by arches opposite the three windows on each side, and resting on each side upon four <b>cluster</b> <b>columns</b> of 24 inches diameter.|$|R
60|$|Outside, in {{the piazza}} before the church, {{there was an}} idle, cruel crowd, amusing itself with the efforts of a blind old man to find the entrance.

At other times he paused, and wildly clasped his hands upon his eyes, or wildly threw up his arms; and then began to run to and fro again uneasily, while the crowd laughed and jeered. Doubtless a taint of madness afflicted him; but not the less he seemed the type of a blind soul that gropes darkly about through life, to find the doorway of some divine truth or beauty,--touched by the heavenly harmonies from within, and miserably failing, amid the scornful cries and bitter glee of those who have no will but to mock aspiration.|$|E

O beloved beauty of aspiring arches, of slender and <b>clustered</b> <b>columns,</b> of flowering capitals and window-traceries, of many-carven breadths and heights, wherein all Nature breathes and blossoms again! There is neither Greek perfection, nor winning Byzantine languor, nor insolent Renaissance opulence, which may compare with this loveliness of yours! Alas that the interior of this Gothic temple of Genoa should abound in the abomination of rococo restoration!

60|$|Their {{business}} did not occupy {{them very}} long, and {{they entered the}} Cathedral before the anthem was over; but Marian {{felt that it was}} not fitting to loiter about the nave while worship was going on within the choir; and the uncomfortable feeling occupied her so much, that she could hardly look at the fair <b>clustered</b> <b>columns</b> and graceful arches, and seemed scarcely to know or care for the gallant William Longsword, when led to the side of his mail-clad, cross-legged effigy. The deep notes of the organ, which delighted Caroline, gave her a sense of shame; and even when the service was over, and they entered the choir, these thoughts had not so passed away as to enable her to give full admiration to the exquisite leafy capitals and taper arcades of the Lady Chapel. Perhaps, too, there was a little perverseness in her inability to think that this Cathedral surpassed that of Exeter.|$|E

50|$|Compound pier or Cluster pier is the {{architectural}} term {{given to a}} <b>clustered</b> <b>column</b> or pier which consists of a centre mass or newel, to which engaged or semi-detached shafts have been attached, in order to perform (or to suggest the performance of) certain definite structural objects, such as to carry arches of additional orders, or to support the transverse or diagonal ribs of a vault, or the tie-beam of an important roof. In these cases, though performing different functions, the drums of the pier are often cut out of one stone. There are, however, cases where the shafts are detached from the pier and coupled to it by armulets at regular heights, as in the Early English period.|$|R
