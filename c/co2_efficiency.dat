5000|$|A {{detailed}} comparison among PEI {{and other}} amino-containing molecules showed an excellence performance of PEI-containing samples with cycles. Also, {{only a slight}} decrease was registered in their CO2 uptake when increasing the temperature from 25 to 100°C, demonstrating a high contribution of chemisorption to the adsorption capacity of these solids. For the same reason, the adsorption capacity under diluted CO2 was up to 90% of the value under pure CO2 and also, a high unwanted selectivity towards SO2 was observed. Lately, many efforts {{have been made in}} order to improve PEI diffusion within the porous structure of the support used. A better dispersion of PEI and a higher <b>CO2</b> <b>efficiency</b> (CO2/NH molar ratio) were achieved by impregnating a template-occluded PE-MCM-41 material rather than perfect cylindrical pores of a calcined material, following a previously described route. The combined use of organosilanes such as aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, AP, and PEI has also been studied. The first approach used a combination of them to impregnate porous supports, achieving faster CO2-adsorption kinetics and higher stability during reutilization cycles, but no higher efficiencies. A novel method is the so-called [...] "double-functionalization". It is based on the impregnation of materials previously functionalized by grafting (covalent bonding of organosilanes). Amino groups incorporated by both paths have shown synergic effects, achieving high CO2 uptakes up to 235 mg CO2/g (5.34 mmol CO2/g). CO2 adsorption kinetics were also studied for these materials, showing similar adsorption rates than impregnated solids. This is an interesting finding, taking into account the smaller pore volume available in double-functionalized materials. Thus, it can be also concluded that their higher CO2 uptake and efficiency compared to impregnated solids can be ascribed to a synergic effect of the amino groups incorporated by two methods (grafting and impregnation) rather than to a faster adsorption kinetics.|$|E

40|$|Tight oil {{resources}} {{have become increasingly}} important as massive hydraulic fracturing techniques breakthrough. Water flooding is generally applied to tight oil reservoirs; however, the oil recovery achieved by water flooding is quite low. A CO₂ miscible flooding process {{is regarded as a}} primary enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique for conventional oil reservoirs as CO 2 can extract oil even at a high water cut. Furthermore, many CO₂ field trials in low permeability reservoirs have been recorded as successful. As <b>CO₂</b> utilization <b>efficiency</b> drops when formation permeability goes down, CO₂ injection in a miscible condition for tight oil exploitation may not be as profitable as that in conventional oil reservoirs. In tight formations, there exist small pore throats, even at nanoscale. As the confined space in nanopores may shift a phase envelop and lower CO₂ minimum miscible pressure (MMP), operating a well in a near-miscible region where pressure is slightly less than MMP as measured in the lab may result in a good chance of miscibility for some parts of a tight oil reservoir. In this paper, equations of state (EOS) calculations are conducted in order to see the effects of confinement on a CO₂ injection process in tight oil reservoirs. On the basis of Cardium reservoir properties, numerical reservoir simulations are run to investigate the effects of confinement caused by a small pore throat size in 50 nm and 10 nm on the CO₂ injection process. Comparisons of CO₂ near-miscible and miscible processes are made with various pore throat sizes. Results show that confinement effects in tight formations help to lower the bubble point pressure and boost an oil rate during CO 2 injection. However, <b>CO₂</b> EOR <b>efficiency</b> goes down as formation pressure approaches MMP as mearsured in the lab. It is not necessary for CO₂ injection to operate in an above MMP condition in tight formations, where a nanopore size is present. In this way, the volume of CO₂ injected can be reduced. For tight oil reservoirs with a small pore throat size, a CO₂ near-miscible process is more suitable than miscible flooding. K. Zhang, M. E. Gonzalez Perdomo, B. Kong, K. O. Sebakhy, K. Wu, G.

During sequestration, carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas effluent is captured from coal fired power plants and is injected into a storage saline aquifer or depleted oil reservoir. In an effort to fully understand and optimize <b>CO₂</b> trapping <b>efficiency,</b> the capillary trapping mechanisms that immobilize subsurface CO₂ were analyzed at the pore-scale. Pairs of proxy fluids representing the range of in situ supercritical CO₂ and brine conditions were used during experimentation. The two fluids (identified as wetting and non-wetting) were imbibed and drained from a flow cell apparatus containing a sintered glass bead column. Experimental and fluid parameters, such as interfacial tension, fluid viscosities and flow rate, were altered to characterize their relative impact on capillary trapping. Computed x-ray microtomography (CMT) was used to identify immobilized CO₂ (non-wetting fluid) volumes after imbibition and drainage events. CMT analyzed data suggests that capillary behavior in glass bead systems do not follow the same trends as in consolidated natural material systems. An analysis of the disconnected phases in both the initial and final flood events indicate that the final (residual) amount of trapped non-wetting phase has a strong linear dependence on the original amount of non-wetting phase (after primary imbibition), which corresponds to the amount of gas or oil present in the formation prior to CO₂ injection. More importantly, the residual trapped gas was also observed to increase with increasing non-wetting fluid phase viscosity. This suggests that CO₂ sequestration can be optimized in two ways: through characterization of the trapped fluid present in the formation prior to injection and through alterations to the viscosity of supercritical CO 2...|$|R

Its <b>efficiency</b> and performance depend critically on the reduction and oxidation (redox) properties of the oxygen carriers (OC). Ceria is {{recognized as one of}} the most promising OC candidates, because of its fast chemistry, high ionic diffusivity, and large oxygen storage capacity. The fundamental surface redox pathways, including the complex interactions of mobile ions and electrons between the bulk and the surface, along with the adsorbates and electrostatic fields, remain yet unresolved. This work presents a detailed redox kinetics study with emphasis on the surface ion-incorporation kinetics pathway, using time-resolved and systematic measurements in the temperature range 600 – 1000 °C. By using fine ceria nanopowder, we observe an order-of-magnitude higher hydrogen production rate compared to the state-of-the-art thermochemical or reactive chemical-looping {{water splitting}} studies. We show that the reduction is the rate-limiting step, and it determines the total amount of hydrogen produced in the following oxidation step. The redox kinetics is modeled using a two-step surface chemistry (an H 2 O adsorption/dissociation step and a charge-transfer step), coupled with the bulk-to-surface transport equilibrium. Kinetics and equilibrium parameters are extracted with excellent agreement with measurements. The model reveals that the surface defects are abundant during redox conditions, and charge transfer is the rate-determining step for H₂ production.

40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{performance of}} TiO(2) -SiMgO(x) ceramic plates for trichloroethylene abatement in gas phase has been evaluated under sun irradiance conditions. A continuous flow Pyrex glass reactor {{fixed on the}} focus of a compound parabolic collector has been used. The performance of the hybrid photocatalyst has been evaluated as the variation of TCE conversion and reaction products formation with the solar irradiance at different total gas flow, TCE concentration, and water vapour content. SiMgO(x) not only provides adsorbent properties to the photocatalyst, but it also allows the effective use of the material during low solar irradiance conditions. The adsorption-desorption phenomena play a pivotal role in the behaviour of the system. Thus, TCE conversion curves present two different branches when the sun irradiance increases (sunrise) or decreases (sunset). CO(2), COCl(2) and DCAC were the most relevant products detected. Meanwhile CO(2) concentration was insensitive to the branch analysed, COCl(2) or DCAC were not indicating the ability of these compounds to be adsorbed on the composite. An increase of the UV irradiation at total TCE conversion promotes the CO(2) selectivity. The excess of energy arriving to the reactor favours the direct reaction pathway to produce <b>CO(2).</b> The photonic <b>efficiency,</b> calculated {{as a function of the}} rate of CO(2) formation, decreases linearly with the solar irradiance up to around 2 mW cm(- 2), where it becomes constant. For decontamination systems high TCE conversion is pursuit and then high solar irradiance values are required, in spite of lower photonic efficiency values. The present photocatalyst configuration, with only 17 % of the reactor volume filled with the photoactive material, allows total TCE conversion for 150 ppm and 1 L min(- 1) in a wide sun irradiance window from 2 to 4 mW cm(- 2). The incorporation of water vapour leads to an increase of the CO(2) selectivity keeping the TCE conversion around 90 %, although significant amounts of COCl(2) were observed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

H 577 P CEE 2017 Zhanxxii, 208 pages :color illustrationsFor {{the purpose}} of {{environmental}} protection and reduction in resource consumption, construction & demolition (C&D) wastes have long been recycled and treated as a secondary aggregate for production of new construction materials. However, due to the intrinsically poor quality caused by the attached old cement mortar, recycled aggregates {{have been reported to}} weaken not only the mechanical properties, but also the durability of the resulting concrete products. Huge research effort is continuously required to develop innovative techniques to enhance the properties of recycled aggregate and related concrete products. Meanwhile, the calcium silicates phases in cement have been reported to react with carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water, leading to a rapid strength development for cement-based materials. At the same time, a certain amount of CO₂ can be sequestrated into the cement-based materials. Thus, in this research, experimental investigations are performed in order to study the beneficial use of CO₂ curing for producing concrete blocks prepared with recycled aggregates. The work conducted in this research program was consisted of three main phases. The work in Phase I was to explore the feasibility of using the CO₂ curing technique for the production of concrete blocks containing recycled aggregates. Recycled fine aggregates collected from a local recycling plant was used to replace the natural fine aggregate in concrete blocks. The CO₂ curing process was performed with a duration of 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, under the pressure of + 0. 1 bar. The experimental results proved that CO₂ curing process rendered the concrete blocks prepared with recycled aggregates with higher compressive strength and lower drying shrinkage than the corresponding moist cured blocks. However, curing time and amount of recycled aggregate present in the blocks had insignificant effects on the strength gain and CO₂ curing degree. The study in Phase II, mainly focused on evaluating several important factors that might influence the CO₂ curing process of concrete blocks made with recycled aggregates. There were two parts including materials characteristic and curing regime. In part 1, the effects of materials characteristics of the concrete block on CO₂ curing process were investigated, including moisture content, bulk density, aggregate to cement ratio, recycled aggregate content and types of binders. The results showed that, the initial moisture content and the aggregate to cement ratio in the concrete blocks significantly affected the CO 2 curing degree and compressive strength of the concrete blocks. The bulk density and the recycled aggregate content also influenced the CO₂ curing process, but their effects on compressive strength were more complex. The work in this part further confirmed that the inclusion of recycled aggregates can improve the <b>CO₂</b> curing <b>efficiency.</b> In part 2, the influence of several factors associated with the curing conditions on the curing degree and compressive strength of the concrete blocks were investigated, including curing time, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and post water curing after the pressurized CO₂ curing (PCC) method was employed. An experiment with flow-through CO₂ curing (FCC) method was also carried out. The results of PCC experiments showed that high percentage of the total considerable curing degree and compressive strength were attained during the first 2 hours of CO₂ curing period, and extending the curing time yielded slower gain of curing degree and compressive strength; the variation of temperature from 20 ℃ to 80 ℃ and relative humidity from 50 % to 80 % had limited effects on PCC; the effects of CO₂ gas pressure on the curing degree and compressive strength were the most pronounced between 0. 1 bar and 0. 5 bar within the first 2 hours of PCC; the post water curing allowed the concrete blocks to attain further strength gain. The results also indicated that, a lower curing degree and slower strength development at the early age were observed for the FCC-cured concrete blocks; however, after 24 hours of curing duration, they were comparable to those obtained from the PCC method. In Phase III, the intrinsic mechanism for rapid strength development of the CO₂-cured cement-based materials was studied, and the chemical and microstructural evolution of cement paste subjected to coupled CO₂- water curing was investigated. These was achieved through identifying the phase variations, change in porosity and morphological evolution of the structure of CSH gel. The results indicated that more than 2 hrs of CO₂ curing might lead to a lower long term strength development after the subsequent hydration period. The results of the solid state ²⁹Si MAS NMR showed that the CO₂ curing process can remove calcium ions from the interlayer of CSH, and promote the merging of dimers into polymers; and thus the formed CSH had a longer silicate chain length and a higher degree of polymerization. This is regarded as the main reason for the rapid strength development of the cement paste at the early age when subjected to the CO₂ curing process.

Contender grown in controlled environmental conditions, at either ambient or elevated (360 and 700 μmol mol ̄¹, respectively) CO₂ concentrations ([CO₂]), was monitored from 10 days after germination (DAG) until {{the onset of}} senescence. Elevated CO₂ had a pronounced effect on total plant height (TPH), leaf area (LA), dry weight (DW) accumulation and specific leaf area (SLA). All of these were significantly increased by elevated [CO₂] {{with the exception of}} SLA, which was significantly reduced. Except for higher initial relative growth rates (RGR) in CO₂-enriched plants, RGR did not differ significantly between the two CO₂ treatments throughout the remainder of growth period. While growth parameters clearly differed between CO₂ treatments, the effects of CO₂ on many physiological processes including net assimilation rate (NAR), Rubisco activity, and some foliar nutrient concentrations were largely transient. For example, CO₂ enrichment significantly increased NAR, but from 20 DAG onward, NAR declined to levels measured on plants grown under ambient CO₂. Similarly, the decline in both foliar N concentration and Rubisco activity in CO₂-enriched plants after 20 DAG was significantly greater than the decline observed for ambient CO₂ plants. Soluble leaf protein and total chlorophylls (a+b) were also significantly reduced in plants grown under elevated CO₂. Chlorophyll (a/b) ratios increased with time underelevated CO₂, indicating that the rate of decline of chlorophyll b was higher than that of chorophyll α. No significant changes in total carotenoid (x+c) levels were observed in either CO₂ treatment. Under enhanced CO₂, the foliar concentrations of K and Mn were increased significantly, while P, Ca, Fe and Zn were reduced significantly. However, changes in Mg and Cu concentrations were not significant. High CO₂-grown plants also exhibited pronounced leaf discoloration or chlorosis, coupled with a significant reduction in leaf longevity. The levels of non-structural carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, fructose and starch) and nitrogenous compounds (nitrogen, total soluble proteins and free amino acids) were determined for leaves and developing seeds of P. vulgaris. Leaf tissue of elevated CO₂-grown plants accumulated significantly higher levels of both soluble sugars and starch. Leaf ultrastructure revealed considerable erilargement of starch grain sizes with surface areas more than five times larger compared to those of control plants. No apparent differences in structure and membrane integrity of chloroplasts in both CO₂ treatments were noted. Although ambient CO₂-grown plants had comparatively low levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), they accumulated significantly higher levels of nitrogenous compounds. The levels of NSC were consistently higher in seeds of plants grown under elevated CO₂. In comparison to plants grown at elevated [CO₂], pods and seeds of ambient CO₂-grown plants had significantly larger pools of free amino compounds and N. Stomatal conductance (gs) declined significantly, as expected for plants grown under elevated CO₂. This was accompanied by a decline in transpiration rates (E). Reduced gs and E led to high AlE ratio, which meant improved water use efficiency (WUE) values for CO₂-enriched bean plants. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination (∆) against the heavier isotope of carbon (¹³C), has been used to select for high WUE in C₃ plants. In plants grown at elevated CO₂ concentration,, 1 was significantly reduced. Although ∆ was negatively correlated with WUE in both CO₂ treatments, the correlation was steeper and highly negative for CO₂-enriched plants. These results indicate underlying differences in gas-exchange physiology, including stomatal responses between ambient and elevated CO₂-grown plants. Photosynthetic acclimation was investigated using the {{response of}} assimilation to internal carbon dioxide concentration (A/C₁ curves). At early stages of growth, the initial slope of the A/C₁ response curve did not differ with CO₂ treatment. In contrast, CO₂-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) was significantly higher in plants grown under elevated versus ambient CO₂ at 15 DAG. However, at subsequent stages of growth both the initial slope and Amax declined in bean plants grown in elevated <b>CO₂.</b> Apparent carboxylation <b>efficiency</b> (ACE, estimated from the initial slope of A/C₁ response) values followed a similar trend and were significantly reduced in CO₂-enriched plants. These results indicate that acclimation or negative adjustment of photosynthesis may have been caused by a combination of both stomatal and biochemical limitations. Bean plants grown under conditions of elevated atmospheric CO₂ flowered 3 to 4 days earlier, and produced significantly more flowers and pods than plants grown at ambient conditions. Plants grown at elevated CO₂ aborted 22 and 20 % more flowers and pods, respectively, than plants grown at ambient CO₂. Elevated CO₂ also significantly increased the number of tillers or lateral branches produced by plants, which contributed to a significant increase in pod number and seed yield in these plants. Although plants grown at elevated CO₂ produced on average 8 seeds per pod, while plants grown under ambient CO 2 conditions produced 5 seeds per pod, the greater number of seeds was offset by lower seed weights in plants grown under _ elevated CO₂. Thus, despite high seed yield in beans grown under elevated CO₂, the harvest index (HI) did not change significantly between CO₂ treatments. ...|$|R
