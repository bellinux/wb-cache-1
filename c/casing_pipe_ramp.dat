30|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{pulse echo}} method {{is one of}} the primary methods for detection of important parameters outside the well casings (Ellis and Singer 2007). The radial measurement technique of this method reduces the effect of the microannulus (Guo et al. 2009) outside the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> and is much less sensitive to tool centralization (Tubman et al. 1984). However, the method has some inherent measurement problems. Numerous studies have tried to eliminate several of these problems. Albert et al. (1988) analyzed the ability of cement bond logs (CBL), ratio bond tool (RBT), and pulse echo tool (PET) logs to detect channels in the casing circumference using a physical model. Pialucha and Cawley (1994) studied the relationship of impedances, layer thickness, and wavelength of the ultrasonic waves employed. Yao et al. (2002, 2005) carried out a quantitative inversion of the wave impedance and the thickness of the media outside the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> with a composite reflection coefficient. Che and Qiao (2003) and Ding et al.

Yuhuan et al. (2014) analyzed the effect of microannulus size on sonic wave propagation. The studies described above revealed the existence of a complex multi-peak-search problem in thickness determination. The above methods overcome this problem by transformations of the objective function. However, the accuracy of the determination methods depends on accurate parameter estimation (e.g., the thickness of the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe).</b> In practice, it is difficult to measure or estimate these parameters accurately.|$|R

The multifrequency AC current through the transmitter coil induces in the pipe wall a longitudinal alternating magnetic field which is sensed by three receiver coils located at different distances. The multiple transmitter frequencies and the multiple transmitter-receiver spacings can provide the maximum flexibility and the most extensive information in quantitatively determining the total wall thickness in single, dual, and three-string casing configuration.

30|$|Transducers {{that are}} widely applied in cement bond {{evaluation}} tools, such as cement bond logs and variable density logs, cannot radiate acoustic energy directionally {{because of the}} characteristics of monopole sources. A phased arc array transmitter, which is a novel transducer that differs from monopole and dipole transducers, is presented in this study. To simulate the acoustic field generated by a phased arc array in a fluid-filled cased borehole with different channelings, a 3 D finite-difference time-domain method is adopted. The acoustic field generated by a traditional monopole source is also simulated and compared with the field generated by the phased arc array transmitter. Numerical simulation results show that the phased arc array radiates energy directionally in a narrow angular range in the borehole, thereby compressing the acoustic energy into a narrow range in the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe,</b> the cement, and the formation. We present the analyses of first-arrival waveforms and the amplitudes of casing waves at different azimuthal angles for the two different sources. The results indicate that employing a directional source facilitates azimuthal identification and analysis of possible channeling behind the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R

30|$|The liquid layer {{outside a}} well casing {{develops}} from flaws along the cement–casing interface, {{which have been}} identified as leakage pathways in wellbores. The thickness of the liquid layer is one of the important parameters for determining cement bond quality. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the thickness of the liquid layer outside a well <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> with the traditional ultrasonic pulse echo method. To address this problem, we propose a novel inversion method for determining the thickness of the liquid layer between the casing and the cement sheath. According to test specimens, multi-layered structures are modeled to determine the overall reflected wave at the mud–casing interface. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to simultaneously inverse the thicknesses of the liquid layer, the casing, and the annular space between the casing and formation. Using synthetic data, this algorithm is more robust and stable when compared with standard particle swarm optimization inversion procedures. In addition, the influences of noise in the reflected wave and deviations of medium parameters on the inversion results of the liquid layer thickness are discussed. Finally, the method was used to determine the thicknesses of the liquid layer in test specimens. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm provides an effective approach to accurately determine the thickness of the liquid layer outside a well <b>casing</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R

30|$|An {{analysis}} method for the buckling process of a pipe section with a random pipelay imperfection is proposed. Four basic lateral modes, acquired by finite-element (FE) eigenvalue buckling analysis, are combined {{to provide the}} needed grid configurations for describing a real pipelay imperfection and an arc-length algorithm is {{used to analyze the}} snap-through process of the shell-element-grid model under nonlinear frictional boundary conditions. This paper also presents evaluation methods for the lateral buckling of two types of pipe-in-pipe systems that are used in the offshore oil and gas industry. For evaluating the buckling and postbuckling of compliant pipe-in-pipe systems FE analyses were carried out to judge the occurrence of the system buckling and furthermore to check postbuckling stresses induced in the buckles. The calculated results of the modified Riks algorithm indicate that only when high temperature would not trigger an abrupt short-wavelength buckle and when no yielding has been induced in the unavoidable long-wavelength buckles, the thermal stability and safety of compliant pipe-in-pipe systems can be proved. In the non-compliant pipe-in-pipe systems, firstly small-amplitude buckles of the carrier pipe may occur in the annulus between carrier <b>pipe</b> and <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> and the contact forces between the spacers and the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> may drive the buckle of the pipe-in-pipe systems on the seabed.

In this work, an integrity assessment of a steel pipe with initial defect (machined surface crack) is presented. The position of this defect is on the external surface; unlike transport pipes, where internal surface is often endangered due to the contact with the fluid, <b>casing</b> <b>pipes</b> are often exposed to damages at the external surface. Analyzed crack is in axial direction, bearing in mind {{that this type of}} defect most significantly decreases the load carrying capacity of the cylindrical pressurized components. A pipe segment exposed to internal pressure is analyzed experimentally and numerically, using the finite element method. The experimental setup included the tracking of crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) values, as well as J integral, which is determined by application of direct measurement. Criteria for pipe failure are determined on finite element models of the pipe; fracture initiation and plastic collapse are considered as failure mechanisms. The size of the crack is varied in the finite element models; several 3 D models with different crack sizes (length and depth) are evaluated. Dependence of maximum internal pressure on the defect size is obtained. 2 D plane strain models are also examined, with an aim to determine the applicability limits of this simplified approach.
