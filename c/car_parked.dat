5|$|The Dude's car {{is found}} by the police without the ransom money, and he reclaims it. Later, while {{cruising}} around in the car, The Dude finds the homework assignment {{of a high school}} student named Larry inside. Taking this to mean that Larry was the one who stole the car, Walter and The Dude go to his house, believing Larry has also stolen the money. When Larry refuses to respond to Walter and the Dude's threats, Walter wrecks a new sports <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> outside which they assume Larry bought with the money.

5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E

50|$|Parking at {{the centre}} is free, however some parking has a three-hour time limit. Out of the 6300 <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> {{approximately}} 2700 are undercover. Along the southern {{fringe of the}} shopping centre is a two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with centre entrances to both levels scattered throughout. A two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is also located {{at the rear of}} the centre with entrances to the Gallery North and Loft malls. The majority of disabled <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are located on the top deck of this <b>car</b> <b>park</b> near the Loft entrance. A four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located near Village Cinemas in Knox O-Zone along with open air street parking scattered throughout the complex. An overflow <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located at the very east of the centre behind the four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with an extended overflow grass area adjacent to this <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
40|$|Large off-street <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{traditionally}} modelled as self-standing traffic zones representing origins/destinations in standard network assignment models. However, such a treatment precludes the drivers from choosing alternative <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> as it assumes the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are their final destinations. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} bringing <b>car</b> <b>park</b> choice {{and the effects of}} capacity within a traditional network assignment model. The search time within <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> depends on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy and can be represented by a flow-delay type function on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy/capacity. This research calibrates the search-time function based on practically observed occupancy and search time at two city-centre <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Leeds, England. The analysis follows a simple fixed search-time method as well as a sophisticated variable search-time method. The results are validated against the observed occupancies at the <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>park</b> specific constant was introduced to account for the unobserved preference for a given type of parking facility. In a multiperiod assignment, when <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancies are passed on dynamically, both fixed and variable search-time approaches are seen as an improvement over the standard approach, with the variable search time outperforming the fixed time approach...|$|R
5|$|Ten {{days after}} leaving Grimsby Town, Beharall {{was on the}} move again, this time to Oldham Athletic on a loan deal {{to the end of}} the season. Beharall made his dèbut in a 0–0 draw against Stoke City on 21 November 2001. He played 17 league games, two FA Cup and two Football League Trophy matches during his loan spell at Oldham, scoring one goal in the 89th minute in a 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic on 15 December 2001. Beharall was bought by Oldham Athletic on 6 March 2002 for £150,000 on a three-year {{contract}} after impressing during his loan deal. David played one more league game for The Latics during the 2001–02 season against Wigan on 9 March, a match which Wigan won 1–0. In the 2002–03 season Beharall played 32 league, 4 League and 3 FA Cup games for Oldham under the management of Iain Dowie, who replaced Mick Wadsworth in the summer of 2002. In the pre-season of the 2003–04 season, he suffered an injury which left him out of action until October 2003. During this time in August 2003 Beharall was a victim of a carjacking when he and team mate Adam Griffin were attacked when they stopped at a cash machine with Beharall leaving Grffin in the passenger seat and his £21,000 Mercedes-Benz R230 <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> at a Texaco garage in Oldham. Griffin was left defenseless with one of the attackers holding him at knifepoint and another man hit Griffin's left arm with an iron bar, then dragging and throwing Griffin to the ground. Beharall left his wallet and mobile phone in the car but was relieved that he and Griffin were OK. During the 2003–2004 season Beharall played 7 league, 2 FA Cup and 2 Football league games, he also scored 2 league goals against Plymouth Argyle on 1 November 2003. After playing only 6 league games during the 2004–05 season new manager Brian Talbot, Beharall left the club on 24 January 2005 after agreeing a settlement figure.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{system in}} Malaysia usually required the car drivers to search an empty parking {{space in the}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without providing detail direction toward the available parking space. As the result, drivers may waste {{a lot of time}} and unnecessary energy while they turn around in the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without direction and may cause car traffic congestion in parking space. This paper investigates the problems of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system in Malaysia and finally proposed a Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System using low cost SMS service. The implementation of SMS service into the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system enable drivers to receive information regarding the availability of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. In this system, the drivers can resend SMS to request for new assignment of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces if they fail to get the previous assigned destination. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System (WMCPS) using SMS services by Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in finding the nearest parking space for drivers. The stimulation results reveal the intelligence of this system can efficiently allocate and utilize the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces inside the <b>car</b> <b>park...</b>|$|R

25|$|Early in the investigation, {{the police}} felt {{confident}} that the assailant or assailants {{were familiar with the}} victims and that the victims probably knew their killer. The investigators theorized that the time of the killings had not been coincidental. Based on the fact that {{only a handful of people}} knew that Anne would be visiting on that precise time, the investigators concluded that the killer had the house under careful surveillance, and acting when seeing her <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> outside. The main theory is that Anne Orderud Paust was the main target of the killer or killers.|$|E
25|$|By November 1928, a Canadian company, International Airways, {{had taken}} {{over control of the}} {{airfield}} from Mount Vernon Airways. Despite its small size, three foreign flights per day left Hoover Field, and in the 18 months prior to December 1928 the airport saw more than 50,000 flights depart. In June 1928, it set an area record for sending 4,200 passengers aloft in a single month. But these statistics belied the very real dangers at the field. In 1928, a pilot and engineer were killed when their plane crashed during take-off. Later that year, a plane attempting to land at night struck a <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> on the field, injuring four.|$|E

25|$|On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers {{had been}} {{surprised}} by a crew member and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a <b>car</b> <b>parked</b> in Italian in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, gave off a smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A cabin steward, with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as {{they were trying to}} use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering the unlocked door to their room in order to deliver complimentary fruit.
