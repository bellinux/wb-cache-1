40|$|One of {{the most}} {{surprising}} discoveries of the Galileo mission was the detection of a self- generated magnetic field {{in the vicinity of}} Ganymede. Up to that discovery, it was widely believed that Ganymede did not fully differentiate and had a central region composed of silicates and iron and an outer ice layer. The existence of the self-generated magnetic field together with the relatively small value of the momentof- inertia factor, suggests that Ganymede is strongly differentiated into an iron core, a silicate mantle and an outer ice layer. Based on Galileo gravity field measurements, a similar interior structure has been proposed for Europa where an internal magnetic field is absent. It has been suggested that <b>chemical</b> <b>convection</b> due to the precipitation of iron or iron sulfide is the most likely mechanism to power a present-day dynamo on Ganymede. <b>Chemical</b> <b>convection</b> and dynamo action will start as soon as core temperatures fall below the liquidus temperature of the core alloy and operates as long as the core is cooling. Interestingly, although Ganymede is about 700 km larger in radius than Europa, the differences in size and mass of the silicate and iron part, respectively, are only small for both satellites. As a consequence, one would expect a similar thermal and magnetic field evolution in both cases. However, thermal evolution models indicate that it is even more likely for Europa to generate an internal field if the same set of parameter values for mantle rheology and radioactive heat source density is used as for Ganymede. We will discuss two scenarios that may help explain the puzzling magnetic dichotomy between both satellites: (1) a larger content of light elements in the core of Europa as compared to Ganymede and (2) tidal heating in the silicate mantle of Europa...|$|E

40|$|The Earth {{acts as a}} {{gigantic}} heat engine driven by decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes, and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing to grow the solid inner core, and on <b>chemical</b> <b>convection</b> due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing. The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat-flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat-flux depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent difficulties in experimentation and theory. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles- the first directly computed values that do not rely on estimates based on extrapolations. The mixtures of Fe, O, S, and Si are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically-determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be 2 - 3 times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements must be reassessed. New estimates of adiabatic heat-flux give 15 - 16 TW at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat-flux based on mantle convection; {{the top of the}} core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core driven by <b>chemical</b> <b>convection</b> against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow.

Thus, the temperature gradient may be even shallower than adiabatic, and compositional convection may carry heat downward, against the temperature gradient.

30|$|For the Moon, we {{do indeed}} find that FeS would start {{crystallizing}} {{at the center}} of the core. In this case, an FeS floating zone develops with a stable chemical gradient where FeS crystallizes and rises upward toward the outer core (see Fig.  1 e), just like in an inverted iron snow scenario.

When this zone eventually comprises the entire core, solid FeS remelting will cease and a solid FeS layer begins to grow at the CMB. This scenario results in dynamics similar to that of the iron snow regime on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic, although the direction of growth of the floating zone is reversed, with solid particles rising instead of sinking. There may thus be a dynamo in the fluid outer core above the floating zone rather than one in a fluid inner core below the iron snow zone. The dynamo would be active as long as the floating zone grows.|$|E

According to these models, a few tens of Myrs after inner core nucleation outer core convection indeed becomes dominantly chemical. Very high core thermal conductivity (e.g., Pozzo et al. 2012) implies that higher CMB heat flux, radiogenic heating, or some presently unknown form of chemical differentiation in the core would be needed to power the geodynamo prior to inner core nucleation. However, the debate on core thermal conductivity is still ongoing (Zhang et al. 2015). Finally, Olson et al.

40|$|Of the {{terrestrial}} planets, Earth and probably Mercury possess substantial intrinsic magnetic fields generated by core dynamos, while Venus and Mars apparently lack such fields. Thermal histories are calculated for these planets and {{are found to}} admit several possible present states, including those which suggest simple explanations for the observations; while the cores of Earth and Mercury are continuing to freeze, the cores of Venus and Mars may still be completely liquid. The models assume whole mantle convection, which is parameterized by a simple Nusselt-Rayleigh number relation and dictates {{the rate at which}} heat escapes from the core. It is found that completely fluid cores, devoid of intrinsic heat sources, are not likely to sustain thermal convection for the age of the solar system but cool to a subadiabatic, conductive state that can not maintain a dynamo. Planets which nucleate an inner core continue to sustain a dynamo because of the gravitational energy release and chemically driven convection that accompany inner core growth. The absence of a significant inner core can arise in Venus because of its slightly higher temperature and lower central pressure relative to Earth, while a Martian core avoids the onset of freezing if the abundance of sulfur in the core is ⪆ 15 % by mass. All of the models presented assume that (I) core dynamos are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection; (ii) radiogenic heat production is confined to the mantle; (iii) mantle and core cool from initially hot states which are at the solidus and superliquidus, respectively; and (iv) any inner core excludes the light alloying material (sulfur or oxygen) which then mixes uniformly upward through the outer core. The models include realistic pressure and composition-dependent freezing curves for the core, and material parameters are chosen so that the correct present-day values of heat outflow, upper mantle temperature and viscosity, and inner core radius are obtained for the earth. It is found that Venus and Mars may have once had dynamos maintained by thermal convection alone. Earth may have had a completely fluid core and a dynamo maintained by thermal convection for the first 2 to 3 by, but an inner core nucleates and the dynamo energetics are subsequently dominated by gravitational energy release.

40|$|AB: A major {{discovery}} of the Galileo mission was the detection of Ganymede's self-generated magnetic field. The magnetic field also proves beyond doubt that Ganymede is fully differentiated into an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle, and an outer ice shell that most likely also contains an ocean. It is widely believed that Europa has a similar structure although {{the absence of a}} self-sustained magnetic field makes the case for a core in Europa less compelling. Since Callisto's moment-of-inertia factor suggests an undifferentiated satellite and since the absence of a magnetic of Io is best explained by tidal heating in the mantle blocking the heat flow from the core (Wienbruch and Spohn, 1995), Europa and Ganymede form a magnetic dichotomy in the Jovian system. We have used stagnant lid models of convection in the two icy satellites to calculate thermal history models with core cooling and have allowed for inner core growth through freezing. The models have stagnant lid convection or conduction in the outer ice shells (depending on material parameters), isothermal oceans, and, in the case of Ganymede, stagnant-lid convection in the ice shell underneath the ocean and above the rock mantle. For Europa the ocean interfaces with the rock mantle. We assume iron cores that start fully molten for both satellites, the radii of which were taken from Sohl et al. (2002). These models suggest that Europa has a few 100 km smaller core and thinner mantle and a substantially thinner ice shell. All but interior structure parameters equal, we find that core convection and hence dynamo action is more likely for Europa than for Ganymede. The reason are mainly the larger core and the thicker mantle. Accepting core convection in Ganymede, the question than poses itself of how to explain the absence of core convection in Europa. We find and will discuss the following possibilities: 1) Europa has no iron core. This is consistent with the observation but leaves the question why Ganymede should have fully differentiated while Europa did not. 2) A higher concentration of light elements in Europa's core. Taking Sulfur as a point in case, Europa may have more sulfur, in which case more cooling would be required to freeze the core, or may even be on the FeS rich side of the eutectic, in which case <b>chemical</b> <b>convection</b> could be less efficient in Europa. 3) Tidal heating.

40|$|The Earth’s {{magnetic}} field {{is produced by}} a fluid dynamo in the molten iron outer core. This geodynamo is driven by fluid motions induced by thermal and <b>chemical</b> <b>convection</b> and strongly influenced by rotational and {{magnetic field}} effects. While frequent observations are made of the morphology and time-dependent field behavior, flow dynamics in the core are all but inaccessible to direct measurement. Thus, forward models are essential for exploring {{the relationship between the}} geomagnetic field and its underlying fluid physics. The goal of my PhD is to further our understanding of the fluid physics driving the geodynamo. In order to do this, I have performed a suite of nonrotating and rotating convection laboratory experiments and developed a new experimental device that reaches more extreme values of the governing parameters than previously possible. In addition, I conduct a theoretical analysis of well-established results from a suite of dynamo simulations by Christensen and Aubert (2006). These studies are conducted at moderate values of the Ekman number (ratio between viscosity and Coriolis forces, ~ 10 ^− 4), as opposed to the the extremely small Ekman numbers in planetary cores (~ 10 ^− 15). At such moderate Ekman values, flows tend to take the form of large-scale, quasi-laminar axial columns. These columnar structures give the induced magnetic field a dipolar morphology, similar to what is seen on planets. However, I find that some results derived from these simulations are fully dependent on the fluid viscosity, and therefore are unlikely to reflect the fluid physics driving dynamo action in the core. My findings reinforce the need to understand the turbulent processes that arise as the governing parameters approach planetary values. Indeed, my rotating convection experiments show that, as the Ekman number is decreased beyond ranges currently accessible to dynamo simulations, the regime characterized by laminar columns is found to dwindle. We instead find a large variety of behavioral regimes ranging from axial columns to fully three-dimensional turbulence. By comparing these to direct numerical simulations and asymptotically-reduced models, we find broad agreement in both the heat transfer scaling properties and flow morphologies in these separate regimes. In particular, large, multi-scale axial vortices emerge consistently in numerical and asymptotic simulations. Such multi-scale structures in the core {{may be related to the}} Earth’s dipolar magnetic field structure. I have designed and fabricated a novel laboratory experimental device capable of characterizing these flow regimes in great detail using accurate heat transfer and velocity measurements and high-resolution flow imaging...|$|E

Hawaiian volcanoes erupt lava of distinct chemical compositions during four major stages in their evolution and growth. The earliest stage is a submarine alkalic preahield stage, which is followed by the tholeiitic shield stage. The shield stage probably accounts for > 95 percent of the volume of each volcano. The shield stage is followed by an alkalic postshield stage during which a thin cap of alkalic basalt and associated differentiated lava covers the tholeiitic shield. After several million years of erosion, alkalic rejuvenated-stage lava erupts from isolated vents. An individual volcano may become extinct before the sequence is complete. The alkalic preshield stage is only known from recent study of Loihi Seamount. Lava from later eruptive stages has been identified from numerous submerged volcanoes located west of the principal Hawaiian Islands. Volcanic propagation rates along the chain are 9. 2 ± 0. 3 cm/yr for the Hawaiian Chain and 7. 2 ± 1. 1 cm/yr for the Emperor Chain. A best fit through all the age data for both chains gives 8. 6 ± 0. 2 em/yr. Alkalic rejuvenated-stage lava erupts on an older shield during the formation of a new large shield volcano 190 ± 30 km to the east. The duration of the quiescent period preceding eruption of rejuvenated-stage lava decreases systematically from 2. 5 m. y. on Niihau to < 0. 4 m. y. at Haleakala, reflecting an increase in the rate of volcanic propagation during the last few million years. Rejuvenated-stage lava is generated during the rapid change from subsidence to uplift as the volcanoes override a flexural arch created by loading the new shield volcano on the ocean lithosphere. Paleomagnetic data indicate that the Hawaiian hot spot has remained fixed during the last 40 m. y., but prior to that time the hot spot was apparently located at a more northerly latitude. The most reliable data suggest about 70 of southward movement of the hot spot between 65 and 40 Ma. The numerous hypotheses to explain the mechanism of the hot spot fall into four types: propagating fracture hypotheses, thermal or <b>chemical</b> <b>convection</b> hypotheses, shear melting hypotheses, and heat injection hypotheses. A successful hypothesis must explain the propagation of volcanism along the chain, the near-fixity of the hot spot, the chemistry and timing of the eruptions from individual volcanoes, and the detailed geometry of volcanism. None of the geophysical hypotheses proposed to date are fully satisfactory. However, the existence of the Hawaiian ewell suggests that hot spots are indeed hot. In addition, both geophysical and geochemical hypotheses suggest that primitive undegassed mantle material ascends beneath Hawaii. Petrologic models suggest that this primitive material reacts with the ocean lithosphere to produce the compositional range of Hawaiian lava...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} is concerned with implementation of the joint "velocity-scalar filtered mass density function" (VS-FMDF) methodology for large eddy simulation (LES) of Sandia Flame D. This is a turbulent piloted nonpremixed methane jet flame. In VS-FMDF, the effects of the subgrid scale <b>chemical</b> reaction and <b>convection</b> appear in closed forms. The modeled transport equation for the VS-FMDF is solved by a hybrid finite-difference/Monte Carlo scheme. For this flame (which exhibits little local extinction), a flamelet model is employed to relate the instantaneous composition to the mixture fraction. The LES predictions are compared with experimental data. It is shown that the methodology captures important features of the flame as observed experimentally. In the second part of this dissertation, the joint "energy-pressure-velocity-scalar filtered mass density function" (EPVS-FMDF) is developed as a new subgrid scale (SGS) model for LES of high-speed turbulent flows. In this model, the effects of compressibility are taken into account by including two additional thermodynamic variables: the pressure and the internal energy. The EPVS-FMDF is obtained by solving its modeled transport equation, in which the effect of convection appears in a closed form. The modeled EPVS-FMDF is employed for LES of a temporally developing mixing layer...|$|R
40|$|A novel SOFC {{system control}} {{strategy}} has been developed for rapid load following. The strategy was motivated from {{the performance of a}} baseline control strategy developed from control concepts in the literature. The basis for the fuel cell system control concepts are explained by a simplified order of magnitude time scale analysis. The control concepts are then investigated in a detailed quasi-two-dimensional integrated dynamic system model that resolves the physics of heat transfer, <b>chemical</b> kinetics, mass <b>convection</b> and electrochemistry within the system. The baseline control strategy is based on the standard operating method of constant utilization with no control of the combustor temperature. Simulation indicates that with this control strategy large combustor transients can take place during load transients because the fuel flow to the combustor increases faster than the air flow. To alleviate this problem, a novel control structure that maintains the combustor temperature within acceptable ranges without any supplementary hardware was introduced. The combustor temperature is controlled by manipulating the current to change the combustor inlet stoichiometry. The load following capability of SOFC systems is inherently limited by anode compartment fuel depletion during the time of fuel delivery delay. This research indicates that future SOFC systems with proper system and control configurations can exhibit excellent load following characteristics. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An {{article is}} made to report {{physical}} aspects of nanoparticles along with mutual interaction of chemical reaction and mixed convection on boundary layer Eyring Powell fluid flow yields by stretching surface. The fluid flow is engaged due to no slip condition i-e the velocity of particles {{is directly related to}} velocity of surface due to stretching. The physical situation within the real concerned constraints is achieved in terms of differential equations as a boundary value problem. To make implementation of numerical algorithm possible partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations by means of appropriate transformation. Then these constructed ordinary differential equations are solved numerically by using shooting scheme charted with Runge-Kutta algorithm. The effect logs of an involved pertinent flow parameters are explored by way of graphical outcomes. It is observed that in the presence of nanoparticles Eyring-Powell fluid velocity increases for positive values of both thermal Grashof and solutal Grashof numbers. A parabolic curve fitting way of communication is executed to represent the impact of both thermophoresis parameter and Brownian motion parameter on heat and mass transfer rates. It is found that heat transfer rate is decreasing function of thermophoresis parameter but mass transfer rate exhibit an inciting nature towards Brownian motion parameter.
