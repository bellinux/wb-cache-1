5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> all citizens.|$|E

5|$|Boston, {{the capital}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an {{important}} shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s. In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> British subjects in the colonies. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent {{what became known as the}} Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} power of the white Democrats in the South came from their having disfranchised most blacks from 1890–1910. The South was essentially a one-party, Democratic region in which only whites voted and held office, well into the 1960s, but Congressional representation {{was based on the}} total population. The situation of disfranchisement did not change markedly until passage in the 1960s of federal civil rights legislation that protected and enforced the <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> voting and citizenship for African Americans and other minorities.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. and the Soviet Union {{emerged as}} rival superpowers after World War II. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. confronted each other {{indirectly}} {{in the arms}} race, the Space Race, proxy wars, and propaganda campaigns. U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War was built around the support of Western Europe and Japan along with the policy of containment, stopping the spread of communism. The U.S. joined the wars in Korea and Vietnam {{to try to stop}} its spread. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968), another wave of social reforms were enacted by enforcing the <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> voting and freedom of movement to African-Americans and other racial minorities.

25|$|On the {{day that}} the {{committee}} was formed, August 17, MKS posted a handwritten list of twenty-one demands in the shipyard. These demands were far broader and all-encompassing that the original postulates of the Gdańsk strikers, pushing for free trade unions and the legal right to strike, an end to the repression of independent activists, improvement of health care services, and the increased availability of basic consumer goods and foodstuffs, amongst other things. In these demands, the workers were calling on the government to protect the <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the Polish people, and take steps to improve the low standard of living of blue-collar citizens. After weeks of negotiations with Wałęsa and his MKS, the Communist party first secretary Edward Gierek was forced to accede to all twenty-one of the strikers’ demands, signing the Gdańsk Agreement on August 31, which allowed workers the right to strike and organise independent unions.|$|E
500|$|The {{ruling was}} praised by {{the video game}} industry, which had {{expected}} the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court.

[...] Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that [...] "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," [...] while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO John Riccitiello asserted that the decision [...] "affirmed the <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> game developers." [...] Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision.
