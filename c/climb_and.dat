5|$|In stage 4, the peloton nearly {{reached the}} Adriatic coast, ending in Chieti in Abruzzo {{just a few}} {{kilometers}} away. The course was hilly, with a <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> a descent early on and several short but steep climbs toward the finish.|$|E
5|$|This {{course was}} hilly. The riders rode {{part of the}} final {{kilometer}} in Macerata twice before the actual conclusion of the race, though they only crossed the finish line once. The final kilometer was uphill; the first visit counted as a point-awarding <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> the second was an intermediate sprint.|$|E

5|$|Grow Home is an {{adventure}} platform video game developed by Ubisoft Reflections {{and published by}} Ubisoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 4, 2015, and for PlayStation 4 on September 1, 2015. The game follows a robot named B.U.D., who is tasked with growing a plant that will oxygenate its home planet. Players explore an open world, moving B.U.D. and individually using each of its arms to <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> interact with objects.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered {{much more likely than}} in previous years that a group of riders could break away from the peloton on the penultimate <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E

In 1795, the prince acquiesced; {{and they were}} married on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. The two were formally separated {{after the birth of}} their only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796, and remained separated thereafter. The Prince remained attached to Maria Fitzherbert {{for the rest of his}} life, despite several periods of estrangement.|$|E

5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{included}} {{a total of}} five recommendations for the FAA. These recommendations included: installing recorders for radar displays, installing audio conversation recorders at air traffic control facilities; establishing <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> descent corridors under ATC positive control in the vicinity of air terminals; and establishing more definitive procedures for receiving and handling the emergency transponder code 7700. Additionally, the NTSB strongly recommended that the FAA and the Department of Defense cooperate to develop a program, in areas where a large intermix of civil and military traffic exists, to ensure that appropriate graphical depictions of airspace utilization and typical flow patterns are prominently displayed at all airports and operational bases for the benefit of all airspace users.|$|E

5|$|The team {{got their}} first win of the season, in their first stage race, at the Étoile de Bessèges. Dumoulin made a late {{selection}} in stage 3, joining nine other riders who finished {{just ahead of the}} rest of the peloton, and won the sprint to the finish line. Later in February, Moncoutié won the queen stage of the Tour Méditerranéen, finishing at Mont Faron. He had previously won stages there in 2003 and 2009, but his win this year was enough to win him the race overall thanks to his time gap. The squad also won the teams classification. Dumoulin took another win later in February, in the first stage of the two-day Tour du Haut Var. He stayed latched onto Rinaldo Nocentini's wheel during the stage's final <b>climb,</b> <b>and</b> came around him in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Adenhart had a 6–0 {{record with}} a 1.04 earned run average {{during the regular season}} in his junior year, and as a result was named the Gatorade Player of the Year in Maryland. In a 1–0 loss during the playoff quarterfinal matchup, he threw a no-hitter and had 14 strikeouts. Entering his final high school season, Baseball America dubbed Adenhart the top high school {{prospect}} in the country. In his senior year, Adenhart threw a perfect game in his very first outing, striking out 15 of the 21 batters faced. Entering the final regular season game of his high school career, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.73 ERA and an average of 2.2 strikeouts per inning. During November of his senior year, Adenhart signed a letter of intent to play with the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team at the University of North Carolina, although his chances of being drafted high continued to <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> the North Carolina coaching staff saw their chances of acquiring Adenhart to be slim.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E

5|$|At {{the second}} monument, the Tour of Flanders, BMC was noted to be {{bringing}} a strong squad, headed by Ballan and Hincapie. Burghardt and Van Avermaet {{went on the}} attack in the early portions of the race, only to be brought back after a short while. When Fabian Cancellara put in {{an attack on the}} Leberg, the day's fourteenth cobbled <b>climb,</b> <b>and</b> quickly took a sizable time gap, it was the BMC team which organized the chase to bring him back. They placed four riders into a seven-rider chase group and succeeded in bringing Cancellara back, something which has usually not happened to him in classics races. A further two riders had remained {{at the head of the}} peloton, giving them six riders at the front of the race when Cancellara was caught. Cancellara put in another move on the Muur van Geraardsbergen and was followed only by Sylvain Chavanel and eventual race winner Nick Nuyens. Hincapie finished with the group 5 seconds back for sixth place on the day. Kristoff rode to seventh place in the sprinters' classic Scheldeprijs later in April, back of three-time winner Mark Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, <b>climb,</b> <b>and</b> swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the <b>climb,</b> <b>and</b> they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E

5|$|Hill was a gymnast {{early in}} life, nearly broke {{a world record}} lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to {{climbing}} at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and {{became a part of}} the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} entered the Billboard 200 albums chart at number190, {{the week of}} September 3, 1983. The album had a slow and steady <b>climb,</b> <b>and</b> peaked at eight on the Billboard 200 on the week ending October 20, 1984, {{more than a year}} after its release. It also peaked at twenty on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. Within a year, Madonna had sold 2.8million copies in the United States. It placed at number seven on the year-end chart for 1984 and at number25 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna {{becoming}} the top pop artist for the year 1985. After 17 years since its release, the album was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across United States. With the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 450,000 copies as of August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Stage 15 {{proved to}} be a crucial one, as the Tour entered Switzerland in a stage with many high {{mountain}} climbs. With about three kilometers gone by in an 8.8km final climb to Verbier, Contador attacked and got free of the leading group, that included Klöden and Armstrong, soloing to the line for the stage win and the yellow jersey. Armstrong said after the stage that he had given it everything he had in the <b>climb</b> <b>and</b> Contador was simply the stronger rider; it was seen as settling any lingering controversy over the squad's leader and protected rider. Contador all but cemented the Tour title by winning the time trial in Annecy in Stage 18, just beating out Cancellara to post the day's best time. Armstrong gained a little over a minute on Fränk Schleck by finishing 16th, and climbed back into a podium position, third, with the result. The two finished the Tour in those positions after holding them on Mont Ventoux, and then riding home safely in the Tour's largely ceremonial finale in Stage 21.|$|E
