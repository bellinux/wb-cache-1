50|$|By using a {{transmission}} gate to switch alternating voltages (e.g.: audio signal), the negative power supply potential must {{be lower than}} the lowest signal potential. This ensures that the substrate diode will remain non-conducting even at negative voltages. Although the transmission gate can still switch to logic voltage levels, there are special versions with integrated level shifters. A good example, is the 4053 standard chip, commonly used to select between analogue inputs to an audio amplifier, has a separate ground (pin 8) and negative substrate <b>connection</b> (<b>pin</b> 7) that also supplies the level shifter.|$|E

The landing-type lifting pole with double-level arms {{is a kind}} of {{construction}} equipment frequently used in erection of large-sized iron tower during the engineering of power transmission line. This equipment lifts heavy load through bilateral symmetry, thus improving the working efficiency. A finite element structural calculation model of tower top of landing-type lifting pole with double-level arms was established according to the actual situation, and this model involved different working amplitude, lifting capacities and unbalanced loading conditions. In addition, the maximum stresses and structural stability coefficients of tower head, lifting arm, draw-bar and rotary tower body were analyzed, and the safety check results of various parts at tower top were obtained.

40|$|NXP {{semiconductors}} designs standardized library {{cells to}} debug integrated circuits. Together with a protocol that enables these sensors {{to communicate to}} the outside world via one <b>connection</b> <b>pin</b> this forms the SIST project. Ad- vantages of this approach are that no dedicated systems have to be designed for every new system on-chip and {{that there is only one}} I/O pin employed. Power supply, temperature and various technology sensors are designed and in production. However a jitter sensor was not yet designed. This Master Thesis describes the design of a jitter sensor to measure cycle to cycle jitter within the SIST project. A delay locked loop (DLL) delays the incoming clock one (nominal) clock period in 40 steps. The output of tap 40 is locked by the DLL at a phase di®erence of 2 ¼ radians. The output of any of these 40 delay taps can be routed to a comparator where the falling edge of the delayed signal is compared with the falling edge of the incoming clock signal. If the clock signal never has a rising edge before e. g., the output of tap 38, the jitter is known to be smaller than 5 percent. To measure if the clock edge is not too late, after tap 40, 24 extra delay cells are added. This cycle to cycle jitter sensor is designed in a 45 nm TSMC process and measures in steps of 2. 5 percent of the clock speed. The transistor level design is veri¯ed and expected to have an inaccuracy of 10 picoseconds. To measure in a range of 100 MHz to 1. 0 GHz, two designs with a scaled delay cell are developed and simulated. The cell consumes 400 ¹W and covers an area of approximately 700 ¹m 2...|$|E

25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the <b>connection</b> <b>pins</b> to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|R

An {{innovative}} dissipative (INERD <b>Pin)</b> <b>connection</b> system, {{which was}} previously developed for seismic resistant X-braced steel frames, {{was applied to}} retrofit existing precast industrial buildings designed only for gravity loads.

The INERD <b>Pin</b> <b>connection</b> system increased both the deformation capacity and the stiffness of the buildings, reducing damage of the structural elements. In case of low seismic actions, the INERD <b>Pin</b> <b>connection</b> system especially enhanced the stiffness of the structure, causing only small reductions of column rotations and top displacements. In case of severe seismic actions, the addition of the dissipative connections showed all its effectiveness particularly for low rotation capacity at column base, increasing the energy dissipation capacity and reducing the displacements of the structure.
