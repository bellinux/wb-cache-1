5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} <b>cleaned.</b> Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately <b>cleaned.</b> To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly <b>cleaned</b> and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has <b>cleaned</b> the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be <b>cleaned</b> with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
