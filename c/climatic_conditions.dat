5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment to the surrounding basins via flash floods.

40|$|Abstract. Organic matter {{types of}} the Early Paleogene core sediments from the Sanshui Basin were {{analyzed}} using organic petrology method. The organic matter is dominated by type II. The type I organic matter intermittently occurs at some intervals and type III organic matter only has occasional occurrence. Organic matter of types I, II 1 and II 2 should be deposited under arid, drier and humid climate condition, respectively. The uppermost part of the Xinzhuang Formation is characterized by type II 1, related to a dry <b>climatic</b> <b>condition.</b> Sub-member A of the Honggang Member is dominated by organic Type II 2, sandwiched by Type I and II 1, reflecting a prevailing humid <b>climatic</b> <b>condition.</b> Sub-member B is characterized by alternations of types II 2 and II 1 or I, suggesting rapid fluctuations of humid and arid <b>climatic</b> <b>condition.</b> Sub-member C shows type II 1 and I in the lower part and shifts to type II 2 in middle and upper parts, suggesting a dry climate condition followed by a prevailing humid <b>climatic</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Present {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the study of bryophytes in relation to soil and <b>climatic</b> <b>condition,</b> broadly speaking three bryoecological zones. These zones are arid and semi arid, the plateau and the southern region having different <b>climatic</b> <b>condition</b> and vegetation.

The availability of water, amount of moisture in the air, temperature, light, elevation, nature of soil and its availability to retain moisture and biotic factors control the distribution of bryophyte species. Sixty four bryophyte species have been collected from different parts and various localities of this state out of which geographically 43 occur in the Western Himalayas, 34 in Eastern Himalayas and 32 in South India. Further it was reported that plants perennate in adverse <b>climatic</b> <b>condition</b> by the formation of gemmae, tubers, meristematic rolling apical apices and some other vegetative parts of the plants...|$|R

5|$|The early {{farmers from}} the Early Basketmaker II Era, {{lived in the}} Petrified Forest from about 1CE to about 800CE. They {{occupied}} pit houses at fewer than 100 sites, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later {{at the base of}} bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. As <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> worsened for farming between 750 and 900CE, the settlements changed with the Pueblo I Era. Rather than below-ground pits, the Pueblo Builders constructed above-ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year. At the same time, <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> changed again, this time for the better, between 900 and 1275CE. More than 200 pueblo-builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations—at the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.|$|E

5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were not nearly as pronounced, likely due to more favorable <b>climatic</b> <b>conditions</b> that would have allowed for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E
