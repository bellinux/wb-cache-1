40|$|The {{feathers}} {{gained by}} slaughtering fattening chickens can be processed into protein meal for feeding certain animals, {{as indicated by}} its chemical characteristics. However, raw feather proteins (keratin) are faintly digestible (cca. 19 %), even inert in digestive tract. Digestion of feather proteins could be improved by hydrolysis (alkaline, enzymatic, microbiological or hydrothermal). Practically, hydrothermal processing of raw feathers is mostly applied. The influence of hydrothermal processing under the pressures of 3. 0, 3. 5 or 4. 0 bar on the nutritive value of the resulting meal is presented in this paper. For the hydrolysis of raw feathers, semi continuous procedure was applied. Semi continuous procedure of feathers processing comprise hydrolysis of raw wet feathers followed by partial drying of hydrolyzed mass {{that has to be}} done in a hydrolyser with indirect heating. <b>Continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>dryer</b> with recycled air was used during the final process of drying. Protein nitrogen decreased by 3. 46 % and 4. 80 % in comparison with total protein nitrogen content in raw feathers under the pressure of 3. 0 and 3. 5 bar, respectively. The highest applied hydrolysis pressure caused the greatest loss of protein nitrogen up to 9. 52 %. Hydrothermal hydrolysis under pressure has increased in vitro protein digestibility significantly. Under pressure of 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 bar digestibility of proteins increasing from 19. 01 to 76. 39, 81. 71 and 87. 03 %, respectively. Under pressure of 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 bar cysteine content decreased from 6. 44 to 4. 17 % (loss 35. 25 %), 3. 94 (loss 38. 825 %) and to 3. 75 % (loss 41. 77 %), respectively. These decreases are statistically significant. It can be concluded that the hydrolysis carried out under the pressure of 3. 5 bar, during the period of 25 minutes, and with the content of water in raw feathers of cca. 61 % is the optimal technological process for converting raw feathers into diets for certain animal diets...|$|E

This fundamental difference is expected to manifest itself in several advantages for electronic, chemical, and mechanical properties. Research into nanoscroll properties has lagged considerably behind graphene and carbon nanotubes, due {{to the difficulty of}} fabricating these structures. We build upon previous work demonstrating nanoscroll formation from single layer {{graphene sheets}} on silicon/silicon-oxide substrates using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) produced graphene. It is found that CVD graphene can considerably improve nanoscroll formation yield over exfoliated material. We also investigate the use of carbon nanotubes deposited onto single layer graphene sheets as a method to initiate nanoscroll formation and produce novel nested nanotube-nanoscroll hybrid structures. An aligned MWNT transfer process is developed and used to produce the first nested nanotube-nanoscroll hybrid. Some possible future applications of these interesting materials are discussed. Scrolling of suspended graphene sheets is investigated by transferring CVD graphene onto TEM grids. It is found that the suspended regions of graphene spontaneously form carbon nanoscrolls. The nanoscrolls are characterized using transmission electron microscopy and the presence of a <b>continuous,</b> <b>tubular</b> structure is confirmed by electron diffraction. This scrolling process, assisted by focused ion beam cutting of the suspended sheets may provide an avenue to controlling chirality and dimensionality of carbon nanoscrolls, which is not yet demonstrated.

40|$|Brown coal is {{considered}} to be a competitive primary energy source for power generation in parts of Central and Eastern Europe due to the economically recoverable reserves of this fuel in these regions. On the other side, it is well known that brown coal contains significant amounts of moisture which decreases the overall plant thermal efficiency due to the increased flue gas thermal loses. In order to keep the competitive edge of brown coal, an improvement of the power plant efficiency is required. One way to achieve this target is to dry the moist brown coal before combustion. Conventionally, the necessary moisture extraction process is integrated into milling, where a recirculated flue gas stream is used as a drying agent. External brown coal drying offers the potential to increase the net thermal efficiency of the entire power generation process by up to 5 % points. This paper presents a description of the technical fundamentals of drying techniques developed and successfully tested so far. Furthermore, it presents computer simulation studies for the integration of an external dryer into a steam cycle of a Greek brown coal-fired power plant as a typical test to demonstrate the potential of the drying technologies for power generation. The major objectives of these studies are to formulate basic drying schemes which might be integrated into a power production steam cycle.

An introductory review into this field is presented, with emphasis on the effects on the molar mass distribution (MMD), of the sought combination of polymerization mechanism, reactor type, and reactor control. Three ideal polymerization mechanisms are analyzed: free-radical, living anionic, and step-growth. Living anionic and step-growth polymerizations are similar in that their growing chains remain reactive while inside the reactor; and for these systems the narrowest MMDs are produced in reactors with narrow residence time distributions (RDT); i. e. : batch or <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> reactors. In contrast, in conventional free-radical polymerizations, the polymer molecules grow in {{a fraction of a}} second and thereafter remain inactive while inside the reactor.

40|$|Abstract Microwave heating {{of foods}} offers rapid and {{flexible}} heating both for consumer and industrial applications, with several advantages, such as reduced processing time (due to volumetric heating and reduced coming-up times (heating {{time required to}} reach the desired target temperature), selective heating, increased process flexibility and efficient heating (volumetric heating of the food does not require heating of a surrounding medium or package). However, successful installations require knowledge in process design. Modelling {{could be used to}} accomplish this in a way that gives the desired electromagnetic field distribution. The resulting microwave heating pattern depends in a complex way on a large number of parameters, related to the food, the package as well as the oven. Among these parameters are: food dimensions and geometry, dielectric and thermo-physical properties of the food, design and geometry of the food package, placement of food components and design of the oven. This thesis deals with selected applications of microwave heating of foods at 2450 MHz, modelling of microwave heating of foods in a lab-scale microwave oven, and the evaluation of <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> microwave heating of foods in pilot-scale, in terms of temperature uniformity in a homogeneous model food and with respect to rapidness in heating of a particulate model food and its resulting product quality. Additionally, an accurate method for determining the dielectric properties of liquids is described. Dielectric properties of foods are required as input data for modelling of microwave heating, and also serve as a first basis for understanding the phenomena behind microwave heating of foods. In the food industry, process operations often require continuous processes, due to the desired high yield. This suggests a large potential for well-designed and controlled microwave continuous operations. High-temperature short-time (HTST) processing of foods could be used to achieve thermal processing as sterilisation, while exposing foods to heating for a shorter time than conventional heat treatment, with resulting minimal product degradation. It is suggested that <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> microwave heating of particulate foods could offer an alternative to HTST processing for producing high-quality particulate foods with increased rapidness due to the volumetric microwave heating and the shorter coming-up times to achieve the necessary target temperature. The work presented in part of this thesis demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} achieve microwave-assisted HTST conditions in terms of <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> microwave heating of a high-concentrated particulate model food product for a 12 mm tubular system at 2450 MHz. This is accomplished by combining modes that heat primarily in the centre (TM 020) and in the periphery (TM 120) of the tube. This process results in a more rapid and uniform heating where the product (particulates as well as the surrounding continuous phase) will reach the desired target temperature more rapidly (than in a traditional HTST system), with resulting reduced losses in product quality in terms of e. g. piece integrity. Additionally,microwave HTST processing offers product quality advantages due to reduced overheating of the continuous phase and also large process flexibility, since a wide interval of possible combinations of target temperature and holding time is accomplished in the same equipment. Moreover, combined centre and periphery heating is shown to give a more uniform temperature distribution, than periphery alone or centre alone heating could offer, in the 16 mm tubular microwave system. Furthermore, modelling of heating of foods in a microwave combination oven at 2450 MHz, in which the food is heated by combined microwave and convective heating, is described by solving for the electromagnetic fields in a model food load and then including these as a source term in a heat transfer model. Validation experiments of the numerical model showed good qualitative and quantitative agreement. Computers today are considerably faster than 10 - 15 years ago, which contributes to increased use of modelling tools for process design and development of optimised industrial microwave heating systems. It is suggested that this has contributed to increase the number of successful installations in food industry and will continue to support the steadily growing trend of industrial installations in the years to come...|$|R

During the HPTT process, pyrolysis oil undergoes a phase split yielding a gas phase, an aqueous phase and an oil phase. In this study, HPTT experiments were carried out at different operating conditions in a <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor. Experimental results showed that, with increasing temperature and residence time, the release of gases (mainly CO 2) and the production of water increased, reducing the oxygen content of the oil phase and hence increasing the energy content (from 14. 1 to 28. 4 MJ/kg) having the temperature a larger effect when compared to the residence time. Using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), an increase of the molecular weight of the oil phase, probably due to polymerisation of the sugars present in pyrolysis oil, was observed. When water was added as solvent to dilute the feed oil, a decrease of the molecular weight of the resulting oil phase was observed. This indicated that the concentration of organic components had a direct effect on the formation of high molecular weight components.

The lung surfactant membrane at the alveolar interface can have a very special arrangement, which affects the diffusional transport. We present a theoretical model for the diffusion of small molecules in membranes with a complex structure, and we specifically compare a membrane composed of a tubular bilayer network with a membrane consisting of a stack of bilayers. Oxygen and carbon dioxide differ {{in terms of their}} solubility in the aqueous and the lipid regions of the membrane, and we show that this difference clearly influences their transport properties in the different membrane structures. During normal respiration, the rate-limiting step for carbon dioxide transport is in the gas phase of the different compartments in the lung. For oxygen, on the other hand, the rate is limited by the transport between alveoli and the capillary blood vessels, including the lung surfactant membrane. In a membrane with a structure of a <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> lipid network, oxygen transport is facilitated to a significant extent compared with the structure of aligned lipid bilayers. The model calculations in the present study show that transport of oxygen through the tubular structure is indeed ca 30 per cent faster than transport through a membrane composed of stacked bilayers. The tubular network will also facilitate the transport of apolar substances between the gas phase and the blood. Important examples are ethanol and other volatile liquids that can leave the blood through the lungs, and gaseous anaesthetics or volatile solvents that are inhaled.

However, the major finding in this study was, following a more detailed analysis in coronal sections of the shell part of the nucleus accumbens, the existence of nerve cell patches of strong D- 1 receptor immunoreactivity associated with low D- 2 receptor, dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. These patches were mainly surrounded by areas of strong D- 2 receptor, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter immunoreactivities and could be found also in the olfactory tubercle. Similar observations were made in postnatal rats. Serial reconstructions of the patches of strong D- 1 receptor immunoreactivity in the rostrocaudal direction were made. The patches formed a <b>continuous</b> <b>tubular</b> nerve cell system in the shell part of the nucleus accumbens. Since this nerve cell system was found to be surrounded by a high density of dopamine terminals, it may represent a compartment where dopamine transmission mainly acts on D- 1 receptors via local diffusion (i. e. via volume transmission). However, {{it must be noted that}} the D- 1 receptor rich patches constitute only a small fraction of the nucleus accumbens and the overall density of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive terminals correlates with the density of both D- 1 and D- 2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens. In conclusion, the present paper gives new aspects on the chemical microarchitecture of the nucleus accumbens...|$|R
