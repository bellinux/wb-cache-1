In term of <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> and coal quality, the suberinite was first discovered by He et al. (1995) in Santanghu Coalfield through {{the research of}} <b>coal</b> <b>petrography.</b> An and Ma (2013) studied the No. 9 coal seam at Hanshuiquan and Tiaohu sags in Santanhu, and judged {{that it is the}} long flame coal characterized by low or extremely low ash, high volatiles, extremely low sulfur, high calorific value, high thermo stability, easy selection, high content of arsenic, extremely low chloride, low phosphorous, low fluorine, and high content of oil. A preliminary study on the arsenic in Santanghu coal field was carried out by Huang (2014), and pointed out that arsenic is abundant in the pyrite. In term of the coal-forming swamp, Chinese coal geology scholars studied the coal-forming swamps of the Jurassic coal accumulating basins in the north of Xinjiang since 2010. For instance, Nie et al. (2016) pointed out that the coal-forming swamp in Turpan-Hami Basin is mainly comprise of wetland marsh facies and wetland forest swamp facies. Li et al. (2012 a, b) deemed that the coal-forming swamp mainly consists of dry forest swamp facies and wetland forest swamp facies in eastern Junggar coalfield. Alimujiang et al. (2014) considered that the coal-forming swamp is mainly composed of wetland swamp facies and wet forest swamp facies in southern Junggar coalfield. Zhang et al. (2015) studied the Jurassic coal-forming swamp in Santanghu, and believed that the major coal seam in Xishanyao Formation is transited from wide water marsh to wet forest swamp, and through the research of its <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> and coal-forming swamp, he found that exinite content is zero. This might be resulted from the small quantity of sample, which fails to accurately reflect the evolutionary characteristics of the coal-forming swamp in this area. For this reason, the major coal seams in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield are selected to study the coal-forming swamp characteristics and evolution rules. Moreover, this paper makes a comparison with the previously studied on coal-forming swamp of Xishanyao Formation in Xinjiang to study the type and characteristic of coal-forming swamp and its evolution characteristic in Xishanyao Formation (Teichmüller and Teichmüller 1982).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the 2012 ’s {{workover}} treatment statistic in the Hancheng block, {{the eastern}} Ordos gas field, the workover caused by pulverized coal accounts for 41. 8 % of the total, which has seriously affected the continuous and stable drainage.

We conclude that the determinant on output of pulverized coal is the nature of coal seam, however engineering factors cause the output of pulverized coal directly. The root-mean-square amplitude attribute analysis was first used to display the mechanical strength of coal seam. Based on the result, we made the prediction about the possibility of the output of pulverized coal and divided the studying area into four grades.

30|$|Coal facies is a {{function}} of the type of peat forming flora. The flora in a given geological milieu are controlled by climate, ground water table, nutrient supply and chemistry of water (marine influence). The ground water is the most important factor which determines not only the type of vegetation but also controls the redox potential (oxic to anoxic) and thereby the mode of preservation of plant litter or intensity of humification process. A peat accumulating system can be distinguished in coastal lowland and freshwater peat land (Diessel 1992). The coastal low land is protected by sand bars or barrier beaches, close to tidal influences and grade into marine-influenced to freshwater mires. The fresh water peatlands are inland mire, having no connection to sea, including upper delta and alluvial plain swamps, marshes and bogs. Peat may form in forest swamps from various plant associations, or in marshes with herbaceous vegetation (sedges and grasses) or in open swamps with predominantly submerged and floating plants or in raised bog with mosses or shrubs or trees. Several coal geologists made significant contributions towards the depositional system, mention may be the name of Amijaya and Littke (2005), Marques (2002), Sebag et al. (2006), and Silva et al. (2008). For retrieving the type of Karharbari <b>coal</b> facies, <b>petrography</b> based model proposed by Hacquebard and Donaldson (1969), Diessel (1986), Calder et al.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of blending on the emissions of NOx and N 2 O during the fluidized bed combustion of five coals with different levels of nitrogen, volatile matter, and fixed carbon contents, and diverse coal and char petrographic composition. The devolatilization chars were produced in a fluidized bed combustor. Using the petrographic analyses of the coals, sixteen coal blends were made to carry out the combustion tests. The combustion of individual coals and the sixteen blends was carried out in an electrically heated atmospheric fluidized bed combustor. The emissions of NOx reached maximum values at a bed temperature around 1173 K and decreased with lower combustion temperatures. The amount of nitrous oxide formed decreased, for all five coals, as the bed temperature increased from 1053 to 1303 K. These trends are consistent with the observed experimental data obtained by other researchers. It was observed that for ratios of 1. 3 to 1. 6 of fixed carbon to volatile matter, both NOx and N 2 O emission levels were minimal and, outside this range, both oxides showed a sharp increase in their formation/emissions. The coal blends were also found to show similar trends with increasing the bed temperatures.

40|$|Several {{kinds of}} data from the Cretaceous Morley and Eocene Beaumont Coal Measures at Ohai Coalfield were {{integrated}} {{in order to develop}} models for sedimentary elastic deposition and mire formation. These data comprise lithostratigraphic relationships at outcrop and basin scale and information on <b>coal</b> chemistry, <b>petrography</b> and palynology. Results indicate that although deposition of both Morley and Beaumont Coal Measures were tectonically controlled by the development of sedimentary sub-basins, Cretaceous mires and sedimentary regimes differ from those of the Eocene. Although the data available at Ohai Coalfield are insufficient for interpretation of fluvial channel planform, other characteristics of the sedimentary environments can be deduced. Accumulation of the Morley Coal Measures occurred in two types of non-contemporaneous environment, 'S'-environments, in which widespread sand was deposited by fluvial channels and few mires developed, and 'C'-environments in which only fine-grained elastic deposition occurred and mires were extensive and persistent. Three environments, which were sometimes contemporaneous, have been identified in the Beaumont Coal Measures. In Beaumont 'S'-environments, sandy elastic sediment was deposited widely by fluvial channels whereas in the 'C'- and 'C-S'-environments, mires developed and sedimentation in shallow lakes and streams was widespread. In the 'C'-environments channels carried mud with little sand but in the 'C-S'-environments sand deposition was more common. Morley mires, which were larger and longer-lived than Beaumont mires, were rarely flooded and may have been domed. In contrast, Beaumont mires were frequently flooded and probably not domed. Most Morley mires developed in environments with widespread mires drained by low energy streams. In contrast high energy fluvial activity was more common in Beaumont mire-forming environments; Beaumont mires are inferred to have frequently developed on lake margins. Palynological evidence indicates that the Morley floral assemblage was dominated by gymnosperms whereas both angiosperms and gymnosperms formed significant proportions of the Beaumont flora. The information available on Morley coal allows development of a model for peat accumulation. Peat accumulation was influenced by a number of interdependent parameters including water table level, nutrient supply and acidity. In response to environmental conditions two different peat types formed. At the base, top and margins of mires peat was generally woodier, less degraded and less oxidised. In contrast, peat in the mire centres suffered both more non-oxidative degradation as well as oxidation and contained less woody material. As mires developed, the initially diverse gymnosperm flora became dominated by the podocarp Phyllocladidites mawsonii however this change in vegetation did not affect the character of the peat...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{remains the}} 5 th largest {{producer}} and 4 th {{largest exporter of}} coal in the world. It is also the largest supplier of coal to the European Union. This fact is significant as the European Union has recently supported the environmental lobby that threatens the combined full scale use of coal in Europe and other first world countries. This promotes the development of clean coal technologies in order to counter the ever increasing number of environmental constraints threatening the export market. One critical development in clean coal technologies is coal beneficiation, which allows the reduction of ash and inert content. Permian coals from South Africa have characteristically high ash and inertinite contents and therefore require further beneficiation. The Witbank coalfield No. 4 seam is no exception. It {{can be described as}} being more inert and having a higher mineral content compared to the No. 2 seam in the same coalfield also mined for export purposes. With the increase in environmental legislation and the push towards “clean coal” this raises a concern in terms of the performance and marketability of export coal produced from the No. 4 seam. This seam will in the future be economically significant and is still a great source for export steam coal. Due to the nature and composition of the No. 4 seam, coal beneficiation is essential to reduce the mineral and inert content to be in line with export quality specification levels. Washability characteristics of the No. 4 seam coal indicate that the No. 4 seam is difficult to beneficiate. Until recently the main clean-ability parameters evaluated in South African export coals as per customer specification included mainly heating value, moisture and ash reduction with little to no work being done on trace element concentration reduction. This paper focuses on the partitioning of the trace elements within the seam in relation to the organic and inorganic affinity of the trace elements and possible methods of trace element reduction by removal using coal beneficiation techniques. The techniques investigated include reduction by washing using dense medium beneficiation and flotation. In each evaluation the focus was on trace-element-tomineral and trace-element-to-organic matter relationship and hence setting the basis for liberation analysis to evaluate reducibility. By the evaluation of the <b>coal</b> mineralogy, <b>petrography</b> and trace element relationships, methods of optimum trace element reduction can be established. With the focus on marketing it was shown that carbon loss need not be sacrificed in the reduction of specific trace elements in the No. 4 seam and that the trace element distribution itself allows for beneficiation whilst maintaining acceptable yields. Processes and possible beneficiation techniques for optimum trace element reduction and marketability {{in the case of the}} No. 4 seam are proposed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>petrography,</b> micro Raman {{spectroscopy}} (MRS) and {{thermogravimetric analysis}} (TGA) {{were employed to}} obtain further inside into the evolution of char structure and its reactivity during heat treatment in the temperature range of 300 - 1400 °C on inertinite-rich South African coals. The lack of publications particularly on South African coals, relating Raman spectroscopy to <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> and thermogravimetric analyses when investigating the evolution of char structure was a motivation for the study. A laboratory scale Packed Bed Balance Reactor (PBBR) was used to prepare coal char samples at various temperatures; that is 300, 600, 800 and 1000 °C. A drop tube furnace (DTF) was used to prepare chars at 1400 °C. Raman spectra of coal and chars were measured on the first-order in the range 800 - 2000 cm- 1. Characteristic bonds for amorphous carbons, G band (graphitic) and D band (disorder), were deconvoluted and curve fitted using the OPUS software. Three bands for coal particles were determined; that is the G band at 1590 - 1603 cm- 1, D 1 band at 1343 - 1355 cm- 1 and D 3 band at 1507 - 1557 cm- 1. Four bands were determined for char particles; that is the G band at 1590 - 1603 cm- 1, D 1 band at 1343 - 1355 cm- 1, D 3 band at 1507 - 1557 cm- 1 and D 4 band at 1200 - 1232 cm- 1. All the bands were fitted {{with a mixture of}} Lorentzian and Gaussian functions except the D 3 band for which only a Gaussian function was used. It was found that sp 2 -sp 3 bonding (reactive sites/crystallites) occurred in dense chars (originating from inertinite particles) at the initial heat treatment temperature, and these sp 2 -sp 3 bondings are known to be consumed later at high temperature. Earlier consumption of sp 2 -sp 3 bonding was observed in porous chars, since they were vitrinitic in origin and contained more reactive sites. The D 1 and G bandwidths showed a significant change with heat treatment, which was consistent with structural modification due to high temperatures. Reflectance measurements, that is: mean vitrinite reflectance (MVR) and mean total reflectance (MTR), showed an increase with heat treatment temperature. MVR and MTR were successfully correlated with Raman parameters (D 1 and G bandwidth). MVR and MTR also showed a good correlation with combustion reactivity measured by TGA. Char morphology analyses were carried out petrographically by point counting for quantification and qualification purposes. The char morphology data showed {{a significant increase in the}} amount of dense/solid chars as compared to the porous chars with an increase in temperature which is in-line with expectations from the inertinite-rich parent coal. Correlations between the D 1 and G bandwidths and char morphology counts were carried out. An inverse of D 1 and G bandwidth showed good correlation with the proportion of dense/solid and porous char. It was concluded from this study that the best correlations between Raman spectroscopy and <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> was through reflectance measurements, and the identified Raman D 1 and G bandwidths. A good linear correlation was also found between Raman D 1 and G bandwidths and combustion reactivity. These correlations confirm the strong connection between char structure and its reactivity and illustrate the advantage of Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> with respect to other structural analyses. Therefore, the use of MRS and petrography on coal chars enhances the understanding of char structural evolution on a molecular level and may lead to enhanced understanding of pulverised fuel (pf) coal combustion...|$|E

Substantial free gas was stored in pores and microfractures at the time of substantial gas generating from coal seams in the burial period. This expanded volumetrically due to the pressure drop in the uplift period, and thus together with the desorbed and liberated coal seam gas, became the important gas source for gas accumulation in the uplift period (Cui et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2010). Starting from the discussion of a theoretical model of coal seam adsorption–desorption, by means of thermal simulation and gas accumulation simulation experiments of actual coal samples, the geological process of gas accumulation in the uplift period of coal measure strata is demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{literature}} on the classification and characterization of chars generated from lump coals during synthesis gas production, especially from a South African perspective. Two inertinite-rich medium rank C Highveld lump coals (Coals A and B) were utilized to study their burning behaviour in a packed-bed reactor combustion unit. Seven sample increments were dissected per coal obtained from predefined zones within the reactor. Proximate analysis revealed that Coal A released 10 % more of its volatile matter yield within the reactor zones when compared to Coal B. Petrographic analysis showed that Coal B had a higher content of reactive macerals when compared to Coal A. The reactive maceral content of Coal A was dominated by vitrinite and liptinite whereas for Coal B, reactive macerals were comprised of 49 % vitrinite and liptinite and the other 51 % is reactive semifusinite and reactive inertodetrinite. This difference leads to different reactivity behaviour when these coal samples were subjected to high temperatures.

The petrographic data of coals was processed with special emphasis on quantifying vitrinite sub macerals and their association with coal carbonisation parameters as well as coke strength. The association between <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> data with coke strength of binary blends as well as industrial blends was also examined. Coke strength parameters including drum index and CSR were found to be predominantly influenced by coal rank with few exceptions of high rank and low fluidity coals. The study showed the association between coke strength and coke micro-texture such that coke strength after reactions was related to increased anisotropic texture. On the basis of vitrinite sub-components a new coal parameter was devised. The new parameter, the ratio of difference of collinite and telinite to the mean vitrinite reflectance, is found to predict coke strength of single coals with high confidence. However, the same parameter could not predict coke strength of binary coke as well as coke made in industrial processes. The study suggested that interaction of sub-vitrinite during carbonisation could be responsible for the limitation of application of the new parameter to predict coke strength of blends.

In this paper, twenty-two samples were collected from the three typical boreholes in Hanshuiquan district, representing the 11 coal seam sequences (7 #, 8 #, 9 #, 13 #, 14 #, 15 #, 17 #, 18 #, 19 #, 20 #, 22 #), respectively. The petrographic characteristics of the coal-bearing sequence in Xishanyao Formation were firstly summarized systematicly, and then the coal-forming swamp characteristics and succession mechanism of the coal seam in Xishanyao Formation were defined by analyzing the samples. The maceral composition, structure, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of coal are included in original genetic criteria of coal-forming swamp analysis. And the composition of <b>coal</b> <b>petrography,</b> maceral and microlithotype are {{the most frequently used}} parameters. Coal is composed of microscopic constituents and inorganic substances. The Xishanyao Formation maceral mainly consists of vitrinite (65.74 %– 97.01 %), inertinite (1.93 %– 34 %), and the exinite shows the mode of regular change. The coal-forming swamp in Xishanyao Formation possesses the characteristics of mainly marsh, wet forest swamp facies, and shallow water covered forest swamp facies, and a few of coal seams distribute in the deep water covered forest swamp facies. In addition, the sporopollens in Xishanyao Formation are mainly Pinaceae evergreen broad leaf and needle-leaved plants, Osmundaceae, Cyatheaceae and Lygodiaceae, indicating that the warm and humid tropic-subtropical climate conductive to the persistent growth of coal-forming plants in the Middle Jurassic. The coal-forming swamp shows the characteristics of vertically upward fluctuation through the periodic transition. It indicates a shallow-deep-shallow change process of the water covered depth in the swamp. This is the principal factor for the formation of the high-quality and continuous coal seam in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the result of}} the detailed investigations carried out on the coal characteristics, including <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> and its geochemistry of the Pabedana region. A total of 16 samples were collected from four coal seams d 2, d 4, d 5, and d 6 of the Pabedana underground mine which is located in {{the central part of the}} Central-East Iranian Microcontinent. These samples were reduced to four samples through composite sampling of each seam and were analyzed for their petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical compositions. Proximate analysis data of the Pabedana coals indicate no major variations in the moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon contents in the coals of different seams. Based on sulfur content, the Pabedana coals may be classified as low-sulfur coals. The low-sulfur contents in the Pabedana coal and relatively low proportion of pyritic sulfur suggest a possible fresh water environment during the deposition of the peat of the Pabedana coal. X-ray diffraction and petrographic analyses indicate the presence of pyrite in coal samples. The Pabedana coals have been classified as a high volatile, bituminous coal in accordance with the vitrinite reflectance values (58. 75 – 74. 32 %) and other rank parameters (carbon, calorific value, and volatile matter content). The maceral analysis and reflectance study suggest that the coals in all the four seams are of good quality with low maceral matter association. Mineralogical investigations indicate that the inorganic fraction in the Pabedana coal samples is dominated by carbonates; thus, constituting the major inorganic fraction of the coal samples. Illite, kaolinite, muscovite, quartz, feldspar, apatite, and hematite occur as minor or trace phases. The variation in major elements content is relatively narrow between different coal seams. Elements Sc,, Zr, Ga, Ge, La, As, W, Ce, Sb, Nb, Th, Pb, Se, Tl, Bi, Hg, Re, Li, Zn, Mo, and Ba show varying negative correlation with ash yield. These elements possibly have an organic affinity and may be present as primary biological concentrations either with tissues in living condition and/or through sorption and formation of organometallic compounds...|$|E
40|$|The Soma Basin hosts three coal seams (kM 2, kM 3 and kP 1) {{and several}} altered tuff layers within the Miocene sequences. This study {{focuses on the}} {{determination}} of <b>coal</b> <b>petrography,</b> Rock-Eval pyrolysis, mineralogy and elemental contents of the three coal seams from Eynez, Işıklar and Deniş sectors in the basin, and to identify the mineralogy of altered tuff layers within kM 2 and kP 1 seams. The routine coal quality analyses show that coal samples from the kM 2 seam are characterized by lower ash yields and total S contents, and higher gross calorific values than kM 3 and kP 1 seams. The mineralogical composition of the bulk coal samples from the kM 2 seam is made up mainly of quartz, clay minerals and lesser amounts of feldspars and carbonates. In the kM 3 and {{as well as in}} the lower part of kP 1 seam carbonate minerals are being dominant phases due to the existences of fossil shell-bearing bands in the coal beds and intercalations. The statistical data implies that major elements in bulk coal samples, such as Al, Fe, K, Mg and Na, and the vast majority of minor and trace elements, as we expected, have inorganic affinity. The trace element contents and elemental enrichments are generally changeable from seam to seam; nevertheless, Cs, Li and U are commonly enriched in all studied coal seams. These could be related to the differences ion ash yields and mineralogical compositions of coal beds within the seams. The mineralogical compositions of the altered tuff layers identified within the kM 2 and kP 1 seams display similar compositions with tonsteins; therefore, these layers are presumably in air-fall ash that were originated from synchronous felsic volcanic activities around the basin. The existences of volcanic layers also have has some influences on the mineralogical and elemental composition of both seams. The SEM data shows that clay minerals originated from these layers and certain trace elements (e. g. As and Zr) are 2 enriched in the coal layers below the tuff layers in the kM 2 seam. This might be related to penetration of leached pore waters into these layers and precipitation of epigenetic minerals. The <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> data and coal facies diagram show that precursor peat of the kM 2 seam was accumulating under telmatic, mesotrophic anoxic conditions where the water level was high and stable. The relatively low ash yields and thicker coal beds suggest the a lower clastic input ratio from the margins; therefore, the aluminosilicate affiliated elements display lower concentrations in this seam. Following periods when the, water-table fluctuated several times and covered entire mire surface; thus, peat formation ceased and several clastic and calcareous intercalations were deposited in the kM 3 and kP 1 seams. These imply the development of limno-telmatic conditions where fluvial influences took places during peat accumulation of both seams. Therefore, clastic inputs from the margins were high which resulted in elevated the concentrations of aluminosilicate affiliated elements. Furthermore, the mineralogical compositions of coal and intercalations of both seams also suggest the development of neutral to alkaline conditions. Considering the maceral compositions along with the thickness of coal, coal seams in the Soma Basin might have and can suggest the indicate oil generation potential; however, the data of pyrolysis analysis data shows that the studied coal seams are mainly gas-prone and only certain coal beds have mixed hydrocarbon generation capacity. Nevertheless, the changes of vegetation and depositional conditions also have reflections on the HI values. The slightly higher HI and TOC in the kM 2 seems to be related to high contribution of woody material in peat and the development of more acidic conditions, whereas the predominance of herbaceous plant and alkaline conditions in the kM 3 and kP 1 seams resulted in relative low HI and TOC values. All data presented in this study indicates that lithological features, differences in coal qualities and elemental contents in the Soma Basin were mainly controlled by changes ion the depositional conditions and as well as detrital inputs during Miocene...|$|E
40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as feed coals to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. <b>Coal</b> <b>petrography</b> was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the feed coal samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the feed coal fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm feed coal samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm feed coal sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm feed coal sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a feed coal with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the feed coal with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

40|$|In {{southern}} Africa, coal is {{a relatively}} abundant and cheap fossil fuel which is {{a major source of}} energy and a huge income generator. Although coal has found a lot of use, it is an anthropogenic source of trace element emissions and although these trace elements (TEs) may occur in parts per million, mass consumption of coal during utilisation results in the release of large quantities of potentially harmful TEs to the environment. With reported diseases like arsenism, minamata disease and selenosis (Zheng et al., 1999) from coal combustion emissions, it is important to regulate TE emissions. Due to global perception, the following TEs were chosen for consideration: As, B, Be, Co, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se and V (which were analysed by ICP-MS) and Hg (which was analysed using an automatic Hydride Generation-Flow Injection Mercury System). There is limited data on TEs in African coals and whilst no TE control legislation exists, Pb in petrol is currently being regulated in South Africa. Important factors such as the mode of occurrence of TEs and their associations with other minerals in coal influence, or affect, the fate of TEs release during coal utilisation. Three run-of-mine (ROM) belt cut coal samples were supplied by Hwange Colliery and two South African samples were used for comparison. The coal samples were subjected to density fractionation and sequential leaching. Mineral matter was determined using XRD and <b>coal</b> <b>petrography</b> was used to consider the organic components. Comparisons of the ROM coals with average global and mean South African values were carried out. Generally, TEs like Cd, Sb and Se in ROM samples of both coalfields appear consistent with published SA data and global average values, whilst values of Hg and Mn in all the coal samples are above the global and SA average values. Density fractionation data show most TEs are concentrated in higher density fractions, hence showing an association with minerals over organic matter. Most TEs in Zimbabwean coals seem to show a strong correlation with mineral matter which should be able to be removed prior to coal utilisation during efficient beneficiation practises...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} of the stratigraphy and coal geology of upper Paparoa Coal Measures and Paleocene age Brunner Coal Measures in the Southern Rapahoe Sector of Greymouth Coalfield. Lack of any clear lithostratigraphic or biostratigraphic definition for the upper contact of Dunollie Coal Measures with Brunner sediments has handicapped previous investigations. Stratigraphic criteria for the respective units are therefore revised. Brunner Coal Measures are divided into a "Brunner Formation" comprising Eocene coal measures and a "Paleocene Brunner Formation" comprising two members. The Brunner Conglomerate Member incorporates all conglomerates previously assigned to both the Dunollie and Brunner-P and the Brunner-P Member comprises Paleocene coal measures overlying the conglomerates. Dunollie Formation extends from the first carbonaceous horizon above transitional lithosomes to the last carbonaceous occurrence below Brunner Conglomerate Member. Revised boundary criteria are applied to new Dunollie Formation isopachs, cross-sections and paleogeographic models. Over much of Greymouth Coalfield the Dunollie Formation and Brunner-P Member have only very minor coal occurrences, with organic matter more commonly occurring as leaf horizons or preserved rootlets. A key objective of this thesis is determination of reasons for relatively abundant coal occurrence in the Southern Rapahoe Sector, based on lithostratigraphic analysis of the coal measures and investigation of coal properties, including <b>coal</b> <b>petrography,</b> chemistry and palynology. Both Brunner P and Dunollie coals are dominated by vitrinite. However, volatile matter, sulphur content and TPI are higher in Brunner P coals. Angiosperm abundance increases from Dunollie to Brunner P. This floral change affects volatile matter but not TPI, which was mainly controlled by a combination of water table and nutrient supply. Elevated sulphur content does not influence volatile matter, indicating that sulphur access was diagenetic and relatively late. Unusually abundant coal occurrence in the Southern Rapahoe Sector is attributed to syndepositional faulting which constrained major fluvial activity to the north. Even so, overbank flooding and channel migration within anastomosing and meandering Dunollie fluvial systems disrupted most mires before thick peat could accumulate. Fluvial activity became further constrained during accumulation of the uppermost Dunollie, allowing development of relatively widespread, sustained mire conditions...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Drives {{to reduce}} carbon dioxide {{emissions}} and improve efficiency make pressurised gasification an attractive option in future coal utilisation technologies. Process conditions in pressurised gasification differ from conventional entrained flow combustion in pressure, atmosphere, peak temperature and heating rate, yet there is sparse literature concerning coal behaviour under pressurised conditions. Previous work suggests that bituminous coals can show enhanced plasticity at high pressures and this phenomenon may not be predicted by standard tests of coking properties. Previous modelling of char reactivity and burnout in combustion and gasification has failed {{to take account of}} the petrographic variability of coals. Current work to improve the predictive capacity of these models requires evaluation of the effects of different macerals and of char preparation pressure on char behaviour. Prior studies of whole coals subjected to high pressure and high temperature conditions have shown that daughter char morphology is influenced by particle heating rate, the size distribution of the feed coal, furnace pressure, feed rate, coal rank and the parent <b>coal</b> <b>petrography.</b> Chars were produced by pyrolysis at 1100 or 1300 °C and 1, 5, 8, 10 and 15 atm furnace pressure, and by combustion at 1100 °C and 1 atm furnace pressure, from a suite of East Australian bituminous coals. The characteristics of the chars and their parent feed coals were quantified using semi-automated image analysis, as well as petrographic, particle size and chemical analyses. Relationships between the morphology of the chars and properties of the parent coal and furnace pressure were established. Daughter char morphology and volatile yield was found {{to be related to the}} petrographic composition of the parent feed coals, their full reflectance profiles and the char preparation pressure. Chars derived from vitrinite-rich lithotypes and those prepared under high pressure conditions show larger mean diameters, porosities, sphericities and proportions of porous char types. Volatile yield is related to the vitrinite content of the lithotype. A parameter derived from full coal reflectograms proves to be effective for prediction of char morphology and trends in volatile yield. The Carbon Burnout Kinetic model is improved in its predictive value by including parent coal vitrinite content as an input parameter and could be further improved by utilising the full coal reflectogram parameter...|$|E
