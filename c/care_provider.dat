5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by a health <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner {{aspect of the}} heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This study {{examined}} the perspectives and experiences of patients, parents, and health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> with shared medical appointments (SMAs) for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Specifically studied were reasons to attend SMAs, perceived differences between SMAs and individual medical appointments, patient-valued health care aspects, and providers' performance. Methods: Fifty-two patients, 8 parents, and 36 health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> participated. Perspectives on SMAs were assessed with questionnaires and an online focus group. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> had work-related reasons to conduct SMAs. Patients and parents primarily valued {{the presence of other}} patients during SMAs. According to health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> and patients, a higher or similar amount of information was discussed during SMAs as opposed to individual appointments, respectively. SMAs did contain more discussion about lifestyle. Most consultation aspects considered important by the patients were performed by their health <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Patient satisfaction with SMAs did tend to decrease after 3 months. Parents were somewhat more critical about SMAs. Conclusions: Health <b>care</b> <b>providers,</b> patients, and parents were generally positive about SMAs. Future studies should examine the impact of the presence of parents and different health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> during SMAs, and that of differences in patient age, type of insulin treatment, and disease-related problems.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{expectations}} of patients for managing pain induced by exercise and mobilization (PIEM) have seldom been investigated. We identified {{the views of}} patients and <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> regarding pain management induced by exercise and mobilization during physical therapy programs. Methods We performed a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with a stratified sample of 12 patients (7 women) and 14 <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> (6 women) : 4 general practitioners [GPs], 1 rheumatologist, 1 physical medicine physician, 1 geriatrician, 2 orthopedic surgeons, and 5 physical therapists. Results Patients and <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> have differing views on PIEM in the overall management {{of the state of}} disease. Patients' descriptions of PIEM were polymorphic, and they experienced it as decreased health-related quality of life. The impact of PIEM was complex, and patient views were sometimes ambivalent, ranging from denial of symptoms to discontinuation of therapy. <b>Care</b> <b>providers</b> agreed that PIEM is generally not integrated in management strategies. <b>Care</b> <b>providers</b> more often emphasized the positive and less often the negative dimensions of PIEM than did patients. However, the consequences of PIEM cited included worsened patient clinical condition, fears about physical therapy, rejection of the physical therapist and refusal of care. PIEM follow-up is not optimal and is characterized by poor transmission of information. Patients expected education on how better to prevent stress and anxiety generated by pain, education on mobilization, and adaptations of physical therapy programs according to pain intensity. Conclusion PIEM management could be optimized by alerting <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> to the situation, improving communication among <b>care</b> <b>providers,</b> and providing education to patients and <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{cultural}} competence among oncology health <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Specifically, the study assessed how career type, presence of previous diversity training, and education affected overall cultural competence of oncology health <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> The study used a quantitative survey design with self-administered questionnaires. A total of 36 voluntary oncology health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> completed the cultural competence assessment survey. Participants were asked of their cultural awareness/sensitivity, cultural behaviors, previous experiences of diversity trainings, and some demographics questions. Descriptive (e. g. mean, frequency distributions) and inferential (e. g. t-test, one-way analysis of variance) statistics were used to analyze the data. Findings of the study showed that the levels of cultural competence among oncology health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> were low to moderate. Oncology health <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> who were social workers and registered nurses tended to report more frequent culturally competent behaviors, compared to other career types of health <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> The study also found that those who had specific previous diversity training tended to report higher levels of cultural competence compared to those who did not have those diversity trainings.
