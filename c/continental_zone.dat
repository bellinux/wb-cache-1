25|$|Considering its {{relatively}} small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost {{part of the}} continental climatic zone, with small areas in the south falling within the Mediterranean climatic zone. The <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed Danubian Plain. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases {{during the second half}} of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern Rhodope Mountains, Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30–40km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western Rhodope Mountains, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Forests of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) form natural {{forests in}} most of the Mediterranean region as well as {{penetrating}} into the warmer sun-exposed areas and hillsides of the Atlantic region; they extend from sea level, with the subspecies ilex, to an altitude of 1400 metres, in some mountains and high plains of the interior; in the <b>continental</b> <b>zone,</b> the oak found is the subspecies rotundifolia, more resistant to such a climate. The holm oak can also be found at higher altitudes, but as isolated trees, not forming forests. Coastal oak forests and those of sublittoral mountains are extraordinarily rich and varied, with a variety of shrubs and lianas; often accompanied by bramble, honeysuckle, ivy, Viburnum tinus, butcher's broom and, in the southwest of the peninsula, wild olive trees. The oak forests of the Balearic Islands are also rich, and incorporate characteristic species of the islands, such as the Balearic cyclamen (Cyclamen balearicum Willk.).|$|E

500|$|The {{climate of}} Erie {{is typical of}} the Great Lakes. Erie is located in the snow belt that {{stretches}} from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; accordingly, its winters are typically cold, with heavy lake effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. Erie lies on the typical humid <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> (Köppen Dfa). The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms and fog.

2500|$|The <b>Continental</b> <b>Zone</b> Foothills {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} foothills, hills, and scattered buttes lying between Oregon's Blue and Wallowa {{mountains and the}} northwestern Snake River Plain, at an elevation of 1,800 to 6,600 feet (550 to 2,010 m). The combined masses of the Cascade Range and the Blue and Wallowa mountains block any maritime influence, creating a continental climate. As a result, plants are subject to wide temperature ranges, high evapotranspiration, and high early-season moisture stress. The distribution of desert shrubs varies with soil depth, texture, and elevation. The sagebrush steppe features mountain-mahogany, bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, and, on schist, Nevada greasebush. Scattered Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests also occur. The region provides important wildlife habitat. Mountain-mahogany and bitterbrush provide winter cover and forage for mule deer. Rodents, songbirds, and upland game birds also use the fruits of bitterbrush. The second largest of the Blue Mountains subregions, the <b>Continental</b> <b>Zone</b> Foothills {{is located in the}} easternmost part of the region, covering [...] in Oregon and [...] in Idaho.|$|E

2500|$|The Wallowas/Seven Devils Mountains {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} deeply dissected {{mountains in the}} Wallowas and Seven Devil ranges. It occupies the mid-elevation zone between the Subalpine-Alpine Zone and the <b>Continental</b> <b>Zone</b> Foothills, at an elevation of 3,000to9,200feet (914to2,804m). Perennial streams following fault lines have eroded deep canyons. The character of the region's xeric forest varies between moister maritime-influenced and drier continental areas, particularly in the diversity and extent of the shrub understory. The region is dominated by Western ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and grand fir, with western larch, ninebark, snowberry, Rocky Mountain maple, serviceberry, mountain big sagebrush, low sagebrush, big huckleberry, grouse huckleberry, twinflower, prince’s pine, elk sedge, and pinegrass. Higher elevations support subalpine fir. The region covers [...] in Oregon and [...] in Idaho, containing parts of the Wallowa-Whitman, Nez Perce, and Payette national forests.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Continental</b> <b>Zone</b> Highlands {{ecoregion}} is {{a moderately}} dissected, mountainous volcanic plateau, with scattered cinder cones, at {{an elevation of}} 4,000to6,700feet (1,219to2,042m). The region experiences seasonal temperature extremes and low annual precipitation. Many of its perennial streams flow south to end in the alkaline basins of the High Desert Wetlands of the Northern Basin and Range ecoregion. Frequent wildfires once influenced the open character of the forest. The predominant forest cover is ponderosa pine with a shrub or bunchgrass understory; the region lacks a zone of true firs found in other highland areas in the Blue Mountains. Characteristic species include ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, grand fir, juniper, antelope bitterbrush, snowberry, mountain-mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, stiff sagebrush, elk sedge, pinegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue. The region covers [...] in Oregon, including parts of the Ochoco and Malheur National Forests.|$|E
2500|$|The John Day/Clarno Highlands {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by moderately to highly dissected hills and low mountains that are uniformly covered by Western ponderosa pine forest with a grass and shrub understory. Elevation varies from 3,000to6,200feet (914to1,990m). The region includes broad streams fed more by springs than by snow melt. The continental climate is tempered by a marine influence; {{it is not as}} dry, nor are temperature extremes as great, as in the <b>Continental</b> <b>Zone</b> Highlands. Historically, frequent low intensity wildfires reduced fuel loading in forests of widely spaced old-growth ponderosa pine. Today, after years of fire suppression and high grade logging, land managers attempt to emulate historical fire regimes to reverse the trend toward dense thickets of young growth that carry hot, stand-replacing fires. Potential vegetation is mostly open ponderosa pine, with some Douglas-fir, western juniper, mountain-mahogany, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support grand fir, mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, ninebark, Wood's rose, Rocky Mountain maple, and willows. The region covers [...] in Oregon, including parts of the Ochoco, Malheur, and Umatilla national forests and lower elevations in the Mill Creek, Bridge Creek, Black Canyon and North Fork John Day wilderness areas.|$|E
