40|$|This {{dissertation}} reconstructs, wherever possible, {{the interior}} of the Cape house between 1670 and 1714 from the evidence preserved in surviving inventories and vendu rolls located in the Cape Archives. Chapter I examines those inventories which contribute something to our knowledge of the architecture of the period. Chapter II reconstructs certain features of doors, windows, fireplaces etc., from clues in the inventories and vendu rolls. Chapter III considers the way the different rooms in a cape house were furnished, and relates this to the developments in interior organisation and design that were taking place in seventeenth-century Europe in general and the Hague in particular. Chapter IV examines beds, window curtains, seat furniture, footstools, footwarmers and screens. Chapter V examines tables, carpets, chests, coffers, cupboards, cabinets, writing boxes, <b>cellarets,</b> mirrors, pictures, and wall racks. Chapter VI deals with lighting equipment, aids to cleanliness, basketware, skins, leatherware and cooperage. Chapter VII examines the various items devoted to eating and drinking. Chapter VIII covers the domestic pursuits: smoking, reading, writing, sewing, knitting, spinning, music, indoor games, clocks, watches, scientific instruments, weapons and domestic pets. The Conclusion attempts to place the domestic world at the Cape in the context of contemporary Dutch culture. Comparisons are drawn between the Cape and other Dutch societies, and particularly between the Cape inventories and those of the Hague and New York, in order to pinpoint those qualities and features which are unique to the Cape house and the people who lived in it.

60|$|To this I assented, of course, {{and we all}} {{followed}} Mr. Mordaunt {{into the}} house. I was as much delighted {{with the appearance of}} things in the interior of Lilacsbush, as I had been with the exterior. Everywhere, it seemed to me, I met with the signs of Anneke's taste and skill. I do not wish the reader to suppose that the residence itself was of the very first character and class, for this it could not lay claim to be. Still, {{it was one of those}} staid, story-and-a-half dwellings, in which most of our first families were, and are content to dwell, in the country; very much resembling the good old habitation at Satanstoe in these particulars. The furniture, however, was of a higher town-finish than we found it necessary to use; and the little parlour in which we breakfasted was a model for an eating-room. The buffets in the corners were so well polished that one might see his face in them; the <b>cellarets</b> were ornamented with plated hinges, locks, etc., and the table itself shone like a mirror. I know not how it was, but the china appeared to me richer and neater than common under Anneke's pretty little hand; while the massive and highly-finished plate of the breakfast service, was such as could be wrought only in England. In a word, while everything appeared rich and respectable, there was a certain indescribable air of comfort, gentility, and neatness about the whole, that impressed me in an unusual manner.|$|R
60|$|So Captain Bruges {{entered the}} little dining-room with its {{mahogany}} table, {{and half a}} dozen chairs, and <b>cellaret,</b> and over the fireplace a portrait of Garibaldi, which had been left as a legacy to the landlady by her late lodger, Dr. Tresorio.|$|E
6000|$|... (Burgess, {{covering}} a lively satisfaction in his diplomatic cunning with a deprecatory cough, retires to the hearth. Lexy folds {{his arms and}} leans against the <b>cellaret</b> in a high-spirited attitude. Candida comes in with glasses, lemons, and a jug of hot water on a tray.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] {{the cook}} said, [...] "after such a shock {{as she has}} had; and she only just getting well after her illness. Two of you run upstairs and get a {{mattress}} off her bed and two pillows, and lay them down in the servants' hall; then take her in there and put her on them. Jane, get some brandy out of the <b>cellaret</b> and bring it here; a spoonful of that will do her good." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was more}} uncomfortable after she came home, {{for by the}} sounds when Mr. Kendal next emerged from his study, she found that he had locked himself in, to guard against further intrusion. And when she offered to return to him the key of the <b>cellaret,</b> he quietly replied that he should prefer her {{retaining}} it,--not a formidable answer in itself, but one which, coupled with the locking of the door, proved {{to her that she}} might do anything rather than invade his privacy.|$|E
6000|$|Like a man {{but half}} awake, obeying an apparition, Mr. Kendal {{put his hand}} {{into his pocket and}} gave her the key. She was {{instantly}} opening the <b>cellaret,</b> seeking among the bottles, and asking questions all the time. She proposed taking a jug of the kitchen-tea then in operation, and Mr. Dusautoy caught at the idea, so that poor Lucy beheld the dreadful spectacle of the vicar bearing a can full of steaming tea, and Mrs. Kendal a small cup with the 'spirituous liquor.' What was the asparagus to this? ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{grandfather}} had returned, and was busily engaged in pouring some gallons of newly arrived rum into the square bottles of his square <b>cellaret.</b> Whenever these home supplies were exhausted {{he would go}} to the Quiet Woman, and, standing {{with his back to the}} fire, grog in hand, tell remarkable stories of how he had lived seven years under the water-line of his ship, and other naval wonders, to the natives, who hoped too earnestly for a treat of ale from the teller to exhibit any doubts of his truth.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} the dining-room, by {{the orders of}} the individual in gaiters, Rebecca found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms usually are, when genteel families are out of town. The faithful chambers seem, as it were, to mourn the absence of their masters. The turkey carpet has rolled itself up, and retired sulkily under the sideboard: the pictures have hidden their faces behind old sheets of brown paper: the ceiling lamp is muffled up in a dismal sack of brown holland: the window-curtains have disappeared under all sorts of shabby envelopes: the marble bust of Sir Walpole Crawley is looking from its black corner at the bare boards and the oiled fire-irons, and the empty card-racks over the mantelpiece: the <b>cellaret</b> has lurked away behind the carpet: the chairs are turned up heads and tails along the walls: and in the dark corner opposite the statue, is an old-fashioned crabbed knife-box, locked and sitting on a dumb waiter.|$|E
60|$|When Herbert Fitzgerald {{got back}} to Castle Richmond it was nearly dark. He opened the hall door without ringing the bell, and walking at once into the dining-room, threw himself into a large leathern chair which always stood near the fire-place. There was a bright fire burning on the hearth, and he drew himself close to it, putting his wet feet up on to the fender, {{thinking}} that he would at any rate warm himself before he went in among any of the family. The room, with its deep red curtains and ruby-embossed paper, was almost dark, {{and he knew that}} he might remain there unseen and unnoticed for the next half hour. If he could only get a glass of wine! He tried the <b>cellaret,</b> which was as often open as locked, but now unfortunately it was closed. In such a case it was impossible to say whether the butler had the key or Aunt Letty; so he sat himself down without that luxury.|$|E
6000|$|The diamond pin, {{undergoing}} valuation in London, still {{represented a}} present terror in his mind. The money, the money--he {{was the most}} attentive husband in England when {{he thought of the}} money! At the time when Lord Harry's carriage stopped at his house-door, he was in the dining-room, taking a bottle of brandy from the <b>cellaret</b> in the sideboard. Looking instantly out of the window, he discovered who the visitor was, and decided on consulting his instructions in the pocket-diary. The attempt was rendered useless, as soon as he had opened the book, by the unlucky activity of the servant in answering the door. Her master stopped her in the hall. He was pleasantly conscious of the recovery of his cunning. But his memory (far from active under the most favourable circumstances) was slower than ever at helping him now. On {{the spur of the moment}} he could only call to mind that he had been ordered to prevent a meeting between Lord Harry and Iris. [...] "Show the gentleman into my consulting-room," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|For {{his present}} use Mr Harding took a lodging in Barchester, and thither were {{conveyed}} such articles {{as he wanted}} for daily use:--his music, books, and instruments, his own arm-chair, and Eleanor's pet sofa; her teapoy and his <b>cellaret,</b> and also the slender but still sufficient contents of his wine-cellar. Mrs Grantly had much wished that her sister would reside at Plumstead, till her father's house at Crabtree should be ready for her; but Eleanor herself strongly resisted this proposal. It was in vain urged upon her, that a lady in lodgings cost more than a gentleman; and that, under her father's present circumstances, such an expense should be avoided. Eleanor had not pressed her father {{to give up the}} hospital in order that she might live at Plumstead Rectory and he alone in his Barchester lodgings; nor did Eleanor think that she would be treating a certain gentleman very fairly, if she betook herself to the house which he would be the least desirous of entering of any in the county. So she got a little bedroom for herself behind the sitting-room, and just over the little back parlour of the chemist, with whom they were to lodge. There was somewhat of a savour of senna softened by peppermint about the place; but, on the whole, the lodgings were clean and comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How weak am I,' said Arthur Clennam, {{when he was}} gone, 'that I could shed {{tears at}} this reception! I, who have never {{experienced}} anything else; who have never expected anything else.' He not only could, but did. It was the momentary yielding of a nature that had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions, but had not quite given up all its hopeful yearnings yet. He subdued it, took up the candle, and examined the room. The old articles of furniture were in their old places; the Plagues of Egypt, much the dimmer for the fly and smoke plagues of London, were framed and glazed upon the walls. There was the old <b>cellaret</b> with nothing in it, lined with lead, like a sort of coffin in compartments; there was the old dark closet, also with nothing in it, {{of which he had}} been many a time the sole contents, in days of punishment, when he had regarded it as the veritable entrance to that bourne to which the tract had found him galloping. There was the large, hard-featured clock on the sideboard, which he used to see bending its figured brows upon him with a savage joy when he was behind-hand with his lessons, and which, when it was wound up once a week with an iron handle, used to sound as if it were growling in ferocious anticipation of the miseries into which it would bring him. But here was the old man come back, saying, 'Arthur, I'll go before and light you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|From love {{by natural}} {{sequence}} to death. Where is the Park Street Cemetery? A hundred hack-drivers leap from their boxes and invade the market, {{and after a}} short struggle one of them uncarts his capture in a burial-ground--a ghastly new place, close to a tramway. This is not what is wanted. The living dead are here--the people whose names are not yet altogether perished and whose tombstones are tended. [...] "Where are the old dead?" [...] "Nobody goes there," [...] says the driver. [...] "It is up that road." [...] He points up a long and utterly deserted thoroughfare, running between high walls. This is the place, and the entrance to it, with its gardener waiting with one brown, battered rose for the visitor, its grilled door and its professional notices, bears a hideous likeness {{to the entrance of}} Simla churchyard. But, once inside, the sightseer stands in the heart of utter desolation--all the more forlorn for being swept up. Lower Park Street cuts a great graveyard in two. The guide-books will tell you when the place was opened and when it was closed. The eye is ready to swear that it is as old as Herculaneum and Pompeii. The tombs are small houses. It is as though we walked down the streets of a town, so tall are they and so closely do they stand--a town shrivelled by fire, and scarred by frost and siege. Men must have been afraid of their friends rising up before the due time that they weighted them with such cruel mounds of masonry. Strong man, weak woman, or somebody's [...] "infant son aged fifteen months," [...] for each the squat obelisk, the defaced classic temple, the <b>cellaret</b> of chunam, or the candlestick of brickwork--the heavy slab, the rust-eaten railings, the whopper-jawed cherubs, and the apoplectic angels. Men were rich in those days and could afford to put a hundred cubic feet of masonry into the grave of even so humble a person as [...] "Jno. Clements, Captain of the Country Service, 1820." [...] When the [...] "dearly beloved" [...] had held rank answering to that of Commissioner, the efforts are still more sumptuous and the verse.... Well, the following speaks for itself:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir George, in fact, {{had every}} reason to be respectable. He had been a choir-boy at Windsor, had played to the old King's violoncello, had been {{intimate}} with him, and had received knighthood at the hand of his revered sovereign. He had a snuff-box which His Majesty gave him, and portraits of him and the young princes all over the house. He had also a foreign order (no other, indeed, than the Elephant and Castle of Kalbsbraten-Pumpernickel), conferred upon him by the Grand Duke when here with the allied sovereigns in 1814. With this ribbon round his neck, on gala days, and in a white waistcoat, the old gentleman looked splendid as he moved along in a blue coat with the Windsor button, and neat black small-clothes, and silk stockings. He lived in an old tall dingy house, furnished in the reign of George III., his beloved master, and not much more cheerful now than a family vault. They are awfully funereal, those ornaments of the close of the last century--tall gloomy horse-hair chairs, mouldy Turkey carpets with wretched druggets to guard them, little cracked sticking-plaster miniatures of people in tours and pigtails over high-shouldered mantelpieces, two dismal urns on each side of a lanky sideboard, and in the midst a queer twisted receptacle for worn-out knives with green handles. Under the sideboard stands a <b>cellaret</b> that looks as if it held half a bottle of currant wine, and a shivering plate-warmer that never could get any comfort out of the wretched old cramped grate yonder. Don't you know in such houses the grey gloom that hangs over the stairs, the dull-coloured old carpet that winds its way up the same, growing thinner, duller, and more threadbare as it mounts to the bedroom floors? There is something awful in the bedroom of a respectable old couple of sixty-five. Think of the old feathers, turbans, bugles, petticoats, pomatum-pots, spencers, white satin shoes, false fronts, the old flaccid boneless stays tied up in faded riband, the dusky fans, the old forty-years-old baby linen, the letters of Sir George when he was young, the doll of poor Maria who died in 1803, Frederick's first corduroy breeches, and the newspaper which contains the account of his distinguishing himself at the siege of Seringapatam. All these lie somewhere, damp and squeezed down into glum old presses and wardrobes. At that glass the wife has sat many times these fifty years; in that old morocco bed her children were born. Where are they now? Fred the brave captain, and Charles the saucy colleger: there hangs a drawing of him done by Mr. Beechey, and that sketch by Cosway was the very likeness of Louisa before-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The best view of Victoria Park is {{from the}} front window of St. Dominic's Parsonage, from which not a single chimney is visible. The parsonage is a semi-detached villa with a front garden and a porch. Visitors go up the flight of steps to the porch: tradespeople {{and members of the}} family go down by a door under the steps to the basement, with a breakfast room, used for all meals, in front, and the kitchen at the back. Upstairs, on the level of the hall door, is the drawing-room, with its large plate glass window looking on the park. In this room, the only sitting-room that can be spared from the {{children}} and the family meals, the parson, the Reverend James Mavor Morell does his work. He is sitting in a strong round backed revolving chair at the right hand end of a long table, which stands across the window, so that he can cheer himself with the view of the park at his elbow. At {{the opposite end of the}} table, adjoining it, is a little table; only half the width of the other, with a typewriter on it. His typist is sitting at this machine, with her back to the window. The large table is littered with pamphlets, journals, letters, nests of drawers, an office diary, postage scales and the like. A spare chair for visitors having business with the parson is in the middle, turned to his end. Within reach of his hand is a stationery case, and a cabinet photograph in a frame. Behind him the right hand wall, recessed above the fireplace, is fitted with bookshelves, on which an adept eye can measure the parson's divinity and casuistry by a complete set of Browning's poems and Maurice's Theological Essays, and guess at his politics from a yellow backed Progress and Poverty, Fabian Essays, a Dream of John Ball, Marx's Capital, and half a dozen other literary landmarks in Socialism. Opposite him on the left, near the typewriter, is the door. Further down the room, opposite the fireplace, a bookcase stands on a <b>cellaret,</b> with a sofa near it. There is a generous fire burning; and the hearth, with a comfortable armchair and a japanned flower painted coal scuttle at one side, a miniature chair for a boy or girl on the other, a nicely varnished wooden mantelpiece, with neatly moulded shelves, tiny bits of mirror let into the panels, and a travelling clock in a leather case (the inevitable wedding present), and on the wall above a large autotype of the chief figure in Titian's Virgin of the Assumption, is very inviting. Altogether the room is the room of a good housekeeper, vanquished, as far as the table is concerned, by an untidy man, but elsewhere mistress of the situation. The furniture, in its ornamental aspect, betrays the style of the advertised [...] "drawing-room suite" [...] of the pushing suburban furniture dealer; but there is nothing useless or pretentious in the room. The paper and panelling are dark, throwing the big cheery window and the park outside into strong relief.|$|E
