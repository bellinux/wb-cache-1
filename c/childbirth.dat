5|$|In North India, Shashthi is worshipped at <b>childbirth</b> and puberty, {{and during}} {{marriage}} rites. When the pregnant woman is isolated during <b>childbirth</b> in the lying-in chamber, a cow-dung {{figure of the}} goddess is traditionally kept in the room. The birth of a living child is considered the blessing of Shashthi, while {{the birth of a}} stillborn infant or the early death of a child are considered manifestations of her wrath. Before <b>childbirth,</b> Shashthi is worshipped to protect the welfare of the expecting mother. She is also invoked after <b>childbirth</b> on the sixth day of each month until the child reaches puberty, especially when the child is sick.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} opened further for <b>childbirth</b> (defibulation or deinfibulation), and closed again {{afterwards}} (reinfibulation). Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again {{to restore the}} pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after <b>childbirth,</b> divorce and widowhood.|$|E

40|$|The {{pregnant}} women are particularly prone to periodontal disease {{and in front}} of the evidences that point out to this last one as a possible factor of risk for premature births. This study was realized to determine the prevalence and severity of the periodontal disease prioritarily in post-partum women with premature <b>childbirths</b> and <b>childbirths</b> to term of the Hospital “Daniel A. Carrión”, Callao during the months of October and November 2003. The sample was constituted for 20 post-partum women with premature <b>childbirths</b> that fulfilled the selection approaches and 90 post-partum women with <b>childbirths</b> to term selected at random. Löe and Silness’s Index Gingival(IG) was used to determine gingivitis and the approaches of the Ramfjord’s Index of Periodontal Disease for periodontitis; while Greene and Vermillion’s Simplified Index of Oral Hygiene (IHO-S) was used for the grade of buccal hygiene. The results showed that 100 % the post-partum women of both study groups presented some form of periodontal disease. However, the prevalence of more severe periodontal disease (periodontitis) was significantly bigger in the post-partum women with premature <b>childbirths</b> (25 %) that in the group with <b>childbirths</b> to term(6. 66 %). Likewise, it was observed that the grade of moderate Gingivitis was the most predominant; 50 % in the group with premature <b>childbirths</b> and 57. 67 % in the group with <b>childbirths</b> to term, differentiates that was not statistically significant. (P> 0. 05) The light Periodontitis was the most predominant in both groups: 15 % in the post-partum women with premature <b>childbirths</b> and 4. 44 % in the group with <b>childbirths</b> to term, being this difference statistically significant (P 0. 05). La Periodontitis leve fue el más prevalente en ambos grupos, alcanzando un 15 % en las puérperas con partos prematuros frente a un 4. 44 % en las puérperas con partos a término, siendo esta diferencia estadísticamente significativa(P< 0. 05). En el caso del Grado de Higiene Bucal la mayor frecuencia estuvo en la condición Regular; 65 % en las puérperas con partos prematuros frente a un 71. 11 % en las puérperas con partos a término; lo cual no fue estadísticamente significativo. Por otro lado, se encontró una correlación positiva entre el IHO-S con los valores medios del IG, profundidad al sondaje y nivel de adherencia clínica entre ambos grupos de estudio...|$|R
40|$|Few {{prospective}} {{studies have}} examined associations between reproductive factors and risk of renal cell cancer (RCC). The authors prospectively examined whether postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use, oral contraceptive use, parity, and other reproductive factors were associated with RCC risk among 118, 219 US women in the Nurses’ Health Study. A total of 247 RCC cases were confirmed between 1976 and 2004. Multivariate relative risks, adjusted for known risk factors, were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Compared with 1 or 2 <b>childbirths,</b> the multivariate relative risks were 1. 75 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 21, 2. 53) for 4 <b>childbirths</b> and 1. 50 (95 % CI: 1. 00, 2. 23) for ≥ 5 <b>childbirths</b> (Ptrend = 0. 02). Comparing an age at first birth of ≥ 28 years with an age at first birth of ≤ 22 years, the multivariate relative risk was 0. 66 (95 % CI: 0. 43, 1. 01; Ptrend = 0. 01). Compared with 1 – 3 <b>childbirths</b> and an age at first birth of ≥ 26 years, the multivariate relative risk was 2. 17 (95 % CI: 1. 49, 3. 14) for ≥ 4 <b>childbirths</b> and an age at first birth of < 26 years. No clear associations were observed for PMH use or duration, time since last PMH use, oral contraceptive use or duration, age at menarche, age at menopause, or history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy...|$|R

5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after <b>childbirth</b> to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after <b>childbirth</b> to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to <b>childbirth,</b> such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E
5|$|In Orissa, {{the goddess}} is worshipped in the lying-in {{room on the}} sixth day after <b>childbirth,</b> on the 21st day after <b>childbirth</b> and on every {{subsequent}} birthday of the child until he or she reaches the age of sixteen. Shashthi is also prescribed to be worshipped the sixth day {{of each of the}} two lunar fortnights occurring each month; as part of the vrata rites, the worship occurring on the bright fortnight of the month of Bhadrapada is {{the most important of these}} and holds the same status in Orissa as the Aranva-Shashthi ritual in Bengal. By these rites, it is believed a childless woman may gain offspring, while a mother may secure the longevity and welfare of her child by the grace of the goddess.|$|E

5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent {{in the event of}} Mary's death in <b>childbirth.</b> In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in <b>childbirth,</b> but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal <b>childbirth,</b> the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during <b>childbirth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was {{responsible}} for the three-and-a-half minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the <b>childbirth.</b> Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child {{with the exception of the}} <b>childbirth</b> scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's computer-generated baby.|$|E
5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy.
