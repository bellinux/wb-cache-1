5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> hairline.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies O. g. gloveri has a {{dark gray}} <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> smoky yellow rostrum. O. g. brookei has an orange russet tipped nose, and light gray spotted above the eyes. The Glover's pika {{is similar to}} the Chinese red pika, but it is distinguished by its smaller auditory bullae, more slender rostrum, and longer nasals than the Chinese red pika. It also does not have the reddish mantle as possessed by the Chinese red pika.|$|E

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E
2500|$|For the red <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> lips, dyes were {{sometimes}} used. Cochineal, madder and vermilion {{were used as}} dyes to achieve the bright red effects on the face.

5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site {{and it is likely}} that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.|$|E

25|$|They occur {{from the}} western Atlantic through the Old World into Australia, usually but not always in marine and {{temperate}} to subtropical habitat.

25|$|Since it is {{only known}} from a single locality, <b>Cheek</b> <b>and</b> Jebb informally {{assessed}} the conservation status of N.abgracilis as Critically Endangered based on the IUCN criteria. The authors noted that while there is mining activity for metal ore on Mount Legaspi, this is currently at lower elevations than the 670m at which the species was collected.|$|E
25|$|The {{unidentified}} {{species from}} Mount Lumarku was formally described as N. hurrelliana in 2003 by Martin <b>Cheek</b> <b>and</b> Anthony Lamb. Its natural range {{is now known}} to cover northern Sarawak, Brunei, and southwestern Sabah, although {{it has not been}} recorded from Kalimantan. If N. mollis and N. hurrelliana were shown to be conspecific, the latter would become a heterotypic synonym of the former.|$|E
25|$|Dipping tobacco, {{commonly}} referred to as snuff, is also put in the mouth, but it is a flavored powder. it is placed between the <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> gum. Dipping tobacco doesn't need to be chewed for the nicotine to be absorbed into your body. First-time users of these products often become nauseated and dizzy. Long-term effects include bad breath, yellowed teeth, and an increased risk of oral cancer.|$|E

25|$|In rabbinical {{interpretation}} {{a continuing}} {{application of the}} commandment is identified. Rabbi Yosef Karo Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 61:1, rules that after the slaughter of animal by a shochet (kosher butcher), the cuts of the foreleg, <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> maw {{should be given to}} a kohen freely, without the kohen paying or performing any service. This giving is required to be free of both monetary and servicial compensation (B.Bechorot 27a).|$|E
