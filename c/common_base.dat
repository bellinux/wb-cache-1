5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a <b>common</b> <b>base,</b> and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect.

Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} for finding all <b>common</b> <b>bases</b> in two matroids. Our algorithm lists all <b>common</b> <b>bases</b> by using pivot operations {{in such a}} way that each basis appears exactly once. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n(n 2 + t) λ) where n is the size of the ground set of the matroids, λ is the number of <b>common</b> <b>bases,</b> and t is time to make one pivot operation. The space complexity is O(n 2) and thus does not depend on λ As applications, we show how our algorithm can be applied to efficient enumerations of all complementary bases in the linear complementarity problem and all perfect matchings in a bipartite graph...|$|R
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick <b>common</b> <b>base.</b> It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
