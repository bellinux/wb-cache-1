40|$|An Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) {{was found}} in ohmically heated plasma in TUMAN- 3 M (R 0 = 53 cm, al = 22 cm − {{circular}} limiter configuration, Bt ≤ 0. 7 T, Ip ≤ 175 kA, 6. 0 · 1019 m- 3). The barrier reveals itself as a formation of a steep gradient on electron temperature and density radial profiles. The regions with reduced diffusion and electron thermaldiffusivity are in between r = 0. 5 a and r = 0. 7 a. The ITB appears more frequently in the shots with higher plasma current. At lower currents (Ip < 120 kA) the ITB is rare. In the ohmic H-mode with ITB the thermal energy confinement is {{in the range of}} 9 - 18 ms. The enhancement factor over ITER 93 -H(ELM-free) scaling is up to 2. The results of experimental study of βN limit in the ohmically heated plasma are presented. Stored energy was measured using diamagnetic loops and compared with W calculated from kinetic data obtained by Thomson scattering and microwave interferometry. Measurements of the stored energy and of the β were performed in the ohmic H-mode before and after boronization and in the scenario with the fast <b>Current</b> <b>Ramp-Down</b> in the ohmic H-mode.

They have characteristics in-between coherent and broadband fluctuations as they oscillate at a marked frequency but have a wide spectrum. This work presents further evidences of the link recently established between QC modes and the trapped electron modes (TEM) instabilities (Arnichand et al 2014 Nucl. Fusion 54 123017).

The {{poloidal magnetic field}} profile in the peripheral region of a plasma (0. 5 leq rho leq 1. 0) has been measured directly with a newly developed fast response Zeeman polarimeter. The experimental results indicate that an obvious skin effect of toroidal current density is clearly observed during both the <b>current</b> ramp-up and <b>ramp-down</b> experiments. The experimentally obtained toroidal current density profiles are well described by the profiles calculated on the assumption of the neoclassical electrical conductivity. Quasi-linear Delta 2 ̆ 7 -analysis of tearing modes for the measured current density profile is consistent with time behaviour of coherent MHD modes such as m= 4 /n= 1 or m= 3 /n= 1 (m: poloidal mode number, n: toroidal mode number) often observed during the current ramp-up phase.

40|$|ITER plasma {{scenario}} {{studies have}} shown that the optimisation of the flux consumption from the poloidal field coils requires control of the plasma inductance, used here li = li (3) [1]. This control was achieved in ITER demonstration discharges (at DIII-D, C-Mod, AUG and JET-C) using a combination of full bore start up with early X-point formation and current ramp-up in H-mode. H-mode during current decay down has been shown also instrumental to maintain low inductance in order to minimise flux consumption. Moreover variation of plasma inductance in ohmic discharges can be controlled, independently of the plasma <b>current</b> <b>ramp-down</b> rate, by varying the plasma elongation, as reported in [2]. An all-metal ITER-like wall (ILW), consisting of beryllium in the main chamber and tungsten surfaces in the divertor, has now been installed in JET. Its implementation has offered the opportunity to assess if the flux consumption and plasma inductance evolution is modified by Be-wall and W-divertor during the current rise and current decay (e. g. current profile evolution, plasma controllability issues as W accumulation in the transient phase, L-H transition, etc.). Details of the experimental results obtained in 2012 with the ILW and comparison with carbon-fibre reinforced carbon (CFC) wall (JET-C) will be given here.

40|$|In {{order to}} prepare {{adequate}} current ramp-up and ramp-down scenarios for ITER, present experiments from various tokamaks have been analysed {{by means of}} integrated modelling in view of determining relevant heat transport models for these operation phases. A set of empirical heat transport models for L-mode (namely, the Bohm-gyroBohm model and scaling based models with a specific fixed radial shape and energy confinement time factors of H(96 -L) = 0. 6 or H(IPB 98) = 0. 4) has been validated on a multi-machine experimental dataset for predicting the l(i) dynamics within +/- 0. 15 accuracy during current ramp-up and ramp-down phases. Simulations using the Coppi-Tang or GLF 23 models (applied up to the LCFS) overestimate or underestimate the internal inductance beyond this accuracy (more than +/- 0. 2 discrepancy in some cases). The most accurate heat transport models are then applied to projections to ITER current ramp-up, focusing on the baseline inductive scenario (main heating plateau current of I(p) = 15 MA). These projections include a sensitivity study to various assumptions of the simulation. While the heat transport model {{is at the heart}} of such simulations (because of the intrinsic dependence of the plasma resistivity on electron temperature, among other parameters), more comprehensive simulations are required to test all operational aspects of the current ramp-up and ramp-down phases of ITER scenarios. Recent examples of such simulations, involving coupled core transport codes, free-boundary equilibrium solvers and a poloidal field (PF) systems controller are also described, focusing on ITER <b>current</b> <b>ramp-down...</b>|$|E

First measurements of the confined alpha particles have been performed and found to be in good agreement with TRANSP simulations assuming classical confinement. Measurements of the alpha ash profile have been compared with simulations using particle transport coefficients from helium gas puffing experiments. The loss of energetic alpha particles to a detector {{at the bottom of the}} vessel is well described by the first-orbit loss mechanism. No loss due to alpha-particle-driven instabilities has yet been observed. ICRF heating of a D-T plasma, using the second harmonic of tritium, has been demonstrated.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the progress in {{analysis of the}} ITER plasma vertical stabilisation (VS) system since its design review in 2007 – 2008. Two indices characterising plasma VS were studied. These are (1) the maximum value of plasma vertical displacement due to free drift that can be stopped by the VS system and (2) the maximum {{root mean square value}} of low frequency noise in the dZ/dt measurement signal used in the VS feedback loop. The first VS index was calculated using the PET code for 15 MA plasmas with the nominal position and shape. The second VS index was studied with the DINA code in the most demanding simulations for plasma magnetic control of 15 MA scenarios with the fastest plasma current ramp-up and early X-point formation, the fastest plasma <b>current</b> <b>ramp-down</b> in a divertor configuration, and an H to L mode transition at the current flattop. The studies performed demonstrate that the VS in-vessel coils, adopted recently in the baseline design, significantly increase the range of plasma controllability in comparison with the stabilising systems VS 1 and VS 2, providing operating margins sufficient to achieve ITER's goals specified in the project requirements. Additionally two sets of the DINA code simulations were performed with the goal of assessment of the capability of the PF system with the VS in-vessel coils: (i) to control the position of runaway electrons generated during disruptions in 15 MA scenarios and (ii) to trigger ELMs in H-mode plasmas of 7. 5 MA/ 2. 65 T scenarios planned for the early phase of ITER operation. It was also shown that ferromagnetic structures of the vacuum vessel (ferromagnetic inserts) and test blanket modules insignificantly affect the plasma VS...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} {{the role of}} the proximity effect in the thermal hysteresis of superconducting constrictions. From the analysis of successive thermal instabilities in the transport characteristics of micron-size superconducting quantum interference devices with a well-controlled geometry, we obtain a complete picture of the different thermal regimes. These determine whether or not the junctions are hysteretic. Below the superconductor critical temperature, the critical current switches from a classical weak-link behavior to one driven by the proximity effect. The associated small amplitude of the critical current makes it robust with respect to the heat generation by phase slips, leading to a nonhysteretic behavior. Micron-size superconducting quantum interference devices (μ-SQUID), based on superconducting (SC) weak links (WLs), have been of interest for probing magnetism at small scales [1 – 8]. A major obstacle of a μ-SQUID proper operation is its hysteretic current-voltage characteristic (IVC). During current ramp-up, the WL switches to a dissipative state at the critical current I c, and during <b>current</b> <b>ramp-down,</b> it comes back to a zero-voltage state at the retrapping current I r < I c. In conventional tunnel-barrier-type Josephson junctions, the hysteresis arises from large junction capacitance [9]. In WLs with negligible capaci-tance, hysteresis is found at low temperatures below a crossover temperature T h < T c [10], with T c as the SC critical temperature. Although an effective capacitance can arise from the recovery time of the SC order parameter [11], it is now understood that hysteresis in WLs is of thermal origin [12 – 14], similar to that observed in SNS WLs [15]. A recent report on high-T c-SC based μ-SQUID shows nonhysteretic IVCs over a wide temperature range [16]. Thermal hysteresis in WLs and its effect on IVCs has been modeled by local thermal balance dictating the position of a normal metal-superconductor (N-S) interface [12 – 14]. In the case of poor heat evacuation, phase fluctuations can trigger a thermal runaway giving a resistive hot spot. This topic is of great practical importance, in particular, for SC-magnet wires and cables, helium level sensors, bolometers [17], μ-SQUIDs, and other nanoscale SC structures [18]. A systematic understanding of various thermal phases which a WL device exhibits can help in designing nonhysteretic devices. In this Letter, we report on the transport characteristics of Nb-film based μ-SQUIDs with a well-controlled geometry and describe a complete picture of different thermal regimes. The IVCs show a critical current and two retrapping currents that we describe using a thermal instability model in SC leads. The critical current I c follows the theoretical expectation at low temperatures but changes its behavior while crossing the smaller retrapping current. In this hysteresis-free regime, the WLs super-conduct, despite being slightly heated by individual phase slips, thanks to the proximity effect of the adjacent SC. We fabricated [19] μ-SQUIDs from Nb films using common techniques [2, 20, 21]. The transport measurements were carried out down to 4. 2 K in a homemade cryostat with built-in copper-powder filters [10]. We have studied six devices with similar behavior, but here we report on two devices, μS 1 and μS 2. For all devices, the patterned SQUID-loop area is 1 μm 2 and the width of its arms is 0. 3 μm. The designed WL length is 150 nm, while the WL width is 70 and 50 nm in μS 1 and μS 2, respectively. Figure 1 (a) shows the SEM image of μS 1. Four different parts of the pattern contribute to the electrical characteristics, namely, (1) the two WLs, each of normal resistance R WL, (2) the SQUID loop with normal resistance as R L, including the WLs, (3) the narrow leads of width 0. 3 μm and length 1. 7 μm {{on either side of the}} SQUID loop, each with a resistance R 1, and (4) the wide leads of width 2 μm, length 27. 5 μm, and normal resistance R 2. From the geometry, the total normal-state resistance between the voltage leads is R N ¼ R L þ 2 R 1 þ 2 R 2 ¼ 40. 3 R □ þ 0. 5 R WL. Here, R □ is the film's square resistance. Figures 1 (b) and 1 (c) show the resistance R versus temperature for μS 1. Multiple SC transitions are observed. The resistance jumps from its residual value of 128 Ω down to about 40 Ω at T c 2 ¼ 8. 7 K, jumps further down from 38 to 8 Ω at T c 1 ¼ 8. 35 K, and finally decreases smoothly to zero. We attribute the transition at T c 2 to the wide leads and that at T c 1 to both the narrow leads and the SQUID loop...|$|E
