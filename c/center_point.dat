5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the <b>center</b> <b>point,</b> as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the <b>center</b> <b>point,</b> but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} design was performed using the software MODDE 9.0 (Umetrics) with central composite on face (CCF) designs with three <b>center</b> <b>points</b> for response surface methodology (RSM) experiments {{in which the}} model type is quadratic. The inclusion of <b>center</b> <b>points</b> is usually recommended in DOE since <b>center</b> <b>points</b> give important information on the inherent variability of the experiments, hence allows the estimation of the experimental error of the model. Standard CCF designs use the fractional factorial or full factorial design for a subset of factors in the experiment. RSM was applied to optimize the conditions of MIP nanoparticles preparation using automatic photoreactor with the purpose to maximize the yield of MIP nanoparticles.|$|R

Through computing the minimum distance between the point and any other point with higher density, the candidate points are chosen out. Then, combined with the average density, the outliers are screened out. Ultimately the initial centers for K-means algorithm are screened out. Experimental results show that the algorithm gets the initial <b>center</b> <b>points</b> with high accuracy, and can effectively filter abnormal points. The running time and the iterations of the K-means algorithm are decreased obviously...|$|R
5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a <b>center</b> <b>point,</b> the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that the road was barricaded in Copake Falls for {{the fact that there was}} no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E

5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single <b>center</b> <b>point</b> at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth.

Five Instance-Based Reduction Techniques {{were used to determine}} the set of <b>center</b> <b>points,</b> and RBF networks were trained using these sets of centers. The performance of the RBF networks is studied in terms of classification accuracy and training time. The results obtained were compared with two Radial Basis Function Networks: RBF networks that use all instances of the training set as <b>center</b> <b>points</b> (RBF-ALL) and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN). The former achieves high classification accuracies and the latter requires smaller training time. Results showed that RBF networks trained using sets of centers located by noise-filtering techniques (ALLKNN and ENN) rather than pure reduction techniques produce the best results in terms of classification accuracy. The results show that these networks require smaller training time than that of RBF-ALL and higher classification accuracy than that of PNN. Thus, using ALLKNN and ENN to select <b>center</b> <b>points</b> gives better combination of classification accuracy and training time. Our experiments also show that using the reduced sets to train the networks is beneficial especially in the presence of noise in the original training sets.
