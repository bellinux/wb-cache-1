5|$|The Culinary Institute of America (<b>CIA)</b> <b>is</b> an American private {{college and}} culinary school specializing in culinary, baking, and pastry arts education. The school's primary campus {{is located in}} Hyde Park, New York, with branch campuses in St. Helena and Napa, California, San Antonio, Texas, and the Republic of Singapore. The college, {{which was the first}} to teach culinary arts in the United States, offers {{associate}} and bachelor's degrees, and has the largest staff of American Culinary Federation Certified Master Chefs. The CIA also offers continuing education for professionals in the hospitality industry as well as conferences and consulting services. In addition to professional education, the college also offers recreational classes for non-professionals. The college operates student-run restaurants on their four U.S. campuses. The school colors (green and gold) refer to the school's mission to sustain the environment and to strive for excellence.|$|E
5|$|The Apple Pie Bakery Café {{opened in}} 2000, and the Colavita Center opened the {{following}} year. More residence halls were {{built at the}} school's Hyde Park campus in 2004. In 2005, Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena. The school's third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio. Two years later, the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility {{on the campus of}} Temasek Polytechnic. In 2012, the CIA began offering a bachelor's degree program in culinary science, and in 2014 introduced a bachelor's degree in applied food studies. Also, in 2012 the college was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame. In 2015, the college expanded its recreation center and added a new dining facility for students, called The Egg; both are housed in the CIA's Student Commons building. In the same year, the college acquired a portion of Copia, a museum in downtown Napa, California that operated from 2001 to 2008. In 2016, the college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The college, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, purchased the northern portion of the Copia property for $12.5 million. In September 2018, the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> launching a Bachelor of Science degree program in Hospitality Management.|$|E
5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the <b>CIA</b> <b>was</b> {{attempting}} {{to assist the}} Tibetan rebels enhancing their ability to move troops and materials. The <b>CIA</b> <b>was</b> conducting studies on how the Tibetan resistance movement could best counter the Chinese Communists. Therefore, the <b>CIA</b> <b>was</b> working {{with the leaders of}} the movement in order to garner more support for the resistance as well as manage the logistics of the movement of these troops. The <b>CIA</b> <b>was</b> examining the difficulty in moving the additional troops necessary to counter the Chinese. This meant that the <b>CIA</b> <b>was</b> giving recommendations for the capacity and ability of roadways to support the troop movements. Without this logistical support, the Tibetans could not sufficiently counter the Chinese Communists. However, a declassified CIA document from July 1958 outlined the agency’s assessment of the possibility that Communists would infiltrate Tibetan society, and completely assimilate all aspects of Tibetan life into the culture of Communist China.|$|R

25|$|The Central Intelligence Agency (<b>CIA)</b> <b>is</b> a {{civilian}} foreign intelligence {{service of the}} United States federal government, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily {{through the use of}} human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA Director {{concurrently}} {{served as}} the head of the Intelligence Community; today, the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> organized under the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI, the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks. In 2013, The Washington Post reported that in fiscal year 2010, the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies, exceeding previous estimates.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 CommSec diversified {{into the}} short term deposit sector with the {{introduction}} of its Cash Management product. The product consists of two distinct accounts the CommSec Cash Account (CCA) and the CommSec Investment Account (CIA). The CCA is designed to both be the source of funds for stock trading and also an everyday transaction account, with a linked debit MasterCard. The <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> designed as a high interest cash deposit distinguished by its lack of tiers and that cash can only be transferred to and from the CCA.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), {{which is}} a {{domestic}} security service, the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. Though {{it is not the}} only U.S. government agency specializing in HUMINT, the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the US intelligence community. Moreover, the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President. It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Division.|$|E
25|$|These {{units have}} a role to play outside the country, as much of the FARC's arms {{smuggling}} work is handled by them. Allegedly, the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> aware about the work of the FARC's military intelligence units and also that of its diplomatic corps, and thus has used its intelligence networks throughout Latin America and the United States to attempt to capture operatives that travel outside Colombia. According to the FARC, the capture of Rodrigo Granda in Venezuela in late and the capture of other operatives, such as Simon Trinidad, in Ecuador would allegedly include CIA participation.|$|E

Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), a CIA Station chief involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels' office in Madrid but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy.

Her boyfriend, arachnologist Mike Krause (August Diehl), generates so much publicity about Salt's imprisonment that the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> forced to arrange a prisoner exchange, despite the agency's policy against it. [...] Salt's CIA colleague Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) greets Salt at the border.

500|$|Two years later, on Salt and Mike's wedding anniversary, a Russian {{defector}} named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) {{walks into}} Salt's office.

500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the town of Jupiter, Florida, which is where Reynolds spent most of his childhood. Sterling proclaims that his career path was largely influenced by Reynolds' film career, particularly his work in the musical film At Long Last Love (1975) and the spy cinema Operation C.I.A. (1965). Reed stated, [...] "Archer says [...] Operation <b>C.I.A.</b> <b>is</b> why [...] became a spy. And [...] like, 'Really, I thought that movie sucked.'" [...] A sequence which features Sterling strapping Reynolds onto a handtruck reflects homage to the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The song [...] "East Bound and Down" [...] by Jerry Reed is presented in the episode, while Sterling makes several references to several American cinematic works from the 1970s. Jesse Carp of Cinema Blend wrote: [...] "I should start by saying that this episode played particularly well for me because I’m a huge fan of 1970s American cinema—the good and the bad—so all of those references that Archer soon starts throwing at Reynolds, I'm catching and loving every second of it." [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] contains several scenes that are reminiscent to those in the action film Gator (1976). Carp wrote that [...] "it isn't long before the Reynolds' sweet talking and charisma mesmerizes Archer and soon the pair are talking plot possibilities for the last film in the Gator trilogy." ...|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the <b>CIA</b> <b>is</b> the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
