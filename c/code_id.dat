The proposed digital signature algorithm {{is based on}} solving quadratic congruence, factorization, and discrete logarithm problems.

The designed authority generates the group member’s identity <b>code</b> (<b>ID),</b> the group identity mark, and the group secret key. Every group member keeps his/her private key and the ID for signing. These parameters can ensure only members who can make signatures and provide data authenticity and non-repudiation for any signer. The challenge-response identification protocol with overlapping-shifting-EXOR logical operations is proposed to ensure the signer to obtain group secret key securely and prevent any signer from making false claims. According to the security analysis, the processing time of the proposed approach is faster than the existing RSA and ElGamal group digital signature systems. Moreover, the proposed method would be suited to microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, computer systems, networks and control systems because of its simplicity, confidentiality, and fast processing speed...|$|E

The proposed WLPS has unique signaling schemes that discriminate it from the traditional wireless systems and allows the WLPS to have many civilian and military applications. The WLPS consists of two main parts: (1) the detecting unit, a base station carried by a mobile unit defined as Dynamic Base Station (DBS), and (2) the being detected unit, a transponder (TRX) that is mounted on the targets, each assigned a unique identification <b>code</b> (<b>ID</b> code). Each DBS should be capable of detecting and locating all available TRXs in its coverage area. As a result, the main complexity of this system is focused at the DBS receiver. In this work, we introduce WLPS structure, and both theoretically and numerically compute, and compare the Probability-of-Detection performance of the DBS receiver realized by a merger of DS-CDMA and antenna arrays. We also analyze and simulate the performance of this system under perturbations in the DBS antenna array vector.

40|$|Objectives: The {{demanding}} and intense environment of medical training can create excessive pressures on medical students that {{eventually lead to}} unfavorable consequences, either at a personal or professional level. These consequences can include poor academic performance and impaired cognitive ability. This {{study was designed to}} explore associations between pass-fail outcome and psychological health parameters (i. e. stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a cohort of first-year medical students in a Malaysian medical school. The depression anxiety stress scale 21 -item assessment (DASS- 21) was administered to them right after the final paper of the first-year final examination. Their final examination outcomes (i. e. pass or fail) were traced by using their student identity <b>code</b> (<b>ID)</b> through the Universiti Sains Malaysia academic office. Results: A total of 194 (98. 0 %) of medical students responded to the DASS- 21. An independent t-test showed that students who passed had significantly lower stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms than those who failed the first-year final examination (P < 0. 05). Those who experienced moderate to high stress were at 2. 43 times higher risk for failing the examination than those who experienced normal to mild stress. Conclusion: Medical students whofailed in the final examination had higher psychological distress than those who passed the examination. Those who experienced high stress levels were more likely to fail than those who did not.

30|$|Inspection of Fig. 1 {{reveals that}} {{the core of the}} catalog {{structure}} is the main info table, that maintains a unique hierarchical relation with tables containing information on the landslides, their consequences and the sources of information, i.e. links to online articles. The tables are connected through the identification <b>code</b> (<b>ID),</b> which is unique for each record and whose format is designed to highlight the landslide event category and the initial date of the event. The name of the landslide event is not a compulsory entry and, when possible, it quotes the terms most commonly used to refer to the event. The landslide categories, as already mentioned, are based on landslide numerosity and on the consequences to human life of the landslide event. Both SLEs and ALEs are divided in three consequence classes. Further compulsory information for each record are the geographical coordinates of the landslide event and the source (s) of data. When the GA service is used, the references are the web addresses of the online news articles. When the CP press review is used, the references include the day (the press review is published each working day), the type (5 daily reviews are published in relation to the geographical location of the source: national, northern Italy, central Italy, southern Italy, main islands) and the pages of the PDF documents reporting the information.

40|$|High {{data rates}} and {{interoperability}} of vender devices have made WiMAX a prime desire for use worldwide. WiMAX {{is based on}} the IEEE 802. 16 standard. IEEE 802. 16 a, b, c & d versions were updated within three years of the first launch of WiMAX. However, during those early years reports were published that highlighted the security weaknesses of the standard. These weaknesses prompted the IEEE to issue a new version, 802. 16 e to tackle the security issues. Despite this security enhancement, WiMAX remains vulnerable. This research project looks at the vulnerability of WiMAX 802. 16 e Subscriber Station/Mobile Station authentication at the initial entry and proposes approaches to the prevention of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks at this point in order to secure the Media Access Control (MAC) layer from such threats.

A simulation package was also required, to prove that a linear load of DoS attack would disable or exhaust the capacity of the base station of a WiMAX network, as well as providing other simulation functions. The freely available simulation tool NIST (NIST IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) and IKE (Internet Key Exchange) Simulation) is oriented towards fixed network communications (NIIST, 2003).

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a {{powerful}} emerging technology widely used for asset tracking, supply chain management, animal identification, military applications, payment systems, and access control. Over the years, RFID {{has emerged as a}} popular technology in various industries because of its ability to track moving objects. As RFID is becoming less expensive and more robust, many companies and vendors are developing tags to track objects. Multiple vendors manufacture RFID tags worldwide. Therefore, {{it is quite possible that}} they manufacture tags with the same identification <b>code</b> (<b>ID)</b> as vendor ID code data sets may not be synchronized or may be subject to tag id errors. Due to this drawback, there is the possibility that non-unique tags exist along with unique tags in the same RFID system. As existing implementations optimize the performance of RFID systems performance based on the assumption of unique tags, it is important to study the effect of non-unique tags on RFID systems. This thesis focuses on a formal analysis of the Basic Frame Slotted ALOHA (BFSA) Muting RFID system with non-unique tags. An RFID network was modeled with OPNET Modeler 14. 5. An evaluation model was built to measure the total census delay, optimal frame size, and network throughput for an RFID network based on a BFSA protocol for non-unique tags and support for muting. The evaluation results are in agreement with results obtained from the evaluation of a similar model for unique tags [Kang 08]. Comparing total census delay for unique and non-unique tags for variable frame sizes showed an increase in total census delay with an increase in the number of tags. Comparing minimum network throughput, mean network throughput, and maximum network throughput for unique and non-unique tags for variable frame sizes showed a decrease in network throughput with an increase in the number of tags...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the automation and optimization in control points measurement and elaboration of sketches in Close Range Photogrammetry. The {{system can be}} controlled by an operator alone and it integrates a robotized and reflectorless total station, two digital cameras, a laptop computer and the control software. The measured data with the station are registered and the control point will get associated to their marks in the images. So, {{it is possible to}} eliminate the handmade sketches since the marking of control points in the image is instantaneously made. The sketch includes object images with enlargements so the point is clearly identified and marked with the support of a virtual reticle. Also the sketch includes object coordinates, image coordinates, identification <b>code</b> (<b>ID)</b> and some additional information about the point. The use of the system by only one operator allows the reduction of costs, organization and time in control point surveying. Different tests have been made in order to check the system. TDC: this test has been made in close range conditions with targets and artificial illumination. EDIF: in this case the test includes long range conditions and control points targeted at natural points in building façade. The tests have allowed several analyses to study the feasibility and the improvement of the system. So we have made in situ tests by comparing direct observations with and without the camera telescope, with targets and natural points, close and long distances and different conditions of illumination. Moreover in one of these tests we include the observation and sketch realization with a manual method. With respect {{to the use of the}} aiming eyepiece camera, the tests (TDC) realized in laboratory (close distance - 4 m- and good light conditions) show very small spatial differences (below the nominal precision of the total station) comparing the direct aim through the telescope without camera. Other test (EDIF) made over longer distance (130 m) and natural targets show differences of few centimeters. Hence, the appending of the eyepiece camera does not involve an excessive aiming error. On the other hand, the improvement of the system is relevant in the observation, measurement and registration of control points. Hence, the decrease of tasks involved and the use the system by an operator reduce the total time employed in two thirds. Although the aim is not completely accurate, the approximation is enough so the final aim is quickly achieved and the lost of time is negligible. After these tests, this system has shown to be an affordable and fully operational method that optimize and reduce the cost and time of control point measurements...|$|E
