5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, {{and the existence}} of an older <b>church</b> <b>on</b> the same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and the body of the church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would be no need for a <b>church</b> <b>on</b> the site any earlier.|$|E
