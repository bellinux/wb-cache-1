40|$|Boost d. <b>c.</b> -d. <b>c.</b> <b>converters</b> {{have very}} good source {{interface}} properties. The input inductor makes the source current smooth and hence these converters provide very good EMI performance. On account of this good property, the boost converter is also the preferred converter for off-line UPF rectifiers. One of the issues of concern in these converters is the large size of the storage capacitor on the dc link. The boost converter suffers from the disadvantage of discontinuous current injected to the load. The size of the capacitor is large. Further, the ripple current in the capacitor is {{as much as the}} load current; hence the ESR specification of the tank capacitor is demanding. This paper presents the polyphase boost converter, which overcomes the problem of high ripple current in the tank capacitor, which has not been discussed earlier. Comparison between the specifications of single stage and multistage is thoroughly examined. Digital control is more convenient for such a topology on account of the requirement of synchronization, phase shifted operation and current balancing. The control method is simpler and faster than its original form [10]. It does not depend on the previous duty ratio and it has been tested on four boost converters in parallel. Each is a 35 W unit switched at 200 kHz. Experimental results in digital control, synchronization operation and current sharing are presented.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in distributed object technology has enabled software applications {{to be developed}} and deployed easily such that objects or components can work together across {{the boundaries of the}} network, different operating systems, and different languages. A distributed object is not necessarily a complete application but rather a reusable, self-contained piece of software that co-operates with other objects in a plug-and-play fashion via a well-defined interface. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), a middleware standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG), uses the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to specify such an interface for transparent communication between distributed objects. Since IDL can be mapped to any programming language, such as C++, Java, Smalltalk, etc., existing applications can be integrated into a new application and hence the tasks of code re-writing and software maintenance can be reduced. Many scientific applications in aerodynamics and solid mechanics are written in Fortran. Refitting these legacy Fortran codes with CORBA objects can increase the codes reusability. For example, scientists could link their scientific applications to vintage Fortran programs such as Partial Differential Equation(PDE) solvers in a plug-and-play fashion. Unfortunately, CORBA IDL to Fortran mapping has not been proposed {{and there seems to be}} no direct method of generating CORBA objects from Fortran without having to resort to manually writing C/C++ wrappers. In this paper, we present an efficient methodology to integrate Fortran legacy programs into a distributed object framework. Issues and strategies regarding the conversion and decomposition of Fortran codes into CORBA objects are discussed. The following diagram shows the conversion and decomposition mechanism we proposed. Our goal is to keep the Fortran codes unmodified. The conversion- aided tool takes the Fortran application program as input and helps programmers generate C/C++ header file and IDL file for wrapping the Fortran code. Programmers need to determine by themselves how to decompose the legacy application into several reusable components based on the cohesion and coupling factors among the functions and subroutines. However, programming effort still can be greatly reduced because function headings and types have been converted to C++ and IDL styles. Most Fortran applications use the COMMON block to facilitate the transfer of large amount of variables among several functions. The COMMON block plays the similar role of global variables used in C. In the CORBA-compliant programming environment, global variables can not be used to pass values between objects. One approach to dealing with this problem is to put the COMMON variables into the parameter list. We do not adopt this approach because it requires modification of the Fortran source code which violates our design consideration. Our approach is to extract the COMMON blocks and convert them into a structure-typed attribute in C++. Through attributes, each component can initialize the variables and return the computation result back to the client. We have tested successfully the proposed conversion methodology based on the f 2 <b>c</b> <b>converter.</b> Since f 2 c only translates Fortran to C, we still needed to edit the converted code to meet the C++ and IDL syntax. For example, C++/IDL requires a tag in the structure type, while C does not.

It presented a detailed design of an integrated system consisting of a radioisotope heat source, a thermophotovoltaic converter, and an optimized heat rejection system. The present paper describes the thermal, electrical, and structural analyses which led to that optimized design, and compares the computed RTPV performance to that of a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) designed for the same mission. RTPV's are of course much less mature than RTGs, but our results indicate that - when fully developed - they could result in a 60 % reduction of the heat source's mass, cost, and fuel loading, a 50 % reduction of generator mass, a tripling of the power system's specific power, and a quadrupling of its efficiency. The paper concludes by briefly summarizing the RTPV's current technology status and assessing its potential applicability for the PFF mission. For other power systems (e. g. RTGs), demonstrating their flight readiness for a long mission is a very time-consuming process to determine the long-term effect of temperature-induced degradation mechanisms. But for the case of the described RTPV design, the paper lists a number of factors, primarily its cold (0 to 10 degrees <b>C)</b> <b>converter</b> temperature, that may greatly reduce the need for long-term tests to demonstrate generator lifetime. In any event, our analytical results suggest that the RTPV generator, when developed by DOE and/or NASA, would be quite valuable not only for the Pluto mission but also for other future missions requiring small, long-lived, low mass generators.

The expected radioactive beams intensities for exotic species in the mass range from A= 60 to A= 140, of the order of 10 ^ 6 to 10 ^ 10 pps will surpass by two order of magnitude any existing facilities in the world. These unstable atoms will be available at energies between few KeV/n to 15 MeV/n. The same driver will accelerate high intensity (100 μA to 1 mA), heavier ions up to Ar at 14 MeV/n producing also proton rich exotic nuclei. In applied areas SPIRAL 2 is considered as a powerful variable energy neutron source, a must to study the impact of nuclear fission and fusion on materials. The intensities of these unstable species are excellent opportunities for new tracers and diagnostics either for solid state, material or for radiobiological science and medicine. The "Go" decision has been taken in May 2005. The investments costs amount to 95 ME and personnel costs to 34 ME, for the construction period 2005 - 2010. Funding from EU 7 th framework and from others partnership countries are expected to contribute for about 20...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{useful and}} {{systematic}} dynamic {{model of a}} battery energy storage system (BES) is devel-oped for a large-scale power system stability study. The model takes into account converter equivalent circuits, battery characteristics and internal losses. Both charging mode and dis-charging mode are presented. The model is expressed in equivalent transfer function blocks, {{and it can be}} easily used in dynamic stability analysis of a power system. To examine the dynamic behaviour of the model, applications to the damping of turbogenerator torsional oscil-lations are performed. Active and reactive power modulation by the BES can be controlled accord-ing to system requirements. Eigenvalue analysis and dynamic simulations are performed to demonstrate the damping effect of the BES.

40|$|The {{operation}} of power electronic systems at cryogenic temperatures is anticipated in many future space missions such as planetary exploration and deep space probes. In addition to surviving the space hostile environments, electronics capable of low temperature operation {{would contribute to}} improving circuit performance, increasing system efficiency, and reducing development and launch costs. DC/DC converters are widely used in space power systems {{in the areas of}} power management, conditioning, and control. As part of the on-going Low Temperature Electronics Program at NASA, several commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) DC/DC converters, with specifications that might fit the requirements of specific future space missions have been selected for investigation at cryogenic temperatures. The converters have been characterized in terms of their performance as a function of temperature in the range of 20 C to - 180 <b>C.</b> These <b>converters</b> ranged in electrical power from 8 W to 13 W, input voltage from 9 V to 72 V and an output voltage of 3. 3 V. The experimental set-up and procedures along with the results obtained on the converters' steady state and dynamic characteristics are presented and discussed...|$|R
