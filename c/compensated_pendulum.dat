2500|$|The {{most widely}} used <b>compensated</b> <b>pendulum</b> was the {{gridiron}} pendulum, invented in 1726 by John Harrison. [...] This consists of alternating rods of two different metals, one with lower thermal expansion (CTE), steel, and one with higher thermal expansion, zinc or brass. The rods are connected by a frame, {{as shown in the}} drawing at the right, so that an increase in length of the zinc rods pushes the bob up, shortening the pendulum. [...] With a temperature increase, the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer, while the high expansion zinc rods make it shorter. By making the rods of the correct lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc cancels out the expansion of the steel rods which have a greater combined length, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature.|$|E
50|$|The firm {{acquired}} {{a reputation for}} building particularly fine regulators. Up to the 1920s it still produced regulators with <b>compensated</b> <b>pendulums</b> and precision movements. The firm was later taken over by Junghans and the factory closed down in 1932, at which period the market for wall regulators had collapsed.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Saxton (March 22, 1799 - October 26, 1873) was an American inventor, born at Huntingdon, Pa. He went to Philadelphia in 1817 {{and while}} there invented a machine for cutting the teeth of marine {{chronometer}} wheels, and an escapement and <b>compensating</b> <b>pendulum</b> for clocks, and constructed a clock for the steeple of Independence Hall.|$|R
2500|$|During the 18th and 19th century, the {{pendulum}} clock's {{role as the}} most accurate timekeeper motivated much practical research into improving pendulums. It was found that {{a major source of}} error was that {{the pendulum}} rod expanded and contracted with changes in ambient temperature, changing the period of swing. [...] This was solved with the invention of temperature <b>compensated</b> <b>pendulums,</b> the mercury pendulum in 1721 and the gridiron pendulum in 1726, reducing errors in precision pendulum clocks to a few seconds per week.|$|R
50|$|His father, a Cornishman, John Ellicott (-1733), {{was also}} a clockmaker and had been {{admitted}} to the Clockmakers' Company in 1696. John Ellicott (jnr) conducted business first from Austin Friars Street EC2 and later from Swithinâ€™s Alley, Royal Exchange, and in 1738 was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He showed {{a keen interest in}} scientific matters and maintained an observatory at his home in Hackney. He was best known for his work on temperature <b>compensated</b> <b>pendulums</b> and his use of the cylinder escapement. His quality workmanship led to an appointment as Clockmaker to George III.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stability}} of each amplitude-mode is maintained by a constant self-adjustment of the phase {{relationship between the}} pendulum and the high-frequency field. Through its interaction with the field, the pendulum extracts {{the amount of energy}} needed to compensate its frictional losses for a given period. The <b>pendulum</b> <b>compensates</b> for the changes in the strength of the magnetic field, ...|$|R
25|$|Increases in {{barometric}} pressure increase a pendulum's period slightly {{due to the}} first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per inch of mercury or 0.015 seconds per day per torr). Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small aneroid barometer mechanism attached to the <b>pendulum</b> <b>compensated</b> for this effect.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{consider}} the physics of an inverted <b>pendulum</b> <b>compensated</b> by a force balance topology, with a theoretical pendulum where the mood {{plays the role of}} the suspended mass and the force balance compensation circuitry is replaced by drug-specific therapeutic interventions. In both systems, the oscillating members (mass/mood) are free to swing in response to any external or internal excitation, while the correction mechanism restores the equilibrium of the system. According to this view, the action of feedback interacts continuously with the oscillating medium by compensating the oscillations completing, in this way, a closed loop. The purpose of the present work is not to simulate, in a manner, the generation of mood oscillations observed in BDs neither to directly associate one by one the functional properties of an electromechanical pendulum system (EPS) with those of a mood pendulum system (MPS) but to found functional commonalities between the feedback treatment applied on the experimental pendulum device and the medical manipulations regarding the treatment of mood episodes. Additionally, in the present study, introduced topics of feedback control, such as the velocity-type compensation, time-selective regulation, and stability, have been co-examined with the treatment manipulations followed in the guidelines for biological treatment of bipolar disorders.|$|R
