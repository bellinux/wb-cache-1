40|$|This {{guidance}} document describes {{the development of}} <b>composting</b> emission factors for EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Included are estimates of the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from <b>composting</b> of yard trimmings and food scraps, as well as mixed organics and polylactide (PLA) biopolymer resin. 1 1. A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF COMPOSTING During <b>composting,</b> microbial decomposition aerobically transforms organic substrates into a stable, humus-like material (Brown and Subler, 2007). Although small-scale <b>composting,</b> such as backyard <b>composting,</b> occurs across the United States, WARM models <b>composting</b> only in central <b>composting</b> facilities with windrow piles because data for small-scale <b>composting</b> or other large-scale operations are insufficient. 2 WARM includes <b>composting</b> as a materials management option for yard trimmings, food scraps, and mixed organics. As modeled in WARM, <b>composting</b> results in some carbon storage (associated with application of <b>compost</b> to agricultural soils), as well as minimal carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from transportation and mechanical turning of the <b>compost</b> piles. To estimate the carbon storage from <b>compost</b> application, EPA selected point estimates from the range of emission factors covering various <b>compost</b> applicatio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Composts</b> can {{influence}} soil fertility and plant health. These influences can be positive or negative, depending {{of the quality}} of the <b>composts.</b> In order to estimate the potential of Swiss <b>composts</b> to influence soil fertility and plant health, one hundred <b>composts</b> representative of the different <b>composting</b> systems and qualities available on the market were analyzed. The organic substance and the nutrient content of the <b>composts</b> varied greatly between the composts; the materials of origin were the major factor influencing these values. The respiration rate and enzyme activities also varied greatly, particularly in the youngest <b>composts.</b> These differences decreased when the <b>composts</b> become more mature. Maturity, the degradation stage of the organic matter, depended not only on the age of the <b>compost,</b> but also on the management of the process. The Nmineralization potential of <b>compost</b> added to soil showed that a high proportion of young <b>composts</b> immobilized the nitrogen in the soil. Two <b>compost</b> parameters allow to predict the risk of nitrogen immobilization in soil: the NO 3 - and the humic acids contents. The phytotoxicity of the <b>composts</b> varied very much even in mature <b>composts,</b> showing that the storage of the <b>compost</b> plays a decisive role. While the majority of <b>composts</b> protected cucumber plants against Pythium ultimum, only a few <b>composts</b> suppressed Rhizoctonia solani in basil. With respect to disease suppression, the management of the maturation process seems to play a major role. In field experiments, some biologically immature <b>composts</b> immobilized nitrogen in soil and reduced growth of maize. With additional fertilization, however, it was possible to compensate this effect. Digestates and <b>composts</b> increased the pH-value and the biological activity of soil. These effects were observable also one maize season after <b>compost</b> application. In conclusion, big differences were observed in the quality of <b>composts</b> and digestates, and in their impact on soil fertility and plant health. The management of the <b>composting</b> process seems to influence the quality of the <b>composts</b> to a higher extent than the materials of origin or the <b>composting</b> system. More attention should be paid to biological quality of <b>composts,</b> in order to produce <b>composts</b> with more beneficial effects on crops...|$|R

Heavy metal concentrations in the <b>compost</b> were also examined to assess the potential health implication of <b>compost</b> application in urban and peri-urban agriculture. It was observed that the overall NPK concentration was low in the different <b>compost</b> types, but generally, total N and K were greater in agricultural waste <b>compost</b> compared to municipal solid waste (MSW) <b>composts.</b> The agricultural waste <b>compost</b> was also richer in organic carbon. In terms of toxicity concerns, heavy metals concentrations (Ni, Zn, Cu and Cd) were generally low in the different types of <b>composts</b> and within permissible Australian standards for <b>compost</b> products. However, lead (Pb) concentration in mixed MSW <b>composts</b> was significantly high in the dry season, exceeding the Australian limit of 150 mg/kg Pb, required for unrestricted <b>compost</b> use. There was considerable seasonal variation in the heavy metal levels in the <b>composts</b> made from open windrows process, with reduced levels in the rainy season.
