50|$|Despite its advantages, the use {{of natural}} gas {{vehicles}} faces several limitations, including fuel storage and infrastructure available for delivery and distribution at fueling stations. CNG must be stored in high pressure cylinders (3000psi to 3600psi operation pressure), and LNG must be stored in cryogenic cylinders (-260F to -200F). These cylinders take up more space than gasoline or diesel tanks that can be molded in intricate shapes to store more fuel and use less on-vehicle space. <b>CNG</b> <b>tanks</b> are usually located in the vehicle's trunk or pickup bed, reducing the space available for other cargo. This problem can be solved by installing the tanks under {{the body of the}} vehicle, or on the roof (typical for busses), leaving cargo areas free. As with other alternative fuels, other barriers for widespread use of NGVs are natural gas distribution to and at fueling stations as well as the low number of CNG and LNG stations.|$|E

Natural gas is one such alternative fuel. However, the major shortcoming of natural gas is {{that it must be}} highly compressed in order to store at a comparable energy density to liquid fuels. For this reason, The Alliance for Collaborative Research in Alternative Fuel Technology (ALL-CRAFT) aims to develop low-pressure, high-capacity storage technologies for natural gas (methane). Midwest Research Institute (MRI), an ALL-CRAFT partner, is assigned the task of developing a fuel tank and fuel delivery system for a natural gas-powered vehicle modified to store natural gas using adsorbed natural gas (ANG) technology. The design work performed thus far has been creating a preliminary model and solving the logistics of modifying the vehicle's fuel delivery system to accommodate the use of the ANG tank in addition to the pre-existing compressed natural gas (<b>CNG)</b> <b>tank.</b> The fuel system of a 2005 Honda Civic GX will be modified by installing an ANG fuel tank to serve as an auxiliary tank to the existing higher pressure <b>CNG</b> <b>tank.</b> The vehicle will have additional capabilities while maintaining all of its original functions. One such capability is running either from its CNG or the ANG tank, with emphasis on maximizing mileage from ANG tank use. Moreover, the <b>CNG</b> <b>tank</b> will be equipped to simultaneously fuel the engine and refill the ANG tank upon the latter's depletion. An on-board CPU will be installed to control this modified fuel delivery system and record data such as mileage accrued from each tank.

40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Peter Pfeifer, PhysicsNatural gas, a {{fuel source}} {{primarily}} composed of methane, is already important in many applications. Methane {{can be used}} as a fuel for cars, but difficulty arises in the practicality of storing adequate amounts in tanks of reasonable volume. A conventional approach is to compress natural gas to high pressures, a <b>CNG</b> <b>tank,</b> but such tanks must be heavy-duty and if breeched release their flammable contents dangerously rapidly. An alternative approach is to construct a tank occupied by an exceptionally porous material, such as activated carbon, which may be used to store gases by adsorption. Adsorption of gas molecules on the surface of solids may occur spontaneously, reducing the surface free energy at the solid-gas interface and resulting in higher gas densities at the surface. Such an adsorbed natural gas tank (ANG tank) may hold as much natural gas as a <b>CNG</b> <b>tank,</b> but at lower, safer pressures and thus be of a flexible, light-weight design better-suited for automobiles. A process developed by Pfeifer, et al. has produced an activated carbon which has proven superior in methane storage compared to others in the literature. However, producing this activated carbon in the lab has proven very labor-intensive, requiring over ten hours of labor per monolith (~ 0. 1 kg) of activated carbon. Its practical use in a large-scale application such as ANG tanks for automobiles necessitates a production process which is largely automated. The design of such a process and an investigation into the capital investment, maintenance, and labor costs required for it reveals that this activated carbon can be produced in large quantities at much lower costs per monolith than in the lab, and so it is practical for high-volume applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a compressed natural gas vehicle (CNGV) for passenger car is of interest nationally and worldwide, particularly with the rise in petrol prices. The main components of a CNGV are the body, engine and transmission and fuel storage. For the vehicle body development, many aspects need to be considered. These are the on board fuel storage locations, crashworthiness, strength and vibration characteristics. For petrol vehicle, {{the shape of the}} fuel storage can be designed to fit the space available underneath the vehicle body structure. However, for CNGV, the shape of the gas storage is always cylindrical. Hence, the vehicle body structure is to be designed to fit the cylindrical storage tanks underneath the platform as well as the passengers above it. In addition, the ergonomic passenger compartment and crashworthiness need also to be considered. This paper presents the analysis of a rear platform of Waja body to fit the <b>CNG</b> <b>tanks.</b> The result for the crash characteristics of the CNG rear platform is presented. It is compared with that of the corresponding petrol platform and discussed.

40|$|The present {{scenario}} {{of the world}} crisis: price of the fossil fuel has increased. Compressed natural gas (CNG) pressure vessel becomes important in NGV fuel driving system because demand in CNG base has increased {{and because it is}} cheaper and more environmental friendly. CNG pressure vessel is suitable for gas operated vehicles which can be made of fully metal, hoop wrapped with metal liner, fully wrapped with metal liner or fully composite with HDPE liner. Fully metal CNG pressure vessel is cheap but it is the heaviest of the pressure vessels compare to others. For lightweight application such as for trucks, buses and taxis, fully composite tanks are more suitable but it comes with a high price. So, many researchers had searched for the best solution to store high volume of CNG with lightweight and cheap material. Even though the aim is clear but the development of CNG pressure tank must follow the standard requirements to prevent failure and minimize the accident. In this paper, the trends of research by manufacturers, research organizations and universities have been analyzed to find the problems and difficulties regarding CNG pressure vessel. The result of the overview showed that all types of tanks had advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|Abstract only availableNatural gas is a {{promising}} fuel source {{because it is}} safe, inexpensive, cleaner than gasoline, domestically produced, and already has an infrastructure for its distribution. Methane, {{the main component of}} natural gas, however, does not have a high energy density, and to store enough in today's natural gas storage tanks to power vehicles, the gas must be compressed to 3600 psi. To be strong enough to hold up at those high pressures, Compressed Natural Gas (<b>CNG)</b> <b>tanks</b> must be bulky and cylindrical, and occupy the trunk space in today's CNG cars, which is considered prohibitive to the cars' market success. ALL-CRAFT's purpose is to develop nanoporous biocarbons which can store methane at relatively low pressures, allowing future tanks to be flat and sleek, ideally occupying the space below the car, making natural gas vehicles attractive consumer products. As a long-term goal, ALL-CRAFT is optimizing biocarbons for hydrogen storage for fuel cells. Nanoporous carbons are like sponges, soaking up molecules of adsorbent gas. The nanoporous biocarbons store up to five times more methane than an empty tank at the same pressure, {{despite the fact that the}} carbon obviously takes up space. It does this using van der Waals forces which act on the methane molecules at short distances. These forces cause the methane to form a supercritical fluid film on the surface of the carbon. The extremely high surface area of ALL-CRAFT's carbon samples—recently approaching 4000 square meters of surface per gram of carbon sample—means that our carbons can hold 180 times their volume in methane. Biocarbons can be made from myriad biomass sources. ALL-CRAFT hopes to perfect a process for making them from corn cob; using just the cob is advantageous because this does not displace corn as a food source like Ethanol does.

Marine Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) technology is a possible alternative; however, the required gas quality for CNG remains a challenge in commercial deployment. The optimal design conditions to safely and efficiently load, store, and unload CNG vessels are highly dependent {{on the quality of}} the gas. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of moderate/rich gases in CNG technology by performing dynamic simulations of the loading and unloading operations. It was demonstrated that existing Equations of State (EOS) are limited in accurately predicting the behaviour of the gas under load/unload conditions, particularly for gases with large heavy hydrocarbons content. Experiments with laboratory-synthesized gas samples were conducted using a PVT cell. The accuracy of the EOSs in predicting dew points, liquid dropout percentages, and gas densities was evaluated using the experimental data from the laboratory and literature. After tuning Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations to improve their predictions, their performance was evaluated using the HYSYS process simulator. A marked improvement in the EOS predictions was achieved by modifying a few EOS parameters. Dew point predictions were improved by adjusting binary interaction parameters (kij), the density predictions were improved by modifying the Peneloux parameters, and modifying both kij and Peneloux parameters enhanced the liquid dropout predictions. Dynamic simulations of the loading and unloading operations of a <b>CNG</b> <b>tank</b> were then performed to evaluate the effect of the heavy hydrocarbon content of the gases. Overall, removing all the heavier hydrocarbons appeared to produce very low temperatures during the unloading operation, while not removing these components caused an accumulation of liquids inside the tank at keel pressure.
