It could recover tampered block with good image quality when tamper occured within the limits of the anti-tamper radius.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to value function approximation which combines linear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identification. In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is {{complicated by the fact that}} state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore, RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state itself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the suitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification (SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much information as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two approaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set of features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function approximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called Predictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive state representations, PSTD finds a linear <b>compression</b> <b>operator</b> that projects a large set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of predictive information.

40|$|A three-component shallow {{reflection}} seismic {{line from}} Springbank, Alberta demonstrates large amplitude, surface wave noise {{due to the}} use of a surface energy source. Changes in phase velocity versus frequency, referred to as dispersion, of surface waves is primarily dependent on the shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the wave channels. Shear wave refraction first breaks are picked from the radial or in-line shear wave shot records. These picks are inverted with for near-surface shear wave lithology. This enabled a dispersion model to be calculated which is used to identify and interpret surface wave noise on the shot record. By summing the _o-p wavefleld transform of the vertical and radial component on a shot consistent basis the dispersion curve can be observed directly. The change in phase velocity with frequency can be approximated by a linear frequency modulated (LFM) wave over the frequency bandwidth of the Rayleigh waves. An offset varying <b>compression</b> <b>operator</b> is cross-correlated with each trace in the shot _gather before multi-channel filtering to remove linear dispersion. This reduces dispersed surface waves to a single aliased dip which is more easily removed by the 2 -D median f-k filter. The output is then uncompressed by flipping the operator in time and again cross-correlating. This hybrid multichannel filter is applied to a synthetic shot record contaminated with LFM noise at a bandwidth of 8 - 30 hz with velocity bounds of 230 - 800 m/s. The f-k domain representation of the synthetic shot record has a single focused dip of 520 m/s after LFM compression. This enables better removal of dispersive noise by the multichannel filters such as the velocity f-k or median f-k. This new filter is applied to the real three-component data set. The results indicate {{that the best way to}} minimize surface wave noise in shallow reflection studies is through careful choice of the acquisition parameters to ensure the target events are within the optimum offset window. In this example, the ground roll filtering is unable to recover the underlying reflection signals within the surface wave noise. The best CDP stack obtained for the P-wave data is due to an inside or near offset mute to completely remove the Rayleigh waves from the shot records before stacking. 6...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} fast solver {{for a general}} class of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which include the well-known graph Laplacian. We achieve this by developing an adaptive <b>operator</b> <b>compression</b> scheme and a multiresolution matrix factorization algorithm which achieve nearly optimal performance on both complexity and well-posedness. To develop our adaptive <b>operator</b> <b>compression</b> and multiresolution matrix factorization methods, we first introduce a novel notion of energy decomposition for SPD matrix $A$ using the representation of energy elements. The interaction between these energy elements depicts the underlying topological structure of the operator. This concept of decomposition naturally reflects the hidden geometric structure of the operator which inherits the localities of the structure. By utilizing the intrinsic geometric information under this Energy framework, we propose a systematic <b>operator</b> <b>compression</b> scheme for the inverse operator $A^{- 1 }$. In particular, with an appropriate partition of the underlying geometric structure, we can construct localized basis by using the concept of interior and closed energy. Meanwhile, two important localized quantities are introduced, namely the error factor and the condition factor. Our error analysis results show that these two factors will be the guidelines for finding the appropriate partition of the basis functions such that prescribed compression error and acceptable condition number can be achieved. By virtue of this insight, we propose the Patch Pairing algorithm to realize our energy partition framework for <b>operator</b> <b>compression</b> with controllable compression error and condition number.

40|$|Control of {{variability}} {{and performance in}} {{the back end of}} the VLSI manufacturing line has become extremely difficult with the introduction of new materials such as copper and low-k dielectrics. To improve manufacturability, and in particular to enable more uniform chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP), it is necessary to insert area fill features into low-density layout regions. Because area fill feature sizes are very small compared to the large empty layout areas that need to be filled, the filling process can increase the size of the resulting layout data file by an order of magnitude or more. To reduce file transfer times, and to accommodate future maskless lithography regimes, data compression becomes a significant requirement for fill synthesis. In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we define two complementary strategies for fill data volume reduction corresponding to two different points in the design-to-manufacturing flow: compressible filling and post-fill compression.

40|$|Truncated Toeplitz <b>operators</b> are <b>compressions</b> of {{multiplication}} <b>operators</b> on L 2 {{to model}} spaces (that is, subspaces of H 2 which are invariant {{with respect to}} the backward shift). For this class of operators we prove certain Szegö type theorems concerning the asymptotics of their compressions to an increasing chain of finite dimensional model spaces. The Toeplitz <b>operators</b> are <b>compressions</b> of multiplication <b>operators</b> on the space L 2 (T) to the Hardy space H 2; the multiplier is called the symbol of the operator. With respect to the standard exponential basis, their matrices are constant along diagonals; if we truncate such a matrix considering only its upper left finite corner, we obtain classical Toeplitz matrices. It does not come as a surprise that there are connections between the asymptotics of these Toeplitz matrices and the whole Toeplitz operator, or its symbol. A central result is Szegö's strong limit theorem and its variants (see, for instance, [4] and the references within), which deal with the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix. On the other hand, certain generalizations of Toeplitz matrices have attracted {{a great deal of attention}} in the last decade, namely <b>compressions</b> of multiplication <b>operators</b> to subspaces of the Hardy space which are invariant under the backward shift. These " model spaces " are of the form H 2 ⊖uH 2 with u an inner function, and the compressions are called truncated Toeplitz operators. They have been formally introduced in [11]; see [8] for a more recent survey. Although classical Toeplitz matrices have often been a starting point for investigating truncated Toeplitz operators, the latter may exhibit surprising properties. It thus seems natural to see whether an analogue of Szegö's strong limit theorem can be obtained in this more general context. Viewed as truncated Toeplitz operators, the Toeplitz matrices act on model spaces corresponding to the inner functions u(z) = z n, and Szegö's theorem is about the asymptotical situation when n → ∞. The natural generalization is then to consider a sequence of zeros (λ j) in D, and to let the truncations act on the model space corresponding to the finite Blaschke product associated to λ j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n...|$|R
