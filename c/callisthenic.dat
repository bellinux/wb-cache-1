50|$|Such drills serve many {{pedagogical}} functions. They instill basic {{movement patterns}} and so internalize {{the concept of}} a hierarchy of dominant positions. When used {{as a part of a}} warm-up they maximize the use of available training time, allowing instructors to review the details of the basic techniques without taking time away from more advanced training. New techniques can be taught in context, for example a new choke can be practiced every time the appropriate position is reached. They allow students of different levels to work together. An advanced student will not necessarily pass the guard or achieve the mount in the same way as a beginner but the drill still functions as a framework for practice. The drills also allow Combatives training to become a routine part of every soldier's day. During physical training for instance soldiers could be asked to perform the drills interchangeable with <b>callisthenic</b> exercises.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Callisthenic</b> {{exercise}} is a systematic rhythmic isotonic exercise that is performed with four counts movements using the upper or the lower body parts. It {{can be performed}} with slow, moderate, or fast cadence and it is usually included in cardiac rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the acute effect of <b>callisthenic</b> exercise time and cadence on the heart rate (HR) and percentage age predicted maximum heart rate (%APMHR). During February to May 2009, sixteen healthy female students (aged 22. 5 ± 0. 89 years) were recruited from College of Applied Medical Sciences (CAMS), King Saud University (KSU) to participate in this study. They practiced one-minute upper- and lower-extremity <b>callisthenic</b> exercise with slow, moderate and fast cadences. Resting, exercise and recovery HR was monitored using Polar wristwatch-like device and %APMHR was calculated. Results showed that progression through the exercise time and cadence resulted in progressive increase in HR and %APMHR. Lower-extremity one-minute <b>callisthenic</b> exercise showed higher increase in HR and %APMHR than upper-extremity one-minute <b>callisthenic</b> exercise. At the end of one-minute <b>callisthenic</b> exercise HR returned to the resting level or even lower indicating acceptable recovery pattern. Fast cadence one-minute lower-extremity <b>callisthenic</b> exercise could be considered as mild-intensity aerobic exercise. If the cardiac patient would respond the same way, <b>callisthenic</b> exercises could be used in phase I cardiac rehabilitation for patients reconditioning after cardiac event and as home program in phase II.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} relative oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate and oxygen pulse associated with the constituent elements of an exercise-to-music class. Six women exercise-to-music leaders with a mean(s. d.) age, weight and height of 33. 2 (5. 2) years, 51. 0 (2. 8) kg and 157. 9 (5. 6) cm respectively, completed five distinct exercise-to-music movement elements. The movement elements were of a locomoter (circuit, jump and low impact) and <b>callisthenic</b> (prone and side/supine) nature. The movement elements were distinguishable from one another in terms of their movement patterns, posture and tempo. Relative VO 2 values were greatest for the circuit element (40. 6 ml kg- 1 min- 1) and least for the side/supine element (20. 0 ml kg- 1 min- 1). The differences in VO 2 between the locomotrr and <b>callisthenic</b> elements were significant (circuit approximately jump approximately low impact > prone approximately side/supine). However, effect size data suggested that the differences between the low impact and jump elements and the prone and side/supine elements were of practical significance (circuit approximately jump > low impact > prone > side/supine). With a single exception similar parametric statistics and effect size trends were identified for absolute heart rate. Specifically, the heart rate associated with the low impact element was not significantly greater than the prone element. The oxygen pulse associated with the locomotor elements was significantly greater than the <b>callisthenic</b> elements (circuit approximately jump approximately low impact > prone > side/supine). This suggested that heart rate may be an inappropriate index for making comparisons between exercise-to-music elements. Reasons for differences in oxygen uptake values between movement elements are discussed...|$|E

Exercise training was conducted in supervised outpatient, residential or community-based settings {{in the majority of}} interventions, with only 18 % (n[*]=[*] 13) containing sessions which were conducted entirely in an unsupervised, home-based environment. Consequently, most interventions also used some form of group exercise training (80 %; n[*]=[*] 53; six missing details). All 72 interventions used aerobic exercise training, with 54 % (n[*]=[*] 31; 15 missing) also containing resistance training or <b>callisthenic</b> body-weight exercises. Interval training was used in eight interventions and circuit-based exercises in seven, while six interventions consisted only of home-based walking programs. In 53 (74 %) interventions, exercise was combined with other secondary prevention strategies such as risk factor education, counselling and stress management, while the remainder provided exercise training as a standalone intervention. Allied health staff, such as physiotherapists and exercise specialists, were directly involved in the prescription and supervision of exercise training in {{more than half of all}} interventions (n[*]=[*] 32; 59 %; 18 missing details), with a physician routinely contributing to exercise supervision in 16 interventions.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{knowledge}} and practice of physical exercise among the inhabitants of Bangkok. The factors correlated with knowledge {{and the practice of}} physical exercise, were also explored. Material and Method: A self-administered questionnaire was designed to survey 1, 200 inhabitants in Bangkok and the vicinity aged more than 18 years old. Results: One thousand one hundred and seven people aged ranging from 18 - 81 years old completed the questionnaires (response rate 92. 25 %). Six hundred and forty people (58. 4 %) exercised regularly. The exercise was performed 1 - 2 days per week with varied duration. They performed exercises alone, in their homes, in the evening. They did not report any expenditure on the exercises. Common types of exercise reported were walking, jogging, attending an aerobic exercise class, using an exercise machine, and <b>callisthenic</b> exercise. Two hundred and seven people (18. 9 %) did not perform exercise at all {{because of the lack of}} time. The factors correlated with regular exercise were the increasing age, the high level of education, the amount of free time per day, and the enjoyment of exercise.

40|$|Research Objective. The {{objective}} {{of our research}} was to provide theoretical substantiation and implement corrective gymnastics in practice {{for the purposes of}} prevention and correction of faults in schoolchildren’s posture. The main means for shaping the correct posture, preventing and correcting faults in posture are <b>callisthenic</b> routine and special corrective exercises. Research methods: anamnesis, somatoscopy, clinical and mathematical methods. Research results. The medical examination revealed that only six of 60 pupils had normal correctly shaped posture, which accounts for 10 %. The posture of the other 90 % of the pupils was impaired. The most common faults were: asymmetrical pectoral girdle and shoulder blades, stooping posture. The examination revealed 19 pupils with scoliotic posture, which accounts for 44 %. The posture of 24 pupils, or 40 %, was hyperkyphotic and stooping. In other words, the posture of 84 % of the pupils was scoliotic or hyperkyphotic. The rest of the pupils had flat and kypholordic posture. It is worth mentioning that some of the pupils examined had more serious disorders of their musculoskeletal system, namely: organic disorders, such as spinal disorders in the sagittal plane — the scoliosis types excluded from the study. Significantly, the first main reason of posture disorders is weakness of the pectoral muscle sling. Conclusions. The principal means of prevention and correction of impaired posture are using special physical exercises designed to create a muscular corpus and correct particular faults in posture. We therefore developed sets of exercises intended to correct posture defects and proposed them to the physical education teacher and class teachers...|$|E
50|$|Boys {{typically}} start {{training at}} the age of ten to twelve. To avoid stunting their growth, young trainees are first taught kundakavartana, <b>callisthenics</b> and exercises to develop their overall strength and endurance without equipment. Exercises that employ the wrestler's own bodyweight include the sun salutation (Surya Namaskara), shirshasana, Hindu squat (bethak) and the Hindu press-up (danda), which are also found in hatha yoga. After acquiring the necessary power and stamina, students may begin khambhasrama, referring to exercises that use the mallakhamba or wrestler's pillar. There are a number of pillars, although the most common is a free-standing upright pole, some eight to ten inches in diameter, planted into the ground.

This study examines the effects of HEx on BP in resistant hypertensive patients. MethodsThis is a parallel, randomized controlled trial. 125 nonconsecutive sedentary patients with resistant hypertension from a hypertension outpatient clinic in a university hospital were screened; 32 patients fulfilled the study requirements. The training was performed for 60 -minute sessions in a heated pool (32 °C), {{three times a week}} for 12 weeks. The HEx protocol consisted of <b>callisthenic</b> exercises and walking inside the pool. The control group was asked to maintain habitual activities. The main outcome measure was change in mean 24 -hour ambulatory BP (ABPM). Results 32 patients (HEx n= 16; control n= 16) were randomized; none were lost to follow-up. Office BPs decreased significantly after heated water exercise (36 / 12 mmHg). HEx decreased 24 -hour systolic (from 137 ± 23 to 120 ± 12 mmHg, p= 0. 001) and diastolic BPs (from 81 ± 13 to 72 ± 10 mmHg, p= 0. 009); daytime systolic (from 141 ± 24 to 120 ± 13 mmHg, p< 0. 0001) and diastolic BPs (from 84 ± 14 to 73 ± 11 mmHg, p= 0. 003); and nighttime systolic (from 129 ± 22 to 114 ± 12 mmHg, p= 0. 006) and diastolic BPs (from 74 ± 11 to 66 ± 10 mmHg, p< 0. 0001).

The purposes of this study were to define its prevalence and to investigate the safety and efficacy of an intensive exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with and without anemia. Methods: 436 participants (77 % males; mean age 64 ± 13 years) were submitted to a two-week cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of low to medium intensity, individualized training with respiratory, aerobic and <b>callisthenic</b> exercises (three sessions daily, six times per week). A six-minute walking test was performed at enrolment and repeated at discharge together with a cardiopulmonary test. Results: Anemia, as defined according to World Health Organization criteria, was detected in 328 patients (75. 2 % of the entire population). The distance walked increased from 381 ± 117 m at baseline to 457 ± 110 m (p < 0. 001) after a mean period of 12. 4 ± 4 days. A direct correlation was found between hemoglobin concentrations and both the absolute distance walked (r = 0. 48; p < 0. 001) and peak VO 2 (r = 0. 39; p < 0. 001). Anemic patients walked a significantly shorter distance at baseline and at discharge (p < 0. 001); however, both groups showed the same increment in the distance walked: 76. 0 ± 61 m vs 76. 0 ± 60 m (p = 0. 99). Conclusions: Our data indicate: 1) a high prevalence of anemia in the study population and 2) that, in spite of a clear reduction in exercise capacity, a moderate anemia does not preclude increments in cardiac performance during a short period of intensive, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{educational}} significance of the raising {{of the human body}} at school. This issue is highly relevant today, because the discipline of physical education has to deal with a problem of legitimization as well as with a factual lack of appreciation (compared to other, more ‘serious’ subject matters). Moreover, the current organization of and the prevailing discourse on physical education has brought about a far going instrumentalization of the body (meaning that movement activities are made subservient to societal goals {{that have nothing to do}} with the corporeal). In this article I elaborate a new way to look at this formal discipline, arguing that we should take the term ‘physical’ quite literally and that the specific educational content of P. E. (in contradistinction to organized sport life outside school) resides in its concentration on the physical as such. I will support this thesis by taking into account some ideas of the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. I will more precisely elaborate his thought that next to the more common classification of (motor) behaviour as ‘means in view of an end’ (instrumental behaviour, poiesis) or ‘pure ends’ (autotelic activity, praxis), there exists also a repertoire of movements that should be termed ‘pure means’. These precisely allow for an experience that is intrinsically equalizing and communizing and that has a deep emancipatory significance (which he describes as ‘potentiality’, but also as ‘profanation’). What we aim at is however not an abstract or general consideration about the aims of P. E., but a deeper understanding of specific practices. Therefore we will use this Agambenian framework to analyse things such as basic <b>callisthenic</b> exercise, as well as specific forms of play and sport. This will allow to make concrete suggestions regarding the (reformation of) P. E. -curricula. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{compare the}} effects on {{exercise}} capacity and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of two exercise programmes; one programme including endurance training and one including only resistance training and <b>callisthenics.</b> A second purpose was {{to find out whether}} the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affected the training response and whether the interventions had a long-term effect. MethodsSixty-three patients were stratified according to severity of COPD and randomised to two training groups. Group A had a mixed programme including endurance training. Group B had resistance training and <b>callisthenics.</b> All trained twice weekly for 8 weeks. A symptom-limited ergometer test, 12 -min walking test, dynamic spirometry, blood gas analysis at rest and HRQoL were measured before and after the training period. Follow-up tests were conducted at 6 and 12 months after training. ResultsForty-two patients fulfilled the trial. In group A (n= 20) peak exercise capacity increased by 7 W (P< 0. 001) and 12 -min walking distance (12 MWD) by 50 m (P< 0. 01), whereas group B (n= 22) did not change in any of these variables. HRQoL did not change significantly in either group. Training response was similar in patients with moderate and severe disease. One year post-training 12 MWD had returned to pre-training level in group A, and below pre-training level in group B (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsExercise capacity in patients with severe and moderate COPD improved by intensive endurance training, two sessions a week for 8 weeks. The improvement was however small and HRQoL did not improve. Severity of illness did not affect response to training.

This study will document the effects of a reduced calorie diet combined with aerobic conditioning and strength training on a subject who has been treated surgically for obstructive sleep apnea. Methods: The subject participated in a 12 -week structured fitness and nutritional program for weight reduction. Pre-program baseline measurements including weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat composition, and waist measurement were established. A pre-program baseline of physical fitness capability was established including a timed 1. 5 mile run along with maximum repetitions of specific <b>callisthenic</b> and strength exercises performed with a 2 minute time limit. All physical fitness training activity was recorded, including elapsed times, repetitions, weight levels, and exercise intensity attained. Daily dietary intake, including grams of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, as well as total calories consumed were recorded in a program log. At program completion monitored parameters were analyzed for percent change from baseline. Results: The dietary calculations revealed an average intake of 1237 total calories per day. This was broken down into 61 % carbohydrates, 26 % protein, and 13 % fat. The subject had a total weight loss of 41 pounds during the 12 week program, corresponding to a 16. 5 % decrease from a baseline of 248 pounds. BMI was reduced from 37. 7 to 31. 5, a 16. 4 % decrease. Body fat percentage was reduced from 36. 6 % to 28 %, a decrease from baseline of 23. 5 %. Patient’s waist size decreased from 42 inches to 36 inches, a decrease of 14. 3 % from baseline.

5000|$|Her big {{innovation}} was to {{move from}} small, private classes to a mass-market movement. In 1930 this grew into a commercial enterprise, the Women's League of Health and Beauty, using the YMCA's Regent Street premises. Public displays in London garnered publicity, and more centres started in 1932 in Bromley, Southend, Slough, Bournemouth, Croydon, Birmingham, Glasgow followed by Ayr, Paisley and Edinburgh and finally franchised centres all over the UK. The Women's League of Health and Beauty classes included elements from dance, <b>callisthenics,</b> and remedial, slimming, and rhythmical exercise to music. The League published its own magazine, Mother and Daughter, from 1933 to 1935 with content on pacifism and feminist political discussion as well as general self-improvement.

40|$|This {{research}} on “America’s Cup” grinders investigated {{the effects of}} a specific eight-week long-arm cranking ergometer (ACE) training on upper body (UB) aerobic fitness (ventilatory threshold – Tvent, respiratory compensation point- RCP, – oxygen uptake peak – V_ O 2 peak) and high intensity working capacity. The training consisted of sessions carried out for 20 – 30 mins, three times per week, at an intensity between the UB-Tvent and UB-RCP, and replaced part of a typical lower limb aerobic training whilst maintaining the usual weekly schedule of <b>callisthenics,</b> resistance training and sailing. Seven sailors, including four grinders and three mastmen (age 30 ± 5. 5 years, height 1. 9 ± 0. 04 m, body mass 102 ± 3. 6 kg), were evaluated through both an ACE cardiopulmonary maximal exercise test (CPET) and an ACE all-out up to exhaustion exercise test, before and after the ACE training. UB aerobic fitness improved significantly: UB-V_ O 2 peak increased from 4. 29 ± 0. 442 to 4. 52 ± 0. 522 l·min− 1 (6. 4 ± 3. 66...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tai Chi, a {{systematic}} <b>callisthenic</b> exercise first developed in ancient China, involves {{a series of}} slow and rhythmic circular motions. It emphasises use of 'mind' or concentration to control breathing and circular body motions to facilitate flow of internal energy (i. e. 'qi') within the body. Normal flow of 'qi' {{is believed to be}} essential to sustain body homeostasis, ultimately leading to longevity. The effect of Tai Chi on balance and muscle strength in the elderly population has been reported; however, the effect of Tai Chi on dyspnoea, exercise capacity, pulmonary function and psychosocial status among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effectiveness of Tai Chi in reducing dyspnoea and improving exercise capacity in people with COPD. • To determine the influence of Tai Chi on physiological and psychosocial functions among people with COPD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (which included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and PsycINFO); handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts; and searched Chinese medical databases including Wanfang Data, Chinese Medical Current Contents (CMCC), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), China Journal Net (CJN) and China Medical Academic Conference (CMAC), from inception to September 2015. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for relevant additional references. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Tai Chi (Tai Chi alone or Tai Chi in addition to another intervention) versus control (usual care or another intervention identical to that used in the Tai Chi group) in people with COPD. Two independent review authors screened and selected studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors extracted data from included studies and assessed risk of bias on the basis of suggested criteria listed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We extracted post-programme data and entered them into RevMan software (version 5. 3) for data synthesis and analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 984 participants from 12 studies (23 references) in this analysis. We included only those involved in Tai Chi and the control group (i. e. 811 participants) in the final analysis. Study sample size ranged from 10 to 206, and mean age ranged from 61 to 74 years. Programmes lasted for six weeks to one year. All included studies were RCTs; three studies used allocation concealment, six reported blinded outcome assessors and three studies adopted an intention-to-treat approach to statistical analysis. No adverse events were reported. Quality of evidence of the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. Analysis was split into three comparisons: (1) Tai Chi versus usual care; (2) Tai Chi and breathing exercise versus breathing exercise alone; and (3) Tai Chi and exercise versus exercise alone. Comparison of Tai Chi versus usual care revealed that Tai Chi demonstrated a longer six-minute walk distance (mean difference (MD) 29. 64 metres, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 10. 52 to 48. 77 metres; participants = 318; I(2) = 59 %) and better pulmonary function (i. e. forced expiratory volume in one second, MD 0. 11 L, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 20 L; participants = 258; I(2) = 0 %) in post-programme data. However, the effects of Tai Chi in reducing dyspnoea level and improving quality of life remain inconclusive. Data are currently insufficient for evaluating the impact of Tai Chi on maximal exercise capacity, balance and muscle strength in people with COPD. Comparison of Tai Chi and other interventions (i. e. breathing exercise or exercise) versus other interventions shows no superiority and no additional effects on symptom improvement nor on physical and psychosocial outcomes with Tai Chi. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No adverse events were reported, implying that Tai Chi is safe to practise in people with COPD. Evidence of very low to moderate quality suggests better functional capacity and pulmonary function in post-programme data for Tai Chi versus usual care. When Tai Chi in addition to other interventions was compared with other interventions alone, Tai Chi did not show superiority and showed no additional effects on symptoms nor on physical and psychosocial function improvement in people with COPD. With the diverse style and number of forms being adopted in different studies, the most beneficial protocol of Tai Chi style and number of forms could not be commented upon. Hence, future studies are warranted to address these topics. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Mathematics through Developing {{strategies}} for engagingmathematics activities is always achallenge. Teachers seek out new resources and online activities to excite students and support their learning. Mathematics through Movement offers an active learning strategy requiring few resources, {{and a bit}} of imagination, to achieve a variety of outcomes across mathe-matics domains. It is based on sound educational theory and a life time of experi-ence in dance. This paper examines the beginnings of research into this teaching strategy in a remote setting in Western Australia. It shows that this teaching tool can motivate talk, deepen understandings, and engage students in mathematics tasks. Background As a dancer, teacher of dance and mother, I had often reflected upon the significant role movement had in my life and that of my daughters. Dancers, dance teachers and parents had often commented that dance, <b>callisthenics</b> or movement of some sort, had supported students in their school work. As a teacher I pondered on Gardner’s kinesthetic learner and I am drawn to his statement: “Indeed participation in the arts is so natural and integral a part of human growth that an understanding of this process should provid...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{records the}} {{development}} of Women's Physical Education in Gt. Britain from 1800 to 1966. Organised physical education for girls dates from 1878 when the School Board of London invited Miss Concordia Lofving to become Inspectress of Physical Exercises in Girls and Infants Schools. Prior to this <b>Callisthenics,</b> dancing, drill and games were recognised forms of physical education in selected schools. The dancing mistress and the drill sergeant were equally responsible for the physical activity given to {{the girls in the}} High Schools, while in Public Elementary schools little attention was paid to this section of the curriculum. This thesis will attempt to trace the close link forged between the leading members of the Physical Education teaching profession and the resulting changes in Women's Physical Education from 1800 - 1966, with a glance towards the future. It has been necessary at certain stages to examine some parts in greater detail in order to stress the overall picture and to show the growth and development of Modern Physical Education. Equally there are sections worthy of a greater depth of study but beyond the limitations of this thesis. The latter has led to an unusually large number of references.

To maintain a healthy lifestyle, measures on the prevention of drug addiction and substance abuse were taken in 2006 by Bukovinian State Medical University. They set out terms on popularization of the healthy lifestyle and prevention of drug addiction, which will be introduced in the educational process. Tutors of first-year academic groups systematically {{pay attention to the}} issue of drug-prevention use and drugs’ harmful impact on psychic and somatic state of the person. During the academic year major sports competitions are held dedicated to the Athlete's day of Ukraine, traditional sport festivals, competitions between courses, tournaments between the departments and hostels. On the basis of the University sports grounds city and regional sport events of different levels, city and regional championships in basketball and volleyball are held. Teachers of Physical Education conduct training work with the University teams of basketball, volleyball, table tennis, wrestling, track and field athletics. The University creates the conditions for rest, rehabilitation and vocational training during working days, preventing activities targeting sports, including the organization of sport tourism. On the basis of the Department of Disaster Medicine and Military Medicine sports and recreation clubs in volleyball, basketball, table tennis, chess, tourism, athletics, judo, sambo, gymnastics, <b>callisthenics,</b> aerobics are organized for the students and the faculty staff. In summer, students spend their holiday in summer sports camp located in the village of Repuzhyntsi, Zastavna district, Chernivtsi region, where the entertainment and sports, and various holidays are held.|$|R
40|$|The overall aims of {{the studies}} were to {{investigate}} the effects of different training modalities on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with moderate or severe COPD and, further, to explore two of the physical tests used in pulmonary rehabilitation. In study I, the 12 -minute walking distance (12 MWD) did not increase on retesting in patients with exercise-induced hypoxemia (EIH) whereas 12 MWD increased significantly on retesting in the non-EIH patients. In study II, {{we found that the}} incremental shuttle walking test was as good a predictor of peak exercise capacity (W peak) as peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) is. In study III, we investigated the effects of two different combination training programmes when training twice a week for eight weeks. One programme was mainly based on endurance training (group A) and the other on resistance training and <b>callisthenics</b> (group B). W peak and 12 MWD increased in group A but not in group B. HRQoL, anxiety and depression were unchanged in both groups. Ratings of perceived exertion at rest were significantly lower in group A than in group B after training and during 12 months of follow-up. Twelve months post-training, 12 MWD was back to baseline in group A, but significantly shorter than at baseline in group B. Thus, a short endurance training intervention delayed decline in 12 MWD for at least one year. Patients with moderate and severe COPD responded to training in the same way. In study IV, both interval and continuous endurance training increased W peak, VO 2 peak, peak exhaled carbon dioxide (VCO 2 peak) and 12 MWD. Likewise, HRQoL, dyspnoea during activities of daily life, anxiety and depression improved similarly in both groups. At a fixed, submaximal workload (isotime), the interval training reduced oxygen cost and ventilatory demand significantly more than the continuous training did...|$|R
