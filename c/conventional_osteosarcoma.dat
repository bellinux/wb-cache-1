40|$|SummaryOsteosarcomas are a {{heterogeneous}} group of tumors with diverse anatomical, clinical, and progressional characteristics. Parosteal osteosarcoma, or juxtacortical osteosarcoma, {{is a rare}} form of osteosarcoma that develops at the bone surface, but has a better prognosis than other <b>conventional</b> <b>osteosarcomas.</b> We report the observation of a 22 -year-old female patient whose initial presentation was an enormous tumefaction of the knee that had been progressing for 10 years. The biopsy concluded in PO of the lower third of the femur. Staging was negative. The tumor had reached an enormous size and required amputation of the left lower extremity. A custom external prosthesis was manufactured {{to get her back}} to walking. Eight years after surgery, no local recurrence or metastasis has been detected.

40|$|Surface osteosarcomas are a rare form of osteosarcomas {{accounting}} for around 3 - 6 % of all osteosarcomas.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the clinicopathological features of extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) and its response to multimodal therapy. Patients and Methods: A nationwide cohort comprising all Norwegian histologically verified ESOS patients between 1975 and 2009 supplemented with clinical reports from all hospitals involved in sarcoma management. Results: Thirty-seven patients {{were classified as}} ESOS, mostly elderly people. Seventy-six % had an axial tumour, including nine patients with radiation-induced ESOS.

Aims and Objectives: To review histologically all metastatic sarcomas to lung and compare with the primary where available. Materials and Methods: Ninety-five patients with pulmonary metastases from sarcoma were analyzed histologically for type of sarcoma, chemotherapy-related changes, and changes in adjacent lung. Various clinical parameters like laterality, multiplicity, and interval between primary and metastasis were also studied. Results: Osteosarcoma constituted half of the metastatic sarcomas (48 cases, 50. 5 %) followed by synovial sarcoma (16 cases, 16. 8 %) and high grade spindle cell sarcoma-NOS (10 cases, 10. 5 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteosarcomas are {{the most}} common non-haematological primary {{malignant}} tumours of bone, and all <b>conventional</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> are high-grade tumours showing complex genomic aberrations. We have integrated genome-wide genetic and epigenetic profiles from the EuroBoNeT panel of 19 human osteosarcoma cell lines based on microarray technologies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cell lines showed complex patterns of DNA copy number changes, where genomic copy number gains were significantly associated with gene-rich regions and losses with gene-poor regions. By integrating the datasets, 350 genes were identified as having two types of aberrations (gain/over-expression, hypo-methylation/over-expression, loss/under-expression or hyper-methylation/under-expression) using a recurrence threshold of 6 / 19 (> 30 %) cell lines. The genes showed in general alterations in either DNA copy number or DNA methylation, both within individual samples and across the sample panel. These 350 genes are involved in embryonic skeletal system development and morphogenesis, as well as remodelling of extracellular matrix. The aberrations of three selected genes, CXCL 5, DLX 5 and RUNX 2, were validated in five cell lines and five tumour samples using PCR techniques. Several genes were hyper-methylated and under-expressed compared to normal osteoblasts, and expression could be reactivated by demethylation using 5 -Aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine treatment for four genes tested; AKAP 12, CXCL 5, EFEMP 1 and IL 11 RA. Globally, there was as expected a significant positive association between gain and over-expression, loss and under-expression as well as hyper-methylation and under-expression, but gain was also associated with hyper-methylation and under-expression, suggesting that hyper-methylation may oppose the effects of increased copy number for detrimental genes. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative analysis of genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations identified dependencies and relationships between DNA copy number, DNA methylation and mRNA expression in osteosarcomas, contributing to better understanding of osteosarcoma biology...|$|R

40|$|Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} {{frequent}} primary malignant bone tumor. Distinct histological features are distinguishable based on the morphology of the tumor.

Computerized nuclear morphometry was performed in 56 <b>conventional</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> preoperative biopsies. The mean patient follow-up time was 35. 1 months. Based on the nuclear area, no significant difference (P = 0. 09) in overall survival between patients with large (> 42. 5 μm 2) and small (42. 5 μm 2 and coefficient of nuclear roundness > 0. 7), these two parameters together {{were likely to be}} a predictive factor (P = 0. 05).

40|$|Aurora kinases are key {{regulators}} of {{cell cycle}} and represent new promising therapeutic targets in several human tumours. Biological relevance of Aurora kinase-A and -B was assessed on osteosarcoma clinical samples and by silencing these genes with specific siRNA in three human osteosarcoma cell lines. In vitro efficacy of two Aurora kinases-targeting drugs (VX- 680 and ZM 447439) was evaluated {{on a panel}} of four drug-sensitive and six drug-resistant human osteosarcoma cell lines. Human osteosarcoma cell lines proved to be highly sensitive to both drugs. A decreased drug sensitivity was observed in doxorubicin-resistant cell lines, most probably related to ABCB 1 /MDR 1 overexpression. Both drugs variably induced hyperploidy and apoptosis {{in the majority of}} cell lines. VX- 680 also reduced in vitro cell motility and soft-agar cloning efficiency. Drug association experiments showed that VX- 680 positively interacts with all conventional drugs used in osteosarcoma chemotherapy, overcoming the cross-resistance observed in the single-drug treatments.

40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with {{telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma}} (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86 %), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90 % (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3. 5 years {{with a range of}} 18 to 78 months.

40|$|<b>Conventional</b> {{high-grade}} <b>osteosarcoma</b> is {{the most}} common primary bone malignancy. Although altered expression of the p 53 inhibitor HDMX (Mdmx/Mdm 4) is associated with cancer risk, progression, and outcome in other tumor types, little is known about its role in osteosarcoma. High expression of the Hdmx splice variant HDMX-S relative to the full-length transcript (the HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio) correlates with reduced HDMX protein expression, faster progression, and poorer survival in several cancers. Here, we show that the HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio positively correlates with less HDMX protein expression, faster metastatic progression, and a trend to worse overall survival in osteosarcomas. We found that the HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio associated with common somatic genetic lesions connected with p 53 inhibition, such as p 53 mutation and HDM 2 overexpression in osteosarcoma cell lines. Interestingly, this finding was not limited to osteosarcomas as we observed similar associations in breast cancer {{and a variety of other}} cancer cell lines, as well as in tumors from patients with soft tissue sarcoma. The HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio better defined patients with sarcoma with worse survival rates than p 53 mutational status. We propose a novel role for alternative splicing of HDMX, whereby it serves as a mechanism by which HDMX protein levels are reduced in cancer cells that have already inhibited p 53 activity. Alternative splicing of HDMX could, therefore, serve as a more effective biomarker for p 53 pathway attenuation in cancers than p 53 gene mutation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Conventional</b> {{high-grade}} <b>osteosarcoma</b> is {{a primary}} malignant bone tumor, which is most prevalent in adolescence. Survival rates of osteosarcoma patients have not improved significantly in the last 25 years. Aiming to increase this survival rate, a variety of model systems are used to study osteosarcomagenesis and to test new therapeutic agents. Such model systems are typically generated from an osteosarcoma primary tumor, but undergo many changes due to culturing or interactions with a different host species, which may result in differences in gene expression between primary tumor cells, and tumor cells from the model system. We aimed to investigate whether gene expression profiles of osteosarcoma cell lines and xenografts are still {{comparable to those of}} the primary tumor. Methods We performed genome-wide mRNA expression profiling on osteosarcoma biopsies (n = 76), cell lines (n = 13), and xenografts (n = 18). Osteosarcoma can be subdivided into several histological subtypes, of which osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and fibroblastic osteosarcoma are the most frequent ones. Using nearest shrunken centroids classification, we generated an expression signature that can predict the histological subtype of osteosarcoma biopsies. Results The expression signature, which consisted of 24 probes encoding for 22 genes, predicted the histological subtype of osteosarcoma biopsies with a misclassification error of 15 %. Histological subtypes of the two osteosarcoma model systems, i. e. osteosarcoma cell lines and xenografts, were predicted with similar misclassification error rates (15 % and 11 %, respectively). Conclusions Based on the preservation of mRNA expression profiles that are characteristic for the histological subtype we propose that these model systems are representative for the primary tumor from which they are derived. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nowadays, {{the results}} of the {{management}} of malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors have been dramatically improved because of the advance in imaging, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical techniques. Patients can have longer survival times with limb-salvage surgery. Several techniques of recon-struction have been advocated and gained more popularity following malignant tumor resection by using allograft, tumor prostheses, composite allograft prosthesis, or arthrodesis. Objective: To report the preliminary results of 32 endoprosthetic reconstructions following malignant bone and soft-tissue tumor resection. The oncologic results, functional outcomes, and complications from the sur-gery were assessed in the present study. Material and Method: Since September 1988, the authors have performed 188 limb-salvage surgical opera-tions for the treatment of musculoskeletal tumors at Siriraj Hospital.

40|$|AbstractHigh-grade <b>conventional</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> is a {{malignant}} tumour predominantly affecting adolescents and, despite multimodal intensive therapy, lethal for {{one third of}} the patients. Although there is currently detailed knowledge of normal skeletal development, this has not been integrated into research on the genesis of osteosarcoma. Recently we showed that the canonical Wnt pathway is not active in osteosarcoma and that its reactivation is disadvantageous to osteosarcoma cells. Since Wnt is regulating normal skeletogenesis together with other pathways, here we report on the activities of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP), the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and the hedgehog (Hh) pathways in osteosarcoma. Human osteosarcoma samples (n= 210), benign bone tumours of osteoblastic lineage called osteoblastoma (n= 25) and osteosarcoma cell lines (n= 19) were examined. For pathway activity luciferase transcriptional reporter assays and gene and protein expression analyses were performed. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated Smad 1 and Smad 2, the intracellular effectors of BMP and TGFβ, respectively, showed nuclear expression of both proteins in 70 % of the osteosarcoma samples at levels comparable to osteoblastoma. Interestingly cases with lower expression showed significantly worse disease free survival. This may imply that drugs restoring impaired signalling pathways in osteosarcoma might change the tumour’s aggressive clinical course, however targeted pathway modulation in vitro did not affect cell proliferation...|$|E

We applied these techniques to primary osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma of bone using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database for all cases of osteosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma of bone from 1993 through 2010. Secondary neoplasms were excluded. The age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, and anatomic location were collected. The time (xt) of the insult/triggering event was calculated using the best fit frequency distribution of age at diagnosis. There were 4, 356 patients with osteosarcoma and 1, 832 patients with Ewing’s sarcoma. The Pearson IV distribution was the best fit for both osteosarcoma (r 2 = 0. 987) and Ewing’s sarcoma (r 2 = 0. 99). For these distributions xt is − 0. 7 years of age (4 weeks after conception) for Ewing’s sarcoma, 0. 45 years for long bone osteosarcoma, and 10. 4 years for parosteal osteosarcoma. This confirms the genetic etiology of Ewing’s sarcoma since an xt is 4 weeks after conception. Long bone osteosarcoma is not entirely genetic, as xt was 0. 4 years for <b>conventional</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> and 10. 4 years for parosteal osteosarcoma. The etiologies for those {{two different types of}} osteosarcoma are thus different...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A chronic {{inflammatory}} cell infiltrate is commonly seen {{in response to}} primary malignant tumours of bone. This is known to contain tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and lymphocytes; dendritic cells (DCs) and mast cells (MCs) have also been identified but whether these and other {{inflammatory cell}}s are seen commonly in specific types of bone sarcoma is uncertain. METHODS: In this study we determined {{the nature of the}} inflammatory cell infiltrate in 56 primary bone sarcomas. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies was employed to assess semiquantitatively CD 45 + leukocyte infiltration and the extent of the DC, MC, TAM and T and B lymphocyte infiltrate. RESULTS: The extent of the inflammatory infiltrate in individual sarcomas was very variable. A moderate or heavy leukocyte infiltrate was more commonly seen in <b>conventional</b> high-grade <b>osteosarcoma,</b> undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) than in Ewing sarcoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma. CD 14 +/CD 68 + TAMs and CD 3 + T lymphocytes were the major components of the inflammatory cell response but (DC-SIGN/CD 11 c+) DCs were also commonly noted when there was a significant TAM and T lymphocyte infiltrate. MCs were identified mainly at the periphery of sarcomas, including the osteolytic tumour-bone interface. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that, although variable, some malignant bone tumours (e. g. osteosarcoma, GCTB) are more commonly associated with a pronounced inflammatory cell infiltrate than others (e. g. chondrosarcoma. Ewing sarcoma); the infiltrate is composed mainly of TAMs but includes a significant DC, T lymphocyte and MC infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Tumours that contain a heavy inflammatory cell response, which includes DCs, TAMs and T lymphocytes, may be more amenable to immunomodulatory therapy. MCs are present mainly at the tumour edge and are likely to contribute to osteolysis and tumour invasion...|$|R
40|$|A journal article {{review on}} {{malignant}} jaws observed and studied at two of Zimbabwe's leading public referral hospitals [...] The term osteosarcoma {{refers to a}} heterogenous group of primary malignant neoplasms affecting boneforming or mesenchymal tissue that have histopathologic evidence of osteogenic differentiation. Several variants exist with the <b>conventional</b> or classical <b>osteosarcoma</b> being {{the most common and}} arising centrally within bones. This is further subdivided into either osteoblastic or chondroblastic variants depending on the predominant cell type. The classical osteosarcoma accounts for approximately 20 % of primary bone tumours. It is most common in the long bones with a bimodal age distribution, with a major peak in the second decade and a somewhat smaller peak after the age of 50 years. Men tend to be more commonly affected than women. Pre-existing medical conditions such as Paget's disease of the bone or a history of radiotherapy has been implicated as a predisposing aetiologic factor. Jaw lesions are uncommon and compromise 6 % of the total osteosarcomas. They characteristically affect patients considerably later than in the appendicular skeleton, with the first peak occurring somewhat later in the third decade...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLow-grade {{osteosarcoma}} {{is a rare}} malignancy {{that may}} be subdivided into two main subgroups {{on the basis of}} location in relation to the bone cortex, that is, parosteal osteosarcoma and low-grade central osteosarcoma. Their histological appearance is quite similar and characterized by spindle cell stroma with low-to-moderate cellularity and well-differentiated anastomosing bone trabeculae. Low-grade osteosarcomas have a simple genetic profile with supernumerary ring chromosomes comprising amplification of chromosome 12 q 13 - 15, including the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4) and murine double-minute type 2 (MDM 2) gene region. Low-grade osteosarcoma can be confused with fibrous and fibro-osseous lesions such as fibromatosis and fibrous dysplasia on radiological and histological findings. We investigated MDM 2 -CDK 4 immunohistochemical expression in a series of 72 low-grade osteosarcomas and 107 fibrous or fibro-osseous lesions of the bone or paraosseous soft tissue. The MDM 2 -CDK 4 amplification status of low-grade osteosarcoma was also evaluated by comparative genomic hybridization array in 18 cases, and the MDM 2 amplification status was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 31 cases of benign fibrous and fibro-osseous lesions. MDM 2 -CDK 4 immunostaining and MDM 2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were investigated in a control group of 23 cases of primary high-grade bone sarcoma, including 20 <b>conventional</b> high-grade <b>osteosarcomas,</b> two pleomorphic spindle cell sarcomas/malignant fibrous histiocytomas and one leiomyosarcoma. The results showed that MDM 2 and/or CDK 4 immunoreactivity was present in 89 % of low-grade osteosarcoma specimens. All benign fibrous and fibro-osseous lesions and the tumors of the control group were negative for MDM 2 and CDK 4. These results were consistent with the MDM 2 and CDK 4 amplification results. In conclusion, immunohistochemical expression of MDM 2 and CDK 4 is specific and provides sensitive markers for the diagnosis of low-grade osteosarcomas, helping to differentiate them from benign fibrous and fibro-osseous lesions, particularly in cases with atypical radio-clinical presentation and/or limited biopsy samples...|$|R
