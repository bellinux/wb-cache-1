These sizes increase {{by a factor of}} , so that particular pens can be used on particular sizes of paper, and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively. For example, a <b>continuous</b> <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> on A0 size paper shall be drawn with a 0.7 mm pen, the same line on A1 paper shall be drawn with a 0.5 mm pen, and finally on A2, A3, or A4 paper it shall be drawn with a 0.35 mm pen.|$|E

Among the edges of these elements, the edge that is intersected by the propagation vector is found. This intersecting edge is drawn with a <b>thick</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>line</b> in Fig.  4. Then the angles formed by the line joining the current tip node to the edge nodes, and the crack propagation direction are calculated (ϕ _ 1 and ϕ _ 2 in figure).|$|R

40|$|Society for Education, Music, and Psychology Research. The staves of 63 {{scores of}} popular {{keyboard}} music from 50 publishers were measured. The staves had similar height but lines that varied in thickness from 0. 1 mm to 0. 45 mm. Evidence from visual psychophysics suggests {{that when the}} stave has <b>thick</b> <b>lines,</b> perceptual distortions are likely to affect {{the clarity of the}} score adversely. Students were asked to sight-read scores comprising random notes ("chromatic") or random notes in the key of G. The scores had staves with lines that were 0. 1 mm or 0. 4 mm thick (current typographic practice). Twice as many errors were made when the staves had <b>thick</b> <b>lines,</b> although the scores were then read more slowly. Scores in the key of G were read more accurately than the "chromatic" scores, but those with <b>thick</b> <b>lines</b> were read with as many errors as "chromatic" scores with thin lines. There was a tendency for individuals with susceptibility to pattern glare to read the scores with <b>thick</b> <b>lines</b> relatively slowly. The findings suggest that perceptual distortions can impair sight-reading of music manuscript because of the pattern from the lines of the stave; using thinner lines can increase both sight reading accuracy and speed...|$|R
