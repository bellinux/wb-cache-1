40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether ethnicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> sirolimus (SRL) and maintained on either calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids. METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI; group 2 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI; group 3 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF; group 4 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|R

5|$|The {{plutonium}} {{present in}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 12% of 241Pu. Because it spontaneously <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> 241Am, 241Pu can be extracted and {{may be used to}} generate further 241Am. However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of 241Pu decays to 241Am after about 15 years, and the 241Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City.

5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E
5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> gray selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E

5|$|The Turkish {{army was}} at first {{quartered}} in Baghdad, but quickly came into conflict with {{the remnants of the}} old Abbasid establishment in the city and the city's populace.

Violent episodes between the populace and the Turks thus became more and more common.|$|E
50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12 by KAO.

5|$|The {{first group}} of <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside. This was {{followed}} by the general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions. According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (a prominent Medinan leader) to Islam. Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E
5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
