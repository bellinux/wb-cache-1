40|$|Abstract. In <b>cold</b> work <b>extrusion,</b> {{lubricants}} play {{an important}} role in lubricating the tool and workpiece surfaces, preventing metal-to-metal contact and reducing sliding friction, so that the workpiece can be extruded smoothly without severe wear due to lubricant starvation. In this paper, the influence of lubricant viscosity in <b>cold</b> work forward <b>extrusion</b> was investigated. The lubricants were additive-free, paraffinic mineral oil, which may have low, medium or high viscosity. The workpiece material was pure aluminum A 1100, extruded with extrusion ratio of 3. The analysis focused on extrusion force, workpiece surface roughness after the extrusion process and the metal flow in the deformation zone of the workpiece. Using the visioplasticity method, the sliding velocity was calculated from the metal flow. Results showed that, the higher the lubricant viscosity, the lower the extrusion force generated. However, a high-viscosity lubricant produces coarser workpiece surface conditions after the extrusion process...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{high-temperature}} extrusion is {{used for}} the manufacture of ready-to-eat snacks, while <b>cold</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{is used for}} the manufacture of pasta and related products intended for later cooking and consumption. The processed products have low moisture and hence considerably higher shelf life, and provide variety and convenience to consumers. In the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10-20 bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both protein denaturation and starch gelatinization, depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).|$|E
