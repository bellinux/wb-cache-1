40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an accurate fault location algorithm for compensated transmission line. The distributed time domain model {{is used for}} modelling of the transmission line. This algorithm does not utilize the <b>compensated</b> <b>device</b> model and does not need any knowledge about the operation mode of the <b>compensated</b> <b>device</b> to compute the voltage drop during the fault period. Samples of voltage and current {{at both ends of}} the line are taken synchronously and used to calculate the location of fault. Besides the location of fault, the proposed algorithm estimates the fault resistance accurately. The proposed algorithm is not sensitive to fault resistance and does not require any knowledge of source impedances. The proposed method has been tested using EMTP/ATP model of a 400 kV, 300 km transmission line, which is compensated by a compensator device. The results of computer simulation confirm the accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R

The impact of high renewable energy penetration on the static voltage stability {{of the system is}} analysed. The effect of load models in distributed generation planning is also demonstrated through nonlinear simulations. In order to ensure fast voltage recovery after a sudden disturbance, <b>compensating</b> <b>devices</b> are located using Q-loadability to increase the system voltage stability limit. Both static and dynamic analyses are carried out to determine the size of distribution static synchronous compensator (D-STATCOM). The parameters of the controller are also tuned to reduce the rating of D-STATCOM. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce the sizes of <b>compensating</b> <b>devices</b> required which, in turn, reduces costs.

50|$|The 15-40-hp is {{fitted with}} Humber-Perrott semi-servo front wheel brakes. The driver's foot pedal still works the {{transmission}} brake {{and now the}} front wheel brakes as well. A floating shoe gives the semi-servo effect and it relies to some extent on forward motion. Applying the brakes when backing the car receives only half the force. Front axle and stub axles are strengthened to accommodate the higher loads from braking, to the same end the springs are wider {{and there is a}} new cross tube linking the dumb irons (forward ends of the main longitudinal chassis members).

50|$|The {{brake system}} uses the {{electro-pneumatic}} straight air brake with regenerative braking from the 1000 series. The series was remodeled with a load <b>compensating</b> <b>device</b> which adjusts brake power to support {{changes in the}} car's body weight which increased the passenger limit. The main controller unit, of a series parallel specification, was also taken from the 1000 series, and taking into account connecting this series with 1380, 1800, and 1850 series cars, test runs on 1800 series cars were carried out. From these tests, {{it was found that}} such trains could be run at up to 120 km/h. Because of this, cars in this series can be used as sudden replacements for cars in limited express trains. It has also been confirmed that this series can be connected to the 5300 series and 5700 series (in this case trains are not run at 120 km/h.) With this series having been connected to the 1380 series for test runs and out-of-service runs, it is theoretically possible to operate a train with this series connected to the 1380 series. However, the 5000 series has cars with only bench seats, as opposed to the 1380 series which, except for the ends of the cars, only has convertible forward- or backward-facing seats, so for the sake of this the two series are operated separately.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} water-level {{regulation}} in the boiler-shells of heat-power and nuclear-power plants largely determines reliable and economical operation. The latter {{can be accomplished}} by means of massive reduction of the actuation-mechanism running time which depends directly on the regulator performance. The paper examines some foreign methods of PID-regulator adjusting in the cascade system of boiler-shell water-level automatic regulation. The authors derive an invariant cascade system of automatic regulation in which they offer not to measure external disturbance, the steam rate for instance, but to realize a concurrent model of the real inertial section of the controlled member. The disparity between the current value of the water-level in the shell and the output from the inertial section of the controlled-member model is fed to the input of the external-disturbance equivalent <b>compensating</b> <b>device.</b> This allows employing the <b>compensating</b> <b>device</b> in closed circuit, and consequently, the regulation quality improves under the influence of any external disturbances. The comparative analysis of the modeling results of the Cascade-System Automatic Regulation (CSAR) with PID-regulator adjusted according to the foreign Â methods Â and Â ofÂ  the Â proposed Â invariant Â system Â shows Â considerable Â improvement in regulation quality of the latter, viz. : system performance grows 2, 5 times when working through the task jump, the peak value of overcorrection lowers from 42, 5 to 10, 0 %; while working through the internal disturbance, the regulating time reduces by 33 %, the maximum dynamic error of the regulation lowers by 65 %; the time of external combustion disturbance workout completion reduces two times, the maximum dynamic error of regulating â by 63 %; the maximum dynamic error of regulation while working through external disturbance with overheated steam rate diminishes by 71 %, the regulating time reduces by 1, 5 times. </p...|$|E
