5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. <b>Crackles</b> may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest <b>crackles</b> with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate. Grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E

25|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumonia are fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. Inspiratory <b>crackles</b> may {{be heard on}} exam. A chest x-ray can be useful to differentiate pneumonia from congestive heart failure. As the cause is usually a bacterial infection, antibiotics are typically used for treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US. The primary symptom of asbestosis is generally the slow onset of shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Clinically advanced cases of asbestosis may lead to respiratory failure. When a physician listens with a stethoscope to the lungs of a person with asbestosis, they may hear inspiratory <b>crackles.</b>|$|E

The episode goes on to depict the events of a stormy night in 1939 when a lightning bolt struck the tower and caused five people—a celebrity couple, a rising child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhop—to vanish from the elevator. The television then turns off and the guests are directed through to the boiler room, where they await the maintenance service elevator's arrival.|$|E
25|$|AF {{can cause}} {{respiratory}} distress due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, {{the heart rate}} will be greater than 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) non-invasive blood pressure monitors. For this reason, when determining heart rate in AF, direct cardiac auscultation is recommended. Low blood pressure is most concerning and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation {{of congestive heart failure}} due to the reduced cardiac output. Respiratory rate will be increased in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of hypoxia related to any precipitating factors such as pneumonia. Examination of the jugular veins may reveal elevated pressure (jugular venous distention). Lung exam may reveal <b>crackles,</b> which are suggestive of pulmonary edema. Heart exam will reveal a rapid irregular rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Both {{before and}} since DAB launched, other mediums of {{transmitting}} {{and listening to}} the radio have expanded. In 1989, cable television subscribers in the Saltash area could hear some BBC Radio stations on their television sets for the first time. With the expansion of digital cable television, many more radio stations have been added. With the expansion of satellite television too, many stations, including others from the European continent and beyond are available. The BBC added radio to UK Gold in 1993 on the Astra satellite, and subsequent satellites and services have been extended since then. The expansion of Freeview, and its subsequent replacement in Cornwall in 2009 of existing analogue television services is perhaps going to have the greatest impact. The internet, with thousands of radio stations streaming online, and the expansion of broadband has meant that radio reception has diversified in the number of stations that can be heard, and it is no longer restricted to <b>crackles</b> and night time fading of a few stations of old.|$|E

Another critic adds that, though Depp's voice [...] "does not have much heft or power", [...] "his ear is obviously excellent, because his pitch is dead-on accurate... Beyond his good pitch and phrasing, the expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to the portrayal. Beneath this Sweeney’s vacant, sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous rage that threatens to burst forth every time he slowly takes a breath and is poised to speak.

Collar regards it their best album. At AbsolutePunk, Jack Appleby said [...] "Instead of pursuing all things epic or intentionally moving to a specific sound, the band had a blast pursuing every genre under the sun, creating a damn good album in the process...Chances are you won't dedicate undivided attention to Paramore, but you'll regularly queue the whole record."

[...] Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated, [...] "The locations, costumes and acting are excellent, with a particularly striking use of light – cold and grey skies foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said, [...] "There's nothing glaringly wrong with this new Sense and Sensibility, the last in Masterpiece's winter-long homage to Austen; it is both lush and tidy.

We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows {{a thing or}} two about freewheeling banter... and for a good while the play <b>crackles</b> with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of elastic materials to external changing conditions can proceed through small and discrete releases of stress, {{rather than a}} continuous and smooth deformation as described by the classical elasticity theory. In a macroscopic elastic body, {{the sum of all}} those small <b>crackling</b> events can create a detectable displacement noise (<b>crackling</b> noise). In this paper we consider the case of the steel cantilevers used in the seismic isolation systems of ground based gravitational wave detectors, to provide the vertical isolation needed to reach the detector target sensitivity.

Understanding this source of noise is extremely important, especially considering its intrinsic nonlinear nature. Since a detailed microscopical model of <b>crackling</b> noise in polycrystalline steel is not available at the moment, we suggest a phenomenological microscopical model, and the focus of this paper is on how <b>crackling</b> noise scales with the size and geometry of the cantilevers.
