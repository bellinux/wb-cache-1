40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to motivate, develop, and apply a new typology of U. <b>S.</b> <b>farm</b> households. Household economic theory serves {{as the foundation for}} this typology. Using the 2003 Agricultural Resource Management Survey, cluster analysis identifies six mutually exclusive groups of U. <b>S.</b> <b>farm</b> households. ^ The six mutually exclusive groups are: Single Income Ruralpolitan, Double Income Ruralpolitan, Active Seniors, Farm Operator with Spouse Working Off Farm, Traditional Farms, and Commercial Farms. Single and Double Income Ruralpolitan operators primarily work off the farm. Spouses also work off the farm for Double Income Ruralpolitans. Operators in the Active Seniors group are the oldest among all groups and they still work on the farm. The next group, Farm Operator with Spouse Working Off Farm, has the operator working on the farm and spouse working off the farm. Both operator and spouse work on the farm for Traditional Farms. Commercial Farms has the largest value of farm assets with the operator working on the farm. These six groups comprise the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Farm</b> Household Typology. ^ Descriptive statistics, pairwise t-tests, a stability index, and a discriminant function show that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Farm</b> Household Typology is unique and identifiable. It is the contention of this dissertation that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Farm</b> Household Typology allows for a richer discussion of U. <b>S.</b> <b>farm</b> policy. In particular, the impacts of government program payments on the farm labor and savings decisions of U. <b>S.</b> <b>farm</b> households. ^ Regression results show that decoupled government payments increase farm labor in a U. <b>S.</b> <b>farm</b> household, the largest increase being in Ruralpolitan farm households. It is also found that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Farm</b> Household Typology better explains the farm labor decision relative to the more common Economic Research Service (ERS) Farm Typology. ^ The saving regression results show that agricultural subsidies do not impact the savings decision; however, the results show that farm households who allocate more resources to the farm have an increase in total savings. This result supports the strong precautionary saving motives of farm households given the uncertainty of farm income. Finally, the savings decision is better explained by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Farm</b> Household Typology relative to the ERS Farm Typology. ...|$|R

Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services offer children a means of developing their reading skills through the provision of books and other resources. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services might be operated by public libraries, school library services or schools. A small proportion of public library authorities in the UK choose to operate specialist mobile libraries which cater for children alone. Such vehicles deliver a library service to children {{across a range of}} geographic and socioeconomic areas with the stated aims of promoting reading and a love of books, and accessing children who would not otherwise use library services. This study evaluated whether <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries (CMLs) across the UK reach those aims and examined the methods by which the aims were targeted. It was decided that the most appropriate research method was to take an inductive perspective and qualitative approach forming a constructivist methodology. The evaluation was achieved by the use of grounded theory as a general method together with ethnographic techniques, in order to observe and understand the interactions of social actors, and identify the processes used to encourage reading. Interviews with key individuals were primarily held to gain access into the field and inform the scope of the research. Participant observations were conducted on 12 of the 26 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> libraries operating in the UK and further interviews with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library (CML) operators and CML service managers were also carried out. Extensive field notes were taken, then coded and analysed by the grounded theory method in order to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> and adults perceptions of the value of a CML to their lives. A model of the influences on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reading was developed to understand the place of a CML in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> literacy. Existing published research was used initially to set the context of the study, and then as data throughout the project. Published and recognised theories about literacy development, learning, and well-being were consulted at relevant points during the research. Analytical reports of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> library services, practitioner handbooks and professional magazines were searched along with unpublished documents provided by library authorities. Issues that were raised from these sources included: the role of untrained library staff; supplying library services to the socially excluded; working with other agencies and the use of reading intervention schemes. The history, function, purpose and definition of CMLs were outlined. Five theories of event, reach, resource, process and well-being emerged from the data and examples of best practice were identified. The daily operation of a CML was modelled using those five theories to create a transferable standard against which to judge similar <b>children</b> <b>s</b> provision. It was found that <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries promote reading because of their transient nature; through the relationships of children with the staff who work on the vehicles; {{by the nature of the}} learning environment and specialist stock of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library, and because they access children who would otherwise not use any other library service...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food is protected in {{international human rights}} law, yet {{millions of people are}} suffering from malnutrition worldwide. Children and adolescents living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes are considered a vulnerable group. Malnutrition in the girl child is of particular concern since it has intergenerational consequences. Little is known about the nutritional status of adolescent girls living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, Uganda. A cross-sectional study is an important first step to identify the main nutritional challenges in order to intervene appropriately. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the nutritional status of adolescent girls in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, by evaluating anthropometric indicators, assessing body composition and investigating dietary patterns. Subjects and methods: A total of 44 girls aged 10 – 19 years living at five <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes participated in the study. A reference group consisted of 27 adolescent girls from three boarding schools in Kampala City. Height and weight were measured to assess the proportion of girls who were stunted, thin, overweight or obese. Body composition data was obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, calculation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and a 24 -hour dietary recall. Results: Adolescent girls in selected <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City suffered from stunting, overweight or obesity, and were at risk of insufficient intakes of multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Dietary diversity was low with a median score of 3 out of 9 food groups. Animal products were rarely consumed. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> home participants appeared especially at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins A, B 12, C, D, E and calcium. Median estimated intake of vitamins B 12 and D were zero. The adequacy of the diet in terms of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients varied among the different <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes, and within the various homes. At two of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes the girls consumed a more adequate diet compared to the reference group, whereas three homes consumed a less adequate diet compared to the reference group.
