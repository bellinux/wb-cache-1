40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) being widely spread in the human {{population}} is also the etiologic agent for a number of malignancies. A notable feature of tumors associated with EBV is their different incidence in various geographical regions, that, as suggested, related with mutational events in multiple loci of the EBV genome and its oncogene, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1), associated with the transforming potential of the virus. Given the multi-ethnic composition of Russian population and the diversity of geographical areas and conditions of their residence, it was relevant to examine the representatives of different geographical regions for the nature of their relationship with EBV. To solve this task the antibody response to locally circulating EBV strains, determined by indirect immunofluorescence, was studied in residents of the Central, North Caucasus and Far Eastern Federal Districts, represented by healthy individuals and patients with various head and neck tumors. The levels of antibody titers obtained were compared with the incidence rates of nasopharyngeal tumors (NPT) in population of above Districts. In order to determine possible structural modifications in LMP 1 gene of EBV strains persisting in selected geographic regions, samples of the gene have been amplified from a biological material collected by “nested” PCR and sequenced. The results obtained have shown that levels of antibody response to EBV among representatives of the regions included in the study vary significantly.  It was found that in residents of the Dagestan and the <b>Chechen</b> <b>Republics,</b> the inhabitants of the North Caucasus Federal District, the correlation between enhanced humoral response to EBV and increased incidence of NPT was detected. Since among NPT the EBV-associated form of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPCEBV) is dominated, the findings allow us to suggest that the population of these Republics have genetic predisposition to increased EBV replication and, consequently, an elevated incidence of NPCEBV. The study also showed that representatives of the regions tested are infected with EBV strains, LMP 1 variants of which such as B 95. 8, China 1, Med+, Med– and NC, are known in the literature. However, LMP 1 variant, specifically associated with NPCEBV, has not been identified. This study showed for the first time the genetic heterogeneity of EBV strains circulating among population of different geographical regions of the country, and the existence of correlation between antibody response to EBV and the incidence of nasopharyngeal tumors, including NPCEBV. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The law {{and order}} {{authority}} service including military are characterized with ‎higher physical exercises and psychoemotional stress that result in forming specific functioning of ‎regulation system in organism. Endocrine system (hypothalamus – hypophysis – thyroid or ‎hypothalamus – hypophysis – adrenal axis etc.) provides increasing or decreasing of organism ‎stability and depends from environment and life activity. In army the processes of long-term ‎adaptation are activated. Under this circumstances the hormones (including thyroid) changes ‎biosynthetic organization processes. ‎During long-time effects of severe factors in hypothalamus – hypophysis – thyroid regulation ‎system occurred changes that reflect in other regulatory mechanisms. This changes results in ‎natural adaptation reactions in energy metabolism, total metabolism in tissues and organs. ‎In consideration of endocrine system importance, social factors in adaptation forming the ‎investigation of hormonal levels in different conditions are actual scientific and practical ‎problem. ‎Objective: The aim of our investigation is analysis of hormonal supplying by hypophysis – ‎thyroid regulation system at different law-enforcement officer groups in dependence from ‎professional stress. ‎Method: The two healthy men group (130 persons), aged 23 - 35 years that living in Archangelsk ‎‎(Russia) were investigated. The first group is Ministry of Home Affairs law-enforcement officers, ‎but second group is civilians unrelated to law-enforcement service. In according to professional ‎occupation the first group was divided in three categories. In first category were combatants that ‎send {{on a mission to}} Caucasus (<b>Chechen,</b> Ingush <b>Republics)</b> for maintenance of law order. The ‎mission duration was 3 month. The total number of missions to war conflict territories in all ‎service life was 2 - 3 times. The investigation of combatants were doubly: before 2 day from ‎mission to war conflict territory and in 2 days after returning to principal place of service ‎‎(Archangelsk city, Russia). The second category of law-enforcement officers includes law-‎enforcement school students. At last, the third group consists from policemen that maintain law ‎order in territory without war conflict and never take part in combat mission. ‎The fasting blood samples from ulnar venous were exercise at all people. The blood serum ‎thyrotrophic hormone (TSH), thyroxin (Т 4) and triiodothyronine (Т 3) were determined by ‎enzymoimmunoassay (commercial assay kit “Monobind Inc. ” USA). ‎The database was analyzed statistically by computer programme (SPSS 15. 0). The significance ‎critical level (p) in check of statistic hypothesis was taken low than 0. 05 but 0. 1 ≤p> 0. 05 ‎estimated as tendency. For estimation of universe distribution we used Shapiro-Wilk normality ‎test that revealed abnormal distribution in all groups. In connection with it comparative analysis ‎of means provided by nonparametric criterions: for dependent samples (combatants before and ‎after mission) we used Wilcoxon criterion, but for independent samples (combatant – students – ‎policemen – civilians) we used Mann-Whitney criterion. ‎Result: Analyses of our results are shown that hormonal levels at all persons were in normal ‎physiological limits. ‎Together with it, we revealed significant differences of hypophysis and thyroid gland serum ‎hormonal means between comparative groups as for dependent samples well as for independent ‎samples. ‎The maximal blood serum TSH mean were detected at before mission combatants and in law-‎enforcement school students, but minimal this ne index were at policemen and civilians. ‎The blood serum thyroid hormones (thyroxin and triiodothyronine) in different groups of law-‎enforcement officers are vary in dependence from professional stress. At law-enforcement school ‎students and before mission combatants a Т 4 were minimal in comparison with policemen and ‎after mission combatants. In this time as to Т 3 were revealed counterpositions that’s law-‎enforcement school students and before mission combatants have maximal levels but policemen ‎and after mission combatants – minimal levels. ‎Conclusion: The revealed differences of endocrine system indexes in law-enforcement officer ‎group with intense load are probable adaptive reactions to extreme professional factors. This one ‎provides optimal physiological adjustments to military stress etc. ...|$|R
