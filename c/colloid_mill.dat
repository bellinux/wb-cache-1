30|$|Mechanical {{grinding}} (milling) is {{used for}} reducing the crystallinity of cellulose. It mostly includes chipping, grinding, and/or milling techniques. Chipping can reduce the biomass size to 10 – 30  mm only while grinding and milling can reduce the particle size up to 0.2  mm. However, studies found that further reduction of biomass particle below 0.4  mm has no significant effect on rate and yield of hydrolysis (Chang et al. 1997). Chipping reduces the heat and mass transfer limitations while grinding and milling effectively reduce the particle size and cellulose crystallinity due to the shear forces generated during milling. The type and duration of milling and also the kind of biomass determine the increase in specific surface area, final degree of polymerization, and the net reduction in cellulose crystallinity. Different milling methods viz. two-roll <b>milling,</b> hammer <b>milling,</b> <b>colloid</b> <b>milling,</b> and vibratory milling are used to improve the digestibility of the lignocellulosic materials (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2008). Compared to ordinary milling process, vibratory ball milling {{is found to be}} more effective in reducing cellulose crystallinity and improving the digestibility of spruce and aspen chips. Also, wet disk milling has been a popular mechanical pretreatment because of its low energy consumption. Disk milling enhances cellulose hydrolysis by producing fibers and is more effective as compared to hammer milling which produces finer bundles (Zhua et al. 2009). Hideno et al. (2009) compared the effect of wet disk milling and conventional ball milling pretreatment method over rice straw. The optimal conditions obtained were 60  min of milling in case of dry ball milling while 10 repeated milling operations were required in case of wet disk milling. Maximum glucose (89.4 %) and xylose (54.3 %) were obtained with conventional ball milling method as compared to 78.5 % glucose and 41.5 % xylose with wet disk milling method. However, wet disk milling had lower energy requirement, high effectiveness for enzymatic hydrolysis, and did not produce inhibitors. Lin et al. (2010) found wet milling better than dry milling for the pretreatment of corn stover. The optimum parameters for milling were particle size 0.5  mm, solid/liquid ratio of 1 : 10, 20 number of steel balls of 10  mm dia each, ball speed of 350  rpm/min grounded for 30  min. Better results were obtained when milling was combined with alkaline pretreatment method. As compared to wet milling process, alkaline milling treatment increased the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of corn stover by 110 %. Sant Ana da Silva et al. (2010) performed a comparative analysis on effects of ball milling and wet disk milling on treating sugarcane bagasse and straw and found ball milling better pretreatment method than wet disk milling in terms of glucose and xylose hydrolysis yields. Ball milling-treated bagasse and straw produced 78.7 and 72.1 and 77.6 and 56.8 %, glucose and xylose, respectively. Kim et al. (2013) compared three different milling methods i.e., ball, attrition, and planetary milling. Attrition and planetary mills were found more effective in reducing the size of biomass as compared to ball milling. Planetary mill produced highest amount of glucose and galactose than other milling methods tested. It is to be noted that all the mill pretreatment methods do not produce any toxic compounds like hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde (HMF) and levulinic acid. This makes milling pretreatment a good choice of preliminary pretreatment method {{for a wide variety of}} lignocellulosic feed stocks. In another study, oil palm frond fiber when pretreated through ball mill produced glucose and xylose yields of 87 and 81.6 %, respectively, while empty fruit bunch produced glucose and xylose yields of 70 and 82.3 %, respectively (Zakaria et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Emulsions are dispersions of one {{liquid in}} another that are {{commonly}} used in various products, and methods such as high-pressure homogenisers and <b>colloid</b> <b>mills</b> are used to form emulsions. The size and size distribution of emulsion droplets are important for the final product properties and thus need to be controlled. Rapid coalescence of droplets during emulsification increases droplet size and widens the size distribution, and therefore needs to be prevented. To increase stability of emulsions, emulsifiers are added to adsorb at the oil-water interface before droplets collide. The time allowed for emulsifier adsorption is typically {{in the range of}} sub-milliseconds to seconds and to optimise emulsification processes, emulsifier adsorption and coalescence stability need to be measured in this time-scale, for which the microfluidic methods described in this thesis were developed. Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing literature on cross-flow microfluidic emulsification. The effects of various parameters such as microfluidic design, shear forces, and interfacial tension forces on droplet formation and the resulting droplet size are discussed, as well as the use of microfluidics to produce food-grade emulsions. Based on this evaluation, the methods to elucidate interfacial tension and coalescence stability are chosen, and these are presented in the next chapters. To measure emulsifier adsorption in the sub-millisecond time-scale, a tensiometric method was developed using a cross-flow microfluidic Y-junction, which is described  in Chapter 3. This method is based on the relation between droplet size and interfacial tension at the moment of droplet formation, which {{is referred to as the}} acting interfacial tension. The acting interfacial tension of a system with hexadecane as the dispersed phase and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS, a model surfactant) solutions as the continuous phase was successfully measured for droplet formation times ranging from 0. 4 to 9. 4 milliseconds and with high expansion rates (100 - 2000 s- 1). Comparison of these results with data from a drop tensiometer (a conventional, static, and supra-second time-scale method) indicates that mass transport in the microfluidic Y-junction is fast and probably not limited by diffusion. Emulsifier mass transport conditions were further investigated in Chapter 4. The continuous phase viscosity and velocity were systematically varied and the effect on the acting interfacial tension in presence of water-soluble SDS was measured. We found that the acting interfacial tension was independent of the continuous phase viscosity, but was inversely dependent on continuous phase velocity. Both aspects led us to conclude that convective emulsifier transport in the continuous phase determines the acting interfacial tension in the Y-junction. When using oil-soluble surfactant Span 20 (dissolved in hexadecane), the acting interfacial tension also decreased with increasing continuous phase velocity, and we therefore concluded that convection also dominated mass transport of emulsifiers dissolved in the to-be-dispersed phase. The Y-junction method was used in Chapter 5 to elucidate the effect of the dispersed phase viscosity on adsorption of the food-grade emulsifiers Tween 20 (dissolved in the continuous water phase) and Span 20 (dissolved in the dispersed oil phase). A reduction in dispersed phase viscosity sped up adsorption of Tween 20, probably because the shorter hydrocarbon made intercalation of the hydrophobic surfactant tail at the interface easier. Dispersed phase viscosity had an even greater effect on adsorption of Span 20 because convective transport towards the interface was increased. Next to interfacial tension, also coalescence can be measured with microfluidics and a microfluidic collision channel was used in Chapter 6 to measure emulsion coalescence stability shortly after droplet formation under flow. Coalescence of emulsions stabilised with proteins was measured at various concentrations, pH values, and adsorption times. We found that protein concentrations just below the concentration needed for monolayer surface coverage may be used effectively. β-lactoglobulin-stabilised emulsions were most stable. Emulsions stabilised with whey protein isolate (with as main component β-lactoglobulin), were less stable and when these proteins were oxidised, this led to reduced stability, therewith indicating that also the oxidative state of proteins needs to be considered in emulsion formulation. The relevance of our work for microfluidic research and industrial emulsification processes is discussed in Chapter 7. Microfluidic devices can be used to study emulsion formation and stability under conditions relevant to industrial emulsification processes; at short time-scales and with convective mass transport. In this thesis we used various food-grade ingredients, and with that application in that field has come closer. We expect that the findings on emulsions can also be applied on foams. With the discussed microfluidic devices different aspects that are important for emulsion formation can be decoupled: for example interfacial tension during droplet formation and emulsion coalescence stability. Furthermore, microfluidic methods are available to for example gain insight in emulsion interface mobility and emulsion storage stability, and we envision that all these microfluidic methods will lead to faster ingredient screening, lower ingredient usage, and more energy efficient emulsion production...|$|R

Emulsions were characterized for their microstructure, rheological properties, surface protein concentration (SPC), stability to creaming and oxidative stability under light (2000 lux/m 2). UHPH produced emulsions containing lipid droplets in the sub-micron range (100 – 200 nm) and with low protein concentrations on droplet surfaces. Droplet size (d 3. 2, µm) was increased in CH and UHPH emulsions by increasing the oil concentration. CM emulsions exhibited Newtonian flow behaviour at all oil concentrations studied; however, the rheological behaviour of CH and UHPH emulsions varied from Newtonian flow (n ≈ 1) to shear-thinning (n ˂ 1) and thixotropic behaviour in emulsions containing 50 % oil. This was confirmed by the non-significant differences in the d 4. 3 (µm) value between {{the top and bottom}} of emulsions in tubes left at room temperature for nine days and also by a low migration velocity measured with a Turbiscan LAB instrument. UHPH emulsions showed significantly lower oxidation rates during 10 days storage in comparison to CM and CH emulsions as confirmed by hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS).

The mechanical treatment to MFC was performed in a laboratory <b>colloid</b> <b>mill</b> or in a pilot high-pressure homogeniser and the pre-treated pulps as well as the produced MFCs were chemically and morphologically characterised. Additionally, the MFCs produced in the <b>colloid</b> <b>mill</b> were evaluated as strength enhancers in test sheets representing the middle ply of paperboard. From the chemical characterisation, it was concluded that the Fenton pre-treatment caused a decrease in the degree of polymerisation (DP) and an increase in both carboxyl- and carbonyl groups. The increase in carbonyl groups could not be explained by the formation of new reducing end groups due to depolymerisation which indicates that carbonyl groups are introduced along the cellulose chain. The enzymatic pre-treatment as performed in this study caused less impact on the cellulosic material, i. e. resulted in a pulp with a higher DP and a much lower amount of carbonyl- and carboxylic groups compared with the Fenton pre-treated pulps. In the subsequent mechanical treatment in a <b>colloid</b> <b>mill,</b> the Fenton pre-treated pulps were easier to process mechanically i. e. reached a higher specific surface area and a higher surface charge at a given mechanical treatment time compared to enzymatic pre-treated pulps and pulps not subjected to any pre-treatment.

By size fractionation, rheological measurements and scanning electron microscopy, it was revealed that Fenton pre-treatment resulted in MFC suspension containing a significantly higher proportion of small sized material (< 0. 2 mm). When the MFCs were evaluated as strength enhancers in test sheets produced from a furnish consisting of a spruce (Picea abies) chemithermomechanical pulp, MFC and a retention system containing cationic starch and an anionic silica sol, Fenton pre-treated MFCs increased the strength properties more than the enzymatic pre-treated MFCs.

The fractions oil of FCC slurry oil distillation with a high content of aromatics is a good swelling agent of SBS. The FCC distillation residual (FR) with high softening point can resolve the problem that penetration increased when the addition of swelling agent increased. SBS is pre-swelled by the heavier fractions from FCC slurry oil, and then it will be dispersed in the vacuum residuum (VR) by simple mechanical stirring to prepare SBS modified asphalt due to the perfect swelling effects in this work. The influences of different materials, distillation yield and ratio of FR to VR on the performance of SBS modified asphalt have been investigated. Fluorescence microscopy was applied to observe the different disperse images of SBS modified asphalt prepared by simple mechanical stirring and high speed shearing. The results indicated that the novel method can be used to prepare SBS modified asphalt with good performance and storage stability. ...|$|E

In contrast, bi-phase emulsion binders produced by either post-adding the latex to the bitumen emulsion, or by adding the latex into the emulsifier solution phase before processing, or by comilling the latex with the bitumen, water and emulsifier all resulted in a network formation of bitumen particles surrounded by a continuous polymer film. The use of emulsified binders appears {{to result in a}} more evenly distributed polymer network compared to the use of hot polymer-modified binders, and they therefore have greater potential for consistent binder cohesion strength, stone retention and therefore improved pavement performance...|$|E

Methods: The peanut was baked in the far-infrared oven, soaked with soft water containing 5 % NaHCO 3, rinsed and then cooked for 30 min, milled at 0. 05 mm spacing grinding, filtered and finished peanut slurry. Tea leaves were extracted twice by water of 90 °C. The two ingredients were combined with other supplement, refined by <b>colloid</b> <b>mill,</b> homogenized twice, followed by bottling, sealed, sterilization, cooled and other processing. In this study, the formula, stabilizers and additives by orthogonal experiments were investigated. Results: The peanut slurry and sugar {{were found to be}} major factors which affected the beverage’s quality. The formula was optimized when the content of peanut slurry, tea and sucrose reached 75 mL, 25 mL and 4 g especially in per 100 mL peanut-tea beverage. As single stabilizer, CMC-Na showed the most significant effect, and storage temperature was found to be better at room temperature than low temperature. Compared with single stabilizer, compound stabilizer was better. The optimal formula was CMC-Na 0. 4 g/L, seaweed sodium 0. 2 g/L, gelatin 0. 8 g/L. Conclusion: The peanut-tea beverage, with unique flavor and rich nutrients, was a novel type of health plant beverage which was suitable for a large variety of people, and had a promising market...|$|E
40|$|Colloid mills are {{the most}} common {{emulsification}} devices used in industry for products with high oil content. Drop breakage occurs when the emulsion is flowed through a small gap between rotor and stator under laminar shear conditions. In this paper, we have developed the first full population balance equation (PBE) model for colloid mills and used the model to better understand the relevant drop breakage mechanisms. The PBE model accounted for both drop breakage and coalescence and generated predictions of the drop size distribution after each pass of the emulsion through the <b>colloid</b> <b>mill.</b> Drops were assumed to break due to capillary instability with the distribution of drop sizes resulting from each breakage event studied in detail. A viscosity model was developed to predict the emulsion viscosity as function of the oil fraction and the high shear rates commonly used. Nonlinear optimization was used to estimate adjustable parameters in the breakage and coalescence functions to minimize the least-squares difference between predicted and measured drop size distributions for high oil-to-surfactant emulsions. We concluded that experimentally observed drop volume distributions could not be predicted with daughter drop distribution functions reported in the literature. Improved predictions were obtained using a new bimodal distribution function which captured drop breakage into multiple, nearly uniform daughter drops with a large number of small satellite drops. We also investigated model extensibility for changes in the oil fraction, emulsion flow rate and rotor speed...|$|E
40|$|Due to poor {{solubility}} in lipids, many of bioactive components (Nutraceutical materials) show less bioactivity than optimal {{state in}} water solution. Phytosomes improve absorption and bioavailability of biomaterials. Liposomes, spherical shaped nanocarriers, {{were discovered in}} the 1960 s by bangham. Due to their composition, variability and structural properties, liposomes and phytosomes are extremely versatile, leading to {{a large number of}} applications including pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industrial fields. They are advanced forms of herbal formulations containing the bioactive phytoconstituents of herb extracts such as flavonoids, glycosides and terpenoids, which have good ability to transit from a hydrophilic environment into the lipid friendly environment of the outer cell membrane. They have better bioavailability and actions than the conventional herbal extracts containing dosage. Phytosome technology has increasing effect on the bioavailability of herbal extracts including ginkgo biloba, grape seed, green tea, milk thistle, ginseng, etc., and can be developed for various therapeutic uses or dietary supplements. Liposomes are composed of bilayer membranes, which are made of lipid molecules. They form when phospholipids are dispersed in aqueous media and exposed to high shear rates by using micro-fluidization or <b>colloid</b> <b>mill.</b> The mechanism for formation of liposomes is mainly the hydrophilic–hydrophobic interactions between phospholipids and water molecules. Here, we attempt to review the features of phytosomes and liposomes as well as their preparation methods and capacity in food and drug applications. Generally, it is believed that phytosomes and liposomes are suitable delivery systems for nutraceuticals, and can be widely used in food industry...|$|E
40|$|Emulsions {{are widely}} {{encountered}} in the food and cosmetic industry. The first food we consume is an emulsion, namely breast milk. Other common emulsions are mayonnaise, dressings, skin creams and lotions. Equipment often used {{for the production of}} oil-in-water emulsions in the food industry consists of a stirred vessel in combination with a <b>colloid</b> <b>mill</b> and a circulation pipe. Within this set-up there are two main variations: i) Configuration I where the <b>colloid</b> <b>mill</b> acts like a shearing device {{and at the same time}} as a pump. This configuration is used in the majority of the production facilities, and ii) Configuration II where the shearing and pumping action are not coupled. The operation procedure for obtaining a certain predefined emulsion quality is often established based on experience (best practice). This is most probably time-consuming (e. g. large experimental efforts for new developed products) and it is also unclear if the process is operated at its optimum (e. g. in minimum time). An other drawback is that there is no feedback during the production process. Hence, it is not possible to deal with disturbances acting on the process. A possible consequence is that, at the end of the production process, the product quality specifications are not met and the product has to be classified as off-spec. In order to be able to enlarge the efficiency of the production processes and to shorten the time to market of new products - and therewith create an advantage over competition - it is necessary to overcome these limitations of the current operation procedure. In the work reported a first step is set into this direction. A model describing the droplet size distribution (DSD) and the emulsion viscosity as function of the time was developed and several off-line optimization studies were performed. The model comprises several fit parameters and experiments were performed in order to estimate the values of these parameters. A number of additional experiments were performed to compare the simulated results with the measurements (model validation). The results of the parameter estimation and the model validation show that the simulated results are qualitatively in good agreement with the measurement data. Given the overall performance of the model it is expected that the model quality is sufficient to render practical relevant optimization results. Although the optimization studies have been performed for a model emulsion, small scale equipment and are not yet experimentally validated, the results of this work strongly suggest that it is indeed possible to minimize the production times and to shorten the product development times for new products. This overall conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) The optimization results show that it is beneficial to produce emulsions with Configuration II: - Configuration II allows the production of emulsions with a bi-modal DSD. No operation procedure was found for the production of such an emulsion in Configuration I. - The production of emulsions in Configuration II is always at least as fast as in Configuration I. 2) The followed approach allows to calculate: * If an emulsion with a certain, predefined, DSD and emulsion viscosity can be produced. * How the process should be controlled in order to produce such an emulsion. * How the process should be controlled to produce this emulsion in minimal time. 3) The optimization results show that it is possible to produce emulsions with: * A bi-modal DSD. * Less oil while maintaining a similar DSD and value of the emulsion viscosity evaluated at a shear rate of 10 1 /s by adapting only the operation procedure. Hence, the addition of extra stabilizers is not considered. This offers possibilities for the production of a broader range of emulsion products and could direct product development in a new direction. Based on this, it is worthwhile and therefore recommended to expand this research work in the direction of industrial emulsions. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|E
40|$|Oil-in-water {{emulsions}} are ubiquitous {{dispersed phase}} systems with diverse applications in consumer products, processed foods, and the pharmaceutical industry. Emulsion formulation variables and process operating conditions both impact the drop size distribution, a key property that influences emulsion rheology, stability, texture, and appearance. A typical emulsified product requires the drop size distribution {{to be maintained}} within acceptable limits. Due {{to a lack of}} quantitative understanding, emulsified products are currently manufactured by combining a broad knowledge of previous product formulations with empirical scientific experimentation. An alternative to trial-and-error experimentation is to utilize a suitable mathematical model to predict the drop size distribution. The population balance equation (PBE) modeling framework particularly is well suited for this problem as size distribution dynamics can be captured using mechanistic functions for drop breakage and coalescence phenomena which occur during emulsification. This thesis presents a PBE modeling framework for high intensity emulsification processes including high pressure homogenizers and colloid mills. It is demonstrated that by incorporating coalescence phenomenon into PBE model with only breakage functions significantly improves model predictions of emulsion drop size distributions at high oil-to-surfactant ratios. To make the model more realistic, the effect of surface coverage of surfactant molecules is added to the coalescence function which improves the extensibility of the model over different surfactant types. To extend model predictability over a large range of surfactant and oil concentrations, a new drop breakage model is formulated; and to capture the change in emulsion viscosity due to changes in oil and surfactant concentrations, the PBE model is coupled with an experimentally fitted emulsion viscosity model. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that use of a dynamic surface coverage model over an equilibrium model, improves the predictions of drop size distribution in both “surfactant rich” and “surfactant limited” regimes. In this thesis, the PBE model is also utilized to optimally achieve target emulsion drop size distributions by controlling the number of homogenization passes and the pressure of each pass. The model predictions are successfully validated by performing homogenization experiments using the optimal formulation and homogenization variables. Apart from developing models for the high pressure homogenization, this thesis presents a new model for emulsification in <b>colloid</b> <b>mill</b> obtained by formulating new mechanistic breakage frequency and daughter drop distribution functions. The predictions of the new model are significantly better than predictions obtained using models with conventional daughter drop distribution functions...|$|E
40|$|The hen’s egg is {{a source}} of new life. Therefore, it {{contains}} many biologically active compounds. In addition to being a very nutritious food and also commonly used in the food industry due to its many techno-functional properties, the egg can serve as a source of compounds used as nutra-, pharmaand cosmeceuticals. One such interesting compound is ovomucin, an egg white protein responsible for the gel-like properties of thick egg white. Previous studies have indicated that ovomucin and ovomucin-derived peptides have several different bioactive properties. The objectives of the present study were to develop isolation methods for ovomucin, to characterize the structure of ovomucin, to compare various egg fractions as sources of ovomucin, to study the effects of various dissolving methods for ovomucin, and to investigate the bioactive properties of ovomucin and ovomucin-derived peptides. A simple and rapid method for crude ovomucin separation was developed. By using this method crude ovomucin was isolated within hours, compared to the 1 - 2 days (including a dialysis step) needed when using several other methods. Structural characterization revealed that ovomucin is composed of two subunits, α- and β-ovomucin, as egg white protein formerly called α 1 -ovomucin seemed to be ovostatin. However, it might be possible that ovostatin is associated within β- and α-ovomucin. This interaction could even have some effect on the physical nature of various egg white layers. Although filtration by-product fraction was a very prominent source of both crude and β-ovomucin, process development has reduced its amount so significantly that it has no practical meaning anymore. Thus, the commercial liquid egg white is probably the best option, especially if it generally contains amounts of β-ovomucin as high as were found in these studies. Crude ovomucin was dissolved both by using physical and enzymic methods. Although sonication was the most effective physical method for ovomucin solubilisation, colloid milling seemed to be a very promising alternative. A milk-like, smooth and opaque crude ovomucin suspension was attained by using a <b>colloid</b> <b>mill.</b> The dissolved ovomucin fractions were further tested for bioactive properties, and it was found that three dissolving methods tested produced moderate antiviral activity against Newcastle disease virus, namely colloid milling, enzymatic hydrolysis and a combination of sonicaton and enzymatic hydrolysis. Moreover, trypsin-digested crude ovomucin was found to have moderate antiviral activity against avian influenza virus: both subtype H 5 and H 7...|$|E
30|$|The {{preservation}} of the wellbore stability has fundamental importance during oil and gas well drilling. About 75  % of the side walls {{of oil and gas}} wellbores consist of shale and mud rocks, which are responsible for 90  % of the wellbore instability problems (Corrêa and Nascimento 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Huang et al. 2007). Several types of shales with a significant amount of clay minerals are very reactive once they come into contact with water, and they can cause serious wellbore instability during drilling, like hole shrinkage and hole sloughing and caving (Hisham 2006; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2013 a, b). Wellbore stability has been studied for a long time using mainly two quite different approaches. Some authors consider the problem exclusively {{from the point of view}} of rock mechanics and others from the point of view of chemical interactions between shales and fluids (Wu et al. 1993; Corrêa and Nascimento 2005). Based on the second approach, a variety of water-based drilling fluids and non-aqueous fluids have been applied; meanwhile, many types of wellbore stabilizers have been developed. These wellbore stabilizers have been classified into several groups, including inorganic salts, formate, polymers with special shale affinity, asphalts, sugars and sugar derivatives, glycerol, polyalcohol, and silicates (Van Oort 2003; Guo et al. 2006; Khodja et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2011; Zhong et al. 2011). Among of them, asphalts as one type of cheap and effective stabilizer can improve wellbore stabilization mainly through plugging or sealing, and they have been divided into four varieties according to modification methods: natural asphalt (no modification, mined from deposit), oxidized asphalt (oxidation by air blown to heighten softening point), sulfonated bitumen (changed into asphalt sulfonate partly to enhance water solubility), and emulsified asphalt (oil in water emulsion to improve dispersion in the drilling fluid and adsorption on the rock surface) (Sharma and Wunderlich 1987; Wang et al. 2005). All types of emulsified asphalts are mostly produced by shearing and thinning a mixture of asphalt, water, and emulsifier using an emulsion machine or a <b>colloid</b> <b>mill.</b> Ionic surfactants are often used as emulsifier, so the emulsified asphalt droplets are mostly charged and possess an electric double layer structure, according to the Stern model (Xie et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2014). Cationic emulsified asphalts have taken the place of anionic ones in drilling fluids to promote inhibition and adsorption (Shi et al. 2003; Wang and Xia 2006). In this paper, a novel cationic emulsified asphalt was investigated to overcome serious instability problems during drilling hydratable shale formations. It had good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, compatibility, sealing property, and flexible adaptability.|$|E
