Based on the resource-based view (RBV) and process level analysis, this study investigates how KM infrastructure influences market interrelationship performance through innovative business processes. The study collected a sample of 126 hospitals in the Taiwanese healthcare industry. The results suggest that technological capability and <b>cultural</b> <b>capability</b> positively affect market interrelationships via innovative business processes. <b>Cultural</b> <b>capability</b> is associated with market interrelationship performance whereas structural capability is unrelated to innovative business processes. The findings advance understanding {{of the influence of}} KM infrastructure on market interrelationship performance as well as provide managerial insights on the influence of innovative business processes on market interrelationships performance.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the first {{empirical}} study of manufacturing methods in the Mauritius Export Processing Zone (MEPZ). The objective of the research was to explore the necessity for and applica-bility of innovative production methods in MEPZ enterprises. Results from the study show that most firms operate an assembly-line method of production, with only a marginal few having {{an appreciation of the}} appropriateness of their current methods or of other methods. However, it emerged that most responding Chief Executives are willing to consider a transition from traditional methods to higher-productivity improvement systems, such as group-based manufacturing. This degree of readiness was not echoed in the extent of Structural and <b>Cultural</b> <b>Capability</b> of firms to implement alternative methods of production. Only an average score was noted on such factors as the Dependability, Self-motivation, and Leadership qualities of the Mauritian workforce, and relatively tepid responses were given regarding firms ability to manage labour turnover, corporate culture, worker involvement and continuous improvement programmes. In conclusion, a possible gap in management was identified, between the high level of readiness for change in top managers, and the poor degree of <b>cultural</b> <b>capability</b> for change in the Mauritian workforce...|$|E
40|$|Background: Midwives have {{a central}} role in closing the gap in health inequalities between Australias’ First Peoples and other childbearing women. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Curriculum Framework (The Framework) {{identifies}} five core cultural capabilities (respect, communication, safety and quality, reflection and advocacy) to foster culturally safe health care. Aim: To use a decolonising, First Peoples-led approach to develop and validate a tool to measure the development students’ cultural capabilities. Method: A pre- post intervention design was used. Development of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Capability</b> Measurement Tool followed a staged process which centred on First Peoples’ knowledges. This process included: item generation, expert review; a pilot, test-retest; and psychometric testing (reliability, factor analysis and construct validity). All third year midwifery students (n = 49) enrolled in a discrete First Peoples health course were invited to complete the survey pre and post course. Findings: A response rate of 77. 5 % (n = 38 / 49) pre-course and 30. 6 % (15 / 49) at post-course was achieved. The tool demonstrated good internal reliability (Cronbach alpha =. 89 –. 91). Principal component analysis with varimax rotation produced a five-factor solution. A paired samples t-test revealed a significant increase from pre-course (mean 93. 13, SD 11. 84) to post-course scores (mean = 100. 53, SD 7. 54) (t (14) = 2. 79, p =. 014). Conclusion: A First Peoples approach was criticalto tool development and conceptual validity. The 22 item <b>Cultural</b> <b>Capability</b> measurement Tool reflected the core cultural capabilities of The Framework. The draft tool appears suitable for use with midwifery students.

Laboratory experimental studies reveal that many fishes acquire dietary, food site and mating preferences, predator recognition and avoidance behaviour, and learn pathways, through copying 1 other fishes. Concentrating on foraging behaviour, we will present the findings of laboratory experiments that reveal social learning, behavioural innovation, the diffusion of novel behaviour through populations and traditional use of food sites. Further studies reveal surprisingly complex social learning strategies deployed by sticklebacks.

A further analytic is the redefinition of the aesthetic with respect to technology, especially aeronautical, in Modern Movement discourse.

A second often-overlooked barrier is that thinking about global culture has been too heavily influenced by a model that conceptualizes global culture along a linear continuum ranging from weak to strong culture.

40|$|Objective: Lean {{interventions}} aim {{to improve}} quality of healthcare by reducing waste and facilitate flow in work processes. There is conflicting {{evidence on the}} outcomes of lean thinking, with quantitative and qualitative studies often contradicting each other. We suggest that reviewing the literature within the approach of a new contextual framework can deepen our understanding of lean as a quality-improvement method. This article theorises the concept of context by establishing a two-dimensional conceptual framework acknowledging lean as complex social interventions, deployed in different organisational dimensions and domains. The specific aim {{of the study was}} to identify factors facilitating intended outcomes from lean interventions, and to understand when and how different facilitators contribute. Design: A two-dimensional conceptual framework was developed by combining Shortell's Dimensions of capability with Walshes’ Domains of an intervention. We then conducted a systematic review of lean review articles concerning hospitals, published in the period 2000 – 2012. The identified lean facilitators were categorised according to the intervention domains and dimensions of capability provided by the framework. Results: We provide a framework emphasising context by relating facilitators to domains and dimensions of capability. 23 factors enabling a successful lean intervention in hospitals were identified in the systematic review, where management and a supportive culture, training, accurate data, physicians and team involvement were most frequent. Conclusions: In the absence of evidence, the two-dimensional framework, incorporating the context, may prove useful for future research on variation in outcomes from lean interventions. Findings from the review suggest that characteristics and local application of lean, in addition to strategic and <b>cultural</b> <b>capability,</b> should be given further attention in healthcare quality improvement...|$|E

This report in detail considers the approach and results in {{an evaluation of the}} level of merger integration capability at the company Biotage. The main purpose with the thesis was to establish a framework that can be applied when assessing a company’s merger integration capability, based on collaborative research between scientific literature and the viewpoints and knowledge of experienced experts in the field. Further, the purpose was to utilize the framework in an assessment of the merger integration capability at Biotage, based on the company’s experience and performance from previous merger integration situations. Derived from the assessment key areas for improvement were identified and prioritized, and actions suggested to be taken by Biotage to increase their capabilities. As a guideline for the methodology and case study, focus lies upon Saunders (2002) research strategy and Yin´s (2003) strategy in case studies. The empirical information that was used was mainly the data that was received through interviews. The method for analysis was built upon the theory diagram where every property was given a measurable value depending on the answers that were extracted from the data collection. The properties were calculated upwards through the diagram until a value of the merger integration capability at Biotage was received. The result was that the level of merger integration capability at Biotage was 66 % according to the developed framework. On the basis of the evaluation it was possible to conclude that the area that has the highest level of merger integration capability is Organizational capability, followed by IT capability. The area which was given the lowest score and thus is in need of the greatest improvements was the <b>Cultural</b> <b>capability.</b> This was primarily because the company had no cultural due diligence process for facilitating the integration of the cultures...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand’s {{increasingly}} heterogeneous population places manifold {{demands on}} the education sector to educate and integrate children who do not speak English. Children of migrant background attending early childhood settings are assumed to benefit in English language obtainment from attending early years educational facilities, but does the mere placement in such settings achieve the desired outcome? Limited research exists into how minority language children acquire English whilst attending preschool settings, how this impacts on their first language, or on how teachers support their second language development. There is little insight into what motivates teachers in their interactions and decision-making, how they adjust teaching content, and whether they engage in language-specific teaching activities at all. To address this gap, this study considers questions regarding the relationship between early childhood teachers’ knowledge of second language acquisition {{and the type of}} support they report implementing. I investigate educators’ views and reported practices, as well as the influence of professional training, institutional policies, and philosophies. This research used a qualitative perspective and was benchmarked against comparative reflections of my own teaching experience. The inductive methodology involved semi-structured interviews of early childhood practitioners, covering a selection of educational settings in the Wellington region that practise distinct philosophies. Results show that teachers rely on their centres’ philosophies and socio-cultural practices as per Te Whāriki - the New Zealand curriculum - in their work with minority language children. The consensus was that early childhood education is to prepare language foundations through emotional confidence and <b>cultural</b> <b>capability,</b> not to set iii academic standards, and children’s perceived natural ability to learn by osmosis is accorded much credence. These findings suggest that teachers’ knowledge regarding complex language and cognitive processes could be significantly improved. Furthermore, support for te reo Māori and Pasifika first languages in New Zealand notwithstanding, practices tend to facilitate institutionalized monolingualism. Future research in all migrant language learning would add to the knowledge base about second language acquisition in New Zealand and the role of early childhood education in this dynamic. As well, there is scope for a discussion on language inequities and the possibilities of a plurilingual society...|$|E
40|$|The most perplexing {{question}} of business organizations today {{is how to}} get and sustain competitive advantage. The dependable answer to this question, as Peter Drucker stated, is defining a business in terms of customer values and designing innovation activities to create those values. Hence, market orientation and innovation are the two complementary pillars of success. This research, therefore, develops a conceptual model to examine how 1) internal factors influence the development of market orientation and innovation; and 2) market orientation and innovation impact on the competitiveness of manufacturing businesses in Ethiopia, a least developed country in sub-Sahara Africa. Market and innovation orientations have been broadly recognized as performance antecedents in the strategic management literature. The performance impact of these orientations is extensively examined in the developed countries’ business environments. Studies also indicate that market and innovation orientations affect performance in situations where the competitive intensity is high. However, literature lacks adequate empirical evidence to determine whether market and innovation orientations have positive impact on performance in the least developed countries’ economies; it is also deficient with the required literature to confirm whether {{the impact of these}} orientations on performance is minimal in the least economically developed environment where competitive intensity is low. The other shortcoming in the strategic orientation literature is the heterogeneity in defining and measuring market orientation constructs. Market orientation is defined from behavioral, <b>cultural,</b> <b>capability,</b> and integrationist perspectives. Despite the contention on what the integrationist perspective suggests, very limited number of studies applies such comprehensive conceptualization. The study, therefore, is designed to fill these voids in the literature by designing a comprehensive model and testing it in the least developed context. From practical point of view, following the current encouraging economic growth of Ethiopia, changes have been observed on the competitiveness of the business environment. In response to the growing competitiveness of the business environment, organizations should adopt relevant orientations and practices; i. e., practices recognized as appropriate to the western environment. Hence, testing the validity of the sound managerial orientations and practices, based on scientifically accepted procedure in the least developed context, is mandatory before making use of them. The research is conceptually rooted in the argument of resource based view and its extension- the dynamic capability. Based on this, the study a) models strategic orientations and managerial practices as capabilities that affect competitive advantage of firms; b) reviews literature on market orientation, innovation, marketing capabilities, organizational culture, and managerial practices to theoretically validate the proposed relationships in the conceptual model; and c) develops eight main hypotheses for empirical verifications. The investigation pursues positivist paradigm. It applies quantitative research design where the study tests the proposed relationships quantitatively by analyzing 204 usable responses (n= 204) of the selected manufacturing companies. The findings show that 1) market orientation and innovation have positive and significant effect on competitiveness of the manufacturing companies in Ethiopia; 2) the level of market orientation and its impact on competitiveness is influenced by sound employee training program, market based reward system, effective marketing program, and organizational culture that emphasize change, entrepreneurship, and achievement orientation; 3) the level of innovation and its impact on competitiveness is influenced by effective marketing program and organizational culture that emphasize change (i. e., adhocracy culture) and control over the change process (i. e., the hierarchy culture); 4) the effect of market orientation and innovation on competitiveness is stronger for the younger and larger organizations when compared to the older and smaller ones, respectively. Based on these findings, the study suggests that managers, beyond ensuring the smooth running of day-to-day operations, should focus on marketplace changes by adopting and developing relevant orientations (i. e., market and innovation orientations) via improving the culture, structure, and other relevant capabilities.

In this paper, they analyze important examples of discursive spaces - public meetings in Indian village democracies (gram sabhas), where villagers make important decisions about budgetary allocations for village development and the selection of beneficiaries for anti-poverty programs. They examine 290 transcripts of gram sabhas from South India to demonstrate how they create a culture of civic/political engagement among poor people, and how definitions of poverty and beneficiary-selection criteria are understood and interrogated within them. Through this examination, they highlight the process by which gram sabhas facilitate the acquisition of crucial <b>cultural</b> <b>capabilities</b> such as discursive skills and civic agency by poor and disadvantaged groups. They illustrate how the poor and socially marginalized deploy these discursive skills in a resource-scarce and socially stratified environment in making material and non-material demands in their search for dignity.

40|$|When {{within a}} {{national}} narrative, “history repeats itself,” what is obsessively re-enacted? In Andrei Platonov’s novel *Chevengur* (written 1927 - 1928 but not published {{in its entirety}} in Russia until 1988), haunting the characters’ imaginings of a socialist future is a specter with two faces: the nomadic horseman of the steppe who is both their dream of liberty and their greatest terror. The specter of the mounted nomad, the perpetually mobile horseman, haunts the Russian national narrative as it erupts in the October revolution, civil war, and the struggle for socialism. It also haunts the Soviet narrative as it strives to incorporate Central Asian peoples into {{the dream of a}} new plenitude, as in *Soul* – *Dzhan* (written in 1935, but not published in an unbowdlerized Russian edition until 1999). In this fable about both “‘a soul in search of happiness,’” as Platonov himself described it, and a people, the wandering Dzhan, whose souls are their only possession, Stalin’s Sovietization of Central Asia offers hope. The word *dzhan* – “‘soul, or dear life’” [...] is a Persian word in the Turkic languages of Central Asia and modern Turkish. These wandering souls are linguistically and materially a difference uneasily incorporated within the Soviet, just as the horsemen of “black Turan” who raid the gardens of the fat men of the lowlands are for a time incorporated into that land of plenty, both destroying and dwelling there. Platonov’s fiction resists the property-owning settler imaginary, substituting for more settled structures of feeling a melancholia (longing, desire, affect of attraction, not possession) – in Russian, *toska*, similar to the Turkish *hüzün* – that asks to be shared and revelled in, and can only be relieved, in so far as that might be desirable, by perambulating movement and friendship. The sharing of toska (or hüzün), especially in a roving existence, fills the space vacated by property relations. “Socialism as anti-depressant” is Jonathan Flatley’s diagnosis of what Platonov proposes in *Chevengur*. This structure of feeling could be understood as a Eurasian alternative to Western capitalist imaginings of space, place, subjectivity, and affect, in which settler ideology has proved so potent a force. A Eurasian perspective reveals something striking about other forms of settler ideology. The emphasis on settlement as a pause in nomadic movement, as a form of sedentarization, exposes how often settlers by definition might see themselves as having a tenuous entitlement to their property, or even a lack of entitlement, however powerful the ideology of settler-entitlement might be. In other contexts, where settlement is meant to be synonymous with possession of the land, if necessary achieved by elimination and expropriation of the indigenous population, settlers [...] as settlers [...] no matter how fiercely they might fight to claim or retain their land, may discover that no settlement is assured, no land guaranteed. Re-enactment for Marx appears as an irresistible tendency, a force of history operating like a force of nature. Revolutionary moments present particular problems of imagination and representation. When social actors attempt to break with the past and bring into being something socially new, an irresistible recourse to the past shadows their every move. We might call this process inadvertent re-enactment. Re-enactments undertaken to investigative the past, on the other hand, with the aim of gaining new historical insights, represent a deliberate endeavor to bring a vanished past back into being. Re-enactment in this sense, as a historically investigative practice and a narrative strategy, approaches – moves toward, seeks to re-inhabit – the past by means of immersion in an artificially constructed, however “faithful,” re-creation in the present. Katie King calls the knowledge produced by such re-enactments “pastpresents. ” Re-enactments as pastpresents serve a potentially redemptive agenda, presupposing that sympathetic mimesis on the part of re-enactors might recover significant traces of what has otherwise been lost or reveal something previously neglected or overlooked. Such re-enactments draw upon what Benjamin saw as a receding <b>cultural</b> <b>capability,</b> the mimetic faculty. Where capital and commodities presuppose universal equivalence – identity – in the interests of limitless exchangeability, re-enactment harks back to an older economy of sympathy and perceived similarity. Re-enactment, then, in its playing out of similarities, might tend toward oppositionality; it will have a tendency to interrupt and defamiliarize things as they are. Like the Muskovite cavalryman and his horse, re-enactor and re-enacted become bound by an ethic of mutuality in adversity. This bond is not one of slavish servitude, but rather a willing being-of-service to another, a dignified relation between non-identical but similar beings bound together by affective attachment. Such imagined affinities {{lie at the heart of}} re-enactment. What Platonov reveals so compellingly is how the combination of freedom of movement, countering ideologies of settlement and colonization, and freedom of service, countering self-interest and identity, might exercise the mimetic faculty to good affect...|$|E

Not only do we propose to investigate B 2 B loyalty but also how this construct occurs across cultures, i. e., is B 2 B loyalty affected by culture? Preliminary research results indicate that Japanese companies will change foreign supplier more easily than Portuguese companies as Japanese society is very competitive and has higher levels of ethnocentrism. Based on preliminary interviews and a literature review we propose that masculinity, ethnocentrism and suppliers’ <b>cultural</b> interaction <b>capabilities</b> are antecedents of cross-cultural customers’ loyalty...|$|R

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{significant}} regional economic disparities, attention is turning away from traditional accounts of regional disadvantage towards the insights offered by institutional and evolutionary economics. Such accounts have highlighted the institutional, social and <b>cultural</b> <b>capabilities</b> that drive regional economic success. One aspect of this literature relates {{to the theme of}} institutional learning. In particular, a distinction has been made between incremental and radical institutional learning capabilities. Whilst incremental learning facilitates institutional adaptation to changing economic circumstances through the application of established interpretations and solutions, radical learning requires the development of an 'adaptability' capacity that reflects upon the applicability of past actions and promotes institutional innovations that break with existing understandings. Yet despite the importance attached to radical institutional learning capabilities, the internal organisational factors influencing actual learning processes - especially within the context of public sector bodies - have received little attention. This thesis explores these features through a comparative investigation of the institutional learning processes occurring within public sector based economic development organisations in Teesside, England and Cracow, Poland. The research presents the key arguments made regarding the centrality of learning to the regional rediscovery debate and examines the significance attached to the themes of institutional learning and cognition. Through reference to empirical evidence the research discusses the place specific and historically dependent nature of institutional learning processes and considers the extent to which institutional cognition, organisational memories, management systems and techniques act as barriers or stimuli to radical learning...|$|R
