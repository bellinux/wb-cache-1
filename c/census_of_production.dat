On {{the basis of the}} analysis, the paper proposes a series of adjustments which result in more consistent long-run series of labour productivity for 21 manufacturing sectors from 1980 - 2002. For purposes of international comparisons with the USA, the paper subsequently presents industry of origin unit value ratios for the benchmark year 1995. These are used to convert Chinese value added into US dollars. In 2002, value added for the statistically well-covered sectors of Chinese manufacturing was 43 per cent of US value added, against 12 per cent in 1980. The comparative analysis of labour productivity points to a long period of Chinese growth without catch up from 1980 - 1992. After 1992, there was a rapid and accelerating process of catch up.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Annual Respondents Database (ARD) is constructed from a compulsory business survey. Until 1997 it was created out <b>of</b> the Annual <b>Censuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Production</b> and Construction (ACOP and ACOC); these were combined into the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) in 1998. The ARD is a <b>census</b> <b>of</b> large businesses, and a sample of smaller ones. Smaller firms may receive a "short form". These do not require detailed breakdowns of totals. Hence for certain variables the values may be imputed from third party sources or estimated rather than returned by respondents. This dataset is created for the Economic Analysis and Satellite Accounts Division for research purposes. To create the ARD, the other surveys are converted into a single consistent format linked by the Inter-Departmental Business Register references over time. Northern Ireland data is held up to 2001. From 2002, the ABI is collected and stored separately in Northern Ireland. Special permission is required to use new NI ABI data. ABI background The ABI is the financial information {{survey conducted by the}} Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is a statutory survey conducted under the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. Organisations are obliged under this legislation to provide a response. Businesses are sampled from the ONS business register current at the time of drawing the sample: first the CSO Business Register, which ran until 1993; then the Inter-Departmental Business Register, which has run from 1994 onwards. The ONS holds firms' responses to the ABI in the Annual Respondents Database (ARD). The ABI replaced the following annual survey systems in 1998 : Annual Employment Survey (AES) Annual <b>Censuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Production</b> and Construction (ACOP/ACOC), which include the Purchases Inquiry (PI) The six annual Distribution and Services (DSI) inquiries (Annual Wholesale Inquiry; Annual Retail Inquiry; Annual Motor Trades Inquiry; Annual Catering Inquiry; Annual Property Inquiry; and Annual Service Trades Inquiry Until 1997 the data were limited to the production and construction industries surveyed by the ACOP and ACOC (construction from 1993 only). The incorporation of the DSI inquiries for six additional sectors is reflected in the number of individual business contributors rising from approximately 15, 000 for 1980 to 1996 to approximately 50, 000 for 1997 / 98 and to over 70, 000 for 1999. The ABI {{is one of the most}} comprehensive surveys undertaken of business organisations in the UK, covering over 100 key economic variables, and approximately two-thirds of the UK economy. Detailed variables for turnover, employment, costs, capital and the derivation of sales and profits are included. A firm-level measure of Gross Value Added (GVA) is also generated so that the productivity of organisations can be evaluated. The ABI samples UK businesses and other such establishments according to their employment size and industry sector. It is a <b>census</b> <b>of</b> large businesses, and a stratified sample of small and medium sized enterprises. The stratified sampling framework means that smaller firms move in and out of the survey. The forms are customised for industry sectors and sub-sectors. The statistics produced from the sample data are used primarily to assist in the generation of the National Accounts and the measurement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A number of different form-types are used in the survey. Long form-types are sent to all businesses with an employment of 250 or more and also to a proportion of selected businesses with lower employment. Short form-types are sent to the remaining selected businesses. The forms differ in that long form-types ask for a detailed breakdown of purchases; employment costs; taxes, duties and levies etc, whereas short form-types just ask for the totals of these variables. The data are collected in two parts: Part 1 is an employment record, collected as soon as possible after 12 th December. Part 2 is for financial information, which may be submitted up to twelve months after the financial year end. Geographical references: postcodes The postcodes available in these data are pseudo-anonymised postcodes. The real postcodes are not available due to the potential risk of identification of the observations. However, these replacement postcodes retain the inherent nested characteristics of real postcodes, and will allow researchers to aggregate observations to other geographic units, e. g. wards, super output areas, etc. In the dataset, the variable of the replacement postcode is 'new_PC'. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. ARD, the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and the Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES) The ABI, Part 2 (ABI/ 2) was replaced by the ABS in 2009. The ABI, Part 1 (ABI/ 1) was replaced by the BRES in 2009. The BRES data for 2009 onwards are held separately under UK Data Archive SN 7463. ABS data for 2008 onwards are held under UK Data Archive SN 7451. Researchers who are applying for access to the ARD and who require data for 2009 onwards are recommended to also apply for the ABS data under SN 7451. Main Topics : The contents of the data can be divided into the following sections: employment turnover and sales purchases stocks, capital expenditure and investment retail other expenditure and income Detailed variables within the above headings are customised according to the following broad industrial sectors into which the data are divided: production construction property motor trades catering retailing wholesale services Standard measure: Gross Value Added (GVA). This is the sum of outputs minus the sum of inputs for a company i. e. income generated less intermediate consumption of goods and services used. <br/...|$|R

40|$|It's been {{a long-standing}} {{assumption}} that Irish manufacturing firms are price takers in their output markets. This assumption has been validated by several aggregate level studies. While {{a much smaller}} {{number of studies have}} examined this issue at a more disaggregated level, they tend to support this conclusion. All of these studies also assume that firms are price takers in their input markets, or, in other words inputs are perfectly elastically supplied to firms. This assumption, however, has never been formally tested. There is intrinsic interest in the context of competition law in ascertaining evidence of deviations from perfect competition in sales of product and purchases of inputs. Moreover the introduction of minimum wages provides an important additional motivation for the topic of this paper, since {{it is well known that}} the introduction of minimum wages or increases in the level of minimum wages can lead to increases in employment over a certain range of wages if the firm possesses market power in its labour market. By using four-digit level <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> Industrial <b>Production</b> (CIP) panel data the paper sets out to test the extent of potential market power in Irish manufacturing industries. The paper employs the ingenious method proposed by Hall and later modified by Roeger in this exercise. While the Hall-Roeger method was originally concerned with imperfect competition in output markets, it can be readily extended to input markets. The empirical results do not indicate much evidence of significant imperfect competition in output markets but the results do point to evidence of market power in certain input markets and in some industrial sectors. The implications of these findings are discussed. ...|$|R
