500|$|Tyndall, also {{previously}} in the National Front, had founded the BNP in 1982, but his [...] "brutal, streetfighting background" [...] and admiration for Hitler and the Nazis had made {{any kind of}} respectability impossible. In his 1999 leadership campaign, Griffin embarked on a strategy to make the party electable, by taking it away from Tyndall's extremist image. He was helped by Tyndall's lack of familiarity with the mainstream media, and in the party's September election he defeated Tyndall to become head of the BNP. One of Griffin's changes included moderating the party's emphasis on the removal of multiculturalism, a policy it claims has a destructive influence on both immigrant and British cultures. Griffin pledged to eliminate [...] "the three Hs: hobbyism, hard talk and Hitler". This realignment was designed to position the BNP alongside successful European far-right groups, such as the French Front National. Street protests were replaced by electoral campaigning, and some policies were moderated (the <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriation</b> of ethnic minorities was instead made voluntary). Other policies included the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles, rapists, drug dealers and some murderers, and corporal punishment for less serious crimes such as juvenile delinquency. Griffin's image as a Cambridge-educated family man was {{in contrast to the}} extremist image presented by the BNP under Tyndall's leadership. In October 1999, Nick Griffin, supported by Tony Lecomber stood against Tyndall for leadership of the BNP. John Tyndall received just 411 (30%) of the votes, while Griffin the majority, 70%.|$|E
2500|$|The BNP {{calls for}} the non-white {{population}} of Britain to either be reduced in size or removed from the country altogether. Under Tyndall's leadership it promoted the compulsory removal of non-whites from the UK, stating that under a BNP government they would be [...] "repatriated" [...] to their countries of origin. In the early 1990s it produced stickers with the slogan [...] "Our Final Solution: Repatriation". Tyndall understood {{this to be a}} two-stage process that would take ten to twenty years, with some non-whites initially leaving willingly and the others then being forcibly deported. During the 1990s, party modernisers suggested that the BNP move away from a policy of <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriation</b> and toward a voluntary system, whereby non-white persons would be offered financial incentives to leave the UK. This idea, adopted from Powellism, was deemed more electorally palatable.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the 10,000 Pacific Islanders remaining in Australia in 1901 were compulsorily repatriated from 1906-08 under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901. Those who were married to an Australian were exempt from <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriation.</b> Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as South Sea Islanders. A 1992 census of South Sea Islanders reported around 10,000 descendants living in Queensland. Fewer than 3,500 were reported in the 2001 Australian census.|$|E
5000|$|As {{successor}} to Brice Hortefeux {{in charge of}} immigration and national identity he announced the objective of ensuring 29,000 <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriations</b> per annum. He said that legislation enacted penalizing assistance to illegal immigrants (with up to 5 years imprisonment) {{was not intended to}} discourage the general public but only traffickers. Ã‰ric Besson has endeavoured to overturn the role of Cimade in offering assistance to illegal immigrants held in the expanded network of detention centres in France by opening bids for offer of these services by other agencies. In September 2009, Besson effected the clearing of an area known as [...] "the Jungle" [...] near Calais, where cabins and shacks housed mainly illegal immigrants desiring to settle in Great Britain and primarily of Afghan or Kurdish stock.|$|R
50|$|In October 1999 Nick Griffin, {{supported}} by Tony Lecomber, stood against Tyndall for {{leadership of the}} BNP. John Tyndall received just 411 votes (27.5% of the total), while Griffin received 1,082 (72.5%). After Griffin won, he began modernising the party's image, though the crucial policy change from <b>compulsory</b> to voluntary <b>repatriation</b> had already been accomplished under Tyndall's leadership. A new monthly newspaper, The Voice of Freedom, was initiated, {{as well as a}} journal, Identity.|$|R

During the 2001 general election, following the milltown riots, Oldham and Burnley polled highest for the BNP. Following 9/11 the BNP made further political capital.|$|R
50|$|The NF and the BNP {{have been}} {{strongly}} opposed to non-white immigration. They have encouraged the repatriation of ethnic minorities: the NF favours <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriation,</b> while the BNP favours voluntary repatriation. BNP {{have had a}} number of local councillors in some inner-city areas of east London, and towns in Yorkshire and Lancashire, such as Burnley and Keighley. East London has been the bedrock of far-right support in the UK since the 1930s, whereas BNP success in the north of England is a newer phenomenon. The only other part of the country to provide any significant level of support for such views is the West Midlands.|$|E

5000|$|The National Front grew {{during the}} 1970s and had between 16,000 and 20,000 members by 1974, and 50 local branches. Its electoral base largely {{consisted}} of blue-collar {{workers and the}} self-employed who resented immigrant competition in the labour market and for scarce housing. Some recruits came from the Monday Club within the Conservative Party that had been founded in reaction to Harold Macmillan's [...] "Wind of Change" [...] speech. The NF fought {{on a platform of}} opposition to communism and liberalism, support for Ulster loyalism, opposition to the European Economic Community, and the <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriation</b> of new Commonwealth immigrants who had entered Britain under the British Nationality Act, 1948. In May 1973, in a by-election in West Bromwich West, the National Front candidate, the party's National Activities Organizer, Martin Webster, polled 4,789 votes (16.2%), a result which shook the political and media Establishment.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a history}} of Melanesian Mackay, {{studying}} in detail the migration of Malaitan (Solomon Islands) labourers between 1871 and 1904. It describes the life and work of the Melanesian community of the district in the nineteenth century, following the <b>compulsory</b> <b>repatriation</b> of the majority after the federation of the Australian colonies and the progressive divorce of the few who remained in Queensland from the sugar industry they and their fellows had done so much to create. Also included is a brief outline of the subsequent fate and present status of that community. To make this Melanesian history fully comprehensible it also gives a detailed account of European settlement, and more especially of the evolution of the sugar industry, at Mackay...|$|E
