40|$|<b>Control</b> <b>chart</b> is {{the most}} widely used tools for {{statistical}} process control. For detecting shift in process mean, chart is the simplest and most commonly used. <b>Control</b> <b>chart</b> should be designed economically in order to achieve minimum quality control costs. The major function of <b>control</b> <b>chart</b> is to detect the occurrence of assignable causes so that the necessary corrective action can be taken before a large quantity of nonconforming product is manufactured. The <b>control</b> <b>chart</b> dominates the use of any other <b>control</b> <b>chart</b> technique if quality is measured on a continuous scale. The design of a <b>control</b> <b>chart</b> refers to the selection of three parameters i. e., sample size, width of control limit, and interval between samples. Economic design of <b>control</b> <b>chart</b> has gained considerable importance in providing better quality of end products to customer at less cost. In the present work, a computer programme in C language based on a non-traditional optimization technique namely particle swarm optimization has been developed for the economic design of the <b>control</b> <b>chart</b> giving the optimum values of the sample size, sampling interval and width of control limits such that the expected total cost per hour is minimized. The results obtained are found to be better compared to that reported in the literature...|$|R
