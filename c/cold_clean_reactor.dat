The temperature of the clean gas in the heat exchanger is controlled by a controller (4) by its temperature at entry by bypassing warm, clean, gas to mix with that from the refrigerator.

About 66 % of moisture is removed in the pre-cooler at a temperature of 1 - 17 deg. C. The remainder is removed in the refrigerator, where the gas is cooled to - 40 deg. C.

The problem of determining the temperature distribution and the resulting thermal stress pattern within the graphite was considered. Preliminary designs for a heterogeneous fuel element and a semihomogeneous fuel element were developed. Utilization of the Hanford in- pile gas loop for fuel element testing is discussed. Two-group PDQ calculations were run to estimate control rod worth for the preliminary design core under <b>cold,</b> <b>clean</b> conditions. Curves of rod worth versus position were developed for the hot, <b>clean</b> and the <b>cold,</b> <b>clean</b> preliminary design core. A detailed lifetime calculation was made for the preliminary design heterogeneous core. Fuel cycle costs were estimated {{on the basis of the}} effect of B in the fuel elements. The schedule and facilities for the critical experiments are discussed in some detail. The speed of the main turbine shaft was tentatively set at about 12, 200 rpm. The design and fabrication of a test stand to evaluate shaft seals and seal systems were completed and trial runs were made. The effects of minor heat transfer due to heat leakage, fluid flow, and thermodynamic phenomena on MGCR full-load cycle performance were studied. Operating characteristics of the heat exchanger test facility are described. A critical review was conducted on the desirability of using concentric ducts and valves. Block diagrams outlining reactor power level, outlet temperature, and plant inventory control are presented. Equations which permit the dynamic analysis of a closed-cycle gas-turbine plant were programed for a digital computer. Descriptions were prepared for fluid-mechanical systems. Several methods of purifying He in both storage bank and main loop were investigated. Investigations into the maximum operating temperatures of the various electrical equipment indicate that temperatures up to 140 deg F can be tolerated. Preliminary design work was carried out on an emergency cooldown system which uses a stored inert coolant. Work on the irradiation stability of fuel materials indicated that conversion from the monocarbide to the dicarbide can take place at 2, 350 deg F in graphite bodies containing UC. Densities as high as 96. 6 % theoretical were obtalned in alumina pellets sintered in H. Xenon released from irradiated UO/sub 2 / granules was measured. Progress was made in the development of high-temperature x-ray-diffraction techniques. Tests were conducted to investigate the effects of coolant and impurities in the coolant on plant materials and the effects of gettering on inhibiting reactions.

An Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS) {{was used to}} detect single particle sizes {{and chemical}} composition. Seven particle types were detected. Air parcels arrived at the sampling site from the vicinity of Shanghai until mid-day of December 25, when they started to originate from North China. The aerosol extinction, scattering, and absorption coefficients all dropped sharply when this <b>cold,</b> <b>clean</b> air arrived. Aerosol particles changed from a highly aged type before this meteorological shift to a relatively fresh type afterwards. The aerosol optical properties were dependent on the wind direction. Aerosols with high extinction coefficient and scattering Ångström exponent (SAE) were observed when the wind blew from the west and northwest, indicating that they were predominantly fine particles. Nitrate and ammonium correlated most strongly with the change in aerosol optical properties. In the elemental carbon/organic carbon (ECOC) particle type, the diurnal trends of single scattering albedo (SSA) and elemental carbon (EC) signal intensity had a negative correlation.

However, bull trout are dependent upon very <b>cold,</b> <b>clean</b> waters for spawning (below 9 degrees Celsius) and are typically characterized as spawning in the upper-most reaches of watersheds. Bull trout have four life history forms: resident, fluvial, adfluvial, and in Puget Sound, anadromous. As {{a result of their}} varied life histories, bull trout are found {{in a wide range of}} habitats. Dunham and Rieman (1999) found a negative relationship between bull trout occurrence and road density. Direct impacts from roads that can adversely affect bull trout include: increased human access and associated exposure to poaching, angling mortality, and introductions of non-native fish; blocks to passage; erosion and sedimentation; construction disturbance; increased stormwater run-off; and stream channel instability and habitat degradation. Additionally, there are various indirect effects of roads that negatively impact bull trout. These relate to land-use changes stemming from road extension, widening, and other road improvements and upgrades. We have drawn from the literature and from in-house endangered species expertise to compile a summary and discussion of basic bull trout biology, and how roads affect their various life history forms and habitat requirements. Endangered species biologists use this information when conducting consultations under the Endangered Species Act, and when participating in planning processes for large-scale transportation projects under NEPA.
