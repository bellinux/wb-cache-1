Was a 35 mm, leaf shutter design. A flash {{is a necessary}} accessory for auxiliary or fill light in dim or high contrast conditions. The first camera {{with any kind of}} hot shoe connector was the Univex Mercury (USA) non-SLR half frame 35 mm in 1938 and many post World War 2 non-SLRs (such as the Bell & Howell Foton USA 35 mm rangefinder) had a Leica-type accessory shoe with added electrical contact (the present day ISO hot shoe). Although the Nikon F (see above) had a non-ISO hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank in 1959, most 1960s 35 mm SLRs used screw-on accessory shoes attached to the eyepiece to mount flashes but a PC <b>cable</b> <b>socket</b> to sync them. The ISO hot shoe became a standard SLR feature in the early 1970s. However, in 1971, SLRs using [...] "dedicated" [...] electronic flashes with automatic flash exposure control began appearing with the Canon FTb (Japan). They used ISO-style shoes with extra electrical contacts. Each SLR brand used incompatible contact configurations and the time of use-any-flash-with-any-SLR passed by the late 1970s. Note, although the hot shoe had been de facto standardized in the 1950s, the International Organization for Standardization did not promulgate its ISO 518 hot shoe specification until 1977.|$|E

Its most distinctive feature is the Double Entry system of two entry plugs, with the two pilots capable of seeing each other {{as if they were}} in a single plug; either pilot is capable of controlling the EVA on their own, although both of them working in tandem is preferred. Unusually, the EVA {{does not appear to have}} an AT-field, instead using a number of remote-controlled drones called RS Hoppers to protect itself; these drones are each capable of deploying their own AT-field, can fly without any apparent means of propulsion and explode violently when damaged. Without these drones, the EVA does not appear to have any offensive weaponry but is immune to progressive blades and specialized anti-AT ammunition fired by Unit 08 fails to affect it whatsoever. The unit itself is also referred to as an [...] "Adams" [...] sic, although the precise meaning of that term is left unclear. At the end of the film, Unit 13 is piloted by Shinji Ikari and Kaworu Nagisa who proceed to remove the two Spears of Longinus from Lilith, setting in motion a chain of events that cause the EVA to enter an [...] "awakened" [...] or [...] "pseudo-evolved" [...] form where it spontaneously emits light, sprouts a pair of wing-like protrusions from its shoulders and manifests a pair of concentric halos that allow it to fly at high speeds.

These included transistorised 'solid-state' versions: the Pianet C, and the modernist, lidless Pianet L with metal legs and built in amplifier and speakers. The next model was the longer running and more numerous Pianet N that evolved through two different specifications. The N was fitted with side mounted ‘inverted V’legs and could be equipped with an optional underbelly 12 watt valve amplifier, the Amplifier CP. The Pianet N (version II) was joined by the Combo Pianet in the early 1970s. These were the final incarnations of the first group of Pianets. The early Pianets (Pianet, Pianet C, Pianet CH & Pianet N) featured lids which opened in an upright V to form a music stand. This feature was introduced on Cembalets and became common to both Cembalets and Pianets. This similarity of appearance results in the mis-identification of models in historic images.

40|$|The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a {{worldwide}} standard for communication between peripherals. Nowadays USB interfaces are integrated {{in almost every}} device. It {{will be used to}} connect peripherals and computers. USB devices communicate between pieces of hardware, i. e., <b>cable,</b> plug and <b>socket.</b> Thus, there exists different standardized communication protocols depending on the application. In case of different communication protocols, it is necessary to verify them, that devices, no matter of country, can communicate to each other. The verifying process is very important in order that companies can sell products with such interfaces and their designated logo, to guaranty a certain standard, which is provided all over the world. Devices have to complete various test procedures to get certified. Otherwise a company is not allowed to use logos ore designations, i. e., USB or information about data rates, i. e., SuperSpeed. Furthermore, successfully completed test procedures prove that a device works properly based on a professional method. The Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) device family from the company Marquardt Verwaltungs GmbH, is using the USB interface for service and data exchange purposes. The service application is realized through a Virtual COM Port (VCP), based on the Communication Device Class (CDC) of USB. On the other side they want to use the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) based on the Still Image Capture Device class for data exchange between the HMI device and a computer. Of course, the integrated circuit, which implements the USB interface on the circuit board of the HMI device has to be verified, too. The verification will be performed through an external company. In contrast, the communication protocols do not need a verification but must be examined. The identification of an USB class in an operating system does neither guaranty a proper functionality nor comply with a professional scientific method. To accelerate the development of a project as well as to reduce the production costs, it is a significant advantage to own a test environment. Microsoft provides the possibility to verify devices on Windows operating systems. Therefor they invented the Windows Certification Program, which contains software {{that can be used for}} verification purposes. One of them is the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) we want to set up and set the HMI device under test, to examine the implementation of MTP. Thus, it is possible to use the HCK test setup during a development process to examine a current implementation without a big effort, i. e., cooperation with an external company or similarly approaches, which delays the whole development process by far. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{progress has}} been seen in recent years {{around the world in}} the construction of cable-stayed bridges, as well as in suspension bridges. As longer cable-stayed bridges have come to be constructed, the multiple-cable system with mono-strand cables has become popular. Stay cables of such long cable-stayed bridges are required to possess excellent mechanical properties, such as a high static and high fatigue strength, and a superior corrosion protective coat. There were few cables in the past which satisfied those requirements, therefore it was necessary to do a study on them. This thesis describes the study on the development of a new-type cable for long cable-stayed bridges, and application subjects for large cable-supported structures. Details of the studies are presented respectively. A slight twist of the wires given to the cable made it possible to coat it with a corrosion protective layer in the manufacturing process and to improve handleability such as installation at the site without damaging the structural performance. It was indicated that the pre- coated parallel wire cable had the same static characteristics (such as the breaking strength and modulus of elasticity) as those of a parallel wire strand, when the twisting angle of a cable was less than 3. 5 °. It was also shown that the twisting angle had little effect on the time dependent characteristics (such as creep and relaxation) when the twisting angle of a cable was less than 3. 5 °. Finally, the tensile test was carried out by using full-size cable models and it was confirmed that a pre-coated parallel wire cable with a breaking load of a 3, 000 tonf (29, 400 kN) class could be put into practical use. A new fatigue resistant socket having a composite-filler consisting of an epoxy resin and a zinc-copper alloy was developed in order to improve the fatigue strength of a socket. It was confirmed that the socket had a higher fatigue strength of about 25 kgf/mm^ 2 (245 MPa). It was confirmed that the socket had a higher fatigue strength of the socket when the twisting angle of a cable was less than 3. 5 °. Experimental results and analysis indicated that the pre-coated parallel wire <b>cable</b> with the <b>sockets</b> had a bending fatigue strength of about 0. 6 °and the socket using epoxy resin also had an effect on decreasing the secondary stress at the entrance of a socket. A new method in socket design for a large cable, introducing the concept of rigidity for ultimate strength, was examined. As a new protection system against corrosion, an extruded polyethylene coating for a parallel wire cable was developed, which eliminated the need for corrosion protective coating work at the site. A high-density polyethylene was selected as the optimum protective coating material. According to the accelerated weathering test results, it was confirmed that the polyethylene showed no deterioration when 1 % carbon black was added. The properties of a polyethylene coated cable were analyzed, and installation characteristics of the cable such as unreeling and clamping were examined using full-size cable models. It was indicated that this protection system was a great advantage in the erection of stay cables of cable-stayed bridges, especially long ones. In addition to fundamental development, the cable that could be applied to any cable-supported structures was also required to have higher performance. One of the application subjects was to make the cable colored and durable. The other was to develop aerodynamic measures against cable vibration to lengthen cable-stayed bridge spans. Details of the investigations with respect to these subjects and the results obtained by the study (a fluoropolymer-coated colored cable and a low drag aerodynamically stable cable with an indented pattern), were presented. A colored cable using a fluoropolymer having outstanding weathering durability was developed. The material properties of the fluoropolymer, especially the weathering durability, were evaluated by using various exposure test methods. It became obvious that the fluoropolymer had excellent weathering durability, which could be estimated to last for more than 100 years if the thickness were 1 mm or more. Structural characteristics of the fluoropolymer-covered cable were examined, and it was indicated that the cable had the same installation properties as those of a polyethylene-coated cable. These characteristics of the fluoropolymer showed that it could be used for various structures and elongated service life and added aesthetic aspects. As a result, a greater freedom of color selection was given to bridge cables that matched the surrounding environment. Finally, it was shown that the colored cable was applied not only to stay cables of long cable-stayed bridges but also to hangers of long suspension bridges. The vibration problems of a stay cable were surveyed and experimental studies on cable vibration and its suppressing method for a long cable-stayed bridge were discussed. After examining the aerodynamic characteristics of a cable with a patterned roughness, using wind tunnel tests, a new aerodynamical cable having both a low drag force and a suppression effect on rain vibration was developed. It was found that it had the same drag coefficient of about 0. 6 as that of a cable with a smooth surface in any design wind velocity range. It was also found that a cable with a surface roughness had a vibration suppressing effect when the relative surface roughness had a vibration suppressing effect when the relative surface roughness of 1 % of the cable diameter was given discretely on the surface. Suppression effects were analyzed by measurement of the drag coefficient and pressure distribution, indicating that cables with a lumped pattern roughness made it possible to reproduce a supercritical state at a low wind velocity range where rain vibrations occurred. To understand further the aerodynamic characteristics of the surface configuration of the cable, various patterned roughnesses were examined in terms of the Reynolds Numbers. It was found that density and arrangement of lumped roughness were the key factors in controlling the drag characteristics of cables, and that optimization of the drag coefficient-Reynolds number relationship could enable adjusting those two factors. Responses of stay cables by vortex-induced vibration in natural wind were measured at an actual cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 490 m. The factors affecting this vibration, such as surface roughness and structural damping, were examined by using a wind tunnel test and analysis. It was shown that the response amplitude was estimated at various damping levels, and that the bending angle of a cable, caused by vortex-induced vibration, to be less than 0. 1 °, which had little effect on the secondary stress and bending fatigue strength of cables. Cable materials in the future for a super-long cable supported bridge were described. It was shown that the development of cable material was inevitable in order to lengthen a bridge span of a super-long suspension bridge. The present status of cable materials including steel wires and various new materials was surveyed and future problems to overcome were pointed out. As a future prospect, a high strength steel material and a light weight material such as carbon fiber were shown to be possible for use in super-long cable supported bridges. In conclusion, several ideas for the new-type cable discussed here helped in the lengthening cable-stayed bridge spans, and contributed a great deal to the advancement of cable-supported structures. 横浜国立大学, 平成 8 年 6 月 30 日, 博士(工学), 乙第 107...|$|R
