50|$|The church's western spire {{makes it}} a {{landmark}} within the city's townscape and the most dominant element of its immediate streetscape. The spire's presence is further accented by it being painted cream, while {{the remainder of the}} structure, including the sympathetic addition of a sessions house at the eastern end, is dark brick. The building has a Latin cross plan, and a corrugated iron roof, with ventilation to its ridges. Its detailing, in keeping with the tall spire, is derived from the Gothic style. Its windows and door openings have <b>pointed</b> <b>heads.</b> Detailing to the spire includes: recessed <b>pointed</b> <b>head</b> arches, accented by tracery; voussoirs, alternately projecting; and elaborate moulding. A lighter coloured brick articulates the <b>pointed</b> <b>heads</b> of the church's other window and door openings.|$|R

50|$|Dudleya densiflora is {{a unique}} plant, {{different}} in appearance from most other dudleyas with its long, snakelike leaves.

(Dudleya edulis also has <b>cylindrical</b> <b>pointed</b> leaves, often longer, but lacks the grainy powder). From this clump of leaves emerges an erect stem with a branched inflorescence, each branch bearing 2 to 8 light colored flowers, usually very light pink to white.|$|R

50|$|Fimbristylis vahlii is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common name Vahl's fimbry.

This is a small, clumping sedge producing rounded stems just a few centimeters high surrounded by curling, thready leaves. At {{the top of the}} stem is an inflorescence which is a cluster of several <b>cylindrical,</b> <b>pointed</b> spikelets surrounded by long, narrow, twisting bracts. The fruit is a tiny achene about half a millimeter wide.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 90 - 93) This thesis {{suggests that}} Bertolt Brecht's play, Round <b>Heads</b> and <b>Pointed</b> <b>Heads,</b> has been underserved both critically and theatrically. Although it {{evolved from a}} previous attempt Brecht made to adapt Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure, {{there has been little}} scholarly discussion of Round <b>Heads</b> and <b>Pointed</b> <b>Heads</b> in light of its Shakespearean original. It is the intention of this thesis to revisit Brecht's play and argue that a comparative analysis of the two plays serves to rescue Brecht's play from its reputation as a failed Nazi satire and a na'ive Marxist account of the rise of fascism in Germany. This thesis also proposes that a study of Brecht's early, incomplete attempt to adapt Measure for Measure, which exists in the Bertolt Brecht Archives in fragmented form, strengthens the link between Round <b>Heads</b> and <b>Pointed</b> <b>Heads</b> and Shakespeare's play. I have included a working translation of these manuscript pages, which comprise the appendix to this thesis. Identifying Round <b>heads</b> and <b>Pointed</b> <b>Heads</b> as Brecht's final, free adaptation of Measure for Measure encourages a critical re-evaluation of the play, rescuing it from its reputation as an anti-Hitler satire and resurrecting it as a complex and sophisticated political parable with multiple implications...|$|R

5000|$|Round <b>Heads</b> and <b>Pointed</b> <b>Heads</b> (Die Rundköpfe und die Spitzköpfe) is an epic parable play {{written by}} the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, in {{collaboration}} with Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, Elisabeth Hauptmann, and the composer Hanns Eisler. The play's subtitle is Money Calls to Money and its authors describe it as [...] "a tale of horror." [...] The play is a satirical anti-Nazi parable about a fictitious country called Yahoo in which the rulers maintain their control by setting the people with round heads against those with <b>pointed</b> <b>heads,</b> thereby substituting racial relations for their antagonistic class relations. The play is composed of 11 scenes in prose and blank verse and 13 songs. Unlike another of Brecht's plays from this period, The Mother, Round <b>Heads</b> and <b>Pointed</b> <b>Heads</b> was addressed to a wide audience, Brecht suggested, and took account of [...] "purely entertainment considerations." [...] Brecht's notes on the play, written in 1936, contain the earliest theoretical application of his [...] "defamiliarization" [...] principle to his own [...] "non-Aristotelian" [...] drama.|$|R
