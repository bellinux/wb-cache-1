5000|$|In the United States, a {{practitioner}} may either be a patent attorney or <b>patent</b> <b>agent.</b> Both <b>patent</b> attorneys and <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> {{have the same}} license to practice and represent clients before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Both <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> and <b>patent</b> attorneys may prepare, file, and prosecute <b>patent</b> applications. <b>Patent</b> <b>agents</b> and <b>patent</b> attorneys may also provide patentability opinions, as noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Sperry v. Florida. [...] However, the USPTO Rules of Ethics and Professionalism, effective as of September 15, 2008, specifically clarifies that <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> may not provide an [...] "opinion of validity of another party's patent when the client is contemplating litigation and not seeking reexamination" [...] because such activity [...] "could not be reasonably necessary and incident to the preparation and prosecution" [...] of a client's patent.|$|R
40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>agents,</b> in many ways, {{are unique}} {{operators}} in our legal system. They are not attorneys; yet, they are authorized by Congress {{to practice law}} before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). This unusual status raises a host of questions, including whether communications with <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> should be privileged and, therefore, shielded from discovery. This question has become increasingly important in recent years {{with the rise of}} litigation at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) [...] an administrative tribunal created in 2011 by the America Invents Act (AIA) [...] where parties can be represented either by a patent attorney or a <b>patent</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>agents</b> have existed in the United States for almost as long as the patent system itself, so {{the question of how to}} treat <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> communications is not new. To be sure, lower courts grappled with the question for close to seventy years, but still could not reach consensus. In 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit took up the issue in In re Queen 2 ̆ 7 s University at Kingston and created a new privilege protecting <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> communications. While the court made clear that the new privilege is limited in scope, the exact boundaries remain undefined. The PTO, too, has been navigating this <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> privilege terrain. Before Queen 2 ̆ 7 s University, the agency was meeting with stakeholders and collecting comments about how to address various privilege issues that arise before the PTO, particularly with respect to PTAB proceedings. Once the Federal Circuit weighed in, it would have been perfectly reasonable for the PTO to take a wait-and-see approach. But that 2 ̆ 7 s not what happened. Instead, less than six months after Queen 2 ̆ 7 s University, the PTO forged ahead proposing its own rule on <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> privilege that differs from the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s rule in potentially significant ways. This effort to recognize a <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> privilege is laudable. Although the sharing of information and “search for truth” are fundamental principles of our justice system, protecting communications between <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> and clients ultimately inures to the public. Not only does it encourage frank conversations and legal advice similar to the attorney-client privilege, it also encourages innovation by making patent protection more accessible because <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> fees are usually lower than lawyer fees. In order to be effective, however, the <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> privilege cannot be uncertain. The remainder of this article proceeds as follows. Part I provides background on the law of privilege in federal court. Part II explains the unique role <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> play in our legal system, and how they 2 ̆ 7 ve been treated to date. Part III then turns to recent developments regarding <b>patent</b> <b>agents</b> and privilege, including the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Queen 2 ̆ 7 s University and the PTO 2 ̆ 7 s proposed rule for <b>patent</b> <b>agent</b> privilege. Part IV concludes by high- lighting some of the inconsistencies between these rules and potential issues that may consequently arise, so we can begin to consider the best path forward...|$|R
