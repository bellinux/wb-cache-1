40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Cullman, Alabama to evaluate the effects of three different rollers/crimpers on terminating a rye (Secale cereale L) cover crop, soil moisture, and sweet corn yield in a no-till system. Three roller types were tested: a straight bar roller, a smooth roller with <b>crimper,</b> and a two-stage roller at speeds of 2 and 4 MPH. Termination rates provided by the three rollers/crimpers were compared to a smooth drum roller (no crimping bar) plus glyphosate (Roundup TM WeatherMax) * * applied at 1 lb/acre. Initialdata indicates that three weeks after rolling 100 % termination was attained by the smooth roller and glyphosate. A termination of 68 % was attained following the smooth roller with <b>crimper</b> at 4 MPH; however, {{no significant differences were}} found between the straight bar roller at both speeds, the smooth roller with <b>crimper</b> and the two-stage roller at 4 MPH (67 %). Roller type did not affect soil moisture after the first and second week from rolling. No significant difference in sweet corn yield was found between straight bar roller at 4 MPH, two-stage roller at 2 MPH, and smooth roller plus glyphosate. The lowest yield was found with smooth drum roller plus glyphosate. The highest yield (15, 348 lbs/ac or 6. 85 tonnes/ac) was recorded following the smooth roller with <b>crimper</b> at 4 MPH...|$|R

5000|$|Mechanical <b>crimpers</b> worked well, but {{the process}} was slow and very labor-intensive. As demand {{increased}} for ribbon candy, {{it became clear that}} another way to make the candy had to be found. Until the 1940s ribbon candy was never made on a large scale, because more sophisticated equipment was needed. A single spinning roll was developed and it was found that by very careful tending of the candy batch, the hand spinner could be eliminated and the automated machine could run faster. The big bottleneck was in having to cut the candy with scissors. An air activated automatic cutter was invented by Sevigny Candy and is still in use today by F.B. Washburn Candy, which purchased Sevigny Candy in June 1986. [...] The Brockton, Massachusetts-based F.B. Washburn Candy company is now the primary source for ribbon candy in the US and Canada.|$|E
40|$|Growers who use {{cover crops}} are {{increasingly}} {{turning to a}} tool that can flatten out their actively growing fields, usually in a single pass. Known as a “roller/ crimper,” the technology can help reduce and sometimes {{eliminate the need for}} herbicides and is ideal for organic farmers and growers interested in reducing herbicide use. Cover crops can improve soil quality; and in organic operations, they {{play a major role in}} keeping weeds in check. <b>Crimpers</b> boost those benefits. They have been used for years in South America and are beginning to catch on in the United States, says Ted Kornecki, an agricultural engineer at the Agricultural Research Service’s National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, Alabama. He has conducted a study evaluating several <b>crimpers</b> to give guidance to growers and has patented three crimper designs. There are several types of <b>crimpers.</b> Most involve some type of rolling, paddlewheel- like cylinder that attaches to a tractor and barrels over a field, tamping down and crimping the cover crop into a smooth mat to kill it. About 3 weeks later, a planter, running parallel to the roller’s path, can plant seeds directly into the ground without significantly disturbing the biomass mat. The technology has shown promise in early trials and demonstrations. “It definitely works,” says Frank Randle, who helped evaluate a crimper similar to one designed by Kornecki as part of a 4 -year demonstration project on his farm near Auburn. Randle used cereal rye and crimson clover as cover crops before planting organic watermelon, squash, okra, and tomatoes. The clover was difficult to kill with the crimper, but the device terminated the rye effectively. After the 4 th year, Randle did have to till the plots to control some perennial weeds, but the crimper could be used again continuously for years after that...|$|E
50|$|Hair {{crimping}} {{is usually}} achieved by treating the hair with heat from a crimping iron (also {{referred to as}} hair <b>crimper)</b> or by braiding the hair, often in multiple strands, then undoing the braids {{after a couple of}} hours.

40|$|Vicia villosa Roth, or hairy vetch, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} cover crops (CC) in Mediterranean dry areas, with an interesting potential as dead mulch in no-tillage cropping systems. In low-input cropping systems, mechanical termination of hairy vetch could replace a glyphosate application to control weeds. Mechanical termination (e. g. with a roller <b>crimper)</b> of hairy vetch is ineffective until the late growing stages of vetch, leading to delayed sowing and yield reduction in the following crop. To find the best compromise in timing between effective termination of vetch and reasonable yield of no-till sunflower, an on-farm experiment was carried out in Pisa (Italy) in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 to compare three termination techniques (roller <b>crimper</b> with no, half and full dose of glyphosate) and three termination dates (before flowering, beginning of flowering, 70...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the efficiency of the flow-wrap packaging process in soap industry through the reduction of defectives. At the 95 % confidence level, with the regression analysis, the sealing temperature, temperatures of upper and lower crimper are found to be the significant factors for the flow-wrap process with respect to the number/percentage of defectives. Twenty seven experiments have been designed and performed according to three levels of each controllable factor. With the general linear model (GLM), the suggested values for the sealing temperature, temperatures of upper and lower <b>crimpers</b> are 185, 85 and 85 ๐ C, respectively. Under the suggested process condition, the percentage of defectives is reduced from 12. 47 % to 5. 51 % and at the significant level of 5 %, the percentage of defectives is between 5. 05 % and 5. 98 %.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Central Italy on growing melon (Cucumis melo L.) after barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Three different systems of cover crop termination (green manure, roller <b>crimper</b> and fallow, as control) were combined with three doses of compost (0, 15 and 30 t ha- 1 d. m.) in a strip plot design. The main objective of the research was to evaluate their effects on organic melon production and on short and long term soil nitrogen (N) fertility.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the mathematics and modelling of the industrial <b>crimper,</b> {{perhaps one of the}} least well understood processes that occurs in the manufacture of artificial fibre. We begin by modelling the process by which the fibre is deformed as it is forced into the industrial <b>crimper.</b> This we investigate by presuming the fibre to behave as an ideal elastica confined in a two dimensional channel. We consider how the arrangement of the fibre changes as more fibre is introduced, and the forces that are required to confine it. Later, we apply the same methods to a fibre confined to a three dimensional channel. After the fibre has under gone a preliminary deformation, a second process known as secondary crimp can occur. This involves the `zig-zagged' material folding over. We model this process in two ways. First as a series of rigid rods joined by elastic hinges, and then as an elastic with a highly oscillatory natural configuration compressed by thrusts at each end. We observe that both models can be expressed in a very similar manner, and both predict that a buckle can occur from a nearly straight initial condition to an arched formation. We also compare the results to experiments performed on the crimped fibre. Throughout much of the process, the configuration of the fibre does not alter. This part of the process we call the block, and model the material in this region in two ways: as a series of springs; and as an isotropic elastic material. We discuss the coupling between the different regions and the process that occurs in the block, and consider both the steady state and stability of the system...|$|R

50|$|Termination of modular {{connector}} cables is very similar, {{regardless of}} the number of positions and contacts in the plug. To prevent damage to the plug (and the expensive crimp die-set), the crimp tool must be carefully matched to the plug being attached. For example, termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand <b>crimper</b> or crimp machine containing an 8P8C die-set or an A67T standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable.|$|R
