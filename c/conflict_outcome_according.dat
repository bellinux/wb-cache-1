This conflict affected households' ability to generate income because of the death or disappearance of income earners and loss of productive assets. Using data from Peru's Demographic and Health Surveys and district-level conflict data published by the CVR, we find long-term effects of the conflict on some indicators of women's health, particularly on height and anemia. ...|$|R

At the firm or group level, heterogeneity could lead to better decision-making and positive outcomes.

Moreover, exposure to different views can lead to creativity and innovation (Hong and Page 2001). On the other hand, diversity may breed <b>conflicts</b> and poor <b>outcomes.</b> <b>According</b> to the social characterization view, people categorize themselves and others based on similarities and differences, which leads to the distinction between insiders and outsiders (Williams and O’Reilly 1998).

40|$|The {{division}} of labor {{as a source of}} conflict is a concern for many couples. This study goes beyond the mere prediction of the amount of marital conflict by scrutinizing the relationship between spouses' discontent with the {{division of}} labor, their conflict interaction patterns, and subsequent outcomes. In addition, it aims to explain the relationship between wives' discontent with the {{division of labor}} and their conflict avoidance by looking at the moderating effect of spouses' gender role ideology. A survey of 494 Dutch couples showed that constructive and destructive <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes</b> were predicted by spouses' discontent with the division of labor via marital interaction. The wife's discontent with housework was positively related to wife-demand/husband-withdraw interaction, which, in turn, predicted destructive <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Constructive <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes</b> were predicted by mutually integrative interaction, which was, in turn, predicted by lower levels of discontent with the division of labor. Finally, traditional wives and wives with traditional husbands were more inclined to avoid conflict about the division of labor-despite their discontent-than egalitarian wives and wives with egalitarian husbands...|$|R

The latter is an outcome with the following properties: (1) It is Pareto-superior to the <b>conflict</b> <b>outcome,</b> (2) It is not Pareto optimal, (3) All the bargainers agree that the conflict's solution should be Pareto superior to it. We present a solution function for this model. It satisfies uniquely several desirable requirements. The model is an extension of Nash's Bargaining Problem paradigm, and the particular solution function we propose is a variation of the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. negotiations, axiomatic theories of bargaining, conflict resolution, cooperative games...|$|R
40|$|We address two largely overlooked, {{fundamental}} issues in computing a ranking hierarchy within a society: which {{information in the}} network is relevant, and what effect chance has on the hierarchy. To properly account for uncertainty from limited data, we construct a random field in a matrix form having entry-wise posterior Beta distributions based on a graph of pairwise <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes.</b> To evaluate relevant network information using information transitivity, another random matrix of synthesized transitive dominance odds is computed collectively along observed dominance paths. These two matrices are coupled together to fuse both direct and indirect dominance information. An ensemble of realizations of this fused random matrix facilitates an ensemble of optimal ranking networks by means of simulated annealing. Conditional statistical inferences regarding network features are derived, manifesting the effect of uncertainty. Our computational approach is suitable for large graphs of pairwise <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes,</b> and can accommodate tremendous data heterogeneity-a typical feature in such studies. We also demonstrate the infeasibility of the classical maximum-likelihood approach, and expose the mechanistic flaws that stem from completely ignoring relevant information residing in the graph.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{internal}} armed <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes</b> have {{found evidence that}} rebel-biased military intervention {{increases the likelihood of}} rebel victory, but little indication that pro-government interventions improve the odds of government victory. Our argument, grounded in a theory of the utility and limitations of military force in civil wars, anticipates that armed intervention increases the probability of victory for the supported side only when that belligerentâ€™s primary challenge is a lack of conventional war-fighting capacity. Empirical analyses of internal armed conflicts from 1945 to 2010 support these expectations. Direct interventions in support of opposition movements have substantively large, robust effects on <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes.</b> In contrast, government-biased interventions are only effective in increasing the odds of an outcome favorable to the government when the fighting capacity of rebel forces matches or exceeds that of the state.

By building on the engagement of many {{in the development of}} the organization, the practices are important for our understanding of how a CEO facilitates the partaking of many in strategy making.

40|$|Military {{conflicts}} {{with a significant}} difference in military power or strategy between two opponents are called asymmetric conflicts. Since World War II, research proves military and technological superiority proved to be a highly unreliable ground to predict the outcome of wars. This thesis aims to develop a more satisfying answer on why big nations lose small wars in asymmetric conflicts. The weaknesses and strengths of the currently leading explanations on asymmetric <b>conflict</b> <b>outcome</b> are assessed and combined. Instead of creating another rival view, currently known decisive elements for asymmetric <b>conflict</b> <b>outcome</b> are combined in a new, more comprehensive model. Although further research should assess the significance of the individual variables and the relevance of possible other variables, this thesis concludes that if the duration of an asymmetric conflict is short, the external political pressure aimed at the strong actor is low, the internal political pressure in the home country of the strong actor is low, a symmetrical military strategy is adopted and the strong actor received more military support from an external actor than its opponent, the strong actor is most likely to win the asymmetric conflict...|$|R

Mothers were more often perceived to have either more aggressive or more compromising conflict styles in comparison to adolescents’ own stiles or fathers’ styles. Analyzing adolescents’ age differences, middle aged adolescents reported higher level of mother’s aggressiveness, higher levels of frustration and escalation in conflicts with mothers, as well as higher frustration in conflicts with fathers in comparison to their younger peers. Gender differences in style and <b>outcome</b> of <b>conflicts</b> revealed a more complex pattern: girls exhibited more compromising conflict style with mother and more aggressive conflict style with fathers than boys; there were no gender differences in parent - adolescent <b>conflict</b> <b>outcomes.</b> The established differences could inform policies, and help tailoring conflict resolution programs for this specific age group...|$|R

40|$|Bargaining theory {{provides}} a useful framework for thinking about the management of violent conflicts. In bar-gaining theory, two or more actors are assumed to have a common interest in reaching agreement, but conflicting preferences as to its terms. If they fail to agree, some suboptimal <b>conflict</b> <b>outcome</b> occurs. This <b>conflict</b> <b>outcome</b> may be fixed or subject to manipulation by each bargainer {{as a means of}} compelling the other to agree to more fa-vorable terms. Using this framework one can ask four questions relevant to understanding conflict management and conflict resolution: 1. What might prevent the bargainers from reaching agreement? 2. If agreement is possible, what determines the amount of time required to reach it? 3. If the conflict situation can be manipulated, can the bargainers somehow agree to minimize the costs of conflict? 4. Once agreement is reached, why might conflict recur? The an-swers to these questions help us understand the role of force, how people organize themselves to use it, why violent conflicts occur, and what role third parties might play in managing them.
