In this thesis mufflers with <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes</b> are analyzed by modeling the actual geometry and locations of holes on the <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes.</b> The Direct-mixed-body boundary element method with substructuring is used to model the mufflers.

40|$|<b>Perforated</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} for various applications. A special application arises when there is fluid injection into the <b>perforated</b> <b>tube.</b> Such cases arise when <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes</b> are used for horizontal oil well drilling and French drains. The behaviour of the flow under these conditions {{has led to the}} development of correlations, which consider the effects of the perforations and injection process. However, there are few friction factor correlations in literature, which consider the increased kinetic energy at the <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> outlet caused by fluid injection and acceleration. The current study reports experimental correlations for determining the friction factor of <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes</b> when the additional kinetic energy from the injection process is considered. The friction factor measurements were conducted in copper tubes with an internal diameter of 20. 8 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm at three nondimensional pitches of 0. 375, 0. 75 and 1. 5. A perforated length-to-diameter ratio of 40 : 1 was used for the <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes.</b> A perforation row contained seven small perforation holes with a diameter of 1. 5 mm spaced evenly around the perimeter of the tube. These perforation rows were staggered row to row, resulting in triangular perforation patterns. Water was used as a test medium with Reynolds numbers at the tube outlet ranging from 20 000 to 60 000. The injection ratio was varied from 0 to 5 % to obtain a total of 135 unique combinations of <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> friction factor data at different injection ratios, Reynolds numbers and nondimensional perforation pitches. The experiments were condensed into friction factor correlations, which allow <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> parameters to be optimisation for minimising pressure losses encountered in draining operations.

The primary components of the system include 1) Spiral-Framed Human Hair-Based Filter, 2) Plastic Medium Mixed Flow Biotower, and 3) Pistia Stratiotes- Based Free Surface Water Wetland System. The first stage Spiral-Framed Human Hair-Based Filter consists of an oil and grease removal apparatus filled with human hair blocks and operated in a spiral plane aimed at removing emulsified oils from wastewater.

40|$|FRP tube {{reinforced}} concrete (FTRC) column {{is a novel}} hybrid concrete column proposed in this thesis. In the FTRC column, FRP tube is placed into the concrete to act as internal reinforcement of the column. Two types of FTRC columns have been investigated. Type I FTRC column is reinforced with <b>perforated</b> FRP <b>tube.</b> Type II FTRC column is reinforced with intact FRP tube, and polymer grid is embedded into the concrete cover to prevent the premature spalling of concrete cover. Both types of FTRC columns are expected to achieve excellent durability under harsh environments as well as superior performance under different loading conditions. This thesis presents experimental and theoretical investigations on the structural behaviour of the proposed FRTC column. The {{first part of the}} research program is concerned with the behaviour of Type I FTRC column under axial compression. Different FRP tube configurations (intact <b>tube,</b> axially <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> and diagonally <b>perforated</b> <b>tube)</b> have been chosen to provide internal reinforcement of FTRC columns. The experimental results show that Type I FTRC column can obtain a considerable amount of strength and ductility under axial compression. Axially <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> performed better than diagonally <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> in improving the strength and ductility of Type I FTRC columns. Numerical simulations have also been carried out to assess the influence of tube perforations on the performance of Type I FTRC columns. In addition, the axial compressive behaviour of <b>perforated</b> FRP <b>tube</b> has been investigated. Different parameters that influence the performance of <b>perforated</b> FRP <b>tube</b> under axial compression have been investigated. Design-oriented equations have been proposed to predict the performance of <b>perforated</b> FRP <b>tube</b> under axial compression. The second part of the research program is concerned with the behaviour of Type II FTRC column under axial compression. In addition to Type II FTRC columns, FRP confined concrete columns have also been tested for comparison. The experimental results indicate that, if properly designed, Type II FTRC columns can perform better than FRP confined concrete columns in terms of strength and ductility. Based on the test results, an analytical model has been developed. The analytical model has been verified by the test results. The model has been subsequently adopted to investigate the influences of various parameters on the axial compressive behaviour of Type II FTRC column. In addition, the behaviour of concrete confined solely by polymer grid under axial compression has been studied. Based on the test results in this study as well as previous studies, an analytical model has been developed for the axial compressive behaviour of polymer grid confined concrete with strain-softening response. The last part of the research program is focused on the behaviour of both types of FTRC specimens under different loading conditions. Four groups of 16 specimens have been tested under concentric, 25 mm eccentric, 50 mm eccentric, and four-point loadings. All specimens were 240 mm in diameter and 800 mm in height. In addition to FTRC specimens, specimens reinforced with longitudinal steel bars and steel helices have also been tested for comparison. Results from the experimental investigations show that FRP tubes significantly increase the load carrying capacity and ductility of FTRC specimens. Type II FTRC specimens performed better than Type I FTRC specimens as well as specimens reinforced with longitudinal steel bars and helices in terms of strength and ductility. In addition, an analytical procedure has been developed for the performance of FTRC specimens under different loading conditions.

In this work, the performance of a passive solar heating system used to serve as a crop grow gutter is studied. The experiments were performed during autumn and winter of 2007 in two greenhouses, located at the University of Thessaly near Volos, Greece, cultivated with a tomato crop. One greenhouse was used for control and plants were grown in rockwool slabs located in a commercial grow gutter, while in the second greenhouse the rockwool slabs were located over the new grow gutter. The gutter consisted of a water-filled polyethylene tube with a diameter of 0. 45 m combined with two <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes</b> (diameter of 0. 2 m) on the top, in a distance of 0. 25 m between them, to serve as gutter-channel for drained nutrient solution collection.

40|$|Gas {{pulsation}} produces excessive {{noise in}} the piping system of the reciprocating compressor and even causes damage in the piping and the machine. Therefore, {{it is very important}} for reasonable analysis and proper control of pressure pulsation. The <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> attenuator is widely applied in the compressor because of its favourable performance of acoustic attenuation. For the attenuator design, pressure loss and transmission loss are the two equally significant parameters characterizing its performance. Even if an attenuator can greatly reduce the compressor pressure pulsation, but cause large pressure loss, it will not be used yet. So it’s necessary to pursue the attenuator with low pressure loss as well as low pressure pulsation. The traditional method of calculating pressure loss of the attenuator is according to empirical formulas, which only fit for simple structures. But for the <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> attenuator, the flow is complex, and the empirical formulas are not available to calculate the pressure loss. Presently, CFD method is used to calculate pressure loss of the attenuator with complex structure. Most perforated attenuators could consist of hundreds of small holes distributed on the pipe, so three-dimensional flow models ensure the accurate solution. This paper predicts pressure loss of the <b>perforated</b> <b>tube</b> attenuator with various geometry parameters using CFD. A three-dimensional CFD model of the attenuator was established under the following assumptions: (1) The physical parameters of the solid and fluid domain of the attenuator are constant; (2) The flow is steady turbulent flow; (3) The influence of the gravity is ignored; (4) The inlet velocity of the attenuator is homogeneous without impulse effect. The standard - model is used in this paper. The flow through the attenuator follows the law of conservation of mass, law of conservation of momentum and the law of conservation of energy. The solution of the model was implemented with the FVM method of the commercial CFD code fluent. According to the CFD model, the following three aspects were analyzed: (1) The influence of the hole diameter on the pressure loss (2) The influence of porosities on the pressure loss (3) The influence of the inlet velocity on the pressure loss Based on analysis of the above three aspects, an attenuator with low pressure loss as well as low pressure pulsation was designed...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of weak shocks in ducts of complex geometry {{and the sound}} radiation produced by the reflection of a weak shock from the open end of a duct have been investigated. Duct geometries include expansion chambers with and without inlet or outlet tubes extended and enclosed <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes.</b> Internal and external pressure histories of the interaction of weak shocks with simple muffler elements have been recorded using a standard one-shot shock tube and a resonating shock tube. The excitation shock Mach number ranged from 1. 05 to 1. 55. Analytical investigations, including a synthesis of existing works on internal weak-shock interactions of an acoustic treatment of the sound radiation produced by weak shock waves, are presented. Combining the above analyses, models for the reduction in radiated sound per unit of incident shock amplitude, {{as a result of}} inserting a muffler between the source and the tailpipe exit, are developed. For expansion chambers with and without extensions, the dependence of the transmitted and reflected waves and of the radiated sound on area ratio is compared with predictions. In particular, measured transmission coefficients for expansion chambers agree reasonably well with the predictions for all shock strengths; however, for large area ratios, the predicted sound attenuation is not observed, as waves diffracted at the upstream junction cause more sound to be radiated. For expansion chambers with internal extensions, sound attenuation is increased for low incident shock strengths; while for increasing incident shock strength, the internal transmission characteristics deteriorate, the reducing the sound attenuation. For enclosed <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes,</b> the dependence of the transmitted and reflected waves and of the radiated sound on the perforated area ratio and incident shock strength is compared with predictions. For <b>perforated</b> <b>tubes</b> with infinite enclosure, the transmission and reflection coefficients depend on both incident shock strength and perforated area ratio, as predicted. However, agreement with data is obtained only after inserting a perforated discharge coefficient with the perforated area ratio in the theory. The reduction of sound radiation with perforated area ratio is measured for one incident shock strength and then compared with predictions. For small area ratios, there is agreement but for large area ratios the measurements show that less sound is radiated than predicted. For large area ratios, gradual compressions with smooth fronts (not shock fronts) are transmitted, resulting in less radiated sound. Enclosures have no effect on the sound attenuation for small perforate area ratios; however, as the perforate area ratio increases, the enclosure eventually inhibits further increase in sound attenuation...|$|R
