25|$|In recent years, bicycle designs have trended towards {{increased}} specialization, as {{the number}} of casual, recreational and commuter cyclists has grown. For these groups, the industry responded with the hybrid bicycle, sometimes marketed as a <b>city</b> <b>bike,</b> cross bike, or commuter bike. Hybrid bicycles combine elements of road racing and mountain bikes, though the term is applied {{to a wide variety of}} bicycle types. Hybrid bicycles and commuter bicycles can range from fast and light racing-type bicycles with flat bars and other minimal concessions to casual use, to wider-tired bikes designed for primarily for comfort, load-carrying, and increased versatility over a range of different road surfaces. Enclosed hub gears have become popular again - now with up to 8, 11 or 14 gears - for such bicycles due to ease of maintenance and improved technology.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 Copenhagen-based Danish {{urban design}} {{consultant}} Jan Gehl {{was hired by}} the New York City Department of Transportation to re-imagine New York City streets by introducing designs to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists. In this connection, Gehl took NYC planning chief Amanda Burden and transportation czar Janette Sadik-Khan on a bike trip around Copenhagen to show them what could be done for New York. Former British transport minister Andrew Adonis has also cycled the streets of Copenhagen in search of inspiration. As a result of Russian president Dmitri Medvedev's favorable impressions of Copenhagen's biking system during his visit to Denmark, 14 city bikes were sent to St Petersburg at the beginning of June 2010 where they will be available to citizens on an experimental basis. Medvedev believes the <b>city</b> <b>bike</b> approach could reduce traffic congestion in the city. The Danish pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai had been specially designed by BIG Architects. It allowed visitors to gain experience of cycling in Copenhagen by taking one of its 300 city bikes along the cycle paths which were incorporated throughout the structure. and city has since signed its first sister cities agreement with Beijing with a major goal of the cooperation being to provide inspiration to Beijing on how it can reintroduce the bicycle as a major mode of transport in the city.|$|E

50|$|The {{suitability}} {{and availability}} of fully outfitted <b>city</b> <b>bikes</b> depends on multiple factors, including local terrain, city density, car traffic, weather, and bicycle infrastructure.

However, such bikes are also used in hilly Switzerland, including Basel and Bern, where 23% and 15% of daily trips are made by bicycle respectively.|$|R
