40|$|This brief aims {{to assess}} the {{coherence}} of the training initiatives taken at the EU level {{in the field of}} the civilian dimension of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The analysis focuses on the training for personnel involved in Civilian Crisis Management (CCM), at both strategic and operational levels. Training for CCM constitutes a significant dimension of the strengthening of EU capabilities in the field of CSDP. It contributes {{to the development of a}} European security culture (Council of the European Union, 2004 : 3) by promoting a common understanding of the <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> among personnel from the EU institutions and the Member States. Training also improves the quality of <b>CSDP</b> <b>mission</b> personnel, which in turn directly influences the effectiveness with which they fulfil their tasks (Khol, 2008 : 6). Considering the existence of different training initiatives in the field of <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> at the EU level, it seems relevant to try {{to assess the}}ir coherence. Since it determines the strength of the link between training needs and training activities, the analysis of the training needs assessment phase will constitute the first dimension of the assessment of the coherence EGMONT Royal Institute for International Relations of these initiatives. The range of actions and their impact on the coherence of the overall training framework in <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> will constitute the second dimension. In order to contextualize this analysis, it should be stated that, firstly, training is only one particular aspect of a broader recruitment issue. It should be put into perspective therefore with other aspects of this problem such as the development of rosters of personnel. Secondly, when focusing on EU initiatives, it should be kept in mind that this analysis will cover only a small aspect of the training activities conducted in <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> given the fact that Member States provide a significant majority of these training activities...|$|R

The European Union (EU) currently lacks a comprehensive agreement {{on where the}} EU will engage in crisis management missions under the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) framework. This thesis investigates the motives for why the European Union engages in military or civilian operations under the framework of CSDP. Predominant research suggests the three dominant factors motivating the EU to engage in CSDP are national interests of the Member States; the EU is a supranational institution seeking to balance against the U. S.; and national political parties dominate foreign policy of the Member States. These three dominant factors {{lead to the development}} of three hypotheses for why the EU engages in military operations under the framework of CSDP. The first hypothesis suggests the EU elects to undertake <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> as a means of balancing against United States' hegemony. The second hypothesis suggests the EU undertakes <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> because of the national interest of the dominant nations, specifically, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The final hypothesis suggests that the national political parties and their political stances influence when the EU will engage in military or <b>civilian</b> operations under <b>CSDP.</b> These hypotheses are tested using three case studies to examine what the dominant factor is in <b>CSDP</b> <b>mission</b> selection. The three cases represent missions outside of Europe where there is significant risk for EU troops and, therefore, significant political risk for EU Member State politicians. The three <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> used in the case study section are the EU mission EUFOR Artemis to Bunia the Democratic Republic of Congo, EUPOL Afghanistan and EUNAVFOR Somalia. After examining the three cases within the boundaries of the three hypotheses, this thesis concludes that the national interests of the dominant Member States are the most significant motive for <b>CSDP</b> <b>mission</b> selection. While the other two motives {{play a role in the}} decision-making process, they are not nearly as dominant as that of the Member States' national interests...|$|R
40|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) in 1999, the EU aimed to tackle challenges in the field of security by deploying various military, police, justice and rule of law missions in troubled crisis areas. The Lisbon Treaty put the instrument of <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> on a new height, putting it under the umbrella of the European External Action Service with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy / Vice -President of the European Commission as their highest representative. <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> - while dealing with civilian crisis management in conflict and post- conflict countries - are operating in a highly political environment with demands and direction coming from the EU Member States, the EU institution s, the Host Nations and other international actors. Common values and norms applying to <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> are underdeveloped and not well communicated. Mandates are often not clearly defined. The work force is mainly seconded by the Member States and highly di verse in respect to culture, professional background and experience and language. Women are strongly underrepresented. Even though leadership is crucial in such a challenging environment, it has never been addressed within the CSDP structures until very recently. This thesis analysis the complexities of <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> and demands put on leadership in such an environment. Furthermore, it defines best practices and closes with recommendations on how the leadership culture in <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> can be improved. Results are generated by using literature analysis, interviews with key stakeholders, online questionnaires and the authors own work experience in a <b>CSDP</b> <b>Mission.</b> For <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> to become even more successful a stronger emphasis on the development of leadership culture seems appropriate. Starting from creating a leadership development strategy, defining standard guidelines and principals for recruitment and promotion of personnel, addressing the problem of gender imbalance, importance should be also put on defining a favored leadership style and common values. Future leaders should be skilled and experienced in working in a highly politicised environment leading and empowering a multi-cultural, diverse work force. With an effective leadership culture <b>CSDP</b> <b>Missions</b> will succeed in being a strong EU actor in civilian crisis management and helping to foster security and maintain peace in the world...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{conditions}} under which incumbent regimes in the Eastern Neighbourhood cooperate effectively with <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> by adhering to and adopting the objectives set out by their mandates. In establishing whether and under what circumstances <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> successfully cooperate with third country governments by inducing the acceptance of and adherence to their mandates, this thesis reclaims a focus on the local dimension of EU partner countries in order to explore the extent to which domestic stakeholders display agency in their relations with the EU and are able to constrain and/or facilitate its foreign policy. It thus asks: under what conditions do incumbent regimes in host countries embrace EU-driven strategies and reforms? The thesis examines two CSDP functions – rule transfer and confidence-building – across three <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> in the Eastern Neighbourhood: the EUJUST Themis rule of law mission to Georgia, the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) and the European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) to Georgia. Drawing on rational-choice assumptions and recent academic contributions to the Eastern Neighbourhood literature, this thesis starts from the premise that the sine qua non condition for effective cooperation between <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> and incumbent regimes in the Eastern Neighbourhood is the compatibility between EU objectives and the incumbent regimes’ intrinsic preference for gaining and/or maintaining political power. Defined as preferential fit, the ‘match’ between the goals of EU missions – as highlighted by their mandates – and the political agendas of national governments in ENP countries emerges as the necessary condition that facilitates effective EU-ENP cooperation. In addition to confirming the centrality of the agency-oriented concept of ‘preferential fit’ for the development of effective cooperation between the EU and its Eastern neighbours, the findings outlined in the four empirical-analytical chapters also identify the conditions which shape the cost-benefit calculations of national governments: 1. The competing strategies of domestic veto players; 2. The potential for alternative coalitions (Russia, US other international organisations); 3. The cost-effectiveness of threats and side-payments (i. e. EU policy-specific conditionality; and EU capacity-building) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} and evaluates the Common Security and Defence Policy (<b>CSDP)</b> <b>mission</b> planning process, i. e. the procedural model for planning, launching and reviewing CSDP operations. It {{shows that the}} EU has developed an intricate planning mechanism by generously drawing upon existing North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) planning doctrine while adding a distinct European touch. These innovations amount to expanding military planning models to civilian operations, tightening political oversight and fostering close links and cooperative mechanisms with the UN peacekeeping system. As such, the innovations mostly pertain to the political aspects of mission planning. However, some problems persist at the strategic and operational levels of mission planning, such as institutional arrangements for planning and commanding operations, procedures pertaining to force generation and inter-pillar coordination, and operational planning doctrine. Lessons learned from recent operational experiences indicate that the mental gap between the political and operational level {{is in need of}} remediation.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the little explored issue of non-state actor (NSA) participation in the European Union’s (EU) Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).

Drawing on interviews with policy-makers and NSA representatives, the article analyses the practices of the EU in its engagement with NSAs, focusing on civilian missions in Georgia and Palestine. It shows that such engagement is more intense during implementation {{at the level of}} <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> rather than during policy-making in Brussels. It argues that a combination of rational choice-based (functional needs of policy-makers and intensity of NSA advocacy) and constructivist (organisational and individual cultures) explanations helps us better understand why CSDP structures open up to NSAs. The article contributes to the nascent academic and policy debate on EU–civil society cooperation in CSDP and, more broadly, to the studies of informal governance in the EU and NSA participation in international organisations. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in 1999, the EU aimed to tackle challenges in the field of security by deploying various police and military missions in troubled crisis areas. The consolidation of the CSDP raised hopes for the EU’s role in external affairs. However, the majority of <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> are still on a small scale.

This paper analyses some of the major provisions of the Lisbon Treaty that impact upon the CSDP.

40|$|France has {{traditionally}} been the most keen proponent for more capable European Union (EU) defense institutions. Its aspirations for EU's autonomy has several times resulted in isolation among its EU partners.

In 2009, France returned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Integrated Military Structure after an interlude of 40 years.

Applying classical and structural realist theory, this master thesis provides a case study of France's military intervention in Mali, launched on 11 January 2013. The analysis examines the EU vs NATO dichotomy and shows how the intervention in Mali can be perceived as an attempt to enhance the EU as a global security actor.

This ARI {{provides an}} overview of the EU’s capability for the planning, command and control of CSDP military operations and offers some practical recommendations. It argues that the lack of a permanent operational planning capability hampers flexibility in the Union’s planning process, as politico-strategic deliberations over potential <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> lack the crucial operational expertise necessary to address crucial political questions, such as how many troops are needed and for how long or how much the mission will cost. Secondly, the lack of an operational planning capability denies the Union the capacity to develop (advance) contingency planning products, that are so crucial in situations where rapid reaction is required. Finally, the lack of a permanent command and control infrastructure has a negative impact upon the quality and security of the Union’s military Communication and Information Systems (CIS) and hampers the kind of overall situational awareness offered by a central command, so vital for a Union that aims to think more strategically (as argued in the 2008 revision of the European Security Strategy) ...|$|R

As the EU developed {{its foreign}} and security policy, a blend of internal security and external stability concerns, {{as well as the}} reference to international legal and humanitarian norms, required it to try tackling (some of) these conflicts.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{advocacy}} strategies {{and influence of}} interest groups in EU foreign policy. It examines in particular the impact of institutional factors on the strategies and lobbying outcomes. Conceptually, it {{contributes to the literature}} on interest groups and lobbying in the EU and to the study of non-state actor participation in international organisations. Conceptualising EU foreign policy as multi-level and multi-pillar, the study inquires into the relationship between policy regime (ranging from the Community method to the intergovernmental method, as these predominate in different areas of EU external relations) and the degree and type of interest group influence. To this end the thesis compares three examples of EU foreign policy: visa liberalisation towards the Eastern neighbours; sanctions towards Belarus; and <b>CSDP</b> <b>missions</b> in Georgia and Palestine. The research reveals that interest groups engage in multi-level lobbying even in those policy areas that are ruled by the intergovernmental method. Intergovernmentalism limits formal access to policymakers, but groups and policymakers build channels for informal access. To some extent contrary to the predications of established theories, this allows interest groups to exert some degree of influence even on policy dossiers in which intergovernmental arrangements prevail. In such policy domains, groups opposing change do not always succeed, despite the veto opportunities that intergovernmentalism provides. While this is a significant finding, the thesis also notes how interest group influence is most commonly exerted upon relatively technical issues and at later stages of the policy cycle. Moreover, the study emphasises that institutional structures are not the only relevant factor in explaining group influence. Group-level characteristics, including material resources, condition groups’ ability to adapt to complex decision-making in EU foreign policy. The thesis concludes that a combination of factors is required to capture the influence of interest groups over EU foreign policy...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{equality}} {{being considered}} one of the key normative foundations of the EU, gender has not yet been mainstreamed within the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This article investigates the impact of institutional structures on the inclusion of a gender dimension in this policy area. The article adopts Woodward’s (2003) model of feminist triangles to unpack the role of actors and processes; specifically, highlighting key innovations and missed opportunities to integrate gender into CSDP. Focusing in particular on femocrats, the article argues that for gender mainstreaming to take place, the office of the Gender Advisor needs to bridge the division between the military and <b>civilian</b> dimension of <b>CSDP.</b> It concludes that CSDP remains largely gender blind in spite of the EU’s adoption of an action plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security...|$|R
40|$|After an {{overview}} of the practice concerning <b>civilian</b> and military <b>CSDP</b> operations, this paper argues that international peace and security is a EU normative value, a broad legal principle in particular, in the sense that EU institutions are legally bound to pursue and promote it throughout the world. It is moreover suggested that, as a matter of its internal validity, EU may not launch peace keeping operations, including enforcement actions or peace enforcement operation falling under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, without a Se- curity Council authorization or welcoming. However, the consent of the host State gov- ernment suffices as long as the CSDP operation is purely civilian. Certainly, the EU does not deliver on the promise of universal peace and security. That is due to the inadequacy of the current EU legal framework, which after all reflects a strong political division of prospects and interests among Member States...|$|R

In his view, {{the fact that his}} country made a decision to contribute “boots on the ground” to the European Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) was astonishing, to say the least: “Things like Mali, you sometimes wonder how these thing happen, even if you are part of them (Havranek 2013). ” Thus a decision to participate in this latest CT motivated (building a Malian military capable of taking on the jihadists of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, AQIM) EU venture in Africa seems not to have been preceded by a careful analysis and weighting of the options on behalf of his country. In fact, it seemed like a knee jerk reaction to a call for troops from France and subsequently from Brussels. In the end, we might even speculate if, in this very case, the Czech Republic duly settled on a number of troops to be sent to Mali (very low – in dozens) and comfortably ticked off the box on its involvement in yet another Common Security and Defence Policy (<b>CSDP)</b> military <b>mission</b> in Africa, and its contribution to external aspects of combating terrorism on EU level.
