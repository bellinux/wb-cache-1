Detainees in camps are required to work for little or no pay; while Chinese law requires that prison laborers' workday be limited to 12 hours a day, The United States Department of State and the Laogai Research Foundation have speculated that re-education through labor detainees are forced to work longer. [...] In 2001, sociologist Dean Rojek estimated that detainees generally worked six days a week, [...] "in total silence." [...] Much of the labor done by re-education through labor detainees is geared towards agriculture or producing goods, {{many of which are}} sold internationally, since re-education through labor detainees are not counted as official [...] "prisoners" [...] and therefore not subject to international treaties. [...] They also perform work ranging [...] "from tending vegetables and emptying septic pits to <b>cutting</b> <b>stone</b> blocks and construction work." ...|$|E

Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, 40 workers of Hamadan city <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> who worked with <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> machines were examined. Measuring exposure to hand-arm vibration was performed by standard methods ISO 5349. Symptoms related hand-arm vibration syndrome using a questionnaire construction was studied.
