40|$|Abstract. Multi-walled carbon {{nanotube}} (MWNT) was filled into poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) matrix and MWNT/PET composite was prepared by injection molding process. The microstructure and electrical <b>conductive</b> <b>property</b> were investigated carefully. After injection molding, the electrical conductivity of injected sample decreased sharply {{because of the}} orientation of CNT due to strong shearing force. The electrical conductive network of CNT had been destroyed after orientation of CNT. Because of the difference of shearing rate between the surface and the body center during the injection molding process, a skin-core structure emerged.

Burroughes et al., which involved a single layer of poly(p-phenylene vinylene). However multilayer OLEDs can be fabricated with two or more layers {{in order to improve}} device efficiency. As well as <b>conductive</b> <b>properties,</b> different materials may be chosen to aid charge injection at electrodes by providing a more gradual electronic profile, or block a charge from reaching the opposite electrode and being wasted. Many modern OLEDs incorporate a simple bilayer structure, consisting of a conductive layer and an emissive layer. [...] More recent developments in OLED architecture improves quantum efficiency (up to 19%) by using a graded heterojunction. In the graded heterojunction architecture, the composition of hole and electron-transport materials varies continuously within the emissive layer with a dopant emitter. The graded heterojunction architecture combines the benefits of both conventional architectures by improving charge injection while simultaneously balancing charge transport within the emissive region.|$|E

Generally, high filler loadings are needed to get better electrical and thermal conductive performance. However, too high filler loading will deteriorate the mechanical property. Therefore, it is still a challenge for the preparation of ECAs with a high electrical and thermal conductivity without adversely affecting the mechanical properties.|$|R

It should be noted that there is only limited improvement for the ratio of inductance and resistance. The efficient way to get a larger quality factor is to increase the natural resonant frequency.
