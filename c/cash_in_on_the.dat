5|$|Dirty Duck {{received}} mostly negative reviews, {{with many}} criticizing it for its crude humor and others seeing {{the film as}} an attempt to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The film fared better on home video and is now considered a cult film.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January, the Birmingham Mail {{reported}} that items of Benefits Street branded merchandise, such as mugs and T-shirts, were being produced for sale {{over the internet}} by individuals wishing to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> programme.|$|E
5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of 133African slaves by {{the crew of}} the British slave ship Zong in the days following 29November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> insurance on the slaves, thus not losing money on the slaves who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E
50|$|Carson himself {{decided to}} move on to other locations, but was unsuccessful. He {{returned}} to Carson Creek, but never really <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success. He died in 1853 of rheumatism, near poverty.|$|R
50|$|A new {{boutique}} is <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bat-craze sweeping Gotham. Captain Gordon must {{cooperate with}} the FBI when a circuit killer strikes in Gotham.

50|$|Espinal's strong preseason {{performance}} {{earned him}} a spot in Coach Thomas Rongen's starting eleven for the Rowdies first match of the 2015 season against the San Antonio Scorpions. Espinal <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opportunity, scoring a goal in first half stoppage time off an assist by Darnell King.|$|R
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did {{not sit well with}} the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s when Australia's Seven Network was {{broadcasting}} both Sons and Daughters and A Country Practice, {{it decided to}} <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shows' success, and provide the shows with some publicity, by producing and releasing a cast album.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} surge in {{popularity}} of heritage turkeys, some farmers have (perhaps unknowingly) passed off birds which {{do not meet the}} basic definition of true heritage birds in an effort to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon. To be a true heritage turkey, birds must meet three specific criteria.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Diane's {{return to the}} soap in 2008 for Frank's funeral, Paul English from the Daily Record accused EastEnders of using actor Mike Reid's real death as [...] "an opportunity to reintroduce some popular old faces. Boiled down, it's <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dead - but it's how Frank might have done it himself." ...|$|R
50|$|Ecotourism in Costa Rica {{is one of}} the key {{activities}} of the tourism industry in the country. By the early 1990s, Costa Rica became known as the poster child of ecotourism. The country is among many developing nations that look to ecotourism as a way of <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> growing demand for this popular trend of travel.|$|R
2500|$|Local bands mimicked British and American bands. [...] Two {{types of}} local Cantonese music {{appeared}} in the market nearly concurrently in 1973: one type <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> popularity of TVB's drama series based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more traditional lyrical styles. The other was more western style music largely from Polydor Hong Kong(寶麗多唱片). [...] Notable singers from the era include Liza Wang (汪明荃) and Paula Tsui(徐小鳳).|$|R
25|$|The Glider Boat was {{intended}} as a strictly recreational aircraft, to be towed from the water surface by a powered boat. The company intended to produce a very inexpensive aircraft to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sudden popularity of aviation following Charles Lindbergh’s 1927 solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|As mopane worms {{represent}} an important {{sector in the}} local rural economy, they attract {{large numbers of people}} who seek to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> profits from selling the insects as food. This circumstance leads to overharvesting, and fewer mopane worms the following year. In some areas, farmers and communities have taken steps to reach a balance, so that each year may yield maximum returns without compromising the following year's harvest.|$|E
25|$|The coin {{was created}} in order to compete with foreign 24-karat gold bullion coins. Since investors {{sometimes}} prefer 99.99% pure gold over the 91.67% gold used in the American Gold Eagle, many were choosing non-U.S. coins, such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, to meet their bullion needs. With the American Buffalo coin, the U.S. government hopes {{to increase the amount}} of U.S. gold sales and <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 24-karat sales, which makes up about 60% of the world gold market.|$|E
40|$|The second-biggest selling provincial daily {{newspaper}} in the nation is a paper that reflects the lifestyle choices Australians have been making over the previous three decades. They have been converging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast to work, to play and to retire. <b>The</b> newspaper <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> amazing development has been the Gold Coast Bulletin, whose circulation topped 45, 000 {{in the first half}} of 2001...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt: Allan Hutchinson, an Osgoode Hall law {{professor}} commissioned {{to write a}} report about problems with the contingency fee system for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, called double dipping “egregious” and noted that personal injury lawyers mounted “concerted opposition” to his attempts to write the report. In his report, he said “there is suggestive evidence that lawyers are <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opportunities for enhancing their fees afforded by contingency fee agreements. ...|$|R
25|$|Also in 1990, Enigma Records, {{already having}} sold its {{interest}} in the band to the Geffen label, illegally released and distributed Fall from Grace, an unauthorized bootleg live album featuring songs from their first two releases and recorded at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The album was released without any input from the band members with regard to its songs, contents, credits, concepts, or artwork. The band learned of its existence when they stumbled upon it in a record store <b>in</b> Tucson, Arizona, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night prior to suffering a near-fatal auto accident. Enigma Records folded after <b>the</b> release, <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sales. The album was picked up, manufactured and distributed by Capitol Records, also possibly illegally.|$|R
25|$|Although Dudley and Jeczalik {{had already}} {{dissolved}} the group, in 1990 they {{assisted in the}} promotion of the lightly remixed compilation The Ambient Collection, which the China label released to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> burgeoning ambient house scene. Jeczalik approved the remixes that appeared on The FON Mixes the following year. The rest of the decade saw China Records releasing further Art of Noise compilations: The Drum and Bass Collection, Art Works, and reissues of Best of without the ZTT-era tracks. Some of these featured new remixes by other artists.|$|E
25|$|Blackjack and Poker Royale {{signified}} {{the beginnings}} of GSN's attempts to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV poker craze at the time. In 2006, GSN introduced High Stakes Poker, a poker show with a private game format among professional players, and also aired additional series World Series of Blackjack and a spinoff, Celebrity Blackjack. One {{of the most popular}} shows from the initial TV poker boom, the World Poker Tour, was slated to move from the Travel Channel to GSN on March 24, 2008. Within a year of GSN's revamp, it began returning its focus primarily to studio-based game shows.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{description}} of sex between women in the first poem, the book was never legally challenged; the passage seems explicit now, but {{at a time when}} lesbianism was virtually invisible in American culture, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice may not have understood its imagery. Others were not as naïve, and Bruno was able to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book's reputation by raising the price from fifteen to fifty cents and pocketing the difference. Twenty years later she used him as one of the models for Felix Volkbein in Nightwood, caricaturing his pretensions to nobility and his habit of bowing down before anyone titled or important.|$|E
50|$|After the Napoleonic war, many {{printers}} <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public’s {{demand for}} news and printed small penny papers, {{each with a}} topical story. In 1818 James Catnach printed an edition on a small sheet in which he suggested that certain local butchers in Drury Lane had received two human bodies which they intended to sell as pork. In the ensuing court case he eventually pleaded guilty and was sent to Clerkenwell Prison for 6 months, during which time his mother and sisters manned the presses.|$|R
3000|$|In addition, these {{instruments}} provide incentives to collude and <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> [...] <b>the</b> government subsidy, for example, taking up subsidized working hour reductions when {{this would be}} unnecessary to prevent separations.|$|R
50|$|Coming {{to know of}} his past, Jothy tries {{desperate to}} correct his ways and set him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right path. Meanwhile Dr Ramakrishnan (Ashish Vidyarthi) takes up the task of testing a {{medicine}} devised by a foreign company, which may come handy in killing people in thousands especially during times of wars. Dr Ramakrishnan chooses Jothy's sister and E's grandmother as specimen for <b>the</b> test. He <b>cashes</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ignorance to slum-dwellers. Things take a turn, when E rescues Dr Ramakrishnan from a murder bid by Nellai Mani (Pasupathy).|$|R
25|$|From 1957-62, the Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association used Arden St to {{hold its}} Greyhound meetings. The dogs ran on a track that formed a {{perimeter}} around the oval. Races were held on Monday nights and regularly attracted crowds of 5000, with double that number in attendance on the night when Rookie Rebel won the first Australian Cup in 1958. The Arden Street days are described as being {{the best in the}} history of Melbourne greyhound racing. Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association shifted its meetings to Olympic Park in 1962 after the Arden Street's ground committee sought to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the dogs by doubling the rent.|$|E
25|$|Property {{prices have}} {{continued}} to rise steeply since {{the early years of}} the 21st century as property developers have moved to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> area's trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries have, as a result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.|$|E
25|$|By 1553, the Board of Ordnance in London had {{purchased}} more than 250 of Levett's guns. At a stroke, this English parson {{who had the}} armaments business thrust on him by {{death in the family}} had morphed into a full-blown entrepreneur. Iron casting and cannon-making became England's first modern industrial economy. Old landowning families like the Sidneys, the Carylls, the Coverts and the Gratwickes rushed to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boom, which lasted for more than two centuries. The wars of Henry VIII were good for business: the 20 blast furnaces and 28 forges in Sussex in 1549 more than doubled in 25 years to 50 furnaces and 60 forges. The secret was in the English method of vertical casting.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Greg Theakston {{started a}} fanzine called The Betty Pages and recounted tales of her life, {{particularly}} the camera club days. For {{the next seven}} years, the magazine sparked a worldwide interest in Page. Women dyed their hair and cut it into bangs {{in an attempt to}} emulate the [...] "Dark Angel". The media caught wind of the phenomenon and wrote numerous articles about her, more often than not with Theakston's help. Since almost all of her photos were in the public domain, opportunists launched related products and <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> burgeoning craze.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Carlson {{was again}} asked by Trotter to host {{an evening of}} world-famous chefs. This time Trotter insisted on paying and Carlson survived the evening without incident. Carlson {{continues}} to work long-hours, sometimes with his family at his side, but says he would not change anything, describing cooking as a [...] "dream job." [...] He has {{said he has no}} interest <b>in</b> <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current celebrity-chef craze, and does not see himself ever leaving Chicago. [...] He was selected to appear on Iron Chef America, but declined to participate.|$|R
2500|$|America {{first saw}} the single of [...] "A Hard Day's Night" [...] on 13 July 1964, {{featuring}} [...] "I Should Have Known Better" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> B-side, and released by Capitol Records. Capitol {{had been in a}} quandary about <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success of the movie A Hard Day's Night, as United Artists held the publishing rights for the soundtrack (thus owning the rights to release the album of the same title). However, there was nothing preventing Capitol from releasing the songs in other forms, leading to six out of the seven songs from the movie's soundtrack coming out on singles.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{building}} programme that also cleared the inner city slums, from the 1950s onwards, historic Georgian Dublin came under concerted attack by the Irish Government's development policies. Whole swathes of 18th-century houses were demolished, notably in Fitzwilliam Street and St Stephen's Green, to make way for utilitarian office blocks and government departments. Much of this development was fuelled by property developers and speculators keen to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> buoyant property markets of the 1960s, late 1970s and 1980s. Many schemes were built by Government supporters with the intention of profitably letting to highly desirable State tenants such as government departments and State agencies. It has been proven that many buildings were approved by government ministers personally connected with the developers involved, often {{to the detriment of the}} taxpayer and the proper planning and preservation of Dublin city.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the 90-minute format was intended to be temporary, with the added time used to prepare a storyline for a spinoff, Texas in 1980. For upon its debut, the mother show contracted to 60 minutes again, this time moving to 2/1 Central, where it settled for the remaining 19 years of its run. Texas, starring the hugely popular Beverlee McKinsey and attempting to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dallas craze, while itself not a success, may have caused further erosion of Another World viewership, {{to the point that it}} was no longer NBC's highest-rated serial, losing that position to Days of our Lives (which itself, along with the rest of NBC's daytime lineup, was in serious ratings trouble). Another World fell from eighth to as low as 11th in the ratings chart, and by the 1981–1982 television season it sunk so low in the Nielsens to 4.7 (a drop of 3.9 points in four seasons). Much like General Hospital winning the 3/2 slot for ABC, One Life to Live came in strong at 2/1, with CBS attempting to get its new Capitol off the ground during that period.|$|E
500|$|Gold Medal Books quickly {{followed}} Women's Barracks with Spring Fire, eager to <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unprecedented sales, and it sold almost [...] copies in 1952. Vin Packer, {{whose real name}} is Marijane Meaker, and Gold Medal Books were overwhelmed with mail from women who identified with the lesbian characters.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, Poundland's then-owners Advent International were {{planning}} <b>on</b> <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> resurgence <b>in</b> discount retailers by preparing {{to put the}} chain up for sale. The report came as figures showed that value retailers were seeing a business boom in the current economic climate, with Barclays Private Equity expressing an interest in a potential take-over of Poundland for about £200 million. On Tuesday 4 May 2010, {{it was announced that}} Poundland had been sold to US private equity firm Warburg Pincus for £200 million and was the subject of an Initial Public Offering in March 2014.|$|R
500|$|In 1963, Clancy {{appeared}} in nine {{games as a}} halfback and also returned punts and kickoffs. [...] He generated 520 yards of total offense: 228yards on kickoff returns, 109yards rushing, 105yards on punt returns, and 78yard receiving. [...] Against Minnesota in 1963, he fumbled a punt at Michigan's 35-yard line; the ball rolled toward the Michigan goal line and was recovered by Michigan at its own 16-yard line. [...] Michigan punted from deep in its own territory on second down, and Minnesota <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field position with the game's only touchdown in a 6–0 Minnesota victory.|$|R
50|$|A posthumous album, La voix d'un ange, was {{released}} {{a month and}} a half after his death by his record company Universal Music Group France, with profits going towards the Association Grégory Lemarchal. This release was not without controversy as the record company was accused of <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public attention caused by his death. Despite the controversy the album was a success, topping both the French Digital and Album Charts in addition to the Belgian (Wallonia) Album Chart. The album was certified Platinum by the IFPI for sales of more than 1 million copies across Europe.|$|R
