However, the attitude of new authorities to Polish minority are not very consistent. The new laws are insufficient, and the local levels of Belarusian government are largely unwilling to accept the aspirations of their own ethnic Poles, making them into new targets for state-sanctioned intolerance, according to 2005 report by The Economist.|$|R

On 25 March 1991, Tuđman and Slobodan Milošević met at Karađorđevo and on 12 July Tuđman met with Izetbegović and Milošević in Split. The Karađorđevo meeting became controversial due to claims that the two presidents discussed the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia.

50|$|Kosanke sees such {{a debate}} as {{irrelevant}} since, {{in the absence}} of statutory law, the non-aggression principle (NAP) is naturally enforced, because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereign</b> individuals naturally expel aggressors {{in the same way that}} ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace.

[...] Contemporary comparisons are made with [...] "the Germanic body" [...] (the Kingdom <b>of</b> Germany), a <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereigns</b> that support a feeble and precarious union; Poland, unfit for self-government and self-defense; and Switzerland, in practice a severed league due to differences of religion.|$|R

In the mid-1990s, Yuri Matochkin, the oblast's first post-Soviet governor, demanded a special relationship with the EU and threatened a referendum on secession, abetting fears in Moscow about the centrifugal forces of separatism. His attempts at elevating the oblast's status to that <b>of</b> a <b>sovereign</b> <b>republic</b> associated with the Russian Federation yielded no results. Around the same time, the secessionist Baltic Republican Party, banned in 2005, aimed at establishing the oblast as the [...] "fourth Baltic state". However, an organized secessionist movement has never emerged there and surveys indicate strong support for remaining a part of Russia.|$|R
