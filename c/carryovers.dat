5|$|The {{afternoon}} draw {{consisted of}} skins play. Allison Pottinger and Margaretha Sigfridsson {{played in the}} women's skins game. Pottinger held an early lead after four straight skins, but Sigfridsson capitalized on missed shots from Pottinger to win the last four skins and the game. Heath McCormick and Niklas Edin played in the men's skins game, where a series of <b>carryovers</b> saw Edin winning the last skin, worth {{three and a half}} points, and the game. A mixed team of John Morris, Beth Iskiw, Ben Hebert, and Jessica Mair played Tom Brewster, Anna Sloan, Scott Andrews, and Claire Hamilton in the mixed skins game. Morris, who skipped against Brewster, held control over the game and limited Brewster in scoring. Brewster won the last point on a draw to the button, giving Team World an 8–7 edge {{in the first round of}} skins play.|$|E
5|$|The evening draw also {{consisted}} of skins play. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott {{played in the}} women's skins game, in which Jones dominated, scoring four skins and winning four points for Team North America. Glenn Howard and Thomas Ulsrud played in the men's skins game. Ulsrud played a fairly open game, forcing <b>carryovers</b> for five ends until a misfire from Ulsrud led to Howard making the cup-winning shot, scoring three points with a tap for two points. Ulsrud won the remaining points in the game on a draw to the button. A mixed team of Kevin Martin, Heather Nedohin, Marc Kennedy, and Laine Peters played Eve Muirhead, Greg Drummond, Vicki Adams, and Michael Goodfellow in the mixed skins game. Martin skipped against Muirhead and controlled most of the game, securing four points on four skins before Muirhead took the last skin. Team North America took a 10½–4½ point edge {{in the second round}} of skins play, giving them a CAD$13,000 bonus for winning the skins rounds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Ecological <b>carryover</b> effects {{occur when}} an individual’s {{previous}} history and experiences explain their current performance. It is becoming clear that ecological <b>carryover</b> effects {{are a common}} phenomenon across taxa, and {{have the potential to}} play an important role in governing individual fitness and population dynamics. <b>Carryover</b> effects may reduce the success of conservation efforts aimed at slowing or reversing biodiversity loss. Failure to consider <b>carryover</b> effects might lead to erroneous conclusions about the effectiveness of conservation measures. We suggest that <b>carryover</b> effects are considered explicitly in threat assessment and conservation planning, in order to understand the long-term consequences of stressors, target efforts more effectively, and ensure that the success or failure of conservation efforts is tracked more accurately. We encourage proactive research focused on the proximate mechanisms underlying <b>carryover</b> effects, so that predictive measures of <b>carryover</b> effects in wild populations can be developed and refined. Finally, we suggest that in some cases, positive <b>carryover</b> effects could be exploited for conservation benefit. We conclude that the failure to consider <b>carryover</b> effects in conservation science and practice may put imperiled populations at further risk...|$|R

40|$|Non-pregnant {{cows are}} {{generally}} culled from dairy herds {{and replaced with}} two-year-old heifers. Alternatively, non-pregnant cows can be dried-off {{at the end of}} lactation, retained for one year (carried over), before being mated and returned to a milking herd in the following year. In this study, calving interval was used as a tool to identify and define the <b>carryover</b> cow population in spring-calving dairy herds. Linear modelling methods were used to compare <b>carryover</b> cow milk production with that of heifers, lactation-matched and age-matched non-carryover cows. Lastly, the survival for second-lactation <b>carryover</b> cows was compared with that of two-year-old heifers and lactation-matched non-carryover cows. Results showed that annually, 2. 5 % of spring-calving cows had returned to a milking herd after a <b>carryover</b> period in the previous year. Of those <b>carryover</b> cows, 43 % returned to a milking herd at four years old, after failing to conceive in their first lactation. Most (69 %) dairy herds contained less than 5 % <b>carryover</b> cows and 17 % of dairy herds comprised of zero <b>carryover</b> cows. The difference between the proportion of Holstein-Friesian in the <b>carryover</b> cow and non-carryover cow group was minimal (2 %) but statistically greater (P< 0. 01) for the <b>carryover</b> cow group. Estimated breeding values (EBVs) for milk traits (milk yield, fat yield, protein yield and somatic cell count) were greater (P< 0. 01), but fertility EBVs were lower (P< 0. 01) for the <b>carryover</b> cow group in the year when they failed to conceive, compared to those for the non-carryover cow group. These were reflected in greater (P< 0. 01) selection indices (Breeding Worth and Production Worth) for <b>carryover</b> cows. After the <b>carryover</b> period, EBVs for milk traits and fertility decreased, and Breeding Worth was lower (P< 0. 01) for the <b>carryover</b> cow group, compared to the non-carryover cow group. <b>Carryover</b> cow milk yield, fat yield, protein yield and somatic cell score was greater (P< 0. 01) than those for heifers, lactation-matched and age-matched non-carryover cows in their first <b>carryover</b> year. This milk production advantage was maintained for up to three <b>carryover</b> years, if the <b>carryover</b> cow maintained an annual calving pattern, but at a decreasing rate. The probability of survival (days) was lower (P< 0. 01) for second-lactation <b>carryover</b> cows when compared to heifers and lactation-matched non-carryover cows.

40|$|Numerous plant {{factors can}} affect forage {{utilization}} by grazing animals. Objectives of this 3 -year study {{conducted at the}} Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory near Whitman, Nebraska were: (1) to determine if <b>carryover</b> herbage affected utilization of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash) by cattle and (2) to evaluate effects of <b>carryover</b> herbage removal and time of grazing on density and height of little bluestem culms. Experimental design was a split plot in space and time. Main plots were 1 -ha pastures replicated 3 times and grazed once each year with 9 yearling steers for 4 - 7 days during mid-month in June, July, August, or October. Stocking rates were 1. 1, 1. 5, and 1. 6 AUM ha- 1 in 1989, 1990, and 1991, respectively. Split plots were little bluestem plants with high densities (x = 60 dm- 2) of <b>carryover</b> culms. Thirty-six plants per pasture were treated in April 1989 as follows: (1) left intact, (2) <b>carryover</b> culms removed, or (3) all <b>carryover</b> herbage removed. Variables measured included utilization and density and height of current year and <b>carryover</b> culms. <b>Carryover</b> culms reduced utilization more than <b>carryover</b> leaves. Utilization was negatively related (r = - 0. 78, P 3 ̆c 0. 01) to density of <b>carryover</b> culms across all 3 plant treatments. For plants from the intact treatment, height of <b>carryover</b> culms (r = - 0. 65, P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and length of current year leaves (r = 0. 41, P = 0. 01) were also correlated to utilization. Utilization of plants from the intact treatment was not affected by time of grazing. Major changes in density and height of <b>carryover</b> culms for plants from the intact treatment were caused by drought conditions during 1989 and a hailstorm during 1990 and not grazing. Grazing during July and August appeared to suppress reaccumulation of culms for plants from the culm removal and total removal treatments. Time of grazing affected height of <b>carryover</b> culms which averaged 27, 25, 21, and 30 cm across plant treatments and years in June, July, August, and October, respectively. Management practices that reduce density and/or height of <b>carryover</b> culms should improve utilization of little bluestem. Following removal of <b>carryover</b> culms, intense grazing during July should slow culm reaccumulation and reduce average height of culms that <b>carryover</b> without adversely affecting plant productivity. ...|$|R

40|$|Organically {{certified}} farms using compost {{to improve}} or maintain fertility rarely consider compost <b>carryover</b> {{and its impact}} on the determination of economically optimal application rates. Compost <b>carryover</b> is comprised of nutrient and non-nutrient elements. Both affect crop growth, yet <b>carryover</b> is typically described primarily in terms of nitrogen (N) -carryover only. This study tested a new method for estimating compost <b>carryover</b> on organically certified land and expressed <b>carryover</b> in units that capture both the nutrient and non-nutrient components. Compost <b>carryover</b> for five treatment rates was estimated over four years in an organically certified field trial in a corn and squash rotation. Nitrate (NO 3 -), phosphorus (P), soil organic matter (SOM) were investigated to determine the residual effect of a one-time compost application. Implications for fertility management and farm profitability were considered. The new method successfully modeled <b>carryover,</b> determining that compost had a persistent and positive effect on crop yields, evident even three years after an initial one-time application. No NO 3 - <b>carryover</b> was observed in any year, suggesting that yield responses were due primarily to non-N <b>carryover.</b> Compositional changes in SOM corresponding to compost input three years earlier suggested that compost was able to influence non-nutritive soil properties many years after incorporation. High value cash-crops are necessary in organic rotations to offset the high input cost of compost use. In organic fertility management, compost is an important and economical source of non-N fertility, which benefits crop yield many years after incorporation. When used with a dedicated N-fixing cover crop in a rotation that includes a high value cash-crop, complete fertility goals could be met in a sustainable manner. (153 pages...|$|R
