5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{the islands}} possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean, which are only found here. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There {{are known to be}} 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

25|$|There is the {{possibility}} that the practices of psychiatric care might make a contribution to illness. Psychiatry and its underpinning science remain heirs to a chequered past and are <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> less guilty than the other sciences in promoting dogma as fact, only to later see it supplanted by a contrary view.|$|E
25|$|The 19th {{surrendered}} en masse. How {{many men}} were in the 19th at this time is impossible to estimate. It was <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> more than 200 men and probably less that half of that. Some individuals might have escaped, but as Wood states the 19th Virginia would never form an organized body of soldiers again.|$|E
25|$|Richard Boys' granddaughter Lilian Boys-Behrens' 1926 book Under Thirty-Seven Kings {{asserts that}} Rev. Boys {{was the first}} person to whom Napoleon spoke upon his arrival in St Helena, {{although}} this is disputed by other contemporary accounts which report that the arrival occurred in silence with no exchanges between Napoleon and the waiting crowd and <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> explicit mention of Rev.

25|$|Margaret {{was married}} to Suffolk's son, John de la Pole. The wedding may have been held between 28 January and 7 February 1444, when she was perhaps a year old but <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> more than three. However, there is more {{evidence}} to suggest {{they were married in}} January 1450, after Suffolk had been arrested and was looking to secure his son's future. Papal dispensation was granted on 18 August 1450, necessary because the spouses were too closely related, and this concurs with the later date of marriage.|$|E
25|$|It {{would seem}} that in the reign of Claudius (AD 41-54) the quaestors had become {{responsible}} for the paving of the streets of Rome, or at least shared that responsibility with the quattuorviri viarum. It {{has been suggested that}} the quaestors were obliged to buy their right to an official career by personal outlay on the streets. There was <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> lack of precedents for this enforced liberality, and the change made by Claudius may have been a mere change {{in the nature of the}} expenditure imposed on the quaestors.|$|E

25|$|The {{interiors}} of the Tudor style building have evolved considerably {{along with the}} style, often becoming truer to the replicated era than were the first examples of the revival style. At Ascott House, Devey's great masterpiece constructed throughout {{the last twenty years}} of the 19th century, the only internal concessions to the Tudor age are the low ceilings necessitated through the external Tudor theme. There are <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> beam ceilings, low narrow doorways or inglenook fireplaces heating small rooms: the large airy rooms are in fact more redolent of the 18th century than the 16th. Cragside is slightly more true to its theme, although the rooms are very large, some contain Tudor style panelling, and the dining room contains are monumental inglenook, but this is more in the style of Italian renaissance meets Camelot than Tudor. While in the cottages at Mentmore the interiors are no different from those of any lower middle-class Victorian small household.|$|E
25|$|Creativity {{is viewed}} {{differently}} in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity {{more in terms}} of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity {{more in terms of}} the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.|$|E

500|$|Dresser's biographer, Clayton Henderson, {{attributed}} {{the success of}} the song to the [...] "perfect marriage of words and music." [...] An Indiana newspaper compared the song in popularity to [...] "Swanee River" [...] and wrote, [...] "Mr. Dresser... has endeavored to perpetuate the beauties of the Wabash as did Stephen Foster that of the Suwannee River, and <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> song since the latter has awakened so much interest among lovers of a good song, nor has any other American author seemed as capable of filling the void left vacant by Foster. The song is a gem and a welcome relief from some of the so-called popular songs sprung on the public from time to time." ...|$|E
500|$|The manga's {{critical}} reaction has been mixed. Most critics reached a consensus regarding {{the high quality}} of its art, describing it as [...] "crisp", [...] "solid", and [...] "clean and well done". Other aspects of the series have divided critics' opinions. Manga Life's Michael Aronson praised the enemy designs, while Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) criticized them, adding the series [...] "is not much fun to read, and <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> fun to look at". Writing for Active Anime, Sandra Scholes found points {{of interest in the}} series' story, and praised its action. Santos said the action [...] "got all the drive and excitement of shōnen action", and [...] Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux called the series [...] "a mixture of Dragonball Z and Naruto, but filled with even more weirdness".|$|E

500|$|When {{his father}} died in 1629, Temple was the main {{beneficiary}} of his father's estate. However, much of his father’s property was held via his wife, mortgaged or being used to meet other commitments. Temple had a relatively meagre inheritance - no grand country house, no great estate and <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> large fortune. His financial affairs were not in good order and were discussed by {{other members of the}} family. Margaret Longville, Temple’s cousin, wrote to her mother, [...] "my cousin Carew Saunders is broke for forty thousand pounds and is not able to pay five shillings in the pound and James Temple is in too much". During Charles I's Personal Rule (1629–1640), he was part of a network of Puritan gentry in Sussex and in due course became a Sussex Justice of the Peace (JP).|$|E
500|$|Depression Quest {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, who generally {{viewed it as}} not being intended for entertainment but education. Jessica Vasquez, writing for Game Revolution, praised the game's portrayal of how sufferers are affected by depression, and expressed optimism in its potential to educate people about depression. Writing for Gizmag, Adam Williams called the experience of Depression Quest [...] "dark and compelling". He added {{that he did not}} find the game fun to play, and that [...] "it's <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> Super Mario Brothers, but that's probably the point". Tim Biggs, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, also stressed a lack of fun in the game, and {{went on to say that}} the game was [...] "a testing and, at times, a boring experience to go through". However, he praised the game's execution, and acknowledged its importance as a tool for raising awareness of depression and for helping its sufferers.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, artist Cornelia Geer LeBoutiller {{criticized the}} painting, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase (a work {{with which it}} is often compared) and Picasso's Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, calling Balla's work [...] "more crude, less mature, almost childish indeed ... Balla takes himself and his dog so seriously, so studiedly, that {{it is doubtful that}} any pleasure has ever come out of it anywhere; <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> movement has." [...] Writing in 1947, critic Henry R. Hope called Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash [...] "a cliché of modern art". Writer Geoffrey Wagner declared Balla's painting to be anathema to the Vorticist aesthetic of British painter Wyndham Lewis, who criticized Futurism for its [...] "romantic excess" [...] and dynamism. However, S. I. Hayakawa credited Balla's [...] "classic" [...] for its introduction of the time dimension in its representation of its subject.|$|E
