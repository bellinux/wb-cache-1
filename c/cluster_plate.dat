Interleukin- 1 (IL 1) {{was measured by}} a thymocyte costimulator assay, which was shown to be completely inhibitable by polyclonal anti-IL 1. Precautions were taken to avoid inadvertent exposure of the studied cells to endotoxin. In a first model, TNF and IL 1 production by adherent MNC in IgG-coated <b>cluster</b> <b>plates</b> were determined. IgG induced a strong TNF response, usually leveling off after 6 hr, and was comparable in kinetics and magnitude with an LPS-induced response. The thymocyte co-stimulatory activity response was relatively weak and peaked at 6 hr. In contrast, LPS-induced co-stimulatory activity production steadily increased over 24 hr. In a second model, MNC in suspension cultures containing autologous serum were exposed to IgG for intravenous use (IgG-IV). Cells exposed to IgG-IV produced higher amounts of cytokines than control counterparts and were primed for enhanced production of cytokines upon a second, unrelated stimulus.

40|$|Preliminary notes This paper gives a brief {{overview}} of building floor slabs starting from slabs with wooden beams to the present reinforced concrete (panels AB). The authors in this paper analyze some new logical views on the issue of building floor slabs. Floor slabs are analyzed {{not only in terms of}} capacity, but also in terms of energy efficiency and safety during seismic activity. The authors offer a solution to build adaptive large residential and commercial area with the possibility of achieving cheaper and more competitive construction with the same gain (profit) in relation to the set of the classic construction and a high selling price. If you require the ability to achieve high capacity with longer spans, less weight and less prone to earthquakes, you can easily come to the conclusion that light grate cluster AB boards have an advantage over other solutions for building floor slabs. Excitation due to possible levelling of supports or torsion rotation of the object is practically possible. It can lead to a state of plate due to the earthquake, which is lower in the grate <b>cluster</b> <b>plates</b> compared to full-reinforced concrete slabs.

After cultures were washed free of debris, fresh cell culture media containing select supplements were added and cultures were reincubated. Parasite growth was assessed 66 h later by {{counting the number of}} parasite developmental stages in 25 random x 100 oil fields by Nomarski interference-contrast microscopy. Four vitamin supplements, calcium pantothenate, L-ascorbic acid, folic acid, and 4 -(para) -aminobenzoic acid, each resulted in a significant increase in parasite numbers in vitro. The addition of insulin and the sugars glucose, galactose, and maltose also had a positive effect on parasite growth, although the effect was less pronounced than with any of the vitamins.

Orientation analyses by electron backscatter diffraction revealed that individual NM plates are composed of alternately distributed thicker and thinner lamellar variants with (1 1 2) (Tetr) compound twin relationship and coherent interlamellar interfaces. In each plate colony, there are four distinct plates {{in terms of the}} crystallographic orientation of the thicker lamellar variants and therefore, in total, eight orientation variants. For the low relative contrast zones, both thicker and thinner lamellar variants in adjacent plates are distributed symmetrically across their inter-plate interfaces (along the substrate edges). At the atomic level, there are no unbalanced interfacial misfits and height misfits, resulting in long and straight inter-plate interfaces with homogeneous contrast. However, in the high relative contrast zones, the thicker and thinner lamellar variants in adjacent plates are oriented asymmetrically across their inter-plate interfaces (at similar to 45 degrees to the substrate edges). Significant atomic misfits appear {{in the vicinity of the}} inter-plate interfaces and in the film normal direction.

40|$|We {{discuss how}} to use tidal streams from {{globular}} clusters to measure the mass distribution of the Milky Way. Recent proper motion determinations for globular <b>clusters</b> from <b>plate</b> measurements and Hipparcos astrometry provide several good candidates for Galactic mass determinations in the intermediate halo, far above the Galactic disk, including Pal 5, NGC 4147, NGC 5024 (M 53) and NGC 5466; the remaining Hipparcos clusters provide candidates for measurements several kpc {{above and below the}} disk. These clusters will help determine the profile and shape of the inner halo. To aid this effort, we present two methods of mass determination: one, a generalization of rotation-curve mass measurements, which gives the mass and potential from complete position-velocity observations for stream stars; and another using a simple chi^ 2 estimator, which can be used when only projected positions and radial velocities are known for stream stars. We illustrate the use of the latter method using simulated tidal streams from Pal 5 and find that fairly accurate mass determinations are possible even for relatively poor data sets. Follow-up observations of clusters with proper motion determinations may reveal tidal streams; obtaining radial velocity measurements would enable accurate measurements of the mass distribution in the inner Galaxy.

40|$|An {{advanced}} technique for a two-dimensional real time visualization of cluster beams in vacuum {{as well as}} of the overlap volume of cluster beams with particle accelerator beams is presented. The detection system consists of an array of microchannel plates (MCP) in combination with a phosphor screen which is read out by a CCD camera. This setup together with the ionization of a cluster beam by an electron or ion beam allows for spatial resolved investigations of the cluster beam position, size, and intensity. Moreover, since electrically uncharged clusters remain undetected, the operation in an internal beam experiment opens the way to monitor the overlap region and thus the position and size of an accelerator beam crossing an originally electrically neutral cluster jet. The observed intensity distribution of the recorded image is directly proportional to the convolution of the spatial ion beam and cluster beam intensities and is by this a direct measure of the two-dimensional luminosity distribution. This information can directly be used for the reconstruction of vertex positions as well as for an input for numerical simulations of the reaction zone. The spatial resolution of the images are dominated by the granularity of the complete MCP device and was found to be in the order of σ ≈ 100 µm.

Furthermore, we introduce a coupling strength parameter ε as a multiplier applied to the nondiagonal coupling terms. A natural interpretation of this parameter is given.

We prove that the series consists only of even order terms of ε. In some practical applications, by using this perturbation series, it would become unnecessary to perform time consuming computations to get coupled eigenvalues, and hence the present results obtained by the perturbation analysis might have considerable engineering importance. We confirm the adequacy of this perturbation analysis by investigating some numerical examples. The results are given for a two-dimensional coupled problem.

To investigate {{the effect of}} the representation of aggregates on electromagnetic scattering calculations, we developed an algorithm to efficiently specify the geometries of aggregates and to compute some of their geometric parameters, such as the projected area. Based on in situ observations, ice aggregates are defined as <b>clusters</b> of hexagonal <b>plates</b> with a chainlike overall shape, which may have smooth or roughened surfaces. An aggregate representation is developed with 10 ensemble members, each con-sisting of between 4 – 12 hexagonal plates. The scattering properties of an individual aggregate ice par-ticle are computed using either the discrete dipole approximation or an improved geometric optics method, depending upon the size parameters. Subsequently, the aggregate properties are averaged over all geometries. The scattering properties of the aggregate representation closely agree with those com-puted from 1000 different aggregate geometries. As a result, the aggregate representation provides an accurate and computationally efficient way to represent all aggregates occurring within ice clouds. Furthermore, the aggregate representation can be used to study the influence of these complex ice par-ticles on the satellite-based remote sensing of ice clouds. The computed cloud reflectances for aggregates are different from those associated with randomly oriented individual hexagonal plates. When aggre...|$|R

The 12 June 2010 M(w) 7. 5 event on the subducting plate is the most recent large earthquake on the Nicobar segment. The left-lateral faulting mechanism of this event is unusual for the outer-rise region, considering the stress transfer processes that follow great underthrusting earthquakes. Another earthquake (M(w) 7. 2) with a similar mechanism occurred very close to this event on 24 July 2005. These earthquakes and most of their aftershocks on the subducting plate were generated by left-lateral strike-slip faulting on north-northeast-south-southwest oriented near-vertical faults, in response to north-northwest-south-southeast directed compression.

After low density plating, the formation of PROG and ADIONE was approximately 10 % of incubated radioactivity, tenfold larger than that of 7 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites. In contrast, after high density plating, low levels of PROG and ADIONE were formed, whereas the conversion to either 7 alpha-OH PREG or 7 alpha-OH DHEA was > or = 50 %. The results expressed per cell indicated that the 3 beta-HSD activity was almost completely inhibited at high cell density, in contrast to the 7 alpha-hydroxylation which was maintained or increased. The pattern of steroid metabolism was related to cell density at the time of measurement and not to an early commitment of cells: when primary cultures were plated at high density (8 x 10 (6) cells/dish), then subcultured after several dilutions (3 -, 9 -, or 27 -fold), the 3 beta- HSD activity was recovered only at low density. Furthermore, when 5 x 10 (5) cells were centrifuged and the resulting <b>clusters</b> were <b>plated,</b> 3 beta-HSD activity was decreased, whereas steroid 7 alpha-hydroxylation was enhanced. This implies that cell density per se, but neither cell number nor a diffusible factor(s) is involved in the regulation of steroid metabolism. We conclude that astrocytes in culture metabolize PREG and DHEA, and that the metabolic conversions and, therefore, the related enzymatic activities depend on cell-to-cell contacts.

40|$|Rat liver {{sinusoidal}} endothelial cells (LEC) contain fenestrae, {{which are}} <b>clustered</b> in sieve <b>plates.</b> Fenestrae control {{the exchange of}} fluids, solutes and particles between the sinusoidal blood and the space of Disse, which at its back side is flanked by the microvillous surface of the parenchymal cells. The surface of LEC can optimally be imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and SEM images {{can be used to}} study dynamic changes in fenestrae by comparing fixed specimens subjected to different experimental conditions. Unfortunately, the SEM allows only investigation of fixed, dried and coated specimens. Recently, the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) was introduced for analysing the cell surface, independent of complicated preparation techniques. We used the AFM for the investigation of cultured LEC surfaces and the study of morphological changes of fenestrae. SEM served as a conventional reference. AFM images of LEC show structures that correlate well with SEM images. Dried-coated, dried-uncoated and wet-fixed LEC show a central bulging nucleus and flat fenestrated cellular processes. It was also possible to obtain height information which is not available in SEM. After treatment with ethanol or serotonin the diameters of fenestrae increased (+ 6 %) and decreased (− 15 %), respectively. The same alterations of fenestrae could be distinguished by measuring AFM images of dried-coated, dried-uncoated and wet-fixed LEC. Comparison of dried-coated (SEM) and wet-fixed (AFM) fenestrae indicated a mean shrinkage of 20 % in SEM preparations. In conclusion, high-resolution imaging with AFM of the cell surface of cultured LEC can be performed on dried-coated, dried-uncoated and wet-fixed LEC, which was hitherto only possible with fixed, dried and coated preparations in SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the fossil}} echinoids from the Paleozoic era are incomplete, {{consisting}} of isolated spines and small <b>clusters</b> of scattered <b>plates</b> from crushed individuals, mostly in Devonian and Carboniferous rocks. The shallow-water limestones from the Ordovician and Silurian periods of Estonia {{are famous for}} echinoids. Paleozoic echinoids probably inhabited relatively quiet waters. Because of their thin tests, they would certainly not have survived in the wave-battered coastal waters inhabited by many modern echinoids. During {{the upper part of}} the Carboniferous period, a marked decline in echinoid diversity occurred, and this trend continued to the Permian period. They neared extinction at the end of the Paleozoic era, with just six species known from the Permian period. Only two lineages survived this period's massive extinction and into the Triassic: the genus Miocidaris, which gave rise to modern cidaroida (pencil urchins), and the ancestor that gave rise to the euechinoids. By {{the upper part of the}} Triassic period, their numbers began to increase again. Cidaroids have changed very little since the Late Triassic and are today considered to be living fossils.Diversity of echinoids have been fluctuating across the eons. Among the different proxies, marine facies variation in combination with outcrop area best explains the palaeodiversity curve.The euechinoids, though, diversified into new lineages throughout the Jurassic and into the Cretaceous periods, and from them emerged the first irregular echinoids (superorder Atelostomata) during the early Jurassic, and later the other superorder (Gnathostomata) of irregular urchins, which evolved independently. These superorders today represent 47% of all extant species of echinoids because of their adaptive breakthroughs, which allowed them to exploit habitats and food sources unavailable to regular echinoids. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, the echinoids flourished. Most echinoid fossils are often abundant in the restricted localities and formations where they occur. An example of this is Enallaster, which exists by the thousands in certain outcrops of limestone from the Cretaceous period in Texas. Many fossils of the Late Jurassic Plesiocidaris still have the spines attached.|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Clusters of galaxies {{are the largest}} bound systems in the Universe and, as such, {{have been used to}} study how matter is distributed over extremely large scales. They provide fundamental constraints for theories of large-scale structure formation and evolution, and are valuable samples for studying galaxy evolution in dense environments. Despite their importance, the last large-area Northern sky cluster catalog was produced over forty years ago, via visual inspection of photographic plates of POSS-I, presented in George Abell's seminal 1958 paper and thesis. To remedy the limitations of this earlier work, we present a modern, objectively generated catalog of galaxy clusters drawn from the object catalogs of the three-band Digitized Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (DPOSS). In this thesis we have undertaken the following: 1) We have created a uniform, calibrated catalog of galaxies over ten thousand square degrees, covering the entire high galactic latitude northern sky. 2) From the input DPOSS galaxy catalogs, we used a simple adaptive kernel technique to create galaxy density maps, combined with a bootstrap technique to make significance maps, from which candidate galaxy clusters were selected in a model-independent fashion. 3) We performed complete follow-up imaging and multislit spectroscopy for candidates from two sky survey plates (totalling ~ 60 [ [...] . ]°) to assess the contamination of our catalog by spurious clusters, and to estimate the redshift distribution of the true clusters. 4) We derived a robust photometric redshift estimator for the <b>clusters,</b> using the <b>plate</b> photometry in conjunction with redshifts culled from the literature as well as our own observations. 5) We used our compilation of clusters with redshifts to measure the cluster-cluster correlation function to very large angular scales, in various photometric redshift shells. 6) We used the large library of CCD images of Abell clusters taken for DPOSS calibration to provide photometric redshifts for these clusters, and study the evolution of the galaxy populations in clusters for 0. 05 < z < 0. 3. Additionally, future scientific projects using this data are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} first {{investigates the}} single-scattering properties of inhomogeneous ice crystals containing air bubbles. Specifically, {{a combination of}} the ray-tracing technique and the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the scattering of light by randomly oriented large hexagonal ice crystals containing spherical or spheroidal air bubbles. The effect of the air bubbles within ice crystals is to smooth the phase functions, diminish the 22 ? and 46 ? halo peaks, and reduce the backscatter in comparison with the case of bubble-free ice crystals. Cloud reflectance look-up tables were generated at the wavelengths of 0. 65 ?m and 2. 13 ?m to examine the impact of accounting for air bubbles in ice crystal morphology on the retrieval of ice cloud optical thickness and effective particle size. To investigate the effect of the representation of aggregates on electromagnetic scattering calculations, an algorithm is developed to efficiently specify the geometries of aggregates and to compute some of their geometric parameters such as the projected area. Based on in situ observations, aggregates are defined as <b>clusters</b> of hexagonal <b>plates</b> with a chain-like overall shape. An aggregate model is developed with 10 ensemble members, each consisting of between 4 - 12 hexagonal plates. The scattering properties of an individual aggregate ice particle are computed using the discrete dipole approximation or an Improved Geometric Optics Method, depending upon the size parameter. The aggregate model provides an accurate and computationally efficient way to represent all aggregates occurring within ice clouds. We developed an algorithm to determine an appropriate ice cloud model for application to satellite-based retrieval of ice cloud properties. Collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data are used to retrieve the optical thicknesses of ice clouds as a function of scattering angle in the nine MISR viewing directions. The difference between cloud optical thickness and its averaged value over the nine viewing angles can be used to validate the ice cloud models. Using the data obtained on 2 July 2009, an appropriate ice cloud model is determined. With the presence of all the uncertainties in the current operational satellite-based retrievals of ice cloud properties, this ice cloud model has excellent performance in terms of consistency in cloud property retrievals with the nine MISR viewing angles...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{presented}} herein elucidate {{details of}} the Coulomb explosion event initiated through the interaction of molecular clusters with an intense femtosecond laser beam (≥ 1 PW/cm 2). Clusters studied include ammonia, titanium-hydrocarbon, pyridine, and 7 -azaindole. Covariance analysis {{is presented as a}} general technique to study the dynamical processes in clusters and to discern whether the fragmentation channels are competitive. Positive covariance determinations identify concerted processes such as the concomitant explosion of protonated cluster ions of asymmetrical size. Anti- covariance mapping is exploited to distinguish competitive reaction channels such as the production of highly charged nitrogen atoms formed {{at the expense of the}} protonated members of a cluster ion ensemble. This technique is exemplified in each cluster system studied. Kinetic energy analyses, from experiment and simulation, are presented to fully understand the Coulomb explosion event. A cutoff study strongly suggests that a Coulomb explosion create ions with two different energies, a direct result of an incomplete Coulomb explosion. A peak analysis implies a strong mass-to-charge dependence on the KER. Taken together, the two studies suggest a duality in the elastic and inelastic contributions to the energy released in a Coulomb explosion. Finally, backward-ejected ions were found capable of arriving before the ion expelled without energy from a Coulomb explosion. Gradient, <b>clustering,</b> and microchannel <b>plate</b> studies confirm the chaotic nature of the Coulomb explosion and the effect clusters have on the event. Backward-ejected protons are found to impact the repeller and eject adsorbed protons from the surface. Moreover, delayed fragmentation is suggested by proton time-of-flights. A cluster study demonstrates the need for clusters at low intensities. Conceptually, the dynamic charge resonance enhanced ionization (CREI) model explains these results of heterocyclic Coulomb explosion. The nonvertical ionization model and the ionization ignition model cannot explain the results herein. The kinetic energy studies suggest that the ground state atomic distance is essential to achieve the amount of kinetic energy released, contrary to the nonvertical ionization model. The cluster study demonstrates that clusters are needed to gain multiply charged atoms at relatively low intensities; this conflicts directly with the supposition of the ionization ignition model...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten is {{considered}} the prime candidate material for plasma facing components within fusion reactors. However, exposure of tungsten to neutron flux brings about transmutation of tungsten into by-products: Re, Os and Ta. Under increasing levels of radiation damage, irradiation induced clustering/precipitation takes place that embrittles and thus reduces lifetime of such tungsten components. This thesis was undertaken to explore this subject on a deeper level. There are three components to this study. The first part considers the effect of Re content on irradiation induced <b>clustering.</b> Lab-made <b>plate</b> W-xRe (x: 2, 5, 10 and 25 at. %) alloys were exposed to 1. 2, 3. 9 and 33 dpa, self-ion irradiated at 773 K. Analysis of cluster number density and volume fraction found they increase with damage level and bulk Re content. Based on these trends and existing literature data, a hypothesis was proposed suggesting clusters originate from vacancy clusters. Also, at 33 dpa, rod shaped clusters form in W- 25 Re alloys while spherical clusters are present in other alloys. The clusters show close correspondence with irradiation induced precipitates and appear to be precursor phase. In {{the second part of}} this thesis, the effect of Os and Ta on cluster formation and alloy mechanical properties is examined. Lab-made plate W- 1 Re- 1 Os and W- 2 Re- 1 Ta alloys were irradiated at 33 dpa at 573 and 773 K and compared against control W- 2 Re alloy. At 33 dpa and 573 K, the Os and Ta presence suppresses cluster formation. Both ternary alloys contain smaller cluster diameter, composition, number density and volume fraction than the W- 2 Re alloy. However, at 33 dpa and 773 K, Os and Ta have opposing effects on cluster behaviour. Os increases the cluster nucleation rate and raises irradiation hardening (compared to W- 2 Re). Meanwhile, Ta presence decreased cluster number density and reduced the irradiation hardening (compared to W- 2 Re alloy). As well, Ta showed no evidence of clustering, only Re clusters form in the W- 2 Re- 1 Ta alloy. The final aspect of the thesis analyzes the effect of material microstructure and external variables on cluster formation in W-Re alloys. Commercial wire form W- 25 Re alloy was irradiated at 1. 2 dpa at 573 and 773 K as atom probe needles and bulk sample. The larger free surface on atom probe needle samples appears to act as a sink for self-interstitials and vacancies at both temperatures. The effect of grain size and dislocation density was examined by irradiating commercial W- 5 Re wire (0. 5 - 1 Î¼m diameter) and plate (1 - 3 mm diameter) samples (annealed and unannealed) to 33 dpa and 573 K. It was found grain boundaries and dislocations act as defect sinks at 573 K. Additionally, radiation enhanced Re grain boundary enrichment was observed for first time. The effect of grain size on cluster behaviour at 773 K was also analysed. Commercial wire and lab-made plate W- 3 Re, W- 5 Re and W- 25 Re alloys were irradiated to 33 dpa at 773 K. The larger grain boundary area in wire samples is suspected of acting as a sink for self-interstitials leaving more vacancies for promoting cluster formation compared to lab-made samples. The discoveries made in this thesis broaden our current understanding of irradiation induced phase formation in tungsten. Their implications on plasma facing component design are discussed as well as recommendations for improvements. Further, areas requiring further research in this field are also highlighted. </p...|$|R
