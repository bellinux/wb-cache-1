40|$|Performance {{inefficiency}} is {{a critical}} challenge facing the construction industry. Despite the efforts made in the existing body of literature, an integrated theory of performance assessment facilitating a bottom-up understanding of the dynamic behaviors, uncertainties, and interdependencies between the constituents in <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> is still missing. The traditional paradigm for performance assessment z is mainly based on a reductionism perspective, in which <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> are identified as monolithic systems. However, complex <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> are systems-of-systems. Systems-of-systems have unique traits that {{are different from those}} of monolithic systems. Failure to investigate <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> as systems-of-systems has led to theoretical and methodological limitations in the creation of integrated tools and techniques for better assessment of performance in complex <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> To address these theoretical and methodological limitations, a system-of-systems framework is proposed as a theoretical lens and methodological structure toward creation of tools and techniques for integrated performance assessment of complex <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> Two principles (i. e., base-level abstraction and multi-level aggregation) are used to develop the proposed framework. The proposed framework facilitates a bottom-up evaluation of the dynamic behaviors, uncertainties, and interdependencies between the constituents in <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> The capabilizties of the proposed framework show its potential in addressing the limitations pertaining to the traditional frameworks for performance assessment. Hence, it can be adopted and tested by researchers to advance the body of knowledge and create integrated theories of performance assessment in complex <b>construction</b> <b>projects...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due {{to the low}} {{productivity}} growth in the construction industry, there are discussions about theories and tools that could support an increased productivity in <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> One such ‘theory’ or package of tools is lean. Lean has been used successfully for decades in the car manufacturing industry, Toyota for example, and in other industries as the shipbuilding industry. In the construction industry, {{the use of the}} word lean is not frequently used and <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> could might implement lean concepts and tools in a greater extent than today. The purpose of this thesis is to increase the productivity in <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> by evaluating if and in which types of <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> different lean concepts and tools could be used and when it is worth to implement different lean concepts and tools. The research questions are about if there are any obstacles to implement lean and which lean concepts and tools that are most suitable for different types of <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> The findings, that will answer the research questions, are based on a theoretical view from an extensive literature review including prior case studies about lean in general as well as about lean in <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> The findings are also based on interviews, about the construction process and lean in <b>construction</b> <b>projects,</b> with managers at different types of projects, constructed by Skanska. Even though lean is already used in some extent in <b>construction</b> <b>projects,</b> the finding is that lean concepts and tools could be used in a greater extent in <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> without obstacles. In addition to concepts and tools used in the car manufacturing industry, e. g. just-in-time, other concepts and tools have to be added. For example production control and planning are important to support lean in <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> In general, lean concepts and tools could be used in all types of <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> Some concepts or tools are more preferable in certain types of projects. Lean could be used only by the main contractor, however, to optimize the process by lean concepts and tool, it is preferable if the whole chain is adopting lean thinking. As a final comment, <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> are not like car manufacturing facilities with repetitive work and products. But the construction industry has to take impact from it and the future will be more like the car industry, if the quality and the architectural creativity could retained in the projects...|$|R
