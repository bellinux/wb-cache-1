5|$|The town {{contains}} 13 residential neighbourhoods radiating {{out from}} {{the core of the}} old market town, and separated by main roads and railway lines. The nearby communities of Ifield, Pound Hill and Three Bridges were absorbed into the new town at various stages in its development. In 2009, expansion was being planned in the west and north-west of the town, in cooperation with Horsham District Council. Economically, the town has developed into the main centre of industry and employment between London and the south coast. Its large industrial area supports manufacturing and service companies, many of them connected with the airport. The commercial and retail sectors <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} phase, Impetigo, the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish {{infantry}} {{north of the}} Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and {{to be in a}} position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{emerging}} competition, natural ice remained vital to North American and European economies, with demand driven up by rising living standards. The huge demand for {{ice in the}} 1880s drove the natural ice trade to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand.</b> Around four million tons (four billion kg) of ice was routinely stored along the Hudson River and Maine alone, the Hudson having around 135 major warehouses along its banks and employing 20,000 workers. Firms expanded along the Kennebec River in Maine to meet the demand, and 1,735 vessels were required in 1880 to carry the ice south. Lakes in Wisconsin began {{to be put into}} production to supply the Midwest. 1890 saw another ice famine hit the east: the Hudson harvests failed entirely, causing a sudden rush by entrepreneurs to establish operations in Maine, where ice had successfully formed. Unfortunately for investors, the following summer was quite cool, suppressing demand for stocks and many businessmen were ruined. Across the U.S., an estimated 90,000 people and 25,000 horses involved in a trade capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms).|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman beylik's first {{capital was}} located in Bursa in 1326. Edirne which was conquered in 1361 was the next capital city. After largely {{expanding}} to Europe and Anatolia, in 1453, the Ottomans nearly completed the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople {{during the reign of}} Mehmed II. Constantinople was made the capital city of the Empire following Edirne. The Ottoman Empire would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> into the Eastern Anatolia, Central Europe, the Caucasus, North and East Africa, the islands in the Mediterranean, Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian peninsula in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E

25|$|Although medical {{men did not}} approve, women healers {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the medical care of Londoners from cradle to grave during the Elizabethan era. They were hired by parishes and hospitals, as well as by private families. They played central roles in the delivery of nursing care as well as medical, pharmaceutical, and surgical services throughout the city as part of organized systems of health care. Women's medical roles <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> in the 17th century, especially regarding me care of paupers. They operated nursing homes for the homeless and sick poor, and also looked after abandoned and orphaned children, pregnant women, and lunatics. After 1700 the workhouse movement undermined many of these roles and the parish nurse became restricted largely to the rearing and nursing of children and infants.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin’s {{locomotive}} output {{dropped from}} 2,666 in 1906 to 614 in 1908. The company cut its workforce from 18,499 workers in 1907 to 4,600 the following year. Baldwin’s business was further imperiled when William P. Henszey, one of Baldwin’s partners, died. His death left Baldwin with a US $6 million liability. In response, Baldwin incorporated and released US $10 {{million worth of}} bonds. Samuel Vauclain wanted to use these funds to expand Baldwin’s capacities {{so it would be}} prepared for another boom. While other Baldwin officers opposed this expansion, Vauclain’s vision won out; Baldwin would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> its Eddystone plant until its completion in 1928. By 1928, the company moved all locomotive production to this location, though the plant would never exceed more than one-third of its production capacity.|$|E
25|$|No vendor {{has made}} money selling power reactors. This is the {{greatest}} failure of any enterprise in the industrial history of the world. We don’t mean that as a criticism of nuclear power’s practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E
25|$|While {{talks of}} a {{possible}} armistice agreement were circulating, in late May and early June 1951, the President of the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea) Syngman Rhee opposed peace talks. He believed the ROK should <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> its army in order to march {{all the way to}} the Yalu River and completely unify the nation. The UNC did not endorse Rhee’s position. Even without UNC support, Rhee and the South Korean government launched a massive effort to mobilize the public to resist any halt in the fighting short of the Yalu River. Other ROK officials supported Rhee’s ambitions and the National Assembly of South Korea unanimously passed a resolution endorsing a continued fight for an “independent and unified country.” At the end of June, however, the Assembly decided to support armistice talks, although President Rhee continued to oppose it.|$|E
