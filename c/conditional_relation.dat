5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) <b>conditional</b> <b>relation,</b> a (2) strong <b>conditional</b> <b>relation,</b> a (3) necessary but not sufficient <b>conditional</b> <b>relation,</b> a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

All subjects learned <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> between constant samples and comparisons, but results of tests for transitivity in those relations were equivocal. In Experiment 2, 4 children were given unreinforced training and testing similar to that provided to the adults in Experiment 1, with procedural refinements. One child learned <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> and demonstrated emergent relations that confirmed the development of two four-member equivalence classes. Another child learned the <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> but did not demonstrate any emergent relations reliably. A 3 rd child, after reinforced training on two <b>conditional</b> <b>relations,</b> learned four new <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> without differential consequences and demonstrated symmetry but not equivalence in the trained relations.

A variant of the MTS is the CRMTS procedure, in which each component stimulus is selected in the appropriate order and conditioned to sample stimuli (Dube, McDonald, McIlvane, & Mackay, 1991). CRMTS training can produce the same <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> between auditory and textual stimuli, in addition to increasing control by each minimal unit (Calcagno, Dube, Galvão, & Sidman, 1994; Hanna, de Souza, de Rose, & Fonseca, 2004; Mackay & Sidman, 1984; Matos, Avanzi, & McIlvane, 2006).

40|$|The {{development}} of functional and equivalence classes was studied in four high-functioning, preschool-aged autistic children. Initially, all subjects failed to demonstrate match-to-sample relations indicative of stimulus equivalence among two three-member classes of visual stimuli.

Next, subjects were taught names for new stimuli outside the match-to-sample format.

New, unnamed stimuli were then related via match-to-sample training to stimuli from sets of named stimuli. Tests for emergent <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> between the new unnamed stimuli and the named stimuli yielded positive results for 1 subject and somewhat mixed results for 3 subjects.

Six experiments with nonreading preschool children posed the following question: Does a stimulus juxtaposed with a conditional discrimination task control relations among the stimuli {{involved in the}} task? In Experiments I and II, printed instance or concept words were juxtaposed with conditional discrimination tasks involving symbols. Results for eight of nine children demonstrated neither <b>conditional</b> nor equivalence <b>relations</b> between words and symbols. Would conditional discrimination training establish classes of visual stimuli composed of selectively nonequivalent subsets? In Experiment III, subjects from the first two experiments were taught <b>conditional</b> <b>relations,</b> then tested for stimulus class development. Printed words {{that could have been}} related transitively were not, apparently due to interference by identical letters in certain words, so no stimulus classes developed. Would the equivalence relations sought in Experiment III develop without a history where printed words were unnecessary to conditional discrimination tasks? For Experiment IV-A, one experimentally naive child was taught the same <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> as Experiment III subjects. Two stimulus classes emerged, each containing two subsets that were selectively nonequivalent depending upon trial context. Are direct or transitive stimulus relations more likely to control responding? In experiment IV-B, the subject from Experiment IV-A expressed more direct than transitive relations on modified matching trials. Would interference by identical elements in words be precluded by training <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> among words directly? One child in Experiment V was taught <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> between concept words and instance words, and instance words and symbols.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{essential}} component of cognition and language involves the formation of new <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> between stimuli based upon prior experiences. Results of investigations on transitive inference (TI) highlight a prominent role for the medial temporal lobe in maintaining associative relations among sequentially arranged stimuli (A > B > C > D > E). In this investigation, medial temporal lobe activity was assessed while subjects completed "Stimulus Equivalence" (SE) tests that required deriving <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> among stimuli within a class (A ≡ B ≡ C). Methods Stimuli consisted of six consonant-vowel-consonant triads divided into two classes (A 1, B 1, C 1; A 2, B 2, C 2). A simultaneous matching-to-sample task and differential reinforcement were employed during pretraining to establish the <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> A 1 :B 1 and B 1 :C 1 in class 1 and A 2 :B 2 and B 2 :C 2 in class 2. During functional neuroimaging, recombined stimulus pairs were presented and subjects judged (yes/no) whether stimuli were related. SE tests involved presenting three different types of within-class pairs: Symmetrical (B 1 A 1; C 1 B 1; B 2 A 2; C 2 B 2), and Transitive (A 1 C 1; A 2 C 2) and Equivalence (C 1 A 1; C 2 A 2) relations separated by a nodal stimulus. Cross-class 'Foils' consisting of unrelated stimuli (e. g., A 1 C 2) were also presented. Results Relative to cross-class Foils, Transitive and Equivalence relations requiring inferential judgments elicited bilateral activation in the anterior hippocampus while Symmetrical relations elicited activation in the parahippocampus. Relative to each derived relation, Foils generally elicited bilateral activation in the parahippocampus, {{as well as in}} frontal and parietal lobe regions. Conclusion Activation observed in the hippocampus to nodal-dependent derived <b>conditional</b> <b>relations</b> (Transitive and Equivalence relations) highlights its involvement in maintaining relational structure and flexible memory expression among stimuli within a class (A ≡ B ≡ C). </p...|$|R
