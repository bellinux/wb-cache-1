40|$|What do {{we mean by}} {{progress}} and <b>cumulation</b> <b>in</b> the social and human sciences? Recent thinking in the philosophy and history of science {{has led to an}} abandonment of some versions of logical positivism and of verificationism that had a strong deductive and theory testing orientation. What is to replace them is less clear. This paper argues that {{progress and}} cumulation {{can be seen as a}} process of evaluation and retention within an epistemic community. Scholarly disciplines differ in their social structure and in their epistemic and normative commitments. Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress and cumulation differ within its multiple subdisciplines, which to varying extents represent epistemic communities. Brief sketches of progress (advance) and <b>cumulation</b> <b>in</b> several subdisciplines are offered...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{sheds light}} on the {{restrictive}} nature of rules of origin (ROO) and {{on the role of}} diagonal <b>cumulation</b> <b>in</b> mitigating the protectionist content of ROO. Empirical evidence suggests that diagonal cumulation has beneficial effects on trade - particularly among spoke countries. We show that these patterns can be reconciled with a theoretical setting where heterogeneous firms buy intermediate inputs from domestic and foreign sources. The model finds that switching from bilateral to diagonal cumulation relaxes the restrictiveness of the ROO and leads the least productive exporters to stop exporting...|$|R

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the structure of}} a generalized family of three-stage chain sampling plans, extending the concept of two-stage chain sampling plans of Dodge and Stephens (1966) which is an extension of the original work of Dodge (1955). Expressions are derived for the OC curves for several sets of general sets of three-stage chain sampling plans, with cumulative acceptance numbers of (c 1,c 2,c 3) = (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 4). In the original work of Dodge (1955) only acceptance numbers of 0, 1 were used and in the extension work of Dodge and Stephens (1966) acceptance numbers of (c 1,c 2) = (0,l), (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4) and (1, 4) were used with selected sets of values of k 1 and k 2 (the number of lots considered for <b>cumulation</b> <b>in</b> the first and second stage respectively). In this paper the OC curves are derived more generally for any k 1, k 2 and k 3 (the number of lots considered for <b>cumulation</b> <b>in</b> the first, second and third stages respectively) combination and OC curves of a number of plans are given and comparisons are made with some single sampling, two-stage chain sampling and multiple sampling plans...|$|R

We present a neural model of learning compatible with Noë’s account of enactive perception. We highlight that accounts of enactive perception tend to oversimplify the problem of identifying contingent relationships and introduce a novel way to address the problem of marginal regularities. Finally, we describe a general (non-task specific) model and present a number of real-world robotic experiments demonstrating a wide range of integrated psychological phenomena...|$|R
