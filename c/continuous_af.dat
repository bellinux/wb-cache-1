40|$|Aims The human left atrial {{appendage}} (LAA) is {{a region of}} increasing interest as a target for interven-tion. We sought to improve insight into the anatomy of this region using computed tomography (CT). Methods and results Multidimensional cardiac reconstruction (whole heart and isolated left atrium) from CT images was performed in each of three groups: (i) patients without atrial fibrillation (AF, n 10); (ii) patients with intermittent (paroxysmal) AF (n 25); (iii) patients with <b>continuous</b> (persist-ent) <b>AF</b> (n 10). Indices included LAA morphology, anatomical relationships, dimensions, angulation, and motility. There was substantial interindividual variation in each index. LAA morphologic differences were associated with variations in anatomical relationships. LAA dimensions in AF patients exceeded those in patients without AF, but angulation and motility were similar. The LAA could be subdivided into proximal and distal portions, each of which had distinct morphology and anatomical relationships. Dimensions in men tended to exceed those in women. Conclusion Regardless of AF history, there is broad variation in LAA morphology, anatomical relation-ships, dimensions, angulation, and motility.

Serial high-density maps were evaluated {{to understand the}} impact of activation direction and rate on electrogram (EGM) fractionation. Methods and Results- Eighteen patients (9 persistent) underwent high-density, 3 -dimensional, left-atrial mapping (> 400 points/map) during AF, sinus (SR), and CS-paced (CSp) rhythms. In SR and CSp, fractionation was defined as an EGM with ≥ 4 deflections, although, in AF, CFE-mean 1. 0 mV) at all sites. During AF, the EGM voltage was higher at continuous CFAE sites than at non-CFAE sites (0. 53 mV (Q 1, Q 3 : 0. 33 to 0. 83) versus 0. 30 mV (Q 1, Q 3 : 0. 18 to 0. 515), P< 0. 00001). Global LA voltage in AF was lower in patients with persistent AF versus patients with paroxysmal AF (0. 6 +/- 0. 59 mV versus 1. 12 +/- 1. 32 mV, P< 0. 01). Conclusions- The distribution of fractionated EGMs is highly variable, depending on direction and rate of activation (SR versus CSp versus AF). Fractionation in SR and CSp rhythms mostly resulted from wave collision. All sites with <b>continuous</b> fractionation in <b>AF</b> displayed normal voltage in SR, suggesting absence of structural scar.

40|$|Background Device-detected {{subclinical}} {{atrial fibrillation}} (AF) refers to infrequent, short-lasting, asymptomatic AF that is detected only with long-term <b>continuous</b> monitoring. Subclinical <b>AF</b> is common and {{associated with an}} increased risk of stroke; however, the risk of stroke with subclinical AF is lower than for clinical AF, and very few patients with subclinical AF alone have been included in large AF anticoagulation trials. The net benefit of anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF is unknown. Design ARTESiA is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, recruiting patients with subclinical AF detected by an implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac monitor, and who have additional risk factors for stroke. Patients with clinical AF documented by surface electrocardiogram will be excluded from the study. Participants will be randomized to receive either apixaban (according to standard AF dosing) or aspirin 81  mg daily. The primary outcome is the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebral infarction, and systemic embolism. Approximately 4, 000 patients will be enrolled from around 230 clinical sites, with an anticipated mean follow-up of 36  months until 248 adjudicated primary outcome events have occurred.

Methods and results: Patients without structural heart disease undergoing stepwise ablation for persistent <b>AF</b> (<b>continuous</b> AF≤ 1 year) were studied (n= 108; age, 61 ± 10 years) and 32 patients {{had a history of}} HF. The HF patients were further grouped on the basis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45 % (n= 15) and > 45 % (n= 17). During a median follow-up period of 2. 2 years, repeated ablations were necessary in 65 patients. The proportion of patients that were arrhythmia free 1 year after the last ablation was 67 % in patients with LVEF≤ 45 %, 86 % in LVEF> 45 %, and 91 % in no HF (p= 0. 0009). In patients with LVEF≤ 45 %, the AF burden was reduced to less than one paroxysmal episode per month, and patients with and without recurrences both showed significant increases in LVEF over the follow-up period (38 ± 7 % to 60 ± 10 % and 37 ± 6 % to 53 ± 10 %, respectively). Conclusions: HF patients with LVEF≤ 45 % had lower chances to remain free from arrhythmias after stepwise ablation for persistent AF than those with LVEF> 45 %. Nevertheless, LVEF also improved in patients with recurrences, reflecting the observed reduction in AF burden and emphasizing the benefits of ablation...|$|R
40|$|Anti-ferromagnetic (AF) heavy-fermion (HF) metals {{frequently}} {{exhibit a}} quantum critical point (QCP), i. e. a <b>continuous</b> disappearance of <b>AF</b> order at zero temperature {{as a function}} of a non-thermal control parameter, like pressure. Commonly, unconventional (d-wave) superconductivity (SC) is observed in the vicinity of such a QCP. In this article, the interplay between quantum criticality and SC in HF metals is discussed. The latter can be well described in the framework of the Kondo lattice (KL) model. After introducing HFs and giving an overview on HF superconductivity, the characteristic energy scales in KL systems are addressed. Subsequently, we concentrate on the isostructural compounds CeCu 2 Si 2 and YbRh 2 Si 2. CeCu 2 Si 2 is a prototypical HF superconductor which shows a QCP of itinerant, i. e. three-dimensional (3 D) spin-density-wave (SDW) type. Overdamped, nearly quantum-critical SDW fluctuations are concluded from inelastic-neutron-scattering results to be the driving force for SC (T-c approximate to 0. 6 K) in this compound. While the QCP in several other Ce-based HF superconductors is presumably of the SDW variety too, {{it is likely to be}} of the local, i. e. Kondo destroying type in the pressure-induced superconductor CeRhIn 5. YbRh 2 Si 2 has been identified as a prototype HF metal exhibiting such a Kondo breakdown QCP, often named a (T = 0) 4 f-orbital selective Mott transition. This compound is not a superconductor at T > 10 mK. Systematically searching for and studying SC near Kondo destroying QCPs may offer a link to unconventional SC in other families of correlated materials, such as the doped Mott insulators in the high-T-c cuprates and some of the organic charge-transfer salts...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Pulmonary vein {{isolation}} (PVI) with cryoenergy delivered {{through a}} balloon {{is a new}} approach {{in the treatment of}} atrial fibrillation (AF), but long-term follow-up is lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide insight in the success rate and the incidence of recurrences. Methods and results: Patients with symptomatic AF despite anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) were treated with cryoballoon PVI. Daily transtelephonic ECG monitoring, 24 h Holter-ECG, and an arrhythmia-focused questionnaire were used to document AF. One hundred and forty-one patients completed a follow-up of 457 +/- 252 days. Before ablation, Holter-ECG showed AF in 45 %, including 16 % <b>continuous</b> <b>AF</b> throughout the recording. Event recording revealed a median AF burden of 26 %. The questionnaire showed a median of weekly AF complaints lasting for hours. All but one patient had successful PVI with a single procedure. After ablation, AF (defined as lasting for more than 30 s) was seen in 11 % of Holter-ECGs, with 1 % <b>continuous</b> <b>AF.</b> The event recording showed an AF burden of 9 %. The median patient reported no more AF-related symptoms. Recurrence during the first 3 months was predictive for later recurrence. A second procedure was performed in 24 patients. The freedom of AF was 59 % without AADs after 1, 2 procedures. Four right phrenic nerve paralyses occurred, all resolving within 6 months. No PV stenoses were observed.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether left atrial appendage flow velocity, as determined using trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE), predicts the outcome after catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF). Method 40 PAF patients (85 % males, 60 +/− 11 years) underwent a stepwise ablation approach. The procedural end point was termination of persistent AF by catheter ablation, either by conversion directly to sinus rhythm or to atrial tachycardia. Left atrial appendage (LAA) peak flow velocities were measured with transesophageal echography and averaged within each RR interval of 10 consecutive cardiac cycles. Others parameters LA area, left ventricular ejection fraction, duration of <b>continuous</b> <b>AF,</b> Administration of amiodarone, were analyzed to determine the factors associated with procedural termination of arrhythmia. ResultsAmong the 40 patients, all received a circumferential PV isolation, a linear ablation, and a continuous CFE ablation. Atrial fibrillation was terminated in 26 patients (65 %) with a mean procedure time of 201 min+/− 43 min. The pre-procedural ejection fraction (p= 0. 38), duration of <b>continuous</b> <b>AF</b> (p= 0. 09) did not differ significantly between patients who had success of catheter ablation compared with those who had not. Peak emptying velocities of the LAA before catheter ablation were significantly higher in patients in whom PAF was terminated during the procedure (0. 23 vs. 0. 34, p= 0. 002). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the mean LAA peak emptying velocity > 0. 30 cm/s (p= 0. 02, odds ratio [OR]= 9, 58 confidence interval [CI] 95 %= 1. 50 to 61. 36), predicted successful catheter ablation for PAF.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bachmann's bundle (BB) is {{considered}} to be the main route of interatrial conduction and {{to play a role in}} development of atrial fibrillation (AF). The goals of this study are to characterize the presence of conduction disorders in BB during sinus rhythm and to study their relation with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-resolution epicardial mapping (192 unipolar electrodes, interelectrode distance: 2 mm) of sinus rhythm was performed in 185 patients during coronary artery bypass surgery of whom 13 had a history of paroxysmal <b>AF.</b> <b>Continuous</b> rhythm monitoring was used to detect postoperative AF during the first 5 postoperative days. In 67 % of the patients, BB was activated from right to left; in the remaining patients from right and middle (21 %), right, central, and left (8 %), or central (4 %) site. Mean effective conduction velocity was 89 cm/s. Conduction block was present in most patients (75 %; median 1. 1 %, range 0 - 12. 8) and was higher in patients with paroxysmal AF compared with patients without a history of AF (3. 2 % versus 0. 9 %; P= 0. 03). A high amount of conduction block (> 4 %) was associated with de novo postoperative AF (P= 0. 02). Longitudinal lines of conduction block > 10 mm were also associated with postoperative AF (P= 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: BB may be activated through multiple directions, but the predominant route of conduction is from right to left. Conduction velocity across BB is around 90 cm/s. Conduction is blocked in both longitudinal and transverse direction in the majority of patients. Conduction disorders, particularly long lines of longitudinal conduction block, are more pronounced in patients with AF episodes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a common}} complication of cardiovascular surgery and its mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of our study was a prospective investigation {{of the relationship between}} AF development and tissue or blood magnesium levels. Methods: This prospective observational study evaluated 20 patients undergoing elective initial coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Right atrial appendage and skeletal muscle samples were obtained for tissue magnesium level analysis before, during (at 60 th minute) and 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with simultaneous blood samples. Daily measurements of blood Mg levels and <b>continuous</b> monitoring for <b>AF</b> were performed for 7 postoperative days. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA, independent samples t and Chi-square tests. Results: AF developed in 5 out of 20 patients during postoperative period (25 %). Patients with or without AF did not differ in terms of tissue and blood magnesium levels during and early after CPB and during 7 days after the operation. Blood magnesium levels were significantly higher in the whole study population on postoperative days 3 through 7 (day 3 - 1. 13 ± 0. 11 mmol/L; day 4 -, 1. 18 ± 0. 07 mmol/L; day 5 - 1. 15 ± 0. 10 mmol/L; day 6 - 1. 17 ± 0. 08 mmol/L; and day 7, 1. 22 ± 0. 08 mmol/L) compared to day 1 and day 2 (day 1 - 0. 96 ± 0. 13 mmol/L and day 2 - 1. 02 ± 0. 12 mmol/L; p< 0. 002 for all comparisons). Conclusion: Although patients with and without AF did not significantly differ with regard to blood and tissue magnesium levels, the coincidence of an early postoperative reduction in magnesium levels in all patients and occurrence of all AF incidences at this time period suggests a potential association deserving further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Initiating {{mechanisms}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) remain poorly understood, involving complex interaction between triggers and the atrial substrate. This {{study sought to}} classify the transitional phenomena, hypothesizing that there is consistency within and between patients in trigger-substrate interaction during transition to AF. Methods and results: Non-contact left atrial (LA) mapping was performed in 17 patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal AF. All had spontaneous ectopy. Left atrial activation from the first ectopic to established AF was examined offline to characterize the initiating and transitional sequence of activation. In 57 fully mapped spontaneous AF initiations in 8 patients, all involved interaction of pulmonary venous/LA triggers with a septopulmonary line of block (SP-LOB) also evident in sinus rhythm, by 4 different transitional mechanisms characterized by (i) <b>continuous</b> focal firing: <b>AF</b> resulted from fragmentation of each ectopic wavefront through gaps in the SP-LOB and persisted only while focal firing continued (n = 18 / 32 %) (ii) transient focal firing, wavefront fragmentation at the SP-LOB produced wavelet re-entry that persisted after cessation of an initiating ectopic source (n = 12 / 21 %), (iii) of two separate interacting ectopic foci (n = 15 / 26 %), or from (iv) transiently stable macroreentry (n = 12 / 21 %), around the SP-LOB extending to the LA roof, resulting in progressive wavefront fragmentation. It was found that 79 ± 22 % {{of each of the}} initiations in individual patients showed the same triggering mechanism. Conclusion: Onset of paroxysmal AF can be described by discrete mechanistic categories, all involving interaction of ectopic activity with a common SP-LOB. Within/between-patient consistency of initiations suggests constancy of the interacting triggers and substrate, and supports the concept of mechanistically tailored treatment...|$|R

The addition of AF burden improved C-statistics: for CHADS 2 from 0. 653 (P= 0. 051) to 0. 713 (P= 0. 007); for CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, from 0. 898 (P< 0. 0001) to 0. 910 (P< 0. 0001). Conclusions- The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score had a high sensitivity to predict thromboembolism. Implementation of device data on AF presence/duration/burden has the potential to contribute to improved clinical risk stratification and should be tested prospectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAtrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is commonest sustained atrial arrhythmia producing high morbidity. Although Cox's Maze III procedure cures AF in majority, reduced atrial {{transport function}} (ATF) is a concern. Radial approach with ablation lines radial from sinus node towards atrioventricular annulii and parallel to atrial coronary arteries, has shown better ATF. MethodsSingle blind open randomized prospective study of 80 patients was undertaken in two groups (40 each) of modified Cox's maze III and modified radial approach, to evaluate conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and ATF. Patients undergoing surgery for rheumatic {{valvular heart disease}} with <b>continuous</b> <b>AF</b> were prospectively randomized. Ablation lines were created with radiofrequency (RF) bipolar coagulation with cryoablation for the isthmal lesions and coronary sinus. Results were compared at 6 months and ATF was evaluated by atrial filling fraction (AFF) and A/E ratio on echocardiography. ResultsThe rate of conversion to NSR in both groups was statistically insignificant by Fisher's exact test (p >  0. 05). ATF was better in modified radial approach compared to modified Cox's Maze III (A/E compared by unpaired t test: 0. 52  ±  0. 08 v/s 0. 36  ±  0. 10; p <  0. 05. AFF compared using Mann Whitney U test: median AFF for radial group was 23 v/s 20 for biatrial group; p <  0. 05). DiscussionIn patients with AF undergoing rheumatic valvular surgery, radiofrequency radial approach is as effective as modified Cox's maze III for conversion to NSR with better atrial transport function...|$|E
40|$|Methods from {{nonlinear}} dynamics {{were applied}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that the dynamics of sustained atrial fibrillation (AF) is modified by the class Ic drug cibenzoline during pharmacological conversion. The experiments were performed in conscious goats in which sustained AF was induced by <b>continuous</b> maintenance of <b>AF</b> via programmed electrical stimulation. Data were collected from electrophysiological experiments in five goats to terminate sustained <b>AF</b> by <b>continuous</b> infusion of cibenzoline. Sets of five unipolar epicardial electrograms of one minute duration were recorded from the left and right atrial free wall during sustained AF (control), and at three episodes during infusion of cibenzoline, when the mean AF interval had been prolonged to 25 %, 50 % and 85 % with respect to control. Ventricular far-field potentials were removed from atrial electrograms by a coherent averaging procedure. Using the Grassberger-Procaccia method, the dynamics of the local atrial electrograms was investigated by estimating the (coarse-grained) correlation dimension and correlation entropy from the correlation integral. The results were related to a recently proposed classification (types I-III) of AF based on the degree of complexity of atrial activation patterns. The coarse-grained correlation dimension D-cg and entropy K-cg indicated that sustained AF corresponded to type Il. During drug administration the coarse-grained parameters were not significantly different from control. Scaling regions in the correlation integral were observed after infusion of cibenzoline (3 out of 5 goats) suggesting that the drug introduced low-dimensional features (type I) in the dynamics of AF (correlation dimension D ranging from 2. 8 to 4. 4 and correlation entropy K from 1. 6 to 6. 2 nats/s). Sinus rhythm recorded shortly after cardioversion was very regular (D< 2 and K< 3 nats/s). The hypothesis that the electrograms during AF and sinus rhythm were generated by a static transformation of a linear Gaussian random process was rejected using a test for time reversibility. The nonlinear analysis revealed that cibenzoline does not significantly alter the dynamics of sustained AF during pharmacological conversion other than a slowing down of the atrial activation and a somewhat increasing global organization of the atrial activation pattern. The sudden change in the dynamical behavior at cardioversion suggests a mechanism that is reminiscent of a bifurcation...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary vein {{isolation}} (PVI) is a recommended {{treatment for}} drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, success rates remain around 50 - 70 % {{for a single}} procedure despite advances in mapping and ablation technologies. PV reconnection is found in almost all patients with AF recurrence and therefore improving lesion durability {{is the focus of}} technological developments such as robotic manipulation. We demonstrated that robotic-assistance improves catheter stability compared to manual catheter guidance during AF ablation, resulting in greater electrogram attenuation at matched RF settings. However, this has not translated into improved outcomes in recent non-randomised trials, which may reflect that we only studied acute lesions. Several recent studies suggest that late-gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-CMR) can be used for studying chronic ablation lesions. We developed an automated LGE-CMR method to detect left atrial ablation scar and validated the technique by comparing co-located electrogram amplitude. A significant correlation between scar and endocardial low voltage was demonstrated. Interestingly, higher levels of pre-existing atrial scar were associated with lower success rates following ablation. Furthermore, whilst veins found to be isolated at the redo procedure had greater levels of ostial scar than reconnected veins, {{there was no difference in}} the amount of ostial scarring or the number of circumferentially scarred veins between patients with and without AF recurrence. This finding is in keeping with invasive studies which suggest that there is a significant degree of reconnection in asymptomatic patients and highlights inconsistencies in our understanding of PV mediated ectopy. It has been suggested that PVI inadvertently damages upstream regulators such as the atrial ganglionated plexi (GP) of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system and animal studies indicate that these may be potential targets for ablation to prevent <b>AF.</b> <b>Continuous</b> high frequency stimulation (HFS) of GPs produces AV block and this phenomenon has been used to identify and ablate the GPs as putative autonomic triggers for PV ectopy. However, animal studies have revealed a complex network of autonomic connections and these have not been investigated in detail in humans. We found that the right lower GP is the final common pathway to the AV node and must remain intact if all other GPs are to be identified and ablated. Heart rate variability has been suggested as a potential endpoint for autonomic modification. Using a novel intraprocedural, short-segment HRV tool, we found that the reduction in HRV following AF ablation occurs only after ablation of the right upper GP and therefore does not reflect the inputs from any other left atrial GP, precluding its use as an endpoint for left atrial denervation. Furthermore, it would seem logical to target the parts of the network that trigger PV ectopy rather than targeting GP sites that produce effects at the sinus node and AV node. We developed a technique to identify sites initiating ectopic triggers and found that the response could be abolished either by achieving PVI or by targeted RF ablation to the site. This raises the possibility of targeted autonomic denervation of culprit sites of atrial ectopy as an alternative strategy to PVI. These findings should now be applied prospectively to assess their impact on outcomes from AF ablation. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Despite the proven {{effectiveness}} of antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), their use has been suboptimal in practice, particularly {{in rural areas}} of Australia. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe medication use in the management of AF in elderly hospitalized patients with comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF). Methods: The hospital records of patients with a diagnosis of AF and CHF were reviewed in a rural Australian medical center. All the patients were hospitalized because of significant systolic ventricular dysfunction. The collected data included age, sex, weight, presenting symptoms of AF, and principle diagnosis on admission; medical history; and history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Electrocardiogram before hospital discharge was also retrieved from patient's medical records and was analyzed by the investigators. Cardiovascular and noncardiovascular drugs administered during the hospital stay and at discharge were also documented. Comparison of antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drugs was made between patients who had AF while hospitalized and those who had a history of AF but were in sinus rhythm while hospitalized. When patients had ≥ 2 moderate risk factors (eg, age ≥ 75 years, hypertension, CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35 %, diabetes mellitus) or ≥ 1 high risk factor (eg, previous stroke, transient ischemic attack or embolism, mitral valve stenosis, or prosthetic heart valve), they were defined as being eligible for anticoagulation treatment. Results: One hundred forty patients (74 men, 66 women; mean [SD] age, 77. 1 [6. 9] years; all were white) had a diagnosis of AF and were selected for the study. Of these, 92 patients (65. 7 %) (47 women, 45 men; mean [SD] age, 77. 4 [9 – 2] years) had <b>continuous</b> <b>AF</b> and 48 patients (34. 3 %) (29 men, 19 women; mean [SD] age, 76. 3 [12. 4] years) had a history of AF but were in sinus rhythm at admission and discharge. The most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug was digoxin, which was prescribed significantly more frequently in the AF group than in the history of AF group (50 (54. 3 %] vs 14 [29. 2 %]; P < 0. 01). Amiodarone was prescribed significantly less frequently in the <b>continuous</b> <b>AF</b> group than in the group with a history of AF (7 [7. 6 %] vs 19 [39 − 6 %]; P < 0. 01). There was no significant between-group difference in the use of β-blockers (26 [28. 3 %] vs 19 [39 − 6 %]), verapamil/diltiazem (9 [9 – 8 %] vs 3 [6. 3 %]), or Sotalol (2 [2. 2 %] vs 4 [8. 3 %]). The mean (SD) resting heart rate for the 140 study patients was 91 (27) bpm. The mean resting heart rate for the patients with AF was significantly higher at admission than at discharge (97 [28] vs 79 [19] bpm; P < 0. 01). Of the 110 patients who were eligible for anticoagulation treatment, 64 (58. 2 %) were prescribed warfarin at discharge. Eligible patients not receiving oral warfarin were significantly older than those who did receive warfarin (79 − 7 [9 − 0] vs 75. 8 [9. 0] years; P = 0. 02). Conclusions: In these elderly hospitalized Australian patients with AF and CHF, digoxin, β-blockers, and amiodarone were the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs. Anticoagulation treatment was prescribed in ~ 60 % of these patients...|$|E
