5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk. The figure atop the granite obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> cape, and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing {{on the east side of}} the base, is dressed in a brimmed hat and short jacket.|$|E

The BSAS bond coat exhibits sufficient environmental resistance such that, if the top coat should spall, the BSAS bond coat continues to provide a level of environmental protection to the underlying SiC-containing substrate...|$|R

25|$|Around the 1880s and {{increasingly}} through into the Edwardian era, {{an adaptation of}} the riding coat called a Newmarket coat (now renamed to be our 20th century morning coat) began to supplant the frock coat as daytime full dress.

Otherwise, the protective top coating would rapidly interact detrimentally with the substrate and degrade by spalling of the protective oxides formed on the outer surface at elevated temperatures...|$|R

25|$|In 1666, Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland, {{following}} the earlier example of Louis XIV of France, decreed that at court, men were {{to wear a}} long <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> vest or waistcoat (originally called a petticoat, a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a cravat, a periwig or wig, and breeches gathered at the knee, {{as well as a}} hat for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.|$|E
25|$|Other {{less obvious}} terms include discoid (resembling a disc or plate, having both {{thickness}} and parallel faces {{and with a}} rounded margin), ellipsoid, globose (spherical), or subglobose (Inflated, but less than spherical), lenticular, oblong, ovoid, reniform and sectoroid. Striate seeds are striped with parallel, longitudinal lines or ridges. The commonest colours are brown and black, other colours are infrequent. The surface varies from highly polished to considerably roughened. The surface may {{have a variety of}} appendages (see Seed <b>coat).</b> <b>A</b> seed coat with the consistency of cork is referred to as suberose. Other terms include crustaceous (hard, thin or brittle).|$|E
25|$|When marching {{into war}} a soldier would have worn the {{traditional}} redcoat uniform {{consisting of the}} distinctive regimental <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> white shirt, grey trousers to be held up {{by a pair of}} braces, shoes and a cap. The cap may have differed depending on the regiment, but a traditional pattern was the Tricorne to be replaced by the Stovepipe Shako. This too would be replaced in the majority of regiments by the widespread use of the Belgic shako by 1812, as displayed by the 33rd Regiment of Foot. A greatcoat, fashioned in grey wool, would be worn and was normally tied on top of the haversack or knapsack which was carried by the men whilst on the move.|$|E

25|$|Ötzi's {{clothes were}} sophisticated. He wore a cloak made of woven grass and a <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> belt, {{a pair of}} leggings, a loincloth and shoes, all made of leather of {{different}} skins. He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for walking across the snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, leggings and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with sinew. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, drill, flint flake, bone awl and a dried fungus.|$|E
25|$|The basic costume of the Mongol {{fighting}} man {{consisted of}} a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. Silk and metallic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.|$|E

Now wealthy and living in a luxurious penthouse, she gives her maid her own Bulgari pearl necklace (matching the three she gave to her friends on graduation day), and has the maid mail letters to them. She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> cigarette and a drink, and then commits suicide by jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger mistress the day before.|$|E

25|$|The Prose Merlin {{contains}} many instances of Merlin's shapeshifting. He {{appears as a}} woodcutter with an axe about his neck, big shoes, a torn coat, bristly hair, and a large beard. He is later found in the forest of Northumberland by a follower of Uther's disguised as an ugly man and tending a great herd of beasts. He then appears first as a handsome man {{and then as a}} beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing leather boots, a wool <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin. He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce. Finally, he appears as an old man with a long beard, short and hunchbacked, in an old torn woolen coat, who carries a club and drives a multitude of beasts before him.|$|E
25|$|Trench coats have {{remained}} fashionable {{in the decades}} following World War II. Their original role {{as part of an}} army officer's uniform lent the trench <b>coat</b> <b>a</b> businesslike respectability, although many prefer to tie the belt in front (rather than use the buckle) to project a more casual look than strict military dress. Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca and Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau wore the trench coat in the public eye. Often, a fedora or an ushanka (during colder weather) was also worn. In the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black turtleneck sweaters, while some Mods wore trench coats as fashionable overcoats, {{as an alternative to the}} fishtail parka or crombie. Streakers and flashers often prefer trench coats since they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose him or herself.|$|E
25|$|Bose's {{arrest and}} {{subsequent}} release {{set the scene}} for his escape to Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long <b>coat,</b> <b>a</b> black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Road house in Calcutta about 01:25AM on 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose in a German-made Wanderer W24 Sedan car, which would take him to Gomoh Railway Station in then state of Bihar, India. The car (Registration No. BLA 7169) was bought by Subhash Chandra Bose's elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose in 1937. The car is now on display at his Elgin Road home in Calcutta, India.|$|E
