5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in {{the periodic table}} suggests {{that it would have}} similar properties to its lighter <b>congeners,</b> scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p valence electron configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter <b>congeners</b> in group 3, but this is not expected to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from periodic trends.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{traditional}} use of narcissi for the treatment of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their <b>congeners.</b> N. poeticus contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in analogy to the earlier actinides. While its behaviour {{is not likely to be}} very distinct from its lighter <b>congeners</b> in group 3, it is likely to pose a limit to the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be purely a formal matter. Like its lighter <b>congeners,</b> unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E
5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its <b>congeners,</b> is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we used {{feathers}} to biomonitor exposure to the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) Aroclor 1268 <b>congener</b> mixture in clapper rails (Rallus longiros-tris). This species {{has been used as}} an indicator species of environmental damage for the LCP superfund site located in Brunswick, GA, USA which is contaminated with Aroclor 1268, a <b>congener</b> mixture that has been used in limited amounts elsewhere and therefore {{can be used as a}} contaminant marker. The Aroclor 1268 <b>congener</b> mixture, including <b>congener</b> profiles, were quantified in feathers using gas chromatography (GC). Concurrently, each sam-ple was quantified for the total Aroclor 1268 <b>congener</b> mixture using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and compared to the GC results to determine if ELISA was an efficient method for quantifying or qualifying PCBs in feathers. ELISA consistently quantified PCB loads over an order of magnitude lower than the GC. Based on sample replication, extraction recovery, and sample spike, it appears that GC is the more reliable method of detection and that ELISA methods may be more suitable for qualitative exposure assessment for this par-ticular Aroclor. Moreover, since all clapper rails from the LCP site had the Aroclor 1268 <b>congener</b> mixture in their feathers, this experiment showed that birds were returning to the site to breed despite the adverse effects experienced by this population from the contamination revealed in previous studies. This study also supports the utility of feathers as a non-lethal mechanism by which to biomonitor PCBs in the environment...|$|R
5|$|Analogous to its lighter <b>congeners,</b> the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{oxidation}} state known for seaborgium {{other than the}} group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter <b>congeners,</b> forming chromium hexacarbonyl, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, and tungsten hexacarbonyl, seaborgium {{has been shown in}} 2014 to also form seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6. Like its molybdenum and tungsten homologues, seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with silicon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its <b>congeners</b> are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E

5|$|Cadmium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically {{similar to the}} two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its <b>congeners</b> in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its <b>congeners</b> magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first {{isolated}} by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Mascarene grey parakeet as a grey, long-tailed parrot. Subfossils show that its beak was about 30% {{longer than that}} of the sympatric echo parakeet, and that it had a comparatively broad beak. Members of the Psittacula genus commonly have large, red beaks, and long tail feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its <b>congeners</b> in other osteological details. It was skeletally similar to the Alexandrine parakeet, but some of its bones were larger and more robust. Its colouration also separated it from all other members of Psittacula, the majority of which are green or partially green.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter <b>congeners</b> which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter <b>congeners</b> in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the first}} of the {{transition}} metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier <b>congeners</b> ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium. Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In fact, in this second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad.|$|E

For a better application of lattice-valued concept lattice into data distributed storage and parallel processing, {{it is necessary to}} research attribute extended algorithm based on <b>congener</b> formal context. The definitions of attribute extended formal context and <b>congener</b> formal context are proposed. On condition that the extent set stays invariable when the new attribute is increased, the necessary and sufficient conditions of forming attribute values are researched. Based on these conditions, the algorithms of generating lattice-valued <b>congener</b> formal context and establishing concept lattice are given, by which we can provide a useful basis for union algorithm and constructing algorithm of lattice-valued concept lattices in distributed and parallel system...|$|R
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter <b>congeners</b> scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group <b>congeners</b> form stable or {{metastable}} allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter <b>congeners</b> which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them.
