50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted across all current research that infants prefer high contrast and bold colors at their earlier stages of infancy, rather than saturated colors. One {{study found that}} newborn infants looked longer at checkered patterns of white and <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> (including red, green, yellow) than they did at a uniform white color. However, infants failed to discriminate blue from white checkered patterns. Another study - recording the fixation time of infants to blue, green, yellow, red, and gray at two difference luminance levels - found that infants and adults differed in their color preference. Newborns and one month did not show any preference among the <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli.</b> It was found that three-month-old infants preferred the longer wavelength (red and yellow) to the short-wavelength (blue and green) stimuli, while adults had the opposite. However, both adults and infants preferred <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> over non-colored stimuli.

Here we show from non-linear analysis of human visual evoked potentials (VEP) the presence of distinct and independent temporal signatures for form and surface color processing. Surface <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> produced most power in the second order Wiener kernel, indicative of a slowly recovering neural system, while chromatic form stimulation produced most power in the first order kernel (showing rapid recovery). We find end-spectral saturation-dependent signals, easily separable from achromatic signals for surface <b>color</b> <b>stimuli.</b> However physiological responses to form <b>color</b> <b>stimuli,</b> though varying somewhat with saturation, showed similar waveform components. Lastly, the spectral dependence of surface and form color VEP was different, with the surface color responses almost vanishing with yellow-grey isoluminant stimulation whereas the form color VEP shows robust recordable signals across all hues.

50|$|At his mother's {{tea parties}} in Weimar, Schopenhauer had met Goethe in 1813. In November, Goethe congratulated Schopenhauer on his {{doctoral}} dissertation On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Both men shared {{the opinion that}} visual representations yielded more knowledge than did concepts. In the winter of 1813/1814, Goethe personally demonstrated his color experiments to Schopenhauer and they discussed color theory. Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write On Vision and Colors. Schopenhauer wrote it {{in a few weeks}} while living in Dresden in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of Schopenhauer's conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. He was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue. Schopenhauer wrote as though Goethe had merely gathered data while Schopenhauer provided the actual theory. A major difference between the two men was that Goethe considered color to be an objective property of light and darkness. Schopenhauer's Kantian transcendental idealism was opposed to Goethe's realism. For Schopenhauer, color was subjective in that it exists totally in the spectator's retina. As such, it can be excited in various ways by external stimuli or internal bodily conditions. Light is only one kind of <b>color</b> <b>stimulus.</b>|$|E

We investigated the neural basis of the form–color link in macaque primary visual cortex (V 1) by studying orientation selectivity of single V 1 cells for pure color patterns. Neurons that responded to color were classified, based on cone inputs and spatial selectivity, into chromatically single-opponent and double-opponent groups. Single-opponent cells responded well to color but weakly to luminance contrast; they were not orientation selective for color patterns. Most double-opponent cells were orientation selective to pure <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{as well as to}} achromatic patterns. We also found non-opponent cells that responded weakly or not at all to pure color; most were orientation selective for luminance patterns.

40|$|We studied brain {{activity}} during retention and retrieval phases of two visual short-term memory (VSTM) experiments. Experiment 1 used a balanced memory array, with one <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> in each hemifield, {{followed by a}} retention interval and a central probe, at the fixation point that designated the target stimulus in memory about which to make a determination of orientation. Retrieval of information from VSTM was associated with an event-related lateralization (ERL) with a contralateral negativity relative to the visual field from which the probed stimulus was originally encoded, suggesting a lateralized organization of VSTM. The scalp distribution of the retrieval ERL was more anterior than what is usually associated with simple maintenance activity, {{which is consistent with}} the involvement of different brain structures for these distinct visual memory mechanisms. Experiment 2 was like Experiment 1, but used an unbalanced memory array consisting of one lateral <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> in a hemifield and one <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> on the vertical mid-line. This design enabled us to separate lateralized activity related to target retrieval from distractor processing. Target retrieval was found to generate a negative-going ERL at electrode sites found in Experiment 1, and suggested representations were retrieved from anterior cortical structures. Distractor processing elicited a positive-going ERL at posterior electrodes sites, which could be indicative of a return to baseline of retention activity for the discarded memory of the now-irrelevant stimulus, or an active inhibition mechanism mediating distractor suppression...|$|E

In contrast, neurons from the superficial SC layers showed little color-related activity. Crucially, visual onset latencies were 30 – 35 ms longer for color, implying that luminance and chrominance information reach the SC through distinct pathways and that the observed colorrelated activity is not the result of residual luminance signals.

We used high contrast (75 %) spatially localized D 6 stimuli and cosine gratings (0. 25 – 9. 5 cpd). The SF discrimination was measured by the method of constant stimuli with a two-interval forced-choice procedure. Data show that: (i) for criterion-A, the discrimination thresholds for <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> were lower than that for luminance stimuli at low SFs, but similar or higher at higher SFs; for criterion-B, the thresholds to chromatic stimuli were higher than that to achromatic stimuli for all SFs; (ii) SF discrimination was best at inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of about 200 ms for <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> and at ISI of 0 ms for luminance stimuli; (iii) SF discrimination got better with stimulus duration and reached to plateau at 200 ms (or more) for <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> and at 67 ms (or more) for luminance stimuli; (iv) SF discrimination threshold (mean Δf= 0. 19 octaves) is about one-tenth of the full bandwidth (mean= 1. 96 octaves) of SF tuned mechanisms and is in hyperacuity range; both (discrimination and hyperacuity) {{can be explained by the}} relative activities within a population of tuned mechanisms. We conclude that color and luminance SF discrimination thresholds have a different SF dependence. While color appears to perform better than luminance vision at low SFs, this effect is lost or even reversed at high SFs. Data imply that color and form interact, but color and motion are largely segregated (i. e. they weakly interact) ...|$|R
