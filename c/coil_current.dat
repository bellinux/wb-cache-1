40|$|For {{accelerating}} {{different kinds}} of ions to various energies, the HIRFL-SSC should form the corresponding isochronous magnetic field by its main coil and trim coils. Previously, there were errors in fitting the theoretical isochronous magnetic field in the small radius region, which led to some operation difficulties for ion acceleration in the inject region. After further investigation of the restrictive condition of the maximum current limitation, the trim <b>coil</b> <b>currents</b> for fitting the theoretical isochronous magnetic field were recalculated by the conjugate gradients method. Better results were obtained {{in the operation of}} HIRFL-SSC. This article introduces the procedure to calculate the trim <b>coil</b> <b>currents.</b> The calculation method of conjugate gradients is introduced and the fitting error is analysed.

However, 3 sets of coils are nearly always used because it is compatible with a symmetric 3-phase AC sine current system.

40|$|Magnetic field {{intensity}} and currents {{passing through the}} coils of the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) 1 O cm Magnetic Suspension and Balance System (MSBS) were measured while a cylindrical model was oscillated along x,y,z and also about y and z axes, respectively. The model was made of alnico 5 and was 8 mm in diameter and 60 mm long. Two kinds of tests were carried out. Amplitude of the oscillation was varied at a frequency of 10 Hz. Frequency was varied from 1 to 50 Hz in the other test.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{survey of the}} various computational methods in CEDRES++ for finding equilibria of toroidal plasma. Our focus is on free-boundary plasma equilib-ria, where either poloidal field <b>coil</b> <b>currents</b> or the temporal evolution of voltages in poloidal field circuit systems are given data. Centered around a piecewise linear finite element representation of the poloidal flux map, our approach allows in large parts the use of established numerical schemes. The coupling of a finite element method and a boundary element method gives consistent numerical solutions for equilibrium problems in unbounded domains. We formulate a new Newton method for the discretized non-linear problem to tackle the various non-linearities, including the free plasma boundary. The Newton method guarantees fast convergence and is the main building block for the inverse equilibrium problems that we can handle in CEDRES++ as well. The inverse problems aim at finding either poloidal field <b>coil</b> <b>currents</b> that ensure a desired shape and position of the plasma or at finding {{the evolution of the}} voltages in the poloidal field circuit systems that ensure a prescribed evolution of the plasma shape and position.
