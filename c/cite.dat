A total of 1, 492 <b>citing</b> literature, published from 1985 to 2005, were searched on Web of Science database. Moreover, 8, 813 <b>cited</b> literature was obtained from <b>citing</b> literature.

5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts <b>cite</b> for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{extent to}} which {{articles}} are <b>cited</b> is a surrogate of the impact and importance of the research conducted; poorly <b>cited</b> articles may identify research of limited use and potential wasted investments. We assessed trends in the rates of poorly <b>cited</b> articles and journals in the cardiovascular literature from 1997 to 2007. Methods and Results: We identified original articles published in cardiovascular journals and indexed in the Scopus citation database from 1997 to 2007. We defined poorly <b>cited</b> articles as those with ≤ 5 citations in the 5 years following publication and poorly <b>cited</b> journals as those with > 75 % of journal content poorly <b>cited.</b> We identified 164 [*] 377 articles in 222 cardiovascular journals from 1997 to 2007. From 1997 to 2007, the number of cardiovascular articles and journals increased by 56. 9 % and 75. 2 %, respectively. Of all the articles, 75 [*] 550 (46. 0 %) were poorly <b>cited,</b> of which 25 [*] 650 (15. 6 % overall) had no citations. From 1997 to 2007, the proportion of poorly <b>cited</b> articles declined slightly (52. 1 %- 46. 2 %, trend P< 0. 001), although the absolute number of poorly <b>cited</b> articles increased by 2595 (trend P< 0. 001). At a journal level, 44 % of cardiovascular journals had more than three-fourths of the journal's content poorly <b>cited</b> at 5 years. Conclusion: Nearly half of all peer-reviewed articles published in cardiovascular journals are poorly <b>cited</b> 5 years after publication, and many are not <b>cited</b> at all. The cardiovascular literature {{and the number of}} poorly <b>cited</b> articles both increased substantially from 1997 to 2007. The high proportion of poorly <b>cited</b> articles and journals suggests inefficiencies in the cardiovascular research enterprise.
