40|$|Although aqueous {{simulations}} with periodic {{boundary conditions}} more accurately describe protein dynamics than in vacuo simulations, these are computationally intensive for most proteins. Trp repressor dynamic simulations {{with a small}} water shell surrounding the starting model yield protein trajectories that are markedly improved over gas phase, yet computationally efficient. Explicit water in molecular dynamics simulations maintains surface exposure of protein hydrophilic atoms and burial of hydrophobic atoms by opposing the otherwise asymmetric protein-protein forces. This properly orients protein surface side chains, reduces protein fluctuations, and lowers the overall {{root mean square deviation}} from the crystal structure. For simulations with crystallographic waters only, a linear or sigmoidal distance-dependent dielectric yields a much better trajectory than does a <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> model. As more water is added to the starting model, the differences between using distance-dependent and <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> models becomes smaller, although the linear distance-dependent dielectric yields an average structure closer to the crystal structure than does a <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> model. Multiplicative constants greater than one, for the linear distance-dependent dielectric simulations, produced trajectories that are progressively worse in describing trp repressor dynamics. Simulations of bovine pancreatic trypsin were used to ensure that the trp repressor results were not protein dependent and to explore the effect of the nonbonded cutoff on the distance-dependent and <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> simulation models. The nonbonded cutoff markedly affected the constant but not distance-dependent dielectric bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor simulations. As with trp repressor, the distance-dependent dielectric model with a shell of water surrounding the protein produced a trajectory in better agreement with the crystal structure than a <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> model, and the physical properties of the trajectory average structure, both with and without a nonbonded cutoff, were comparable...|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulated}} annealing {{is applied to}} the tertiary structure predic-tion of a 17 -residue synthetic peptide, which is known by experiment to exhibit high helical content at low pH. Two dielectric models are considered: sigmoidal distance-dependent dielectric function and a <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> function (c = 2). Starting from completely random initial conformations, our simulations for both dielectric models at low pH gave many helical conformations. The obtained low-energy conformations are compared with the NOESY cross peak data for both main chain and side chains, and it is shown that the results for the sigmoidal d&ectric function agree with the experimental data more than for the <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> function. The failure of the <b>constant</b> <b>dielectric</b> function is interpreted to be due to the insufficiently screened repulsive electrostatic interactions among four positively charged residues at low pH. The results of the sigmoidal dielectric func-tion predict the existence of two disjoint helices around residues 5 - 9 and 11 - 16. Simulations with high pH, on the other hand, hardly gave a helical conformation, which is also in accord with the experiment.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Constant</b> <b>{{dielectric}}</b> (CD) and distance-dependent dielectric (DDD) {{functions are}} the most popular and widespread in the Molecular Mechanics simulations of large molecular systems. In this article, we present a simple procedure to derive an effective dielectric constant, out,eff, for these two methods based on numerical solutions of the Poisson equation. It was found that because of the very approximate nature of the CD and DDD models there is no universal out,eff, which will work equally well for all molecular systems. For example, different MD trajectories of the same molecule can produce different optimal out,effs. The DDD function was found to yield better agreement with the numerical solutions of the Poisson equation than a CD model does. The reason is that a DDD function gives a better description of the electrostatic interactions at short distances between the atoms. Another interesting finding {{of this study is that}} under certain conditions out,eff can take negative values for a system of two atoms at a limited distance range. However, in principle, there is nothing to prevent the out,eff from taking negative values for specific conformations of some molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
