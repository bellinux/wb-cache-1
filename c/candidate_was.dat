5|$|Although {{not known}} as a {{reformer}} before his appointment, Robert returned in 1051 from Rome, where {{he had gone to}} be confirmed by the papacy, and opposed the king's choice for Bishop of London {{on the grounds that the}} <b>candidate</b> <b>was</b> not suitable. Robert's attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by Earl Godwin contributed to the quarrel between the earl and the king. When Godwin returned to England in 1052 Robert was outlawed and exiled, following which King Edward appointed Stigand to the archbishopric. The appointment was either a reward from Godwin for Stigand's support during the conflict with Edward or a reward from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the crisis in 1052. Stigand was the first non-monk to be appointed to either English archbishopric since before the days of Dunstan (archbishop from 959 to 988).|$|E
