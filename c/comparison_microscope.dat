5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon.

These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a <b>comparison</b> <b>microscope.</b> Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E

25|$|Microscopes {{were first}} {{developed}} {{with just two}} lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece. The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has a longer focal length. This {{has the effect of}} producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the <b>comparison</b> <b>microscope,</b> looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.|$|E

The invention of the <b>comparison</b> <b>microscope</b> by Calvin Goddard and Phillip O. Gravelle in 1925 modernized the forensic examination of firearms.

40|$|Every firearm has {{individual}} characteristics {{that are as}} unique to it as fingerprints are to human beings. When a firearm is fired, it transfers these characteristics – {{in the form of}} microscopic scratches and dents – to the fired bullets and cartridge casings. The rifling of the barrel of the firearm marks the bullets travelling through it, and the firearm's breech mechanism marks the ammunition's cartridge casing. Characterising these marks is the critical element in identifying firearms. Traditionally the comparison of ballistic evidence has been a tedious and time-consuming process requiring highly skilled examiners. In the past decade, engineers have created automated ballistics identification systems that meld traditional <b>comparison</b> <b>microscopes</b> with digital cameras, computers, huge databases, and image analysis techniques. This kind of system can help investigators to link crimes by automatically finding similarities among images of bullet but suffering significant drawbacks and minimal matching. More recently, approaches based on 3 D digital representations of evidence surface topography have started to appear, both in research and industrial products. Potentially the introduction of 3 D surface topography measurement can overcome the limitations of digital imaging systems by making the bullet surface measurement reproducible and reliable. A 3 D quantitative approach for bullet identification is proposed in this paper. In this system the surface topography of the whole bullet can be acquired for analysis and identification. Primary researches have been done by applying advanced surface topography techniques for bullet marks’ characteristics extraction. A variety of 2 D and 3 D visualization graphics have also been provided to help firearm examiners to make final decisions...|$|R

Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material.

2500|$|On April 8, 1927, their appeals exhausted, Sacco and Vanzetti {{were finally}} {{sentenced to death}} in the {{electric}} chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T.

By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that an automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Major Calvin Goddard in 1927.
