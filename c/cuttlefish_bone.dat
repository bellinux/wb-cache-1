50|$|The {{greater crested tern}} breeds in colonies, {{often in}} {{association}} with other seabirds. It is monogamous and the pair bond is maintained through the year and sometimes in consecutive breeding seasons. The colony size {{is related to the}} abundance of pelagic fish prey, and the largest documented colony, with 13,000 to 15,000 pairs, is in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia, a region which also supports major colonies of other seabirds. Since nesting in this area follows the summer monsoonal flooding, it is presumably a response to fish stocks rising, probably due to river run-off providing extra nutrient to the Gulf. This tern does not show site fidelity, frequently changing its nest site from year to year, sometimes by more than 200 km.A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting, and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or <b>cuttlefish</b> <b>bones.</b> One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30 days prior to hatching. The eggs are cream with blackish streaks. Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colony and more tightly so within sub-colonies. Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched chicks, but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two days-old, shortly before they begin to wander from the nest. The precocial chicks, which are very pale with black speckling, are brooded and fed by both parents, but may gather in crèches when older. The young terns fledge after 38 to 40 days, but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until they are about four months old.|$|R
30|$|Groundwater {{containing}} fluoride concentration {{greater than}} 1.5  mg L− 1 will, therefore, require defluoridation. Several authors have reviewed various {{techniques such as}} precipitation, co-precipitation, ion exchange and adsorption for defluoridation of groundwater (Mohapatra et al. 2009; Velazquez-Jimenez et al. 2015). Among these techniques, adsorption is widely used because of its viability and sustainability since it uses locally available and cost effective materials. Numerous adsorbents have been developed and tested for fluoride removal which includes cow dung (Rajkumar et al. 2015), clay soils (Coetzee et al. 2003), activated alumina (Maliyekaal et al. 2006), <b>cuttlefish</b> <b>bones</b> (Nasr et al. 2011) and bimetal oxide (Tang and Zhang 2016). Out of the tested adsorbents, the activated alumina is {{the most widely used}} because of its low-cost advantage and availability. However, activated alumina has difficulty for operation and poor sustainability due to frequent regeneration and low adsorption capacity (Chen et al. 2010). Vinati et al. (2015) reviewed the potential application of clay and clay minerals in defluoridation and concluded that clays exhibit immense potential for fluoride adsorption due to large specific surface area, chemical and mechanical stability, layered structure, and high cation exchange capacity. Bentonite is an alumino-silicate clay group which comprises of layers of alumino-silicate sheets and exhibits a high cation exchange capacity and low permeability (Agnello 2005). The permanent negative charges in the bentonite clay are stabilized by available exchangeable cations. This enhances the ability to remove contaminants by cationic exchange (Ma et al. 2012; Bradley and Weils 2004). Bentonite modified with high ionic density cations has shown higher capacity for anion adsorption. Thakre et al. (2010) documented that the Mg 2 +-incorporated bentonite works effectively over a wide range of pH and showed a maximum fluoride removal capacity of 2.26  mg g− 1 at an initial fluoride concentration of 5  mg L− 1, which was much better than the raw bentonite. Gitari et al. (2013) in their study show that Fe 3 +-modified bentonite exhibits ≈ 100 % of fluoride removal from drinking water over a pH range of 2 – 10, while the raw bentonite clay showed release of fluoride over the same range of pH. The main objective {{of the study was to}} synthesize a low-cost adsorbent by increasing surface charge density with introduction of Mn 2 + ions onto bentonite interlayers. The specific objectives were as follows: (1) to evaluate physicochemical properties of raw and modified bentonite, (2) to optimize the loading of Mn 2 + onto raw bentonite and lastly, (3) to evaluate F− adsorption capacity of the modified bentonite clay.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Discharge of textile {{wastewater}} {{causes the}} reduction of sunlight penetration, interferes with the receiving waters ecology and damage the environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the removal efficiency of reactive blue 19 dye from aqueous solutions by <b>cuttlefish</b> <b>bone</b> powder. Materials & Methods: This study was performed experimentally and in laboratory scale. In this research, the effect of adsorbent dose, contact time, initial dye concentration and pH was evaluated. Dye concentration in unknown samples was determined by UV/Vis spectrophotometer. In order to better understand the adsorption process, the experimental data were analysed with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Results: Results showed that increasing the adsorbent dose up to 0. 4 gr/ 100 ml and increasing of contact time, led to an increase in the efficiency of dye removal. Increasing the initial pH had no effect on the adsorption efficiency and increasing the initial concentration of dye decreased the removal efficiency. The Removal efficacy of the dye was found to be 60 %, 45 %, 37. 5 % and 31. 9 % at the time interval of 3 h and the initial dye concentrations of 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l, respectively.

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} development of a methodology for formulation in Fine Art, Design and Craft practice. The methodology is applied to the choosing of formulations for bronze and glass investments casting moulds in which a significant ingredient is <b>cuttlefish</b> <b>bone</b> powder, but it is claimed to have an applicability beyond this particular example. The methodology involves four steps; identifying key attributes (effects) which the required formulation must display, identifying the roles, shapes and sizes of the components of the formulation, finding a model which combines the component characteristics into a visualisation of the formulation, referred to as a "microstructure drawing", and using the microstructure drawing to describe the behaviour of the formulation. The research approach taken is to search for a suitable set of formulations using a traditional trial-and-error process. The key attributes required of the formulation are defined in terms of the handling characteristics, and the mechanical integrity of the hardened mould. The components are then characterised using micrographic images and a set of symbols developed to represent their size, shape and function. Then a visualisation of the formulation is developed by mixing symbols in proportion to the amount used in the formulation. These microstructure drawings are then used to describe the behaviour of the formulation. Conclusions are drawn as to the value of the microstructure drawing as an additional "sense" which the practitioner can use when searching for a suitable formulation. Comments are made on the generic aspects of the work, the feasibility of using <b>cuttlefish</b> <b>bone</b> powder for investment casting moulds, and on the communicability of the methodology...|$|E

In fact, despite the possibility to fabricate home-made materials in reproducible way to meet specific performance demands, the complexity of biological systems suggested to consider nature as an inspiration for the design and synthesis of new types of materials. In this context, marine biomaterials are a area of research with significant applications. In fact, the marine environment represents a unique resource of natural inorganic and organic materials with peculiar properties such as chemical and structural complexity, multifunctionality and miniaturization that are not possible to obtain in the laboratory.
