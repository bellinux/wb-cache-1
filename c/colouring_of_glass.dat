The presence of Iron could also produce a red colour, as well as form green and brown tones.3 [...] When copper was present and cooled in an oxidizing atmosphere (i.e. great exposure to oxygen) glass could achieve a blue-green colour. To get a clear blue colour cobalt was often used.3 To produce a purple colour manganese was added, and in the right environments manganese was also used as a decolouring agent. [...] Yellow and opaque white were created {{by the addition of}} antimony and lead or tin and lead and if a stronger orange colour was desired zinc was then added as well. [...] While the colouring of imported glass certainly took place in local Sub-Saharan beadworking sites, this does not imply that the minerals utilized came from local sources. Many glass pigments were most likely imported from abroad to Sub-Saharan beadworking sites.3 ...|$|E

In its place the following method evolved. I would be given a number of optional schedules for each furnace along with data on production and costs.

5000|$|Primary glass {{production}} {{involves the}} combination of the raw materials Soda, Lime and Silica, heated at specific temperatures in order to produce a basic glass compound (see Glass and Anglo-Saxon Glass). Traditionally, glass has been made from either the mixture of ground quartz stones (providing the silica) and plant ash (supplying the soda and lime elements); or, by utilizing sand as a silica and lime source and then adding a chemical natron for the remaining soda needed. The production <b>of</b> primary <b>glass</b> has seen much variation throughout its history, each region slightly altering the chemical composition to better suit its particularly environmental and cultural needs (i.e. adding various fluxes/chemical additives in order to lower the required melting temperature). The addition of mineral deposits to alter the <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> can be carried out in the primary stage or can be added in later stages of production. The secondary production <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> typically involves processes <b>of</b> <b>colouring,</b> remelting, shaping and decorating <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> object.

5000|$|The {{stages of}} the firing can be varied but {{typically}} start to climb at quite a rapid rate until the heat places the glass in an [...] "orange state" [...] i.e., flexible. At that point, gravity will allow the glass to slump into the mold and the temperature is held at a constant for a period that {{is known as the}} [...] "soak". Following this stage, the kiln is allowed to cool slowly so that the slumped glass can anneal and be removed from the kiln. If two differing <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> are used in a single piece of work, the same CoE (Coefficient <b>of</b> thermal Expansion) <b>glass</b> must be used, or the finished piece will suffer from fractures as the glass will shrink at differing rates and allow tension to build up to the point of destruction.

Brill was {{called upon to}} conduct scientific investigations of the huge amount of material generated at the site, in order to exploit the full potential of the artefacts; after all, the site was being excavated specifically because of {{its role as a}} glass factory (Brill 1988). Of the vast quantity <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> fragments from Jalame, both vessel sherds and cullet, most were aqua and green and all were soda-lime-silica glasses melted in highly reducing conditions (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Where the melting conditions had been increasingly reducing, a ferri-sulfide chromophore complex was shown to have formed, thus changing the bluey-aqua <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> to an olive, or even an amber shade (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Despite these colour variations, Brill’s further chemical analysis showed the vessel glasses to be highly homogenous in composition, apart from a clear divide where around 40 glasses demonstrated the intentional addition of manganese (Brill 1988). Most interestingly, especially in relation to his earlier work at Beth She’Arim, Brill conducted an investigation of the furnace at Jalame, nicknamed the Red Room, in which there was a mysterious absence <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> finds <b>of</b> any kind (Brill 1988). Whilst work at Beth She’Arim had eventually found there to be five firing chambers responsible for heating the one tank, the fragmentary remains at Jalame made it very difficult to interpret the furnace set-up, apart from the fact that they believed there to have been only one firing chamber (Brill 1988).|$|R
25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards <b>of</b> clarity and <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass. For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> by modifying the furnace atmosphere.

50|$|The {{east and}} west faces of the church are similar, both having {{centrally}} located transepts flanked by four equal bays of windows, two {{on either side of}} the transept gables. These bays of windows are made up of three lancet windows <b>of</b> stained <b>glass</b> and surrounded by lighter brickwork and cement render. The bays are divided by buttresses of dark brick which have cement rendered copings. The transept gables have double doors located centrally between two small windows and have been bagged and painted to match the front face of the church. Above the doorway is a circular window with stone tracery and stained glass panels. This is also surrounded by lighter brickwork. The <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> the stained <b>glass</b> in these windows differs on each side of the building. There are eight clerestory windows {{on either side of the}} transept gables. These are replacements of the originals and are round arched with each window divided into three smaller arches. Centrally located in the roof line above these windows are two ventilation gablets, one on either side of the transept gables.|$|R
