50|$|In {{digital radio}} systems, several {{variable}} bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream {{by means of}} statistical multiplexing. This {{makes it possible to}} transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. On communications satellites which carry broadcast television networks and radio networks, this is known as multiple channel per carrier or MCPC. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single transponder), single channel per <b>carrier</b> <b>mode</b> (SCPC) is used. Digital SCPC differs from the older analog SCPC transmission method in that a digital SCPC signal carries more than just a single audio channel (two are used) but also coding and decoding information, ancillary and control data, and network identification data. Digital SCPC and MCPC subcarrier transmissions use satellite broadcast standards such as DVB-S and its successor DVB-S2 along with MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 compression formats, respectively.

40|$|AbstractAfter {{heterologous}} expression in E. coli, functionally active phosphate carrier (PIC) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria was purified and reconstituted into giant liposomes {{and used for}} patch clamp experiments. Single channel currents across excised patches revealed an anion channel function of the PIC protein. Besides the three transport modes known to date, namely phosphate/phosphate exchange, phosphate/OH− exchange and mercurial-induced unidirectional transport, this channel activity represents the fourth transport mode of the PIC. The PIC channel activity was sensitive towards phosphate as its physiological substrate. Phosphate (10 mM) blocked in a specific but reversible manner the PIC channel, suggesting a phosphate-dependent conformational change of the protein into the <b>carrier</b> <b>mode.</b> Furthermore, the current through the channel and its gating activity were affected by divalent cations. In the presence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, the channel displayed a mean conductance of 25 ± 5 pS whereas 40 ± 10 pS was observed {{in the absence of}} divalent cations. Also, the dwell times in either the open or closed state of the PIC channel appeared to be prolonged in the presence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism, the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors is studied from low-energy to high-energy. The spin self-energy is evaluated explicitly in terms of the collective charge <b>carrier</b> <b>modes</b> in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels, and employed to calculate the dynamical spin structure factor. Our results show the existence of damped but well-defined dispersive spin excitations in the whole doping phase diagram. In particular, the low-energy spin excitations in the superconducting-state have an hour-glass-shaped dispersion, with commensurate resonance that appears in the superconducting-state only, while the low-energy incommensurate spin fluctuations can persist into the normal-state. The high-energy spin excitations in the superconducting-state on the other hand retain roughly constant energy as a function of doping, with spectral weights and dispersion relations comparable to those in the corresponding normal-state. The theory also shows that the unusual magnetic correlations in cuprate superconductors can be ascribed purely to the spin self-energy effects which arise directly from the charge carrier-spin interaction in the kinetic energy of the system.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{studies the}} carrier and mode choice {{selection}} {{problem in the}} China Pearl River Delta (PRD) area from selected shippers, who are aiming to deliver their overseas shipments. After the implementation of Environmental Act and Labour Law recently in China, particularly in Guangdong province, many factories have relocated their manufacturing base further inland (northwest-ward) to lower their fixed and operation costs. Hence they need to reassess their current transport network for overseas consignments. In this paper, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model is constructed based on comprehensive industrial interviews and statistical analysis. AHP is used to analyse the weakness and strength of impacting factors in carrier selection. Research Approach The initial stage will be focus on field data collected through questionnaire and telephone conversation with the local industrial practitioners. Data collected will be analyses {{to find out the}} basic parameters that constitute the carrier/mode choice. The methodology used in this research is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This is an analytical tool, supported by simple mathematics, which enables researchers to explicitly rank tangible and intangible factors against each other for the purpose of resolving conflicts or setting priorities. The process has been formalised by Saaty and used {{in a wide variety of}} problem areas. Over the past two decades, Saaty’s AHP has been developed to solve decision making problems in various fields by prioritisation of alternatives using eigenvectors and manipulations in matrix algebra. This paper studies the factors that will affect the shippers’ mode/carrier choice and ascertains the unique key factors that will affect their mode/carrier choice in the PRD for their overseas consignments. The model is implemented under different types of shipper according to the nature of their cargo consignments. Major criteria are summarised from field questionnaire for evaluating different modes and alternatives. Findings and Originality Raw data will be collected from shippers who operate in PRD region. The study will analysis those raw data and come up with some interesting findings. Research Impact No studies, as known by the authors that have been carried out on carrier and mode selection in this region in recent decades. The relocation of industrial activity due to changes of related labour and environmental laws has never been studied. The improvement in port performances and inland infrastructure of ports located near the new location may create a new platform for the study of mode and carrier choice.

40|$|The {{selection}} of freight transport mode {{in cities like}} Hong Kong, with little land, is in some respects obvious. The deciding criterion for mode/carrier selection {{is based on the}} {{selection of}} either the lowest total transport cost or the shortest transit time for the cargo. The peculiar nature of each transport mode, namely; rail, sea, road and air, will definitely earn their own places when shippers need to make a decision on their shipments. The nature of the cargo will also affect the choice of carrier/mode when they are transported in break bulk. Fortunately, the invention of ISO containers in the late 1950 s eliminated and overcame the shortfall in some transport modes. With the extensive usage of ISO containers hereafter, shippers can now enjoy a much freer choice of transport mode. When China started its open-door policy in the late 1970 s, many local (Hong Kong) manufacturers relocated their factories to the Pearl River Delta (PRD) due to the low labour and land costs. Delivery of shipments was mainly carried out by Hong Kong freight forwarders as they had been in business with the shippers for decades. Road transport was the only mode choice available at that time due to the inflexibilities in other transport modes such as sea and rail. Progressively, these factories were relocated northwards at a later time due to the gradually increasing labour and land costs. Freight forwarders were then faced with a prolonged delivery time due to the stringent Customs regulations in China as well as a progressive increase in the physical distance between the factory and the loading port in Hong Kong. The continuous developments in adjacent ports in Southern China offered freight forwarders an opportunity to revise the route of consignments so that the lowest cost and shortest transit times were achievable. Nowadays, consignments from the PRD region can be transported to the loading ports via at least three transport modes, namely, sea (barge), road (truck) and rail. In addition to physical constraints in the mode/carrier selection, the mode choice in China is further complicated due to the inflexible Customs regulations and government policies on tax rebates. Considerable research has been done on mode and carrier selection for bulk cargo in Western countries. However there is no explicit study on the mode choice in China. This thesis studies factors that will affect the shippers’ mode/carrier choice and ascertains the unique key factors that will affect their mode/carrier choice in the PRD for their overseas consignments. From this study, it was observed that shippers irrespective of the consignment size and cargo value prefer to use a loading port that is reliable and efficienct in operation. This is the first thesis written about <b>carrier</b> <b>mode</b> choice in China applying systematic and rationale methods to express the mode selection criteria in PRD area. The results were achieved by using the pairwise comparison method - Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method so that rigidity of the results is academically accepted. Nevertheless, further study on the mode choice can be carried forward through assessing buying behaviour and the shipper-carrier relationship.
