25|$|Habitat loss {{continues}} to be a major problem for the species. In northern Australia, much of the nesting habitat of the saltwater crocodile is susceptible to trampling by feral water buffalo, although buffalo eradication programs have now reduced this problem considerably. Even where large areas of suitable habitat remain, subtle habitat alterations can be a problem, such as in the Andaman Islands, where freshwater areas, used for nesting, are being increasingly converted to human agriculture. After the <b>commercial</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> crocodile skins waned, perhaps the greatest immediate challenge to implementing conservation efforts has been the occasional danger the species can pose to humans, and the resulting negative view of the crocodile.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations between Canning and Fagel {{started on}} 20 July 1820. The Dutch were adamant on the British {{abandonment}} of Singapore. Indeed, Canning was {{unsure of the}} exact circumstances under which Singapore was acquired, and at first, only non-controversial issues such as free-navigation rights {{and the elimination of}} piracy were agreed upon. Discussions on the subject were suspended on 5 August 1820, and did not resume until 1823, by which time the <b>commercial</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> Singapore was well-recognized by the British. The negotiations resumed on 15 December 1823, by which time the discussion became centred around the establishment of clear spheres of influence in the region. The Dutch, realising that the growth of Singapore could not be curbed, pressed for an exchange in which they abandoned their claims north of the Strait of Malacca and its Indian colonies in exchange for the confirmation of their claims south of the strait, as well as the British colony of Bencoolen. The final treaty was signed on 23 March 1824 by Fagel and Canning.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-20th century, the {{knowledge}} of making amate paper was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village. It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla {{as many of the}} villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals. The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the shamans, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used for cutting gods and other figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture. But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of amate paper was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing amate paper in rituals. One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the <b>commercial</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts.|$|E

500|$|MEP was not {{intended}} to be a production design, and would be able to export only small amounts of electricity. It would, however, {{serve as the basis for}} the first production model, LIFE.2. LIFE.2 would produce 2.2GW of fusion energy and convert that to 1GW of electrical at 48% efficiency. Over a year, LIFE would produce 365 days x 24 hours x 0.9 capacity factor x 1,000,000kW nameplate rating = 8billion kWh. In order to generate that power, the system will have to burn 365 x 24 x 60 minutes x 60 seconds x 15 pellets per second x 0.9 capacity = 425million fuel pellets. If the pellets cost the suggested price of 50 cents each, that is over $200million a year to fuel the plant. The average rate for wholesale electricity in the US [...] is around 5 cents/kWh, so this power has a <b>commercial</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> about $212million, suggesting that LIFE.2 would just barely cover, on average, its own fuel costs.|$|E

When he opened the London armory he posted a 14-foot sign on the roof across from Parliament reading [...] "Colonel Colt's Pistol Factory" [...] as a publicity stunt which created a stir in the British press. Eventually the British government forced him to take down this sign. Colt historian Herbert Houze wrote that Colt championed the concept of modernism before the word was coined, he pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements to promote his products, he introduced the adjective [...] "new and improved" [...] to advertising and demonstrated the <b>commercial</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> brand-name recognition as the word for [...] "revolver" [...] in French is Le Colt. Barbara M. Tucker, professor of history and director of the Center for Connecticut Studies at Eastern Connecticut State University, wrote that Colt's marketing techniques transformed the firearm from a utilitarian object into a central symbol of American identity. Tucker added that Colt tied his revolvers to American patriotism, freedom and individualism while asserting America's technological supremacy over Europe's.|$|E

Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey.

Differences in favour of eel are also reported for cholesterol, as well as differences in energy content in favour of eel and grey mullet. Absorption index for all species was higher than 0. 92.
