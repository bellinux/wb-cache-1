The Semantic Web envisions a portion of the World-Wide Web in which the underlying data is machine understandable and can thus be exploited for improved querying, aggregation, and interaction. <b>Excel</b> <b>Sheet</b> Based Semantic Email is a type of Semantic Web application, which deals with the understanding of emails received and performing corresponding actions according to the schema specified in the email. The user can compose an email structure and specify all the semantic actions and necessary information related to a particular schema. The emails received are processed according to the schema format to which they belong and corresponding semantic actions are taken. In this project, Semantic Email is implemented by encoding the information in <b>Excel</b> <b>Sheets.</b> It could be reengineered to support heterogeneous semantic actions based on the particular application. The project can be enhanced providing a web interface, apart from the email system that is currently used as the way of communication. The clients can directly use the web page...|$|R

To organize the process in Sweden, the Swedish Bahá’í Institute has assigned coordinators on both national and regional level. To assist them in their task of monitoring the progress, <b>Excel</b> <b>sheets</b> were designed with statistics of courses, tutors and participants. These <b>Excel</b> <b>sheets</b> proved {{to be very difficult to}} use and not appreciated by the coordinators, as basic information was difficult to find, everything had to be updated manually and reports took long time to create. The purpose of my Master’s thesis was to, with the help of a user-centered design process, develop and design an interface for reporting statistics and monitoring the progress of the institute process. My users were the coordinators, both the national and the regional coordinators, who have similar needs, differing only in scale. As the regional coordinators are spread over the country, having a user-centered approach becomes increasingly difficult. Th...|$|R
