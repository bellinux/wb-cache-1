40|$|Many {{companies}} have established online product communities or forums {{as a vehicle}} to extend product support services to their customers.

Drawing on theories and concepts from diverse areas including computer-mediated communication, consumer psychology, and online communities, this study proposes a four dimensional construct - Online Community Experience (OCE) - to capture <b>customer</b> <b>experiences</b> in such online product communities, and examines its impact on customer attitudes regarding the product, the company, and the quality of service.
