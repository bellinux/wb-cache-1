The <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> defined a modest maximum construction cost and building volume (50 cubic metres) per student.

5000|$|The basic {{building}} blocks for all derivative contracts are futures and swaps contracts. In energy markets, these are traded in New York NYMEX, in Tokyo TOCOM and online through the IntercontinentalExchange. A future is a contract to deliver or receive oil (in {{the case of an}} oil future) at a defined point in the future. The price is agreed on the date the deal/agreement/bargain is struck together with volume, duration, and contract index. The price for the futures contract at the date of delivery (contract expiry date) may be different. At the expiry date, depending upon the <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> the [...] "futures" [...] owner may either deliver/receive a physical amount of oil (extremely rare), they may settle in cash against an expiration price set by the exchange, or they may close out the contract prior to expiry and pay or receive the difference in the two prices.

50|$|From the mid-1930s, {{the company}} became {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} British rearmament programme, developing and producing military vehicles. In 1935 Guy submitted their new four wheel Ant armoured car to military trials where it impressed and 150 were ordered by the government. After this success Guy began to concentrate solely on the production of military vehicles and by 1938 Guy relied exclusively on Government contracts and had ended civilian productions. During this time Guy designed a new armoured car, the Quad Ant, which was welded rather than riveted together. The original official <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> it had been designed in response to had been for riveted construction but Guy had suggested welding as being more suitable and effective. To that end they developed the necessary techniques including rotating jigs which meant the bodies and turrets could be produced quicker and cheaper. This new development made armoured vehicles much safer and {{is reported to have}} eventually saved the British government £100 million pounds, earning Guy a commendation from the Royal Commission. Initially though, the government's technical advisors were skeptical that welding armour plate using these techniques would be economical, so Guy offered to weld the first batch ordered, and if unsuccessful, to stand the cost. The vehicles were welded, and on examination by the British Army, the welding was found to have worked extremely well. Over time it was further developed and became widely used in allied armoured vehicles, such as later models of the Churchill and Sherman tanks.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} optimal portfolio choice on fair pricing of specific pension insurance contracts. We motivate that {{the manager of the}} insurance company should optimize utility of final payout for the policy holders. The payout to the policy holder is highly non-linear in wealth, implying that the optimization problem is non-trivial. Still, we find closed form solutions. Simultaneously with the optimal portfolio choice we find fair <b>contract</b> <b>specifications</b> {{in the sense that the}} market values of future claims to policy and equity holders, respectively, are equal to their initial deposits. We find that the introduction of a dynamic optimal portfolio changes the fair <b>contract</b> <b>specifications</b> as well as the comparative statics considerably compared to the case with a fixed underlying portfolio. The utility loss, measured by a certainty equivalent wealth, of not introducing portfolio choice can have an arbitrary sign since the fair <b>contract</b> <b>specifications</b> change by the introduction of optimal portfolio choice. Our findings illustrate that dynamic portfolio choice should not be ignored when analyzing fair insurance contracts. JEL Classification: G 11, G 13, G 2...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} mapping from the {{concepts}} and terms of a business contract language (BCL) to the ex-ecutable primitives of a fully-distributed choreography en-gine (Finesse).

Through this process we also identify minimal properties of a business <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> nec-essary to deterministically transform the specification into an executable program, and similarly, we highlight the key semantic properties of a choreography engine necessary to implement business contracts. This mapping indicates how a business <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> might be mapped onto a standard process execution environment for E-commerce. ...|$|E

40|$|Many popular methodologies are {{influenced}} by Design by Contract. They recommend to specify the intended behavior of operations in an early phase of the software development life cycle. Formal <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> languages, however, are still rarely used because their semantics often mismatch the needs of software developers. Restrictive specification languages usually suffer from the ”frame problem”: It is hard to express which parts of the system state should remain unaffected when the specified operation is executed. Constructive specification languages, instead, suffer from the tendency to make specifications deterministic. This paper investigates how a combination of OCL and graph transformations can overcome the frame problem and can make constructive specifications less deterministic. Our new <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> language is considerably more expressive than both pure OCL and pure graph transformations...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note {{provides an example}} set of <b>contract</b> <b>specifications</b> {{that can be used}} as a template by Corps personnel for planting salt marsh vegetation. While the example presented here will be useful to U. S.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new version}} of the CL <b>contract</b> <b>specification</b> language. CL combines deontic logic with propositional dynamic logic but it applies the modalities exclusively over structured actions. CL features synchronous actions, conflict relation, and an action negation operation. The CL version that we present here is more expressive and has a cleaner semantics than its predecessor. We give a direct semantics for CL in terms of normative structures. We show that CL respects several desired properties from legal contracts and is decidable. We relate this semantics with a trace semantics of CL which we used for run-time monitoring contracts. ...|$|E
