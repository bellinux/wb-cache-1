5|$|In 2008, solar {{electricity}} was not cost competitive with bulk, baseload power. However, it does provide electricity {{when and where}} power is most limited and most expensive, which is a strategic contribution. Solar electricity mitigates the risk of fuel-price volatility and improves grid reliability. Since then <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> decreased to make {{solar electricity}} increasingly competitive.|$|E
5|$|Increasing costs: due {{to higher}} costs {{of fuel and}} insurance, and due to greater {{regulation}} requiring equipment such as new radios, {{or in some cases}} transponders, gliding <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> increased, although without the continuous use of engines and fuel, they are still considerably lower than traditional power flying.|$|E

30|$|For karyotyping, staff time {{required}} to perform the test or grade of staff used was the area most likely to impact upon total costs. For instance, substituting a clinical scientist with an MTO reduced the total cost to £ 95, a difference of £ 22. Other <b>costs</b> <b>had</b> limited impact upon karyotyping total costs. For aCGH, varying array (slide) <b>costs</b> <b>had</b> the greatest impact upon total cost. Changing the array to £ 25 per patient, reduced total test cost to £ 342. By comparison, equipment and staff <b>costs</b> <b>had</b> limited impact.|$|R

5|$|While health {{insurance}} premium <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> moderated, {{some of this}} is because of insurance policies that have a higher deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients. In addition, many employees are choosing to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the impact of the ACA difficult to determine precisely.|$|E
5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for construction in the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for construction in the city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{existing}} large-scale photovoltaic power stations are {{owned and operated by}} independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits, but as levelized <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E

5|$|Residential {{development}} of the mountain's southern foothills {{has been on the}} rise for several years, primarily in the form of single-family residences. Construction <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> continued to rise as well, in part because of a bill passed in 2003. Oregon House Bill 3375 required that new construction on slopes of 20 percent or greater with unstable soil undergo increased regulation and an extended approval process. The bill doubled the cost of new foundations to around $20,000 to $30,000, and the cost of retrofitting an existing structure approached $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} the {{extension}} to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949. Rising construction costs caused by difficult ground conditions and restricted funds in the post-war austerity period led the scheme to be cancelled again in 1950. Various proposals have been evaluated since, including an extension to Peckham considered in the early 1970s, but the <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> always out-weighed the benefits.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} events can disrupt and or damage the {{infrastructure}} upon which society depends. Several recent eruptions have illustrated {{the vulnerability of}} urban areas that received only a few millimetres or centimetres of volcanic ash. This has been sufficient to cause disruption of transportation, electricity, water, sewage and storm water systems. <b>Costs</b> <b>have</b> been incurred from business disruption, replacement of damaged parts and insured losses. Ash fall impacts on critical infrastructure can also cause multiple knock-on effects, which may disrupt many different sectors and services.|$|E

5|$|On 28 July 2008, the {{pavilion}} {{at the end}} of the Grand Pier was completely destroyed by a fire. Eleven fire engines and 80 firefighters could not contain the blaze, which is believed to have started in the north-east tower of the Pavilion. A competition was held to design a new pavilion, and the project was awarded to the winning architect Angus Meek Architects of Bristol. Construction work began on the pier and new pavilion in 2009, and it was scheduled to reopen in July 2010, after a £39 million rebuilding programme. After continuing problems and setbacks, with the pier not opening until a formal opening ceremony on 23 October 2010, the overall <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> reached £51 million. During the same period there was a £34 million redevelopment of the promenade, including refurbishment of the Marine Lake and pedestrianisation of Pier Square. As part of the work, a scour protection apron and splash wall were added as part of flood prevention measures.|$|E
5|$|Park Lane is {{the second}} most {{valuable}} property in the London edition of the board game Monopoly. The street had a prestigious social status when the British version of the Monopoly board was first produced, in 1936. On the board, Park Lane forms a pair with Mayfair, the most expensive property in the game. The squares were designed to be equivalents of Park Place and Boardwalk, respectively, on the original board, which used streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988, the World Monopoly Championships were held at the Park Lane Hotel, sponsored by Waddingtons, manufacturers of the British version. Since the game's original production, prices on the real Park Lane have held their value, though average rent <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> been overtaken by Bond Street.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 {{has been}} in active service with the USAF since 1955. , 58 were in active service with 18 in reserve. The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was disestablished in 1992 and its {{aircraft}} absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010 all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the newly created Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). Superior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> kept the B-52 in service despite the advent of later, more advanced aircraft, including the canceled Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie, the variable-geometry B-1 Lancer, and the stealth B-2 Spirit. The B-52 completed sixty years of continuous service with its original operator in 2015. After being upgraded between 2013 and 2015, {{it is expected to}} serve into the 2040s. The B-52s are expected to reach the end of their service lives by 2045, and be replaced by B-21 Raiders.|$|E

5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as wind turbine {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance <b>costs</b> <b>have</b> continued to decline. For example, the wind {{industry in the}} USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
