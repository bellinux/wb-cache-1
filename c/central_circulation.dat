25|$|Thiopental {{rapidly and}} easily crosses the {{blood brain barrier}} {{as it is a}} {{lipophilic}} molecule. As with all lipid-soluble anaesthetic drugs, the short duration of action of sodium thiopental is due almost entirely to its redistribution away from <b>central</b> <b>circulation</b> towards muscle and fat tissue, due to its very high fat:water partition coefficient (aprx 10), leading to sequestration in fat tissue. Once redistributed, the free fraction in the blood is metabolized in the liver. Sodium thiopental is mainly metabolized to pentobarbital, 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-hydroxybutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid, and 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-carboxypropyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid.|$|E

25|$|On December 5, 2010, an extratropical {{disturbance}} {{developed in}} the western Gulf of Alaska, along a stationary front. During the next few days, the system rapidly intensified, while channeling smaller winter storms and moisture from the Pineapple Express atmospheric river in {{the west coast of}} North America, before approaching the North American west coast itself on December 8. On December 9, a new low pressure area formed to the south of Alaska in the storm system's circulation, becoming the dominant low of the storm on December 11, when the original low pressure center dissipated over the coast of British Columbia. During the next few days, the storm system slowly looped back westward while slowly strengthening, before moving back towards the West Coast on December 13. During this time, the storm system channeled more moisture into the Pacific Northwest and other neighboring regions, triggering flooding in some areas. After stalling for a day, on December 14, the <b>central</b> <b>circulation</b> split again, with the original center of circulation intensifying and moving ashore, while the new low stalled in the northern Gulf of Alaska became the dominant low of the storm.|$|E

2500|$|Wright's {{design for}} the repositioned home – now in its third {{revision}} – utilized the Gray home foundation and framing for several walls and floors but otherwise entirely engulfed the original building. [...] The existing stair hall was retained and extended {{to serve as the}} <b>central</b> <b>circulation</b> spine for the first and second levels. [...] As a result of turning the structure during the move, the hall was made to traverse the lot from side to side, or from north to south. [...] This unusual orientation inconspicuously placed the front door halfway down the north elevation instead of directly facing the street. [...] The first floor hall was divided into three sections; a small vestibule inside the entrance was followed by a narrow passageway lined by French doors on one side which terminated in an open space with broad doorways into each of the home's principle rooms. [...] Of these, the living room, library and kitchen were carved out of the original house, while a rear addition housed a dining room and pantry. [...] Two staircases – one a wide, open, public stair in the central hall, and the other a narrow, winding, and closed service stair – connected the first and second floors. [...] The second floor contained five bedrooms around a single hall bathroom. [...] A finished third story, accessed by the tight service stair, contained two servant bedrooms and a second bathroom. [...] All in all, the remodeling and expansions brought the house to a gross floor area of approximately 1800squarefeet (170m2) on the first floor 1600squarefeet (150m2) on the second.|$|E

2500|$|On December 15, the Aleutian Low {{opened up}} a large {{atmospheric}} river (the Pineapple Express) again, over California, which fed the storm system moisture, allowing it to strengthen significantly. This in turn brought torrents of rain and occasional gusts of wind, while the main storm itself slowly strengthened while stalling in the Gulf of Alaska. By December 15, a powerful Kona low (which would later become Tropical Storm Omeka) had also set up near Hawaii, feeding additional moisture into the Pineapple Express, which in turn strengthened the storm system even further. The favorable weather pattern allowed the storm to retain its intensity, even while it slowly moved down towards the West Coast. The massive storm complex slowly looped westward and then southward towards the West Coast, undergoing explosive intensification once more on December 19. The system stalled {{off the coast of}} the Pacific Northwest, and weakened slightly. However, the system fully opened up the Pineapple Express over California beginning on December 19, triggering flash floods, mudslides, and landslides across much of the Western States, particularly in California. The Pineapple Express system channeled large amounts of moisture into California, ravaging much of the state from December 15 through December 22, bringing with it as much as 20 inches of rain to the San Gabriel Mountains and San bernardinos and over 13 feet of snow in the Southern California mountains and [...] Sierra Nevada. Although the entire state was affected, the Southern California counties of San Bernardino, Orange, San Diego, and Los Angeles bore the brunt of the system of storms as coastal and hillside areas were impacted by mudslides and major flooding. During the time that the storm stalled off the West Coast, the system brought significant rain, snow, and mudslides California the Southwest region. On December 21, the storm complex's <b>central</b> <b>circulation</b> fell apart, as it began to interact with another storm in the Gulf of Alaska. On December 22, after stalling off the West Coast for 5 days, the weakened system finally approached Southern California and began moving ashore, making landfall early on December 23, which finally put a temporary end to the Pineapple Express event. Later on the same day, the winter storm weakened into a small, 1011 mbar storm, after moving eastward into the Four Corners region. On December 23, the winter storm interacted with another frontal system, causing the storm to weaken even further, {{to the point where the}} storm lost its circulation. By the time the winter storm reached southern Texas later in December 2010, almost all of the system's convection had dissipated.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrince William Sound (PWS) oceanic {{circulation}} {{is driven}} {{by a combination of}} local wind, large run-off and strong tides. Using a regional oceanic model of the Gulf of Alaska, adequately resolving the mean circulation and mesoscale eddies, we configure a series of three nested domains. The inner domain zooms in on Prince William Sound with a 1 -km horizontal grid resolution. We analyze a set of four experiments with different combinations of run-off, wind and tides to demonstrate the relative influence of these forcing on the <b>central</b> Sound mean <b>circulation</b> cell and its seasonal variability. The mean <b>circulation</b> in the <b>central</b> PWS region is generally characterized by a cyclonic cell. When forced only by the wind, the circulation is cyclonic in winter and fall and strongly anticyclonic in summer. The addition of freshwater run-off greatly enhances the eddy kinetic energy in PWS partly through near-surface baroclinic instabilities. This leads to a much more intermittent <b>circulation</b> in the <b>central</b> Sound, with the presence of intense small-scale turbulence and a disappearance of the summer wind-forced anticyclonic cell. The addition of tides reduces the turbulence intensity (relatively to the experiment with run-off only), particularly in the central Sound. The generation of turbulent motions by baroclinic processes is lowered by tidal mixing and by modification of the exchange at Hinchinbrook Entrance. Tides have an overall stabilizing effect on the <b>central</b> Sound <b>circulation.</b> Tidal rectification currents help maintain a mean cyclonic circulation throughout the year...|$|R

The incremental closure of the total retinal circulation may have led to other atypical features such as the high frequency of secondary neovascularization, which is unusual in central retinal artery occlusion and also unusual in eyes of patients with CMVR involving the entire retina.|$|R
