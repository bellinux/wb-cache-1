The <b>credit</b> <b>channel</b> affects the economy by altering the amount of credit firms and/or households have access to in equilibrium. Factors that reduce the availability of credit reduce agents' spending and investment, which leads to a reduction in output. In short, the main difference between the interest rate channel and the <b>credit</b> <b>channel</b> mechanism is how spending and investment decisions change due to monetary policy changes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>credit</b> <b>channel</b> view {{posits that}} {{monetary}} policy adjustments {{that affect the}} short-term interest rate are amplified by endogenous changes in the external finance premium. The external finance premium is a wedge reflecting {{the difference in the}} cost of capital internally available to firms (i.e. retaining earnings) versus firms' cost of raising capital externally via equity and debt markets. External financing is more expensive than internal financing and the external finance premium will exist so long as external financing is not fully collateralized. Fully collateralized financing implies that even under the worst-case scenario the expected payoff of the project is at least sufficient to guarantee full loan repayment. In other words, full collateralization means that the firm who borrows for the project has enough internal funds relative {{to the size of the}} project that the lenders assume no risk. Contractionary monetary policy is thought to increase the size of the external finance premium, and subsequently, through the <b>credit</b> <b>channel,</b> reduce credit availability in the economy.|$|E

50|$|Another {{topic of}} {{study is the}} impact of sudden stops on output. Sudden stops can be {{accompanied}} by a currency crisis and/or a banking crisis. Empirical studies show that the effects of a banking crisis are more pernicious than the effects of a currency crisis, due to the additional effect of the <b>credit</b> <b>channel</b> on output. Lower asset prices are a persistent fact after a banking crisis, which indicate a low value of collaterals to loans, and therefore, negatively impact the banking sector and the supply of loans.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>credit</b> <b>channel</b> {{operates}} as an amplification mechanism alongside {{the interest rate}} effect, small monetary policy changes can have large effects if the <b>credit</b> <b>channel</b> theory holds. Asset price boom and bust patterns in the 1980s {{may have led to}} the subsequent real fluctuations observed in many advanced economies. It has also been found that small firms, who are credit constrained relative to larger firms, respond to cash flow squeezes by cutting production and employment. Large firms, by contrast, respond to cash flow squeezes by increasing their short-term borrowing. Moreover, this empirical result still holds when controlling for industry characteristics and financial criteria. Recent research at the Federal Reserve suggests that the bank lending channel manifests itself through the mortgage lending market as well. Monetary policy tightening may force banks to shift from retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to uninsured managed liabilities if they wish to continue financing mortgages. These sources of funding are more expensive than deposits, raising the bank's average funding costs. Banks who lend heavily in sub-prime communities will face higher external finance premiums because the risk from holding assets composed largely of subprime borrowers is relatively high. As a result, banks have to raise funds through instruments that offer higher interest payments. The empirical evidence suggests that banks that lend heavily in subprime communities and rely mostly on retail deposits reduce mortgage issuance relative to other banks {{in the face of a}} monetary contraction. No evidence was found of reductions in mortgage lending initiating from other banks who do not lend heavily in subprime communities or who do not rely heavily on retail deposits in response to monetary policy tightening.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{monetary}} policy on firms' investment behaviour through the interest rate and <b>credit</b> <b>channels.</b> The analysis relies on a comprehensive database of Belgian firms covering all sectors of economic activity and firms of all sizes. We proceed in two steps. First, we estimate a reduced-form investment equation derived from the neoclassical model, augmented by cash flow. This equation gives us the sensitivity of investment to the user cost, sales and cash flow. This allows us to assess {{the relative importance of}} the interest rate and <b>credit</b> <b>channels.</b> We simulate the effect of a transitory change in the market interest rate on investment through changes in the user cost of capital and the cash flow-capital ratio. We additionally compute the long-run elasticity of the capital stock to the market interest rate. We perform both exercises for various sample splits according to sectors and sizes. Our results indicate that in the manufacturing and construction sector, small firms are more sensitive to monetary policy than large firms, that firms in the construction sector are more sensitive than firms in other sectors and that services firms are almost unaffected. The interest rate channel appears to be the dominant channel of monetary transmission; it accounts for 75 % of the first-year effect of an interest rate change. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
