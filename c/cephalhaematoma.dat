40|$|The {{reported}} {{frequency of}} neonatal <b>cephalhaematoma</b> is 0. 2 %– 2. 5 % of live births. 1 It is uncommon in premature infants. The condition is self-limiting and resolves {{in most cases}} by 2 – 3 months. 2 When the haematoma does not resolve, it may get organised, and calcifi cation may be seen. Rarely, ossifi cation is seen in a <b>cephalhaematoma.</b> There are only few published reports of ossifi cation of <b>cephalhaematoma.</b> Once ossifi ed, no signifi cant reduction in size can be anticipated. Management is primarily surgical for cosmetic reasons. As early operation gives a satisfactory outcome, it is prudent to get a radiograph or a CT scan if the haematoma has not resolved within 6 weeks after birth. 1 Diagnosis of <b>cephalhaematoma</b> is easily made radiographically, and CT scanning should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain after skull radiographic procedures have been performed or, more importantly, those in whom a pathologic intracranium is suspected or cosmetic correction is needed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND A <b>cephalhaematoma</b> {{is usually}} a benign {{condition}} which resolves spontaneously. Nevertheless, {{there is a small}} risk of primary or secondary infection and diagnosis of this condition is challenging. The {{purpose of this article is}} to summarise risk factors, clinical criteria, pathogenesis, appropriate investigations and treatment methods for infected cephalhaematomas in infants. CASE PRESENTATION A 5 -week-old infant presented with fever and a non-tender <b>cephalhaematoma</b> without local signs of inflammation. The inflammatory markers in blood were elevated. Urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were sterile. The raised inflammatory markers did not decrease under antibiotic treatment. An aspirate of the <b>cephalhaematoma</b> grew Escherichia coli. A debridement and evacuation of the haematoma was performed and the infant was treated with antibiotics for 11  days. The infant did not show any sequelae on follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS We present a case of an infected <b>cephalhaematoma</b> with Escherichia coli in a 5 -week-old infant. Diagnosis of an infected <b>cephalhaematoma</b> is challenging. Infection should be suspected if infant present with secondary enlargement of the haematoma, erythema, fluctuance, skin lesions or signs of systemic infection. Inflammatory markers and imaging have limited diagnostic power. The main associations with infection of cephalhaematomas are instrumental assisted deliveries and sepsis, followed by the use of scalp electrodes, skin abrasions and prolonged rupture of membranes. Although, aspiration is contraindicated in treatment of cephalhaematomas, it needs to be performed when an infection is suspected. Escherichia coli are the most frequently isolated bacteria from infected cephalhaematomas...|$|E
40|$|Where appropriate, {{to assist}} women {{to give birth}} vaginally by: forceps, {{involving}} direct traction on the fetal skull, or vacuum extraction, involving traction on the fetal scalp BACKGROUND INFORMATION In 2010, 836 instrumental vaginal deliveries occurred at KEMH. The use of forceps is more successful in achieving a successful vaginal delivery than with use of a vacuum extraction; however it is associated with higher rates of maternal complications including perineal trauma, tears, requirements for pain relief and incontinence. Neonatal facial injuries are more common with a forcep delivery while <b>cephalhaematoma</b> occurs more when a vacuum extraction method of delivery is utilised. The use of a soft vacuum cup causes less risk of scalp injuries and <b>cephalhaematoma,</b> 2 but has a higher failure rate. KEY POINTS 1. Medical doctors performing assisted deliveries should be deemed competent in accredited skills required to conduct these deliveries. An obstetric trainee must be supervised by an accredited medical doctor if conducting an assisted delivery...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} and {{its relationship}} to glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) status of healthy, term Chinese infants was evaluated in 220 G 6 PD-deficient infants, 26 intermediate infants who were observed for 3 weeks, and 116 normal (control) infants. Each infant was free of isoimmunisation, <b>cephalhaematomas,</b> or contusions. The mode of labour, method of delivery, and type of feeds had no appreciable effect on daily bilirubin levels. "Elevated" physiological jaundice was associated with normal and G 6 PD-deficient status; there was no increased haemolysis. G 6 PD-deficient status was associated with jaundice significantly raised especially {{in the first week of}} life, and prolonged beyond that of the "elevated" physiological jaundice. Significantly increased though mild haemolysis was observed. Close surveillance is therefore required for G 6 PD-deficient infants at least for the first week of life, the period of increased risk. With G 6 PD-intermediate infants, only the usual measures for normal infants are required...|$|R
40|$|One {{thousand}} {{five hundred}} and twenty-six records of deliveries with vacuum extractor in 1982 and 1983 in the Hong Kong University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology were reviewed. Vacuum extractor {{was found to}} be easy and safe to use even by inexperienced house-staff. Vacuum extractor was especially useful in the delivery of malpositioned fetal heads because of its mechanism of allowing autorotation. Its advantage of not occupying extra space in the pelvis was most beneficial to the relatively smaller Chinese pelvis. Maternal injury was uncommon. Fetal scalp injury like <b>cephalhaematoma</b> was not uncommon but serious scalp injury was infrequent. Perinatal mortality rate attributed to the instrument was low (0. 6 / 1, 000). However, in order to achieve safety to the mother and fetus, strict rules in application of the vacuum extractor must be observed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{contrast}} to the initiation of treatment for neonatal jaundice, specific guidelines for discontinuation of phototherapy and subsequent management of the infants are lacking. The current study aims at documenting the current practice and examining if babies can be discharged from phototherapy without routine evaluation for rebound hyperbilirubinaemia. Between January and May 1998 inclusively, all neonates aged under two weeks with a birth weight ≥ 2, 200 grams admitted for phototherapy were recruited for the study. Babies were excluded if they required intensive care, received parenteral nutrition, or were receiving antibiotics {{at the time of}} discontinuation of phototherapy. 154 infants were enrolled. Seven (4. 5 %) babies required a second course of phototherapy because their SB rebounded into the treatment range. When compared with those babies not requiring treatment again, they had a higher mean SB (234. 3 vs 204. 1, p< 0. 001) and {{were more likely to be}} younger than five days of life (3 / 7 vs 16 / 147, p= 0. 041) when phototherapy was first stopped. Other factors like sex, <b>cephalhaematoma,</b> glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, blood groups, Coombs ' test, onset of jaundice, and haemoglobin level were not found to be significant. If a threshold of SB ≤ 216 µmol/L (or 234 µmol/L less 2 standard deviations) were used for discontinuation of phototherapy without routine evaluation for rebound hyperbilirubinaemia, 61 % of the "well " babies in this study would have had an earlier discharge. Thus, a more structured guideline on the management of discontinuation of phototherapy is indicated for evaluation of our current practice.
