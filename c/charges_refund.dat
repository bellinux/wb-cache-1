40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the effect of <b>refunding</b> {{environmental}} <b>charges.</b> Taxes are often resisted by polluters because they imply both abatement and tax costs.

5000|$|Electronic {{payments}} are highly susceptible to fraud and abuse. Liability for misuse {{of credit card}} data can expose the merchant to significant financial loss {{if they were to}} attempt to manage such risks on his own. One way to lower this cost and liability exposure is to segment the transaction of the sale from the payment of the amount due. Many merchants offer subscription services, which require payment from a customer every month. SaaS payment processors relieve the responsibility of the management of recurring payments from the merchant and maintain safe and secure the payment information, passing back to the merchant a payment [...] "token" [...] or unique placeholder for the card data. Through Tokenization, merchants are able to use this token to process <b>charges,</b> perform <b>refunds,</b> or void transactions without ever storing the payment card data, which can help to make the merchant system PCI-compliant. Another method of protecting payment card data is Point to Point Encryption, which encrypts cardholder data so that clear text payment information is not accessible within the merchant's system {{in the event of a}} data breach. Some payment processors also specialize in high-risk processing for industries that are subject to frequent chargebacks, such as adult video distribution.|$|R

This report reviews the theoretical foundations for idealized pollution control MBIs.

40|$|Business {{processes}} {{form the}} backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation {{can be achieved by}} encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 2 ̆ 7 responsive 2 ̆ 7 workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 2 ̆ 7 order to cash 2 ̆ 7 process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 2 ̆ 7 interruptions 2 ̆ 7. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 2 ̆ 7 expected, asynchronous exceptions 2 ̆ 7 during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping <b>charge</b> or <b>refund</b> may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 2 ̆ 7 exception handling 2 ̆ 7 rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 2 ̆ 7 basic 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 extended 2 ̆ 7 interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies...|$|R
40|$|Paper I: Greenhouse gas {{taxes on}} animal food {{products}} - rationale, tax scheme and climate mitigation effects Agriculture {{is responsible for}} 25 – 30 % of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but has thus far been largely exempted from climate policies. Because of high monitoring costs and comparatively low technical potential for emission reductions in the agricultural sector, output taxes on emission-intensive agricultural goods may be an efficient policy instrument to deal with agricultural GHG emissions. In this study we assess the emission mitigation potential of GHG weighted consumption taxes on animal food products in the EU. We also estimate the decrease in agricultural land area through the related changes in food production and the additional mitigation potential in devoting this land to bioenergy production. Estimates {{are based on a}} model of food consumption and the related land use and GHG emissions in the EU. Results indicate that agricultural emissions in the EU 27 can be reduced by approximately 32 million tons of CO 2 -eq with a GHG weighted tax on animal food products corresponding to € 60 per ton CO 2 -eq. The effect of the tax is estimated to be six times higher if lignocellulosic crops are grown on the land made available and used to substitute for coal in power generation. Most of the effect of a GHG weighted tax on animal food can be captured by taxing the consumption of ruminant meat alone. Paper II: The Swedish nitrogen tax and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture The Swedish tax on nitrogen in synthetic fertilizers was abolished in 2010, possibly to compensate farmers for planned future increases in the CO 2 tax for the agricultural sector. This study estimates the effect of the nitrogen tax on agricultural emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), another greenhouse gas (GHG) that is more potent than CO 2. Price elasticities of nitrogen fertilizer use are estimated from county-level panel data and combined with the standard GHG accounting approach for international reporting of N 2 O emissions, as well as an alternative emission function suggested in the literature, to estimate the impact of the tax on emissions. The results suggest that annual direct N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils in Sweden would have been on average 160 tons higher without the tax. Results also indicate that higher N 2 O emissions from the removal of the N tax has the potential to fully offset the decreases in GHG emissions that can be expected from the future tax increase on CO 2 from agricultural diesel use. Paper III: On refunding of emission taxes and technology diffusion We analyze diffusion of an abatement technology under a standard emission tax compared to an emission tax which is refunded in proportion to output market share. The results indicate that refunding can speed up diffusion if firms do not strategically influence the size of the refund. If they do, it is ambiguous whether diffusion is slower or faster than under a non-refunded emission tax. Moreover, it is ambiguous whether refunding continues over time to provide larger incentives for technological upgrading than a non-refunded emission tax, since the effects of refunding dissipate as the overall industry becomes cleaner.

40|$|Abstracts. This thesis {{consists}} of five self-contained chapters: Chapter 1 :	Effects of driving restrictions on air quality and car use in Bogota Rationing car use {{at certain times}} of the day based on license plate numbers has become a popular policy to address traffic congestion and air pollution in several cities around the world. This paper analyzes the effects of moderate and drastic driving restrictions of the program Pico y Placa on air pollution and car use in Bogota. Because the program was implemented in phases, it was possible not only to study the impact of the program, but also to distinguish between the short- and long-run effects for each phase of restriction. Using hourly carbon monoxide data, monthly information on gasoline consumption, and vehicle registration and vehicle sales data, this paper shows differentiated effects of Pico y Placa on air quality and car use in the short- and long-run and between phases of the program. Although there was an initial improvement in air quality in both phases of the program, carbon monoxide concentrations, vehicle ownership, and total driving actually increased when drastic restrictions were implemented. Gasoline taxes, on the other hand, have tended to reduce gasoline usage in Bogota, suggesting that a price-based mechanism would be more effective in reducing driving. Chapter 2 :	Air pollution dynamics and the need for temporally differentiated road pricing Nowadays, road traffic is a major source of urban air pollution. In this paper we investigate the effects of the temporal variation of pollution dispersion, traffic flows and vehicular emissions on pollution concentration and illustrate the need for temporally differentiated road pricing through an application to the case of the congestion charge in Stockholm, Sweden. By accounting explicitly for the role of pollution dispersion on optimal road pricing, we allow for a more comprehensive view of the economy-ecology interactions at stake, showing that price differentiation is an optimal response to the physical environment. Most congestion charges in place incorporate price bans to mitigate congestion. Our analysis indicates that, to ensure compliance with air quality standards, such price variations should also be a response to limited pollution dispersion. Chapter 3 :	Synergies and trade-offs between climate and local air pollution policies in Sweden In this paper, we explore the synergies and tradeoffs between abatement of global and local pollution. We build a unique dataset of Swedish combined heat and power plants with detailed boiler-level data 2001 - 2009 on not only production and inputs but also on emissions of CO 2 and NOx. Both pollutants are regulated by strict policies in Sweden. CO 2 is subject to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and Swedish carbon taxes; NOx - as a precursor of acid rain and eutrophication - is regulated by a heavy fee. Using a quadratic directional output distance function, we characterize changes in technical efficiency as well as patterns of substitutability in response to the policies mentioned. Chapter 4 :	Diffusion of NOx abatement technologies in Sweden Though economists argue for the use of single instruments, we often observe the use of multiple instruments in actual regulations. These may include permit schemes, taxes, fees, subsidies and emission standards. In order to evaluate these combinations and to better understand their effects, we need more empirical analysis of how they interact. They might, for example, be either complements or substitutes; this might even vary between different types of instrument. As a case study we look at detailed data of NOx emissions from large combustion plants in Sweden. These are regulated both by a <b>refunded</b> <b>charge</b> {{and at the same time}} plant level emission standards. We study the adoption of abatement technologies under the combined effect of these charges and standards. The results indicate that the net charge has an effect and one that is complementary to the standards, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies. Chapter 5 :	Air quality combination forecasting with an application to Bogota The bulk of existing work on the statistical forecasting of air quality is based on either neural networks or linear regressions. The present paper shows how forecast combination can be used to produce more accurate results. This is accomplished using both Monte Carlo simulation and an extensive application to air quality in Bogota, one of the largest and most polluted cities in Latin America...|$|R

The policy, under which the <b>charge</b> revenues are <b>refunded</b> back to the regulated firms in proportion to energy output, was explicitly designed to affect investment in NOx reducing technologies. The results indicate that paying a higher net NOx charge increases the likelihood of adoption, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies. We also find some indication that market power considerations in the heat and power industry reduce the incentives to abate emissions through investment in post-combustion technologies. Adoption of post-combustion technologies and the efficiency improving technology of flue gas condensation is also more likely in the heat and power and waste incineration sectors, which is possibly explained by a large degree of public ownership in these sectors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This thesis {{consists}} of five self-contained chapters: Chapter 1 : Effects of driving restrictions on air quality and car use in Bogota Rationing car use {{at certain times}} of the day based on license plate numbers has become a popular policy to address traffic congestion and air pollution in several cities around the world. This paper analyzes the effects of moderate and drastic driving restrictions of the program Pico y Placa on air pollution and car use in Bogota. Because the program was implemented in phases, it was possible not only to study the impact of the program, but also to distinguish between the short- and long-run effects for each phase of restriction. Using hourly carbon monoxide data, monthly information on gasoline consumption, and vehicle registration and vehicle sales data, this paper shows differentiated effects of Pico y Placa on air quality and car use in the short- and long-run and between phases of the program. Although there was an initial improvement in air quality in both phases of the program, carbon monoxide concentrations, vehicle ownership, and total driving actually increased when drastic restrictions were implemented. Gasoline taxes, on the other hand, have tended to reduce gasoline usage in Bogota, suggesting that a price-based mechanism would be more effective in reducing driving. Chapter 2 : Air pollution dynamics and the need for temporally differentiated road pricing Nowadays, road traffic is a major source of urban air pollution. In this paper we investigate the effects of the temporal variation of pollution dispersion, traffic flows and vehicular emissions on pollution concentration and illustrate the need for temporally differentiated road pricing through an application to the case of the congestion charge in Stockholm, Sweden. By accounting explicitly for the role of pollution dispersion on optimal road pricing, we allow for a more comprehensive view of the economy-ecology interactions at stake, showing that price differentiation is an optimal response to the physical environment. Most congestion charges in place incorporate price bans to mitigate congestion. Our analysis indicates that, to ensure compliance with air quality standards, such price variations should also be a response to limited pollution dispersion. Chapter 3 : Synergies and trade-offs between climate and local air pollution policies in Sweden In this paper, we explore the synergies and tradeoffs between abatement of global and local pollution. We build a unique dataset of Swedish combined heat and power plants with detailed boiler-level data 2001 - 2009 on not only production and inputs but also on emissions of CO 2 and NOx. Both pollutants are regulated by strict policies in Sweden. CO 2 is subject to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and Swedish carbon taxes; NOx - as a precursor of acid rain and eutrophication - is regulated by a heavy fee. Using a quadratic directional output distance function, we characterize changes in technical efficiency as well as patterns of substitutability in response to the policies mentioned. Chapter 4 : Diffusion of NOx abatement technologies in Sweden Though economists argue for the use of single instruments, we often observe the use of multiple instruments in actual regulations. These may include permit schemes, taxes, fees, subsidies and emission standards. In order to evaluate these combinations and to better understand their effects, we need more empirical analysis of how they interact. They might, for example, be either complements or substitutes; this might even vary between different types of instrument. As a case study we look at detailed data of NOx emissions from large combustion plants in Sweden. These are regulated both by a <b>refunded</b> <b>charge</b> {{and at the same time}} plant level emission standards. We study the adoption of abatement technologies under the combined effect of these charges and standards. The results indicate that the net charge has an effect and one that is complementary to the standards, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies. Chapter 5 : Air quality combination forecasting with an application to Bogota The bulk of existing work on the statistical forecasting of air quality is based on either neural networks or linear regressions. The present paper shows how forecast combination can be used to produce more accurate results. This is accomplished using both Monte Carlo simulation and an extensive application to air quality in Bogota, one of the largest and most polluted cities in Latin America...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} expansion of refundable credits over the past twenty years. This trend is likely to continue as part of federal policy to stimulate the economy and promote non-tax related social benefits. With the growing use of the tax system to deliver refundable benefits to individuals, the tax preparation industry as a whole has become, in some significant respects, a vehicle for cross-marketing of non-tax goods and services. Refund anticipation loans, or RALs, are one example of these non-tax products that paid preparers facilitate for their customers. RALS are short-term loans secured by a taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s anticipated tax refund amount. A taxpayer will borrow against the anticipated refund, and will be required to repay the loan regardless {{of the size of the}} actual refund amount. The RAL lender issues the taxpayer the amount of the anticipated refund less any preparation fees, as well as any filing, finance, and processing <b>charges.</b> The IRS <b>refund</b> is then transferred directly to the lender to pay back the loan. RAL customers receive their money between two and six weeks faster than waiting for their refund check. RALs have created a substantial market, with about 900 million in loan-related RAL fees being generated annually. The creation of RALs has opened up a major market niche, with their popularity largely coming with the advent of the IRS 2 ̆ 7 s e-filing program, and their use often associated with the receipt of earned income tax credit (EITC) -generated refunds. Over time, RAL providers have come under fire from consumer advocates, elected officials, and IRS officials. The criticisms of RALs have come from two general starting points: 1) a social policy standpoint that draws heavily from general consumer protection concerns, including that RALs compromise taxpayer privacy and unfairly drain away precious tax benefits through fees that are high when computed on an annual percentage basis, and 2) a more targeted tax compliance perspective examining the role that RALS play in contributing to the underreporting aspect of the tax gap. While noting that consumer privacy and general consumer protection concerns are independent bases for further regulation, this essay focuses on the debate over RALs 2 ̆ 7 effect on tax compliance, and its contribution to the tax gap. While RALs are regulated to a limited extent by the IRS and Treasury, the IRS and the National Taxpayer Advocate have raised concerns about whether RALS create incentives for less compliant behavior among preparers who facilitate access to RAL lenders. In 2008 the IRS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), seeking comments to determine to what degree RALs and other similar products should be further regulated. The rule on which the IRS and Treasury were seeking guidance would prohibit the use of information obtained during the tax preparation process for the purpose of marketing any product. This new rule would, at a minimum, inject additional costs for preparers and consumers and likely limit their use in some way. The question that the IRS raised in its ANPR focused on whether RALs contribute to increased demand for overstated tax refunds. This question itself raises many unanswered questions. For example, does the additional speed in which individuals receive money embolden inappropriate taxpayer conduct? If the answer is yes, assuming practitioners can influence taxpayer compliance decisions, will increased regulation of preparers generally or RALs in particular result in fewer taxpayers willing to misstate facts to generate an improper refund? Do additional profits derived from RALs contribute to preparers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to turn a blind eye to existing due diligence rules? Or even worse, do RALs contribute to conditions where preparers themselves are facilitating the noncompliance through more preparer-generated noncompliance efforts? These questions highlight the lack of information that hampers policymakers in designing effective measures to reduce the tax gap. Until the IRS generates quantitative data that identifies, for example, preparer types and correlates error rates with types of preparers, and generates studies comparing error rates among preparers offering RALs as compared with non RAL-seeking taxpayers, it is difficult to justify taking measures that may effectively limit RALs on compliance reasons alone. This essay argues that in addition to the importance of additional research relating to preparers to backstop heavy-handed regulatory efforts, the IRS should broadly consider the insights from responsive regulation, and in particular consider ways to encourage preparers to self-regulate. Self-regulation allows the IRS to preserve scarce compliance resources for egregious actors. The focus on RALs in this essay allows for a further inquiry into the special role that preparers play in our tax system, and reflects the possibility that meaningfully working with the preparer community can be a means to reducing the tax gap in the thorny area of refundable credits...|$|R
