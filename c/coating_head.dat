40|$|The {{active layer}} {{crystallization}} during roll-to-roll coating of organic solar cells is studied in situ. We developed an X-ray setup where the coater unit is an integrated {{part of the}} small angle X-ray scattering instrument, {{making it possible to}} control the coating process while recording scattering measurements in situ, enabling us to follow the crystal formation during drying. By varying the distance between the <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> and the point where the X-ray beam hits the film, we obtained measurements of 4 different stages of drying. For each of those stages, the scattering from as long a foil as possible is summed together, with the distance from <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> to scattering point kept constant. The results are average crystallographic properties for the active layer coated on a 30 m long foil. With this insight into the dynamics of crystallization in a roll-coated polymer film, we find that the formation of textured and untextured crystallites seems uncorrelated, and happens at widely different rates. Untextured P 3 HT crystallites form later in the drying process than expected which may explain previous studies speculating that untextured crystallization depends on concentration. Textured crystallites, however, begin forming much earlier and steadily increases as the film dries, showing a development similar to other in situ studies of these materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Making {{quality control}} in the design stage can greatly improve product’s {{robustness}} and save costs. The whole system function variance model and the sensitivity index model are established combined with axiomatic design and then making comparative evaluation to them combined with information axiom. A fundamental model of describing relationships among function and structural characteristics, design parameters and uncontrollable factors in non-linear systems which based on Taylor expansion is proposed. And then the relation between robust design, information axiom {{and the concept of}} information is expounded. The solution to information amounts can be used as the evaluation index to the result of robust design. Finally, combined with <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> example show that the method can optimize design parameters reasonably, reduce design time and cost effectively under the premise of meeting product performance...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} atmospheric-pressure chemical vapour deposited fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) thin films as front electrodes for the fabrication of mesoporous perovskite solar cells with an active area of 1 cm 2 and compare them {{with the use of}} a commonly used commercial transparent conducting oxide. The effects of sheet resistance (Rs) and surface roughness are both closely linked to the film thickness. In order to separate out these effects the characteristics of the deposited FTOs were carefully controlled by changing the fluorine doping levels and the number of passes under the <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> to give films of specific thicknesses or Rs. Under AM 1. 5 Sun illumination and maximum power point tracking, the optimised FTOs yielded a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 17. 8...|$|E

40|$|MOCVD {{has been}} {{associated}} with batch processing of III–V opto-electronic devices for decades, with epitaxial structures deposited on up to 200 mm diameter wafers. Recent development in thin film PV has seen the gap in conversion efficiencies closing in on that of the commonly found multicrystalline Si wafer based PV. To further improve the conversion efficiency of thin film PV towards the theoretical limits of single junction solar cells requires a technique such as MOCVD with scalability potential. Preliminary results on the development of a chamberless inline process are reported for up to 15 cm wide float glass, progressively coating each layer in the CdTe solar cell as the heated substrate passes under each <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> in turn and entirely at atmospheric pressure. Emphasis is made on ensuring that the chamberless coating heads can be operated safely using a combination of nitrogen curtain flows and a balanced exhaust pressure system. Results are also presented on the exclusion of oxygen and moisture from the coating area, achieved using the same gas flow isolation process. This paper also reviews the achievements made to-date in the transfer of the high efficiency batch MOCVD produced CdTe solar cell to the chamberless inline process demonstrating device quality thin films deposition...|$|E
40|$|Coating {{devices for}} {{application}} of coating {{material to the}} surface of a web or a flexible substrate utilizing the study of flow patterns in blade coating to develop high-speed coaters, wherein the coater may be modified to provide an air layer between the coating liquid and any lower boundary. The coater devices of the described embodiments provide two inlet channels and an outlet channel. The first inlet channel carries the coating liquid, and the second channel can be used to pump the carrier fluid, e. g. air, into the <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> to pressurize the chamber and to keep the contact wetting line at the upstream section attached to the substrate. The air layer serves as a carrier fluid removing the wall shear stress on the coating liquid in the channel, and thus the coating flow for the operation of the device may proceed without flow separation from the wall (i. e., in a vortex-free mode) at relatively low flow rates appropriate for commercial applications. The excess coating liquid and all of the air leave the coater head at the outlet channel. A coating composition application chamber receives the liquid flow of the liquid coating composition from the upstream direction to the downstream direction. The coating composition application chamber is adapted for receiving a liquid flow of a carrier fluid introduced at the upstream side of the application chamber {{in the direction of the}} travel of the web positioning the liquid flow of the liquid coating composition between the carrier fluid and the web.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{preservation of}} paper with the same qualities of brightness and color {{is one of the}} important requirements for certain paper products. A major problem limiting the wider use of mechanical pulp is the sensitivity of lignin-containing pulps to yellowing induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. One of the yellowing inhibitor systems contains an Ultra Violet Absorber (UVA) and a Radical Scavenger (RS). The application of this inhibitor system to paper made of mechanical pulps requires the addition of two components, UVA and RS. To Properly understand the use of a paper yellowing inhibition system; it is important to reveal the effect of adding the inhibitors on the global properties of the resulting coating mixture. We need to optimize the input factors to achieve the longest in time inhibition effect. It is essential to study the rheological properties of the resulting system and the effects provoked by each of the ingredients. Studying the microstructure of the materials sheds more light on the interaction of the additional components with the original formulation. The coating formulation and the inhibition ingredients undergo mixing and transport processes. A study of the effect of pre-shear adds {{to the understanding of the}} system. Numerical simulation of 3 D hydrodynamics with non-Newtonian rheology in the vicinity of the <b>coating</b> <b>head</b> creates a powerful tool for investigation of the coating system under these conditions. Among the operating parameters, the total concentration of inhibitors or total charge proved to have the largest effect of brightness stability or longer in time yellowing inhibition. The rheology of RS is Newtonian. The Ultra-violet absorber (tin 1130) is an extremely viscous shear-thinning thixotropic material. Water-retention studies show that inhibitors increase water loss, with more water penetrating the paper web. Zeta potential measurements revealed the repulsive forces between pigment and inhibitor particles. RS adsorbs on ground calcium carbonate GCC and disrupts interactions between kaolinite particles. UVA adsorbs on particles of kaolinite and GCC. The inhibitors increase the viscosity, thixotropy, and elasticity of the original coating formulation. A study of pre-shear reveals decrease in viscosity, while inhibitors concentration under pre-shear increases viscosity and elasticity. Transmission Electron Microscopy shows the microstructure of increasing agglomerations with added inhibitors. Numerical 3 D simulation of the flow in the coating nip taking inertia forces into consideration depicts vortex formations on the surface of the coater's rolls...|$|E
