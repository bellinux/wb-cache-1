5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{traditionally}} {{had been}} subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal. As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{had shown that}} he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. These early assertions of independence <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.|$|E
5|$|Souls {{provide a}} variety of effects, and are {{separated}} into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. Bullet souls are Soma Cruz's replacement for Sub Weapons in this game, and enable the player to consume a set amount of magic points to use an ability, often some form of projectile. Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Enchant souls are continuously active so long as they are equipped, and provide increases in statistics or other innate abilities—such as the ability to walk on water. Ability souls give the player innate abilities, which are often required to traverse certain areas of the castle. Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them, they do not consume magic points.|$|E

5|$|The player {{collects}} {{money by}} exploring Rapture {{and from the}} bodies of defeated foes; this money can be used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards {{in the form of}} ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new plasmids from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture. In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> a limited number of plasmids and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.|$|E

At most, it <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> been six years since they last worked together. Of course, chronologies are difficult to construct, especially with Poirot's career.|$|E
25|$|Hero - The {{character}} which a given {{player is}} playing as. Each hero has {{an amount of}} starting health, faction affiliation, race, class, specializations, and professions. The hero's traits determine what other cards can {{be included in the}} deck (e.g., Horde heroes <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> Horde allies). Lastly, each hero has a unique power which can be used once per game, after which the hero card is turned face down. Starting with Worldbreaker, Hero cards no longer have professions.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} 15 {{years of his}} career, Burley was very heavily {{involved}} {{in the affairs of}} the Arundel dynasty, its affinity within Shropshire and its work on behalf of the House of Lancaster. His commitment to the FitzAlan earls <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> become more complete with the death of Stafford, another major client, at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. However, it never induced him to give up his work for other clients. Burley seems to have been trusted from the outset by new Lancastrian régime as politically and ideologically reliable, and he began to reap the rewards of loyalty.|$|E

25|$|Good {{structural}} design {{is important in}} most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: {{the only way to}} assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure is to learn from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can be absolutely sure that a given structure will resist all loadings that could cause failure, but <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{word order}} of a Hurrian {{sentence}} is SOV. Within noun phrases, the noun regularly comes at the end. Adjectives, numbers, and genitive modifiers come before the noun they modify. Relative clauses, however, tend to surround the noun, {{which means that the}} noun the relative clause modifies {{stands in the middle of}} the relative clause. Hurrian has at its disposal several paradigms for constructing relative clauses. It can either use the relative pronouns iya and iye, which has already been described under 'pronouns' above, or the nominalising suffix -šše attached to a verb, which undergoes Suffixaufnahme. The third possibility is for both these markers to occur (see example 16 below). The noun, which is represented by the relative clause, can take any case, but within the relative clause <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> the function of the absolutive, i.e. it can only be the subject of an intransitive relative clause or the object of a transitive one.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of whether}} planets with similar {{physical}} attributes to the Earth are rare or not, {{some argue that}} life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist Nick Lane argues that simple cells (prokaryotes) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones (eukaryotes) all of whom share a common ancestor, this event <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> happened once. In some views, prokaryotes lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have {{tens of thousands of}} times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into mitochondria that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple. An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appear very soon after first traces of oxygen appear in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free, allowing {{players to}} use cartridges or downloaded content from {{any part of}} the world, though Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed. Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, they have access to download all previous purchases; however, a user <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device. The Switch does not support optical discs and is not backwards compatible with the 3DS and Wii U game media. The Switch is not backwards compatible with other digital titles from previous consoles. The console also did not launch with the Virtual Console, which provided digital versions of physically released games from past Nintendo consoles, but the company said this feature may be added later. Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles, but currently does not support controllers or controller emulation for these titles.|$|E
25|$|The others leave but {{a moment}} later Poirot suffers a small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor his opinion of the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that he knows who the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer wanted to be on the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> been to have hidden something from sight at the moment that the room was broken into. As the Dictaphone is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only be someone who had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E
