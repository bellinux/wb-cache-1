5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E

Hawking's calculation fixed the <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E
25|$|In {{the view}} of Jaynes (1957), {{thermodynamic}} entropy, as explained by statistical mechanics, {{should be seen as}} an application of Shannon's information theory: the thermodynamic entropy is interpreted as being proportional to the amount of further Shannon information needed to define the detailed microscopic state of the system, that remains uncommunicated by a description solely in terms of the macroscopic variables of classical thermodynamics, with the <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> being just the Boltzmann constant. For example, adding heat to a system increases its thermodynamic entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with the measurable values of its macroscopic variables, thus making any complete state description longer. (See article: maximum entropy thermodynamics). Maxwell's demon can (hypothetically) reduce the thermodynamic entropy of a system by using information about the states of individual molecules; but, as Landauer (from 1961) and co-workers have shown, to function the demon himself must increase thermodynamic entropy in the process, by at least the amount of Shannon information he proposes to first acquire and store; and so the total thermodynamic entropy does not decrease (which resolves the paradox). Landauer's principle imposes a lower bound on the amount of heat a computer must generate to process a given amount of information, though modern computers are far less efficient.|$|E
25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{cellular}} foams as a core material in light-weight optical and structural systems is of considerable interest. Research {{and development of}} these systems, however, have been hampered {{by the lack of}} material property data and uncertainty in the use of various suggested material characterizations and the associated <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality.</b> ASTM standards were researched and, for the most part, found inadequate for testing cellular foam materials. The compression, tension and shear test methods developed are presented, as well as the results from physical tests on closed-cell SXATM foam specimens.

Twenty-one (21) finite element models were built and seventy (70) analyses were performed to study the effects of cell geometry. Based on the FEA results, material characterizations are presented for the cubic array and the tetrakaidecahedron geometry. The FEA results are compared with the characterizations proposed by Gibson and Ashby and the test results.

30|$|In {{terms of}} communication, for data {{aggregation}} to complete, {{we note that}} each node has to at least transmit its own data once. Thus, O(N) is an absolute lower bound in terms of communication messages for data aggregation. We have thus shown that EZ-AG achieves this lower bound of O(N) for data aggregation and therefore is indeed quite efficient in terms of communication. Moreover, we also show that the random walk phase terminates in exactly N token passes. Also during each transfer of the token, the number of requests for the token remain fairly constant and low (See Fig.  12).

40|$|In August 2003, 14, 800 heat-related deaths {{occurred}} in Paris [1] during {{what is considered}} the warmest summer since at least 1500 [2], [3], [4] and [5]. These deaths resulted not only from unusually high peak temperatures {{and a reduction in}} the diurnal temperature swing, but also from a failure of buildings to successfully modify the external environment. It has been estimated [6] that by the 2040 s, a 2003 -type summer is predicted to be average within Europe. Clearly this will have a great impact on morbidity and mortality and produce challenges for emergency services [7]. The effects of climate change on the internal environment are not well known and are the subject of much current research [8]. For building scientists and emergency planners, there is the need to know the general form of the relationship between increases in external temperature due to climate change and increases in internal temperatures. Here we show that the relationship is linear, and that differing architectures give rise to differing <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality.</b> This is a surprising result as it had been assumed that, given the complexity of the heat flows within large structures, no simple relationship would exist and had not been found in previous work [9]. We term these <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> climate change amplification coefficients. These coefficients fully describe the change in the internal environment of an architecture given a seasonal or annual change in external climate and can be used to judge the resilience to climate change of a particular structure.
