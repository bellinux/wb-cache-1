40|$|Abstract — A concept called “software-defined networking” (SDN) {{is applied}} to <b>carrier</b> <b>networks</b> as one way to add {{flexibility}} to those networks. To apply SDN to <b>carrier</b> <b>networks,</b> a resource-pooling mechanism in MPLS-TP networks is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed resource-pooling mechanism applied to Multi-Protocol Label Switching – Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks was evaluated in terms of service agility. Moreover, a controller, which utilizes this mechanism to allocate a pooled resource to IP traffic, is prototyped and evaluated. The time required for the controller to allocate pooled resources in MPLS-TP networks to IP traffic is sufficiently short. This result indicates that the proposed mechanism will help to flexibly change <b>carrier</b> <b>networks</b> and reduce manual configurations spanning multiple layers. Consequently, the proposed mechanism will help assure service agility. Keywords-Cloud computing; SDN; MPLS-TP; service agility; I...|$|R

50|$|In PBB and PBT {{switches}} at {{the edge}} of the <b>carrier</b> <b>network</b> encapsulate customer traffic within an 802.1ah frame. The <b>carrier</b> <b>network</b> core is only responsible for transporting frames from an edge device to another, alleviating Q-in-Q’s issue of forwarding table scalability. The same feature - assigning a MAC address per edge device, not per service - creates a scalability issue for multipoint services. Multipoint services require full mesh connectivity between edge devices, a very inefficient method as all frames are duplicated at the root nodes, rather than at the optimal point as in VLAN connectivity. Moreover, the need to create forwarding entries for each unicast connection within the full mesh (as opposed to a single VLAN forwarding tree in the case of VLAN connectivity) will quickly become unsustainable as multipoint services become predominant in the near future.|$|E
