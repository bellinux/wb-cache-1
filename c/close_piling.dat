40|$|A {{series of}} twenty-eight {{centrifuge}} tests {{was performed on}} piled embankments with basal geosynthetic reinforcement to assess the influence of pile spacing, embankment height, pile cap size and geosynthetic stiffness on the load transfer mechanism and surface settlements. The measurements of the forces on the piles {{made it possible to}} assess the load transfer mechanisms, and 100 % efficiency was achieved for all tests performed. The results showed that for the thicker mattress and/or <b>closer</b> <b>piles,</b> the surface settlements were smaller or negligible. Geosynthetic maximum deflections were also examined experimentally and analytically, the latter based on BS 8006 (2010) and its further corrigendum in 2012. Close agreement in the predictions of the maximum reinforcement deflection was reached with BS 8006 (2012) by adopting a slight modification in the ratio of diagonal and orthogonal maximum deflection (yd/ y ¼ 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Soft soil {{improvement}} techniques using {{a network of}} rigid inclusions and geosynthetic reinforcement are investigated to improve our understanding of load transfer mechanisms towards piles. The physical modelling of the system consists in simulating fictional soft soil settlement through downward displacement of a perforated tray above a network of rigid piles placed in the centrifuge swinging basket. Tests are used to validate {{the results of the}} numerical study. Elasto-plastic and hypoplastic constitutive models have been used to predict the behaviour of the granular mattress, which simulates a Load Platform Transfer (LPT). A two-dimensional, axisymmetrical model has been adopted, which fulfils the validation on the experimental test and the time needed for calculation. The results of the parametric studies show that load transfer increases with mattress thickness and <b>closer</b> <b>pile</b> spacing. Geosynthetic deflection is reduced when load transfer is high...|$|R

40|$|The soil {{reinforcement}} method, {{which consists}} of placing a granular mattress above a set of rigid inclusions, is used to transfer part of the surface load to the piles through arching. The addition of an extensible geosynthetic layer {{at the base of}} the mattress increases load transfer. A small-scale centrifuge model, the mobile tray device, is used to simulate the foundation behaviour by modelling soft soil settlement between the inclusions. A parametric study was conducted to examine the influence of the mattress thickness and of the pile spacing. The different test configurations are compared with regard to the stress transmitted to soft soil, to differential settlement and to the efficiency of load transfer. With thicker mattresses and/or <b>closer</b> <b>pile</b> meshing, load transfer increases and surface settlements are reduced. Geosynthetic maximum experimental and analytical deflections are also examined. For the analytical study, conducted using the EBGEO German standard, three different distributions of the vertical stress applied to the geosynthetic layer are compared: uniform, triangular and inverse triangular. All three scenario results fall within the range of the experimental results. The inverse triangular distribution reveals some deflection values that were lower than the uniform one. The triangular distribution gives the highest deflection values...|$|R

40|$|Fodder beets (Beta vulgaris L.) are {{especially}} respected for their high feeding value and high netto-energy yield per hectare. The price per nutritive value is lowest {{as compared to}} other forages. Preservation of fodders beets demands thorough cleaning without damaging and regularly occurs as a whole in well <b>closed</b> <b>piles.</b> In addition, feeding them to the animals is labour demanding. These disadvantages enforce the research towards other preservation methods which {{may be able to}} valorise this valuable type of roughage. The preservation of fodder beets in silages using silo bags, either separately or in combination with maize was investigated. Fodder beets were harvested and ensilaged at the ideal moment of maize harvest (October) or fodder beets were harvested at the ideal moment for fodder beet harvest (November) and consequently ensilaged with previously ensilaged maize. Highest energy yields of the silages were recorded at optimal harvest time for fodder beets. Ensilaging fodder beets separately resulted in large energy losses due to effluent and dry matter losses. Using lab scale silage, possible solutions for these large losses were investigated. Addition of 10 % maize did reduce the effluent losses but dry matter losses remained at a high level. Addition of 4, 5 l propionic acid per ton beets reduced effluent and dry matter losses sufficiently. Ensilaging foliage was another point of interest. This appeared to result in a lowered energy yield at organic and dry matter basis, an increased amount of ashes and doubling of the iron (Fe) concentration. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A 5. 15 m {{diameter}} {{water diversion}} tunnel was driven into Bangkok stiff clay using an earth pressure balance shield. The tunnel was driven within a clear distance of 2 m from the <b>closest</b> <b>pile</b> of a 3 x 4 pile group supporting an expressway. During construction, tunnel driving parameters {{as well as}} induced ground and pile group responses were recorded. To avoid cutting the piles supporting the expressway, the alignment of the tunnel was adjusted and curved. As {{a result of this}} change in tunnel alignment, the tunnel advancing rate was reduced from an average 17 m/day for a straight drive to an average of only 6 m/day for the curved alignment, and the ratio between the tunnel face pressure and overburden pressure was changed from 0. 5 to 0. 4, accordingly. Due to the reduction of the tunnel face pressure, up to a 280 % larger inward ground movement towards the tunnel was observed. As the shield penetration rate decreased, the torque required for tunnel driving was reduced by 33 %, while the ratio between shield penetration rate and soil extraction was almost constant throughout the tunnel route. A transverse influence zone due to tunnel driving was identified to extend up to a distance that was twice the tunnel diameter radially from the longitudinal tunnel axis. The maximum tilting of the expressway pier and deduced differential settlement of the pile located within the influence zone were up to 1 : 2600 and 2. 0 mm, respectively. Tilting of all the piers was mainly caused by long-term subsurface settlement having the tilting direction towards the tunnel.

The design and development of the simple shear apparatus was based on a new simple shear stress equation. Series of constant normal stresses, constant normal stiffness and constant volume tests were conducted on samples of Berea Sands compacted to low density in the new apparatus, supported by moisture induced collapse settlement and matric suction tests. The tests revealed significant volume contraction of Berea Sands due to imposed simple shear strain. The tests data were fed into a new Winkler - type load transfer model and were used to determine the load - transfer curves of vertically loaded piles. The curves revealed that both the loadsettlement behavior and pile capacity in low density sands are dependent on the volume contraction of the soil in the plastic zone <b>close</b> to the <b>pile</b> surface, horizontal stress normal to the pile shaft and stiffness of the soil outside the plastic zone...|$|R
