40|$|Application {{of energy}} {{efficient}} compressors, {{air handling units}} (AHUs), condensers and evaporators of high effectiveness are the some of the measures towards energy conservation in refrigeration systems. Cooling of <b>compressor</b> <b>shell</b> with the defrost drips is an energy saving measure which is explored in this paper. In tropical countries which have 70 – 80 % RH year round, the quantity of defrost formation is significant while refrigeration systems are on. This defrost water is dripped on the compressor's shell, which in turn cools the compressor oil and hence reduces the friction losses and winding temperature of the motor. Once winding temperature is reduced the compressor's ampere rating is reduced which ultimately reduces the energy consumption of the compressor. For given conditions of refrigerator function, the <b>compressor</b> <b>shell</b> temperature and ampere rating of compressor are tabulated and investigated before and after <b>compressor</b> <b>shell</b> cooling. The investigation reveals that around 8 – 10 % energy savings are achieved for the given conditions...|$|E
40|$|In a {{hermetic}} {{reciprocating compressor}} the suction pressure pulsations affect compressor performance and noise. The pressure pulsations are created {{due to the}} dynamic flow of refrigerant through the suction valve into the cylinder bore. One dimensional (1 D) acoustic method, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are three commonly used methods to calculate these pressure pulsations. With CFD being used most often to solve this type of analysis; however CFD is often time consuming and requires significant computer resources. In order to solve the pressure pulsation analyses faster, the suction plenum geometry is often simplified by reducing the model size. This simplification could lead to inaccuracies in pressure pulsation modeling. This paper will use the FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method to analyze a hermetic HVAC reciprocating compressor to show that geometry simplifications could result in poor predictions of pressure pulsation. The FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method was chosen due to its short solution time and the inherent ability to compare similarities and differences in the plenum’s impedances between the full model which includes volume inside the <b>compressor</b> <b>shell,</b> and a simplified model. This paper will specifically look at {{the influence of the}} <b>compressor</b> <b>shell</b> volume on simulating suction pressure pulsations. In the compressor analyzed, the <b>compressor</b> <b>shell</b> volume influences the pressure pulsation at the first compressor speed harmonic. A pressure pulsation at the first harmonic has the greatest influence on the compressor performance. This paper will compare measured pressure pulsations to simulated pressure pulsations. The pressure pulsations are in good agreement when the full model is analyzed but when simplifications are done to the model it fails to provide good agreement...|$|E
40|$|The {{tonal noise}} or {{vibration}} of air-cooled or water-cooled chillers with rotary twin screw compressors {{is crucial for}} environmental concerns. This work aims to perform the receiver tests regarding the radiated noise and structural vibration due to the compressor in different operating conditions. The sound pressure near the compressor is recorded by the one-third octave and narrow band frequency analyzers, respectively. For environmental concern, the one-third octave band spectrum is frequently adopted to evaluate the radiated noise, while the narrow band spectrum {{can be used to}} characterize the noise sources.

To do so, the two-stage compressed air cycle with intercooler of Fajr Petrochemical Company was considered. This cycle includes two centrifugal <b>compressors,</b> a <b>shell,</b> and a tube intercooler.

40|$|International audienceThe current {{evaluation}} of {{heating and cooling}} system performances {{has become a major}} issue in European buildings sector. A promising method for measuring heat pump performances on-field has been previously developed and published. However, the accuracy of the method is strongly dependent on the {{evaluation of}} heat transfer from compressor towards the ambient air. In this paper a developed compressor heat transfer model that couples integral and differential formulations is presented.

40|$|TutorialAlthough wet (oil injected) and dry (oil free) screw {{compressors}} {{are widely used}} in many applications, limited information is available regarding the pulsation, vibration, and noise problems associated with these types of compressors. This tutorial discusses such problems and includes case histories where field testing was performed, and provides design recommendations. Both wet and dry {{screw compressors}} normally generate pulsation at the pocket passing frequency (PPF) and its multiples. The pulsation amplitudes are affected by many variables such as mole weight of the gas, operating pressures, speed, screw profile, {{and shape of the}} discharge port. The pulsation amplitudes are further amplified by acoustical natural frequencies of the compressor/silencer/piping system. Dry screw compressors are generally supplied with suction and discharge silencers which are designed to attenuate the pulsation generated by the compressors. Most of the silencers are reactive type (Helmholtz filters), absorptive type, or a combination of these two. Although the silencers are designed to attenuate pulsation at certain frequencies, they can also amplify pulsation when the excitation frequencies are coincident with the acoustical natural frequencies of the silencer itself. Pulsation in the silencers can also increase the vibration levels of the compressor rotors and can cause electrical problems to be fed into the local bus. Therefore, the silencers should be carefully designed to attenuate the pulsation levels over a wide frequency band. Wet screw compressors typically do not have silencers, since oil separators are used. The oil separators are primarily designed to remove the oil from the gas, but the separators can also attenuate and/or amplify the pulsation generated by the <b>compressor.</b> The <b>shell</b> wall mechanical natural frequencies can also be excited by pulsation at multiples of the PPF, which can result in excessive noise levels and fatigue failures of the shell wall, attached small bore piping, instrumentation, and the oil injection lines...|$|R

Elements from the space industry include the implementation of Onshore Support Centre (OSC), prepositioning of spares and tools and standard procedures for critical equipment. A simplified oil and gas production system {{has been used as a}} basis for a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), identifying critical components that should be considered for Condition Monitoring (CM). The results of the FMECA were that centrifugal <b>compressors</b> and <b>shell</b> and tube heat exchangers were ranked as critical equipment. Gate valves were also ranked as critical but have been neglected in the further analysis due to heat exchangers and compressors being more critical. Several different CM methods have been described, emphasis have been put on detection method, application and words of warning when implementing the method. CM methods relevant to the critical equipment have also been discussed. For compressors the most relevant CM methods includes Vibration monitoring, Power and Load monitoring. In addition to these general methods special software applications are also available through different distributors. For monitoring heat exchangers internal inspection is most commonly used. The inspection interval can be determined by a Risk Based Inspection (RBI) scheme. When an inspection is due Eddy Current Testing (ECT) or gas leak tests can be used to determine diminishing pipe thickness in the tube section of the heat exchanger.

40|$|Frost {{formation}} on {{the cold}} evaporator surface is a typical problem in household refrigerators. It happens due to humidity present in the ambient air associated with frequent door openings. In addition, mass transfer from stored goods to dry internal cabinet air and moisture infiltration through door gaskets also contribute to frost formation on the evaporator surface. To prevent this, the evaporator has to be defrosted manually or automatically (as in modern refrigerators). To do so, an electrical heater is switched on at a preset time and frequency and defrosts the evaporator. During this time, defrosted water is drained through a pipe into a water tray which is usually placed at {{the vicinity of the}} compressor. There the water evaporates mainly due to heat transfer from hot <b>compressor</b> <b>shell.</b> This system of defrosting and evaporation works well in areas with low relative humidity, where the amount of defrosted water is small and the evaporation rate is higher when compared to places with high relative humidity. Moreover, the <b>compressor</b> <b>shell</b> temperatures of high efficient compressors are not usually high enough to provide the minimum evaporation rate to balance the defrosted water flow rate and thus avoid water overflow.

40|$|A part of {{lubrication}} oil stored in an oil sump of a refrigeration compressor becomes fine oil mist in a <b>compressor</b> <b>shell.</b> Although {{some of the}} oil mist is separated from refrigerant in the <b>compressor</b> <b>shell,</b> {{a certain amount of}} the oil mist is discharged with refrigerant into a refrigeration cycle. The oil circulated with refrigerant in the cycle degrades the heat transfer efficiency of heat exchangers, increases pressure drop in lines and the heat exchangers and sometimes reduces reliability of the compressor when an oil return from the cycle to the compressor is insufficient. It is therefore important to reduce the oil discharge from the compressor to the cycle. In order to decrease the oil amount discharged from the compressor, development of a superior oil separator should be done and many researches were focused on it. More basically, since the separation efficiency of the oil separator strongly depends on droplet size of the oil mist, factors associated with the droplet size such as generation mechanism of the oil mist in the compressor, the droplet behavior on solid surface in the compressor and surface tension of the oil in which the refrigerant is dissolved should be clarified. However, the surface tension of the oil mixed with refrigerant and wettability of solid surface with the oil/refrigerant mixture which influences the droplet behavior have not been reported sufficiently. In this study, the surface tension of the PAG oil/CO 2 mixture is measured by a pendant drop method and the wettability of the solid surface is evaluated as the fundamental study for discussing the generation mechanism of the oil mist in the compressor. The measurements of the surface tension of the oil/refrigerant mixture and contact angle of the mixture on the solid surface are achieved under high pressure and temperature condition. It is found that the surface tension of oil/refrigerant mixture decreases steeply with increasing the refrigerant concentration in the oil. The contact angle on solid surface decreases with the refrigerant concentration due to the reduction of surface tension. The contact angle on Aluminum surface is smaller than that on the PTFE surface and decreases with elapsed time. With using Ohnesorge number which is a ratio of viscous force to inertia force and surface tension force to evaluate the oil droplet behavior on the metal surface, Ohnesorge number is estimated to be very small under discharge condition in the compressor and it suggest that the oil droplet of oil/refrigerant mixture will spread immediately on the metal surface...|$|E
