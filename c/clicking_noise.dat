25|$|In the {{original}} Morse telegraphs, the receiver's armature made a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> {{as it moved}} {{in and out of}} position to mark the paper tape. The telegraph operators soon learned that they could translate the clicks directly into dots and dashes, and write these down by hand, thus making the paper tape unnecessary. When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses. It was later found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught as a language that is heard, instead of one read from a page.|$|E
2500|$|Aragog was an Acromantula, an enormous, sentient spider {{capable of}} speech, {{who made a}} unique <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> as he moved in search of prey. Hagrid raised Aragog from an egg as a Hogwarts student, keeping him inside a cupboard. In his third year at Hogwarts, Hagrid was caught talking to Aragog in the dungeons by Tom Riddle, who alleged that Aragog was the [...] "Monster of Slytherin," [...] and that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, it was Riddle who had opened the Chamber, and the monster was {{actually}} a basilisk.|$|E

40|$|An FM <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> {{suppressor}} {{was evaluated}} {{by means of}} several experimental tests conducted to verify previous test results. The range and worst case type of operation for the suppressor were also determined. A brief theoretical justification {{for the existence of}} FM <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> near threshold conditions is presented. It is concluded that the circuit does perform click suppression, but over a limited range. Suggestions for improvement of the circuit are given...|$|R

2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E

50|$|In clicker training, {{a parrot}} is taught to {{associate}} a click with receiving a reward {{and is a}} particularly popular form of positive reinforcement training.

50|$|Unlike bats, the swiftlets make <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> for {{echolocation}} {{that are}} well within the human range of hearing. Two broadband pulses are separated by a slight pause. The length of the pause shortens as light becomes poorer. The clicks are followed by the twittering call when the bird is approaching its nest.|$|R
60|$|According {{to three}} other observers, the Australians often evince astonishment by a clucking noise. Europeans also {{sometimes}} express gentle surprise {{by a little}} <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> of nearly the same kind. We have seen that when we are startled, the mouth is suddenly opened; and if the tongue happens to be then pressed closely against the palate, its sudden withdrawal will produce a sound of this kind, which might thus come to express surprise.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile {{the three}} hundred deer, {{in the midst}} of which they had been {{standing}} all this time, kept moving about the enclosure, emitting a peculiar grunting sound, and making a strange <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> with their ankle-joints. This is a well-known peculiarity of the reindeer. Every time they lift or set down their feet, the ankle-joints crack as do the knuckles of a man when he pulls his fingers. As these deer were constantly getting up and lying down, the twittering rattle of their ankle-joints was unceasing.|$|E

50|$|He {{taught himself}} {{echolocation}} {{at the age}} of five. He was able to detect the location of objects by making frequent <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> with his tongue. This case was explained in 20/20: Medical Mysteries. He used it to accomplish such feats as running, playing basketball, riding a bicycle, rollerblading, playing football, and skateboarding.

50|$|Holding {{the fingers}} and hand {{perpendicular}} to the strings may cause other difficulties. Since the string is aligned with the groove between fingertip and nail: this may cause <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> or double sounds (fingertip sound, then nail sound). By holding the fingers and hand to the left, {{it is impossible for}} the string to land in the groove, since {{the left side of the}} nail will touch the string first.|$|R
60|$|One {{says that}} Mr. Carmyle was annoyed. The word is weak. The {{interruption}} coming {{at such a}} moment jarred every ganglion in his body. The <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> of the drumsticks maddened him. And the gleaming whiteness of Mr. Williams' friendly and benignant smile was the last straw. His dignity writhed beneath this abominable infliction. People at other tables were laughing. At him. A loathing for the Flower Garden flowed over Bruce Carmyle, and with it a feeling of suspicion and disapproval of everyone connected with the establishment. He sprang to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the first}} time she had ever found herself in the {{business}} apartment of any professional man less important than a dentist. From the little waiting-room, where they handed her the Times, which she could not read from excitement, she caught sight of rooms lined to the ceilings with leather books and black tin boxes, initialed in white to indicate the brand, and of young men seated behind lumps of paper that had been written on. She heard a perpetual <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> which roused her interest, and smelled a peculiar odour of leather and disinfectant which impressed her disagreeably. A youth with reddish hair and a pen in his hand passed through and looked at her with a curious stare immediately averted. She suddenly felt sorry for him and all those other young men behind the lumps of paper, and the thought went flashing through her mind, 'I suppose it's all because people can't agree.' ...|$|E

I had another fox squirrel, older than this fellow, and he ran things to suit himself, until one day the grays united their forces and routed him. I {{think they would have}} killed him had I not freed him. Well, this one is commencing the same way. Do you hear that odd <b>clicking</b> <b>noise?</b> That comes from the Captain's teeth, and he is angry and jealous because I show so much attention to this one. He always does that, and he would fight too if I were not careful. It is a singular fact, though, that the white squirrel has not even a little pugnacity. He either cannot fight, or he is too well behaved. Here, Mr. Clarke, show Snowball this nut, and then hide it in your pocket, and see him find it." ...|$|E

They attack human intruders without hesitation, sometimes taking painful nips. They're particularly aggressive during reproductive periods. During aggressive encounters, they emit <b>clicking</b> <b>noises.</b> Males guard and tend the nest, visited by several females.|$|R
5000|$|Literal {{translation}} in English language would be: [...] "fold {{and snap}} to be prepared." [...] The first two terms are the <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> {{that you are}} supposed to hear when breaking the chocolate bar twice in the middle - knick is from the German verb knicken (to bend something), Knack means snap/click and [...] "auf Zack sein" [...] means on one's toes / ready and waiting / prepared / set / arranged. This motto aired on German TV in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Form was a boot sector virus {{isolated}} in Switzerland {{in the summer}} of 1990 which became very common worldwide. The origin of Form is widely listed as Switzerland, but this may be an assumption based on its isolation locale. The only notable characteristics of Form are that it infects the boot sector instead of the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> associated with some infections. Infections under Form can result in severe data damage if operating system characteristics are not identical to those Form assumes.|$|R
60|$|After {{eighteen}} memorable days {{spent with}} unceasing delight at Bahia, the 'Beagle' sailed again for Rio, where Darwin stopped for three months, {{to improve his}} acquaintance with the extraordinary wealth of the South American fauna and flora. Collecting insects was here his chief occupation, and {{it is interesting to}} note even at this early period how his attention was attracted by some of those strange alluring devices on the part of the males for charming their partners which afterwards formed the principal basis for his admirable theory of sexual selection, so fully developed in the 'Descent of Man.' 'Several times,' he says, 'when a pair [of butterflies], probably male and female, were chasing each other in an irregular course, they passed within a few yards of me; and I distinctly heard a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise,</b> similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a spring catch.' In like manner he observed here the instincts of tropical ants, the habits of phosphorescent insects, and the horrid practice of that wasp-like creature, the sphex, which stuffs the clay cells of its larvæ full of half-dead spiders and writhing caterpillars, so stung with devilish avoidance of vital parts as to be left quite paralysed yet still alive, as future food for the developing grubs. Cases like these helped naturally to shake the young biologist's primitive faith in the cheap and crude current theories of universal beneficence, and to introduce that wholesome sceptical reaction against received dogma which is the necessary groundwork and due preparation for all great progressive philosophical thinking.|$|E
6000|$|They {{are each}} some {{two or three}} feet high, of the very finest mud, which leaves no feeling of grit on the fingers or tongue, and dries, of course, rapidly in the sun. On the top, or near the top, of each is a round hole, a finger's breadth, {{polished}} to exceeding smoothness, and running down through the cone {{as far as we}} could dig. From each oozes perpetually, with a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> of gas- bubbles, water and mud; and now and then, losing their temper, they spirt out their dirt to a considerable height; a feat which we did not see performed, but which is so common that we were in something like fear and trembling while we opened a cone with our cutlasses. [...] For though we could hardly have been made dirtier than we were, an explosion in our faces of mud with 'a faint bituminous smell,' and impregnated with 'common salt, a notable proportion of iodine, and a trace of carbonate of soda and carbonate of lime,' {195} would have been both unpleasant and humiliating. But the most puzzling thing about the place is, that out of the mud comes up--not jumbies, but-- a multitude of small stones, like no stones in the neighbourhood; we found concretions of iron sand, and scales which seemed to have peeled off them; and pebbles, quartzose, or jasper, or like in appearance to flint; but all evidently long rolled on a sea-beach. [...] Messrs. Wall and Sawkins mention pyrites and gypsum as being found: [...] but we saw none, as far as I recollect. All these must have been carried up from a considerable depth by the force of the same gases which make the little mud-volcanoes.|$|E

500|$|Typically tame, the nilgai {{may appear}} timid and {{cautious}} if harassed or alarmed; instead of seeking cover like duikers it would flee up to -or even [...] on galloping-away from the danger. Though generally quiet, nilgai {{have been reported}} to make short guttural grunts when alarmed, and females to make <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> when nursing young. Alarmed individuals, mainly juveniles below five months, give out a coughing roar (whose pitch is highest in case of the juveniles) that lasts half a second, but can be heard by herds less than [...] away and responded to similarly.|$|R
2500|$|Infrared lasers are {{particularly}} hazardous, since the body's protective glare aversion response, {{also referred to}} as the [...] "blink reflex," [...] is triggered only by visible light. For example, some people exposed to high power Nd:YAG laser emitting invisible 1064nm radiation may not feel pain or notice immediate damage to their eyesight. A pop or <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> emanating from the eyeball may be the only indication that retinal damage has occurred i.e. the retina was heated to over 100 °C resulting in localized explosive boiling accompanied by the immediate creation of a permanent blind spot.|$|R

The gun is small in comparison to other light guns for the Dreamcast. There are no expansion slots. The gun features a directional pad and Start and B buttons beneath the barrel. The trigger uses a plastic slide, as opposed to hinged triggers, which produce <b>clicking</b> <b>noises.</b> The orange plastic hammer of the gun is actually a functional button capable of triggering a secondary weapon.|$|R
