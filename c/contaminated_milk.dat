50|$|Some {{diseases}} {{are difficult to}} evaluate in the archaeology, however, tuberculosis can be found and dates {{as far back as}} the Neolithic period. Tuberculosis is presumed to have been transmitted from domesticated cattle to humans through ingestion of contaminated meats and the drinking of <b>contaminated</b> <b>milk.</b> It is also possible to contract tuberculosis through contact with infected persons. When an infected person coughs, they eject infected mucus from their body which can possibly infect those close by. There are several types of tuberculosis, the kind that affect cold-blooded animals, the kind that affects birds and the bovine type that causes disease in humans. Because bovine tuberculosis is often found in children, it may be that the disease is spread through the consumption of <b>contaminated</b> <b>milk.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of alternative microbiological techniques {{is driven by}} the necessity to meet the cur-rent needs to deliver rapid results in the manufacturing process of foods, but it is important that these methods be evaluated for each application. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the Petrifilm ™ EB and the TEMPO ® EB systems with ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004 for the count of Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurized and UHT milk samples. We analyzed the microflora of 141 pas-teurized milk samples, 15 samples of artificially <b>contaminated</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> and 15 samples of ar-tificially <b>contaminated</b> UHT <b>milk.</b> Investigation of the method Petrifilm ™ EB and ISO 21528 : 2 regression analysis showed a high correlation in the samples, r = 0. 90 for the microflora of pasteur-ized milk, r = 0. 98 for artificially <b>contaminated</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> and r = 0. 99 for the artificially con-taminated UHT milk. In evaluating the system TEMPO EB ® method and ISO 21528 : 2 correlation was also significant in the analyzed samples, with r = 0. 86 for the microflora of pasteurized milk, r = 0. 96 for artificially <b>contaminated</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> and r = 0. 99 for artificially <b>contaminated</b> UHT <b>milk.</b> No statistically significant differences were observed between the three methods conducted to analyze artificially contaminated pasteurized and UHT milk at three inoculum levels. In conclusion, the Petrifilm ™ EB system and the TEMPO ® EB system may be an alternative to the ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004 for the Enterobacteriaceae assay for milk as because of the ease-of-operation and the time reduction achieved for conducting the microbiological assay using these systems...|$|R
40|$|Late blowing {{is still}} a {{significant}} problem in hard cheeses, including Grana Padano (GP), a DOP Italian cheese known worldwide.

In this study, a fingerprinting of Clostridia population in Grana Padano cheese was performed.

50|$|Human milk {{sickness}} is uncommon {{today in}} the United States. Current practices of animal husbandry generally control the pastures and feed of cattle, and the pooling of milk from many producers lowers the risk of tremetol present in dangerous amounts. The poison tremetol is not inactivated by pasteurization. Although extremely rare, milk sickness can occur if a person drinks <b>contaminated</b> <b>milk</b> or eats dairy products gathered from a single cow or from a smaller herd that has fed on the white snakeroot plant. There is no cure, but treatment is available.|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of the pathogenic Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC; also called verocytotoxic-producing E. coli or VTEC) in sporadic cases and disease outbreaks is presently increasing. Infrequent cases are due to ingestion of milk and dairy products. As ruminants are healthy carriers of STEC and most dairy products may provide these bacteria with favourable conditions for their growth, milk and dairy products are a potential source of STEC. But not all STEC serotypes are pathogens; only relatively small numbers in the entire family of STEC are pathogenic. This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding of STEC and their significance in milk and dairy products. It is intended to gather the information {{that is needed to}} understand how these bacteria are described, detected and characterised, how they <b>contaminate</b> <b>milk</b> and grow in dairy products, and how the dairy industry can prevent them from affecting the consumer.

40|$|Sediment in milk {{indicates}} carelessness in {{its production}} or handling. Sediment <b>contaminates</b> <b>milk</b> {{and makes it}} less salable. Most of the sediment in milk comes from the bodies of cows and consists of hairs, manure, bedding, etc. Straining removes only the coarse particles of dirt and removes neither the bacteria nor the fine dirt. Straining improves the commercial quality of milk, but does not appreciably improve its healthfulness. The best system is to prevent, so far as possible, the entrance of dirt into milk. This can be done best by having clean cows in clean stables, milked with clean hands, into clean, small-top pails. Filter cloth and absorbent cotton are efficient materials for strainers. Cheesecloth and wire gauze are less effective. Straining cloths should be changed whenever they become soiled. They should be thoroughly washed and sterilized after each using. Efficient sterilization is accomplished by boiling or exposure to steam {{for at least five}} minutes. " [...] p. ...|$|R
