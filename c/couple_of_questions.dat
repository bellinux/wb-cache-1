40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{behavior}} of Hamilton operators and their spectra which depend on infinitely many coupling parameters or, more generally, parameters taking values in some Banach space. One of the physical models which motivate this framework is a quantum particle moving in {{a more or less}} disordered medium. One may however also envisage other scenarios where operators are allowed to depend on interaction terms in a manner we are going to discuss below. The central idea is to vary the occurring infinitely many perturbing potentials independently. As a side aspect this then leads naturally to the analysis <b>of</b> a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> interesting <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> a more or less purely mathematical flavor which belong to the field of infinite dimensional holomorphy or holomorphy in Banach spaces. In this general setting we study in particular the stability of selfadjointness of the operators under discussion and the analyticity of eigenvalues under the condition that the perturbing potentials belong to certain classes. ...|$|R
