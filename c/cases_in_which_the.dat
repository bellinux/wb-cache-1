5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to {{determine}} if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it {{had a tendency to}} harm public welfare. One of the earliest <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{there have}} been 61 {{occasions}} on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. The most recent dismissal of this fashion in first-class cricket occurred during a County Championship contest between Leicestershire and Kent in April 2016, when Kent batsman Sean Dickson was dismissed for the infraction. Brodribb {{suggests that it is}} likely that there should have been a significant number more dismissals than {{there have been}} for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious.|$|E

5|$|The decade from 1954 to 1964 was {{the most}} {{successful}} period in the ACLU's history. Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states. During the ACLU's bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> ACLU was involved; the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight. The ACLU {{played a role in}} Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects. The ACLU's success arose from changing public attitudes; the American populace was more educated, more tolerant, and more willing to accept unorthodox behavior.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented a number of <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, {{there would be no}} poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume.
