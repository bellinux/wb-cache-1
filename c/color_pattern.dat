In 2014, a study compared the facial <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> across 25 canid species.

5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E

5|$|Some poison dart frogs species {{include a}} number of conspecific color morphs that emerged as {{recently}} as 6,000 years ago. Therefore, species such as Dendrobates tinctorius, Oophaga pumilio, and Oophaga granulifera can include <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> morphs that can be interbred (colors are under polygenic control, while the actual patterns are probably controlled by a single locus).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationships between}} several types of <b>color</b> <b>patterns</b> and their impressions. Psychological tests are conducted to evaluate impressions of <b>color</b> <b>patterns</b> in similar-color combination and those in different-color combination. This study also evaluates the effect of differences in color disposition on their impressions. Experimental results show the following. In the case of similar <b>color</b> <b>patterns,</b> red-group patterns evoke warmer impressions than blue-group patterns, and green-group patterns are felt more natural than purple-group <b>patterns.</b> When the <b>color</b> disposition is changed, the subjects change their impressions in terms of "dynamic" and "colorful" for some <b>color</b> <b>patterns</b> in different-color combination. In conclusion, {{the knowledge of the}} effect of the color disposition clarified through this study will be useful in application to design of many fields of products including dresses.

5|$|Because of {{its highly}} {{variable}} <b>color</b> <b>pattern,</b> the leopard catshark {{has historically been}} known under a multitude of names. In an 1837 issue of Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith listed without descriptions the new genus Poroderma, containing the species P.africanum (the pyjama shark), P.pantherinum, P.submaculatum, and P.variegatum. German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle assigned these sharks to the genus Scyllium, and in their 18381841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen furnished descriptions for S.pantherinum and S.variegatum, and listed two more names without description, S.leopardinum and S.maeandrinum. In 1934, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler described P.marleyi, characterized by large black spots.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> {{was known to}} exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they first arrived in the early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others arrived {{in the western hemisphere}} when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped to Mexico, California and Oregon.|$|E

5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, because of the <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. This {{is especially true for}} juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark stripes on the sides of its head that extend back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall <b>color</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, the <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray {{is closely}} related to H. undulata and H. leoparda, which share much of its range. All three species are very similar in size, shape, and <b>color</b> <b>pattern,</b> resulting in a long history of taxonomic confusion that only recently is starting to be untangled. In 2004, Mabel Manjaji described the 'uarnak' species complex, containing H. fai, H. gerrardi, H. jenkinsii, H. leoparda, H. toshi, H. uarnak, and H. undulata, plus three more undescribed species. The reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range, and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species. Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray, leopard stingray, longtail stingray, and marbled stingray; some of these names are shared by other, similar species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> varies geographically. The {{head has}} two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the <b>color</b> <b>pattern</b> may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
