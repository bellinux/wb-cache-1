25|$|The {{difference}} between the total debits and total credits in a single account is the account's balance. If debits exceed credits, the account has a debit balance; if credits exceed debits, the account has a <b>credit</b> <b>balance.</b> For the company as a whole, the totals of debit balances and credit balances must be equal {{as shown in the}} trial balance report, otherwise an error has occurred.|$|E
25|$|Debit {{cards and}} credit cards are {{creative}} terms used by the banking industry to market and identify each card. From the cardholder's point of view, a credit card account normally contains a <b>credit</b> <b>balance,</b> a debit card account normally contains a debit balance. A debit card is {{used to make a}} purchase with one's own money. A credit card is used to make a purchase by borrowing money.|$|E
40|$|Current ERISA and IRC funding {{rules for}} defined benefit pension plans permit {{sponsors}} of underfunded plans with funding standard account (FSA) <b>credit</b> <b>balances</b> to forgo making contributions, even for severely underfunded plans. Because such <b>credit</b> <b>balances</b> insulate sponsors from making contributions for incurred losses, sponsors of plans with large FSA <b>credit</b> <b>balances</b> may influence plan trustees to invest plan assets in riskier investments. Consistent with these incentives, {{we find that}} underfunded plans with large FSA <b>credit</b> <b>balances</b> earn higher average returns and experience higher return variance on their plan assets relative to those with small <b>credit</b> <b>balances,</b> especially as the underfunding worsens.

25|$|Banks in the United States offer {{savings and}} money market deposit accounts, but {{these should not}} be {{confused}} with money mutual funds.

25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a <b>credit</b> <b>balance</b> on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E
2500|$|When I write two £100 cheques for a {{total of}} £200, the balance in my bank account is reduced by £200. Based on the law of accounting, a {{decrease}} in my cash asset is a credit.

Thus, in my records, my [...] "Bank" [...] ledger account has an asset <b>credit</b> <b>balance,</b> which is reduced by the credit for £200. [...] Amounts in my records for the two creditors are liabilities, which are reduced by the two debits totaling £200.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{computerization}} {{of credit}} card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and <b>credit</b> <b>balance.</b> This system was computerized in 1973 {{under the leadership of}} Dee Hock, the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute. [...] However, until always-connected payment terminals became ubiquitous {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone. [...] Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card. [...] Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Credit</b> card <b>balance</b> is an {{important}} factor in retail finance. In this article we consider multivariate models of <b>credit</b> card <b>balance</b> and use a real dataset of credit card data to test the forecasting performance of the models. Several models are considered in a cross-sectional regression context: ordinary least squares, two-stage and mixture regression. After that, we take advantage of the time series structure of the data and model <b>credit</b> card <b>balance</b> using a random effects panel model. The most important predictor variable is previous lagged balance, but other application and behavioural variables are also found to be important. Finally, we present an investigation of forecast accuracy on <b>credit</b> card <b>balance</b> 12 months ahead using each of the proposed models. The panel model is found to be the best model for forecasting <b>credit</b> card <b>balance</b> in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and the two-stage regression model performs best in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) ...|$|R
