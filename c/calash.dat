6000|$|... "As {{one of the}} relics?" [...] {{suggested}} the artist, glancing at a green <b>calash</b> and a plum-colored quilted petticoat lying on the settle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe I {{understand}} you, Pathfinder," [...] said Mabel, blushing {{in spite}} of herself, [...] "and I look upon the <b>calash</b> as the joint gift of yourself and Jasper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the right-about, {{and fall}} out, Quartermaster," [...] said Lundie, {{smiling at the}} success of the artifice. [...] "The honor of the silken <b>calash</b> will lie between Jasper Eau-douce and Pathfinder." ...|$|E
60|$|Our party met a {{great many}} of these <b>calashes</b> coming into town, and {{bringing}} in loads of country people.|$|R
50|$|In the Philippines, the kalesa is a one-horse {{descendant}} of Spanish Colonial <b>calashes,</b> {{and is a}} common sight in older cities such as Manila and Vigan.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} Almayer had clambered {{over into the}} stern sheets, four <b>calashes</b> were in the boat and the oars were being passed over the taffrail. The mate was looking on. Suddenly he said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} be {{disposed}} to sell that <b>calash,</b> Mabel, when {{it has been a}} short time in your possession?" [...] inquired the captain's lady. [...] "Wear it, I should think, you never can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is something, Mabel, that is something; {{although}} I have no <b>calash</b> to give you! But ask Jasper himself; I'll {{leave it}} all to Jasper, for a truer tongue and heart are not in America." ...|$|E
60|$|A small, rough dug-out {{belonging}} to the Emma had been brought round to the ladder. A shadowy <b>calash</b> hovering respectfully {{in the darkness of}} the deck had already cleared his throat twice in a warning manner.|$|E
60|$|Nearly an hour passed. The <b>calashes</b> {{stretched}} forward {{head first}} and lay back with their faces to the sky, alternately, {{in a regular}} swing that sent the boat flying through the water; and the two sitters, very upright in the stern sheets, swayed rhythmically a little at every stroke of the long oars plied vigorously.|$|R
60|$|Almayer looked anxious. He steered badly. Several {{times the}} blades of the oars got foul {{of the bushes}} on {{one side or the}} other, {{checking}} the way of the gig. During one of those occurrences, while they were getting clear, one of the <b>calashes</b> said something to the others in a rapid whisper. They looked down at the water. So did the mate.|$|R
60|$|At {{one side}} of the church there was a booth for the sale of crockery and tin ware; and there was an every-day cheerfulness of small {{business}} in the shops and tented stands about the square on which the church faced, and through which there was continual passing of heavy burdens from the port, swift <b>calashes,</b> and slow, country-paced market-carts.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the young}} man himself will think all the better of you for your {{prudence}} after {{the triumph of the}} day is forgotten. It is a pretty and a becoming <b>calash,</b> and ought not to be thrown away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Money cannot buy it, Lieutenant," [...] {{returned}} Jasper, whose eye lighted {{with all}} the fire of success and joy. [...] "I would rather have won this <b>calash</b> than have obtained fifty new suits of sails for the Scud!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>calash</b> is his," [...] {{returned}} the other, {{shaking his head}} and walking quietly away from the stand. [...] "What a creature is mortal man! never satisfied with his own gifts, but for ever craving that which Providence denies!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are poor}} <b>calashes</b> without sense," [...] commented Wasub with pitying superiority. [...] "Some {{with no more}} {{comprehension}} than men of the bush freshly caught. There is Sali, the foolish son of my sister and by your great favour appointed to mind the tiller of this ship. His stupidity is extreme, but his eyes are good--nearly as good as mine that by praying and much exercise can see far into the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{returned}} {{on board}} {{as he had}} insisted I should do. I didn't want to intrude on his grief. Later, about five in the morning, some of my <b>calashes</b> came running to me, yelling {{that there was a}} fire ashore. I landed at once, of course. The principal bungalow was blazing. The heat drove us back. The other two houses caught one after another like kindling-wood. There was no going beyond the shore end of the jetty till the afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{we fight}} without a leader?" [...] he began again. [...] "It {{is the belief}} in victory that gives courage. And what would poor <b>calashes</b> do, sons of peasants and fishermen, freshly caught--without knowledge? They believe in your strength--and in your power--or else--Will those whites that came so {{suddenly}} avenge you? They are here like fish within the stakes. Ya-wa! Who will bring the news and who will come to find the truth and perchance to carry off your body? You go alone, Tuan!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] cried Mrs. Ellison with {{profound}} disgust, [...] "I hope {{he had to}} walk back. But I'm afraid there were only too many chances for him to ride. I dare say {{he could get a}} <b>calash</b> at the hotel there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now you've got the <b>calash,</b> lad, it's {{of no use}} to you," [...] he added; [...] "it {{will never}} make a sail, nor even an ensign. I'm thinking, Eau-douce, you'd no' be sorry to see its value in good siller of the king?" ...|$|E
60|$|As Pathfinder had not {{buried his}} {{bullet in the}} potato, but had cut through the skin, the prize was {{immediately}} adjudged to Jasper. The <b>calash</b> was {{in the hands of}} the latter when the Quartermaster approached, and with a polite air of cordiality he wished his successful rival joy of his victory.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{half an hour}} she was abreast, to windward, within hail, {{and rolling}} slightly, with her engines stopped. We lost our composure, and yelled all {{together}} with excitement, 'We've been blown up.' A {{man in a white}} helmet, on the bridge, cried, 'Yes! All right! all right!' and he nodded his head, and smiled, and made soothing motions with his hand as though at a lot of frightened children. One of the boats dropped in the water, and walked towards us upon the sea with her long oars. Four <b>Calashes</b> pulled a swinging stroke. This was my first sight of Malay seamen. I've known them since, but what struck me then was their unconcern: they came alongside, and even the bowman standing up and holding to our main-chains with the boat-hook did not deign to lift his head for a glance. I thought people who had been blown up deserved more attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was below}} {{yesterday}} morning when {{we felt the}} shock, but the noise came to us only as a deep rumble. I made one jump for the companion but that precious Shaw was before me yelling, 'Earthquake! Earthquake!' and I am hanged if he didn't miss his footing and land down on {{his head at the}} bottom of the stairs. I had to stop to pick him up but I got on deck in time to see a mighty black cloud that seemed almost solid pop up from behind the forest like a balloon. It stayed there for quite a long time. Some of our <b>Calashes</b> on deck swore to me that they had seen a red flash above the tree-tops. But that's hard to believe. I guessed at once that something had blown up on shore. My first thought was that I would never see you any more and I made up my mind at once to find out all the truth you have been keeping away from me. No, sir! Don't you make a mistake! I wasn't going to give you up, dead or alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{they drew}} near the {{steamboat}} wharf they saw, swarming over a broad square, a market beside which the Bonsecours Market {{would have shown}} as common as the Quincy, and up the odd wooden-sidewalked street stretched an aisle of carriages and those high swung <b>calashes,</b> which are to Quebec what the gondolas are to Venice. But the hand of destiny was upon our tourists, and they rode up town in an omnibus. They {{were going to the}} dear old Hotel Musty in Street, wanting which Quebec is not to be thought of without a pang. It is now closed, and Prescott Gate, through which they drove into the Upper Town, has been demolished since the summer of last year. Swiftly whirled along the steep winding road, by those Quebec horses which expect to gallop up hill whatever they do going down, they turned a corner of the towering weed-grown rock, and shot in under the low arch of the gate, pierced with smaller doorways for the foot-passengers. The gloomy masonry dripped with damp, the doors were thickly studded with heavy iron spikes; old cannon, thrust endwise into the ground at the sides of the gate, protected it against passing wheels. Why did not some semi-forbidding commissary of police, struggling hard to overcome his native politeness, appear and demand their passports? The illusion was otherwise perfect, and it needed but this touch. How often in the adored Old World, which we so love and disapprove, had they driven in through such gates at that morning hour! On what perverse pretext, then, was it not some ancient town of Normandy? ...|$|R
60|$|A rosy, dark-eyed {{face looked}} {{out from the}} faded green <b>calash,</b> a gayly flowered gown was looped up over a blue quilted petticoat, and a red camlet cloak hung down behind. A big {{reticule}} and a funny umbrella were held in either hand, and red hose and very high-heeled, pointed shoes covered a trim pair of feet.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} {{compressed}} his lips, dashed a {{hand across his}} eye, and flushed and paled alternately, like a girl confessing her love. Then, squeezing the other's hand, he said calmly, like one whose manhood has overcome all other sensations, [...] "I would lose an arm, Pathfinder, {{to be able to}} make an offering of that <b>calash</b> to Mabel Dunham." ...|$|E
60|$|Pathfinder and {{his companions}} retired, for the sports were about to proceed. The ladies, however, were not so much engrossed with rifle-shooting as to neglect the <b>calash.</b> It passed from hand to hand; the silk was felt, the fashion criticized, and the work examined, and divers {{opinions}} were privately ventured concerning the fitness of so handsome a thing passing into the possession of a non-commissioned officer's child.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. He {{must have}} as many lives as a cat," [...] {{answered}} Carter. [...] "I {{will tell you how}} it was. As I said before I wasn't going to give you up, dead or alive, so yesterday when the sun went down a little in the afternoon I had two of our boats manned and pulled in shore, taking soundings to find a passage if there was one. I meant to go back and look for you with the brig or without the brig--but that doesn't matter now. There were three or four floating logs in sight. One of the <b>Calashes</b> in my boat made out something red on one of them. I thought it was worth while to go and see what it was. It was that man's sarong. It had got entangled among the branches and prevented him rolling off into the water. I was never so glad, I assure you, as when we found out that he was still breathing. If we could only nurse him back to life, I thought, he could perhaps tell me a lot of things. The log on which he hung had come out of the mouth of the creek and he couldn't have been more than half a day on it by my calculation. I had him taken down the main hatchway and put into a hammock in the 'tween-decks. He only just breathed then, but some time during the night he came to himself {{and got out of the}} hammock to lie down on a mat. I suppose he was more comfortable that way. He recovered his speech only this morning and I went down at once and told you of it, but you took no notice. I told you also who he was but I don't know whether you heard me or not." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few steps}} {{had brought them}} into the market-square {{in front of the}} cathedral, where a little belated traffic still lingered in the few old peasant-women {{hovering}} over baskets of such fruits and vegetables as had long been out of season in the States, and the housekeepers and serving-maids cheapening these wares. A sentry moved mechanically up and down before the high portal of the Jesuit Barracks, over the arch of which were still the letters I. H. S. carved long ago upon the keystone; and the ancient edifice itself, with its yellow stucco front and its grated windows, had every right to be a monastery turned barracks in France or Italy. A row of quaint stone houses--inns and shops--formed the upper side of the Square; while the modern buildings of the Rue Fabrique on the lower side might serve very well for that show of improvement which deepens the sentiment of the neighboring antiquity and decay in Latin towns. As for the cathedral, which faced the convent from across the Square, it was as cold and torpid a bit of Renaissance as could be found in Rome itself. A red-coated soldier or two passed through the Square; three or four neat little French policemen lounged about in blue uniforms and flaring havelocks; some walnut-faced, blue-eyed old citizens and peasants sat upon the thresholds of the row of old houses, and gazed dreamily through the smoke of their pipes at the slight stir and glitter of shopping about the fine stores of the Rue Fabrique. An air of serene disoccupation pervaded the place, with which the occasional riot of the drivers of the long row of <b>calashes</b> and carriages in front of the cathedral did not discord. Whenever a stray American wandered into the Square, there was a wild flight of these drivers towards him, and his person was lost to sight amidst their pantomime. They did not try to underbid each other, and they were perfectly good-humored; as soon as he had made his choice, the rejected multitude returned to their places on the curbstone, pursuing the successful aspirant with inscrutable jokes as he drove off, while the horses went on munching the contents of their leathern head-bags, and tossing them into the air to shake down the lurking grains of corn.|$|R
6000|$|There is a {{good deal}} of amusement, and some profit, in the perusal of those little items which {{characterize}} the manners and circumstances of the country. New England was then in a state incomparably more picturesque than at present, or than it has been within the memory of man; there being, as yet, only a narrow strip of civilization along the edge of a vast forest, peopled with enough of its original race to contrast the savage life with the old customs of another world. The white population, also, was diversified by the influx of all sorts of expatriated vagabonds, and by the continual importation of bond-servants from Ireland and elsewhere, so that there was a wild and unsettled multitude, forming a strong minority to the sober descendants of the Puritans. Then, there were the slaves, contributing their dark shade to the picture of society. The consequence of all this was a great variety and singularity of action and incident, many instances of which might be selected from these columns, where they are told with a simplicity and quaintness of style that bring the striking points into very strong relief. It is natural to suppose, too, that these circumstances affected the body of the people, and made their course of life generally less regular than that of their descendants. There {{is no evidence that the}} moral standard was higher then than now; or, indeed, that morality was so well defined as it has since become. There seem to have been quite as many frauds and robberies, in proportion to the number of honest deeds; there were murders, in hot-blood and in malice; and bloody quarrels over liquor. Some of our fathers also appear to have been yoked to unfaithful wives, if we may trust the frequent notices of elopements from bed and board. The pillory, the whipping-post, the prison, and the gallows, each had their use in those old times; and, in short, as often as our imagination lives in the past, we find it a ruder and rougher age than our own, with hardly any perceptible advantages, and much that gave life a gloomier tinge. In vain we endeavor to throw a sunny and joyous air over our picture of this period; nothing passes before our fancy but a crowd of sad-visaged people, moving duskily through a dull gray atmosphere. It is certain that winter rushed upon them with fiercer storms than now, blocking up the narrow forest-paths, and overwhelming the roads along the sea-coast with mountain snow drifts; so that weeks elapsed before the newspaper could announce how many travellers had perished, or what wrecks had strewn the shore. The cold was more piercing then, and lingered further into the spring, making the chimney-corner a comfortable seat till long past May-day. By the number of such accidents on record, we might suppose that the thunder-stone, as they termed it, fell oftener and deadlier on steeples, dwellings, and unsheltered wretches. In fine, our fathers bore the brunt of more raging and pitiless elements than we. There were forebodings, also, of a more fearful tempest than those of the elements. At two or three dates, we have stories of drums, trumpets, and all sorts of martial music, passing athwart the midnight sky, accompanied with the--roar of cannon and rattle of musketry, prophetic echoes of the sounds that were soon to shake the land. Besides these airy prognostics, there were rumors of French fleets on the coast, and of the march of French and Indians through the wilderness, along the borders of the settlements. The country was saddened, moreover, with grievous sicknesses. The small-pox raged in many of the towns, and seems, though so familiar a scourge, to have been regarded with as much affright as that which drove the throng from Wall Street and Broadway at the approach of a new pestilence. There were autumnal fevers too, and a contagious and destructive throat-distemper,--diseases unwritten in medical hooks. The dark superstition of former days had not yet been so far dispelled as not to heighten the gloom of the present times. There is an advertisement, indeed, by a committee of the Legislature, calling for information as to the circumstances of sufferers in the [...] "late calamity of 1692," [...] with a view to reparation for their losses and misfortunes. But the tenderness with which, after above forty years, it was thought expedient to allude to the witchcraft delusion, indicates a good deal of lingering error, as well as the advance of more enlightened opinions. The rigid hand of Puritanism might yet be felt upon the reins of government, while some of the ordinances intimate a disorderly spirit on the part of the people. The Suffolk justices, after a preamble that great disturbances have been committed by persons entering town and leaving it in coaches, chaises, <b>calashes,</b> and other wheel-carriages, on the evening before the Sabbath, give notice that a watch will hereafter be set at the [...] "fortification-gate," [...] to prevent these outrages. It is amusing to see Boston assuming the aspect of a walled city, guarded, probably, by a detachment of church-members, with a deacon at their head. Governor Belcher makes proclamation against certain [...] "loose and dissolute people" [...] who have been wont to stop passengers in the streets, on the Fifth of November, [...] "otherwise called Pope's Day," [...] and levy contributions for the building of bonfires. In this instance, the populace are more puritanic than the magistrate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was but a}} worldly vanity,' quoth the Mayor; 'for, {{with all}} deference, Sir Gervas Jerome, a man's own hair {{arranged}} with some taste, and with perhaps a sprinkling of powder, is to my mind the fittest ornament to his head. It is the contents and not the case which availeth. Having donned this frippery, good Master Foster and I hired a <b>calash</b> {{and drove to the}} Palace. We were deep in grave and, I trust, profitable converse speeding through the endless streets, when of a sudden I felt a sharp tug at my head, and my hat fluttered down on to my knees. I raised my hands, and lo! they came upon my bare pate. The wig had vanished. We were rolling down Fleet Street at the moment, {{and there was no one}} in the <b>calash</b> save neighbour Foster, who sat as astounded as I. We looked high and low, on the seats and beneath them, but not a sign of the periwig was there. It was gone utterly and without a trace.' ...|$|E
60|$|The same {{morning that}} Mrs. Bullfrog and I came {{together}} as a unit, we took two seats in the stage-coach and began our journey towards my place of business. There being no other passengers, we were as much alone and as free to give vent to our raptures as if I had hired a hack for the matrimonial jaunt. My bride looked charmingly in a green silk <b>calash</b> and riding habit of pelisse cloth; and whenever her red lips parted with a smile, each tooth appeared like an inestimable pearl. Such was my passionate warmth that--we had rattled out of the village, gentle reader, and were lonely as Adam and Eve in paradise--I plead guilty to no less freedom than a kiss. The gentle eye of Mrs. Bullfrog scarcely rebuked me for the profanation. Emboldened by her indulgence, I threw back the <b>calash</b> from her polished brow, and suffered my fingers, white and delicate as her own, to stray among those dark and glossy curls which realized my daydreams of rich hair.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Arbuton made no {{motion to}} enter the church, and Kitty would not hint the curiosity she felt to see the interior; and while they lingered a moment, the door opened, and a peasant {{came out with a}} little coffin in his arms.

Kitty and her companion had moved reverently aside; but now Mr. Arbuton came forward, and helped the woman to her place. She gave him a hoarse, sad [...] "Merci!"
