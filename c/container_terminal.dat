5|$|The Port of Rijeka {{development}} master plan, {{devised by}} Rotterdam Maritime Group, specifies further expansion of port facilities by 2030, including {{the construction of}} a large <b>container</b> <b>terminal</b> in Omišalj on Krk Island, near the JANAF Omišalj oil terminal. The <b>container</b> <b>terminal</b> would increase the annual capacity of the port by 2.5million TEUs. The plan requires construction of a high performance railway to Zagreb and a rail link planned by Croatian Railways to the proposed island terminal. The new line entails building a new bridge to Krk Island in addition to the existing Krk Bridge. The plan also includes expansion of the existing terminals, and is estimated to require an additional US$150 million. Likewise, an expansion of the Liquid Cargo Terminal is planned, as well as an expansion of the Bakar Bay facility, where a car terminal is planned. The expansion of the port, improvement of transportation links and the strategic partnership are aimed at establishing Rijeka as the largest container port on the Adriatic Sea.|$|E

40|$|Since {{container}} throughput {{is continually}} increasing, the main issues facing decision-makers at port <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> {{is how to}} expand the existing <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> and construct new <b>container</b> <b>terminals.</b> Simulations that support user needs require modeling tools that are both {{easy to use and}} sufficiently flexible to reflect real world systems.

40|$|This paper aims {{to address}} the linkage between {{logistics}} (in particular, the management of marketing channel flows) and transport markets, while also the interaction between these two markets and inter-modal <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> is analysed. The marketing channel theory is used to describe all relevant actors and flows that run through marketing channels, starting with customer needs and ending with customer satisfaction. Porter's theory of competitive advantages is used to review competitive forces in both markets. Finally, a competitor analysis is performed for the logistics and transport market. These theories are applied {{so as to be}} able to determine the competitive position of inter-modal <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> with a view to the management of marketing channel flows and the physical transport of freight flows. Hence, the central question of this paper is: Which markets are served by inter-modal <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> and with whom are they competing? At present, neither the maritime <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> nor the continental <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> appear to have a significant influence in the logistics service market; they concentrate mainly on the physical movement of containers (transshipment). Furthermore, maritime <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> and continental <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> are not dominant players in the transport service market. Our conclusion is that continental terminals are predominantly competing with unimodal road transport, with neighbouring continental terminals and with barge transport companies. ...|$|R

5|$|Following World War II and the Paris Peace Treaties, Rijeka {{became a}} part of Croatia and Yugoslavia. This {{provided}} the Port of Rijeka with a new market and sparked further development. A bulk cargo terminal was completed in 1967, followed by warehouses in Škrljevo in 1978. In 1979, a <b>container</b> <b>terminal</b> in Sušak, a phosphate terminal in Rijeka and a timber terminal in Bršica were added. Joining them were a livestock terminal in Bršica and a general cargo terminal with a roll-on/roll-off ramp in the Bakar area in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The greatest volume of cargo was recorded in 1980, when 20.2million tonnes, including 13.1million tonnes of liquid cargo, were transported. The port suffered another period of stagnation in the 1990s due to the Croatian War of Independence, when a portion of the port's shipping switched to Trieste and Koper. Since 1996, the volume of operations of the Port of Rijeka has again been gradually growing.|$|E

5|$|The port of Rijeka is {{the largest}} port in Croatia, {{handling}} the largest portion of the country's imports and exports. In 2008, 2418 ships docked at Rijeka itself, 872 at Bršica, 818 at Bakar, and 268 at Omišalj—a total of 4376. In 2010, the Port of Rijeka transported 10.2million tonnes of cargo, a 9% drop from 2009. However the figure represents a 69% increase of dry cargo transport volume compared to 2002. The 2010 figure includes 5.6million tonnes of liquid cargo, 2.3million tonnes of general cargo, 2.0million tonnes of bulk cargo and 254,000 tonnes of timber. The <b>container</b> <b>terminal</b> recorded a substantial growth of business in past years. 137,048 TEUs were transported through the port in 2010, marking a 5% rise in turnover compared to 2009 and a ninefold increase over 2002. The Port of Rijeka also serves passenger and ferry lines operated by Jadrolinija to the nearby islands of Cres, Mali Lošinj, Susak, Ilovik, Unije, Rab and Pag, {{as well as to}} Adriatic ports further south, such as Split and Dubrovnik.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{applying}} soft computing techniques, such as evolutionary computation and simulation, to {{the deployment of}} intelligent autonomous vehicles (IAVs) in <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> {{is the focus of}} this thesis. IAVs are a new type of intelligent vehicles designed for transportation of <b>containers</b> in <b>container</b> <b>terminals.</b> This thesis for the first time investigates how IAVs can be effectively accommodated in <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> and how much the performance of <b>container</b> <b>terminals</b> can be improved when IAVs are being used. In an attempt to answer the above research questions, the thesis makes the following contributions: First, the thesis studies the fleet sizing problem in <b>container</b> <b>terminals,</b> an important design problem in <b>container</b> <b>terminals.</b> The contributions include proposing a novel evolutionary algorithm (with superior results to the state-of-the-art CPLEX solver), combining the proposed evolutionary algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation to take into account uncertainties, validating results of the uncertain case with a high fidelity simulation, proposing different robustness measures, comparing different robust solutions and proposing a dynamic sampling technique to improve the performance of the proposed evolutionary algorithm. Second, the thesis studies the impact of IAVs on container terminals’ performance and total cost, which are very important criteria in port equipment. The contributions include developing simulation models using realistic data (it is {{for the first time that}} the impact of IAVs on <b>containers</b> <b>terminals</b> is investigated using simulation models) and applying a cost model to the results of the simulation to estimate and compare the total cost of the case study with IAVs against existing trucks. Third, the thesis proposes a new framework for the simulations of <b>container</b> <b>terminals.</b> The contributions include developing a flexible simulation framework, providing a user library for users to create 3 D simulation models using drag-and-drop features, and allowing users to easily incorporate their optimisation algorithms into their simulations...|$|R
