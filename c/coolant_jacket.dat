In these applications, the engine is mounted longitudinally. Displacement is 2.0 L——with a square 86 mm bore and stroke. Compression is 9.2:1 and maximum boost is 1.4 bar (20.0 psi), delivering [...] at 5300 rpm and [...] of torque from 2500 to 5250 rpm. Engine redline is at 6300 rpm and premium fuel is recommended. The sodium filled exhaust valves were based on technology developed for the Corvette V8 powertrains. The sodium fuses and becomes a liquid at idle, which improves conductivity and draws heat away from the valve face and valve guide towards the stem to be cooled by the engine oil circulating in this area. The camshaft-driven direct injection systems pressurizes the fuel to 31 bar (450 psi) at idle, and up to 155 bar (2,250 psi) at wide-open throttle. The [...] "Gen II" [...] block is similar to the 2.4 L and also features VVT technology. The Gen II block was developed using data from racing programs and computer simulations.

This project aims at understanding the coolant flow behaviour in the coolant jackets of a diesel engine and investigating the possibility of running the engine at higher coolant temperatures by predicting the temperature distribution of the structure which is required for the assessment of the durability ofthe engine components. In this thesis, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and FE (Finite Element) techniques are used to study coolant flow in the coolant jackets and to predict the temperature distribution within the engine structure respectively.

40|$|Modern IC-engines {{produce more}} power per {{displaced}} volume and operate at higher combustion pressures and temperatures. In addition, engine structure {{materials such as}} aluminium and magnesium alloys, which are more sensitive to thermal loads, are more commonly used. These two parameters might lead to problems such as thermal fatigue, knock, high fuel consumption and emissions, performance loss, bore distortion, oil consumption, noise and vibration. These may, however, be limited by careful design of well-aimed precision engine cooling strategies which provide efficient and sufficient cooling of the extremely hot regions while avoiding over-cooling of the other regions. To enable precision cooling, an accurate and quick prediction tool is needed. CFD has been used {{during the last decade}} as a tool for optimization of flow and pressure drop in the IC-engine <b>coolant</b> <b>jackets.</b> There is, however, a need to improve the CFD-methods for more accurate simulations and to extend its benefit to the prediction of the heat transfer. The goal of this work is to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} fluid flow and heat transfer mechanisms relevant to IC-engine cooling and to develop CFD methods for realistic predictions of the heat transfer coefficient for this kind of application. In this work the flow and heat transfer processes have been investigated for well known generic cases relevant to the engine cooling applications. These cases consist of confined flow in curved ducts with various cross section shapes. The performance of several turbulence models including different versions of high- and low-Reynolds number two-equation models, mostly k-epsilon models, with linear and non-linear Reynolds stress formulations and also V 2 F and RSM have been investigated. Wall functions, damping functions and a two-layer technique were used for wall treatment. Available experimental data in the literature have been used for validation of these studies. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are discussed in the thesis. The focus has been on forced convection heat transfer. The impact of parameters such as inlet boundary conditions and duct cross-section shape on the flow and heat transfer has also been studied. It was found that these parameters, especially the upstream boundary conditions have significant influence on the pressure-driven secondary flow and, thereby, the heat transfer mechanism in curved ducts. The convergence problem of V 2 F and the RSM and the physical shortcomings of linear eddy viscosity models as well as the robustness of models like Suga's cubic low-Re k-epsilon model and Chen's k-epsilon model have been discussed.

40|$|Low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) is {{a versatile}} polymer which {{is widely used}} both in domestic and industrial applications. About 50 % of commercial LDPE production {{around the world is}} carried out by free-radical polymerization initiated by organic peroxides in high-pressure tubular reactors. The free-radical polymerization is highly sensitive to even small changes in process conditions. As a result, the extreme pressures and temperatures in the high-pressure tubular LDPE reactor (HPTLR) present operational challenges to the plant engineer. A reliable model of the HPTLR will prove to be a valuable tool for the plant engineer in making decisions about reactor operations;In this work, a comprehensive dynamic model for the HPTLR has been developed for the prediction of reactor behavior. The model combines the power of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) -based modeling with the simplicity and intuition of CRE (chemical reaction engineering) -based micromixing models. The mathematical model is based on the finite-mode PDF (probability density function) approach to modeling turbulent reactive flows. The advantage of this approach is that the source terms in the model transport equations appear in closed form thus obviating the need for closure approximations which are common in (and the main shortcoming of) CRE-based reactor models. Some simplifying assumptions (which are found to be true in most cases of HPTLR operations) have been made, important among which is the assumption of fully-developed turbulent pipe flow. A two-environment model is used to describe micromixing. Free-radical mechanisms are considered for both LDPE polymerization reactions as well as ethylene decomposition reactions. Heat-transfer effects between the reactor tube and the <b>coolant</b> water <b>jacket</b> surrounding it are also considered. The resultant transport equations, which are convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) - type partial differential equations, are numerically solved using a fractional time-stepping method;Model parameters have been estimated using plant data for both steady-state and dynamic behavior.

This report summarizes work performed during year 2 of a 3 -year project. The goals included performing near-IR spectroscopy of sonoluminescence.

The MBSL cells are designed around a 20 kHz acoustic horn with replaceable titanium tips from Sonics and Materials.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an integrated methodology for the accurate {{characterization of the}} thermal behavior of internal combustion engines, with particular reference to a high performance direct injected SI engine for sport car applications. The engine is operated at full load and maximum power revving speed, which {{is known to be}} critical {{from the point of view}} of thermal stresses on the engine components. In particular, two different sets of 3 D-CFD calculations are adopted: on one side, full-cycle in-cylinder analyses are carried out to estimate the point wise thermal heat flux due to combustion on the engine components facing the combustion chamber. On the other side, full-engine multi-region CHT calculations covering the engine <b>coolant</b> <b>jacket</b> and the surrounding metal components are used to compute the point wise temperature distribution within the engine head, liner and block. An iterative procedure is then implemented in order to exchange relevant thermal data between the two modeling frameworks: at first, local gas temperatures and heat transfer coefficients from the in-cylinder simulations are applied as thermal loads to the CHT calculations; then, the resulting surface temperature maps are re-applied to the combustion chamber walls for the subsequent in-cylinder CFD analysis. The procedure is iteratively repeated until convergence is met in terms of thermal characterization of the engine. The procedure takes into account the non-uniform spatial distribution of both thermal loads from the combustion process and resulting temperature distribution on the combustion chamber walls, which are known to be particularly evident when considering direct injected stratified charged engines. The resulting thermal fields are compared to those deriving from a traditional approach for both the in-cylinder and CHT calculations, i. e. the application of uniform heat fluxes on the CHT side and the use of uniform wall temperatures on the in-cylinder side. The resulting differences are highlighted and critically discussed, with particular emphasis on those which could have a relevant impact on both the fatigue strength evaluation of the engine and the arising of local undesired phenomena such as surface ignition and knocking...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} best way to {{compensate}} for disturbances affecting the reaction temperature in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is to cascade the temperature controller of the reactants with the temperature controller of the coolant when the reaction is exothermic. However, this strategy does not always work and sometimes the cascade control will not improve the tightness of the control system. This is due to the facts that the heat transfer process is slow and that the transportation lag is longer than the time constant of the slave process in addition to a fact that the primary and secondary time constants of these processes do differ much. Therefore, the aim of this study is to see whether a cascade control is significantly effective than the normal feedback control. Two controller configurations were proposed for controlling the temperature of the reaction in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). The first configuration is the normal single feedback controller, the other configuration is to cascade the reaction temperature inside the reactor with the temperature of the <b>coolant</b> in the <b>jacket</b> round the reactor. For each configuration Frequency Analysis, Routh Array and Bode methods are applied so as to determine the best controller performance. The comparison through frequency, Routh and Bode shows that the feedback control is ever better. It gave a high gain and same period of oscillation. The study also showed a considerable difference between methods of tuning i. e., between frequency, Bode and Routh. It is recommended that for heat transfer processes such as exothermic and endothermic reactions, a single feedback controller will be as effective as the cascade controller due to the sluggishness of the response of the heat transfer process...|$|R
