50|$|This engine had {{slightly}} higher performance (exhaust temperature and specific impulse) over NERVA (the U.S. nuclear thermal rocket engine project). The {{design of the}} reactor core included thermal insulation between uranium carbide/tungsten carbide fuel and the zirconium hydride moderator. This solution allowed for a very <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> core design. Hydrogen flow cooled the moderator first allowing to keep very low neutron energy and high fission cross-section, then it was heated by the direct contact to the fuel rods.

5000|$|A marine nuclear {{propulsion}} plant must {{be designed to}} be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which {{might have to be}} undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium oxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a [...] "burnable poison" [...] in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the [...] "nuclear poison" [...] increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel is extended by providing an internal neutron shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.|$|E
5000|$|In 1952, Robert Bussard {{joined the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program. Bussard commented {{that it was}} the first time he had ever {{witnessed}} a program that was three years behind the press clippings. General morale was low; the missile and rocket people understood and preferred chemicals, and the reactor people had no regard for the idea of flight. Bussard decided to write another survey, one with rigor as a major goal. He used data and analyses from existing chemical rockets, along with specifications for existing components. All calculations were based on what was known concerning nuclear reactors at that time. C.B. Mills, a well-known reactor physicist, lent credibility to the paper, as did A.B. Longyear of Aerojet General Corporation. Most importantly, Bussard's paper did not limit itself to a specific payload or range, but rather surveyed several ranges and payload sizes. In his paper, [...] "Nuclear Energy for Rocket Propulsion", Bussard stated that the use of nuclear propulsion in rockets “is not limited by considerations of combustion energy” and thus “low molecular weight propellants such as pure hydrogen may be used.” He found that, while a combustion propulsion engine would produce “an exhaust velocity of 8300 ft/sec,” a hydrogen-fueled nuclear engine would “attain an exhaust velocity of 22,700 ft/sec at the same conditions.” Bussard’s proposal called for “a <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> built of graphite, which withstands high temperatures and actually gains strength when heated.” His study concluded that the “use of hydrogenous propellants necessitated protective coating materials,” which meant that if they were to use hydrogen as rocket fuel, then they would need to coat the reactor with certain materials. The study was published in the classified Journal of Reactor Science and Technology in December 1953.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} multi-step {{synthesis of}} 1, 2 -diphenylethane was performed sequentially in a structured <b>compact</b> <b>reactor.</b> This process involved a Heck C-C coupling reaction {{followed by the}} addition of hydrogen to perform reduction of the intermediate obtained in the first step. Both of the reactions were catalysed by microspherical carbon-supported Pd catalysts. Due to the integration of the micro-heat exchanger, the static mixer and the mesoscale packed-bed reaction channel, the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> was proven to be an intensified tool for promoting the reactions. in comparison with the batch reactor, this flow process in the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> was more efficient as: (i) the reaction time was significantly reduced (ca. 7 min versus several hours), (ii) no additional ligands were used and (iii) the reaction was run at lower operational pressure and temperature. Pd leached in the Heck reaction step was shown to be effectively recovered in the following hydrogenation reaction section and the catalytic activity of the system can be mostly retained by reverse flow operation.

40|$|A compact, structured, {{multichannel}} reactor {{was tested}} for two exemplary reactions: the selective hydrogenation of aromatic aldehyde and the tandem C-C coupling-hydrogenation. In {{the case of}} hydrogenation reaction up to 50 % yield with ca. 96 % selectivity was attained {{in a single pass}} (single channel of 10 cm length of catalytic bed) at a liquid phase residence time of ca. 10 s, proving the effectiveness of the designed reactor. By controlling the point of injection of hydrogen into the reactor an increase in the yield of hydrogenation up to 73 % was achieved using two channels in a consecutive mode. The designed <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> was also proven to be an excellent tool for kinetic studies: the kinetics of the three-phase hydrogenation was evaluated showing: (i) reaction limitation for applied reaction conditions, (ii) Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of hydrogenation, and finally (iii) the dominating role of adsorption of reactant and absorption of hydrogen in the mechanism of hydrogenation at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> was also successfully used for conducting sequential coupling Heck reaction with consecutive hydrogenation of double C-C bond. A stepwise conversion of the substrates to the final product was achieved with ca. 6 min residence time at relatively low temperature and pressure. In conclusion, the developed structured <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> was demonstrated as a promising alternative to replace conventional batch reactors and establish continuous synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates and specialty chemicals.

40|$|An {{important}} milestone on the Fast Track path to Fusion Power is {{to demonstrate}} reliable commercial application of Fusion as soon as possible. Many applications of fusion, other than electricity production, have already been studied in some depth for ITER class facilities. We show that these applications might be usefully realized on a small scale, in a Multi-Functional Compact Tokamak Reactor based on a Spherical Tokamak with similar size, but higher fields and currents than the present experiments NSTX and MAST, where performance has already exceeded expectations. The small power outputs, 20 - 40 MW, permit existing materials and technologies to be used. The analysis {{of the performance of}} the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> is based on the solution of the global power balance using empirical scaling laws considering requirements for the minimum necessary fusion power (which is determined by the optimized efficiency of the blanket design), positive power gain and constraints on the wall load. In addition, ASTRA and DINA simulations have been performed for the range of the design parameters. Our studies show that increased toroidal field in a spherical tokamak can be possibly achieved by use of commercially available high temperature superconductors. This multi-functional <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> will also contribute to the mainstream GW Fusion power concept by providing data on burning plasma, test of diagnostics, remote handling, blanket design and operation, reactor integration etc. In this paper, the motivation for the concept as well as physics and technological challenges of the multi-functional <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> are discussed.

40|$|In Japan Atomic Energy Agency, an {{innovative}} sodium cooled fast reactor of 1500 MWe class, JSFR, {{has been investigated}} on the Fast Reactor Cycle Technology Development project. A <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> vessel (R/V) and a column type upper inner structure with a radial slit for an arm of a fuel-handling machine are adopted. These result in increase of the spatial-averaged velocity on the horizontal {{cross section of the}} R/V by factor of 2. 5. These high velocities may cause gas entrainment at the free surface in the upper plenum and also the cavitations. Therefore horizontal dipped plates (D/P) are set below the free surface to prevent the gas entrainment. We performed two water experiments using an 1 / 10 th scaled full-sector model of the upper plenum of R/V and a large scaled partial model. The flow optimization in the upper plenum was performed in the full-sector model. It was observed in the large scaled model that the gas entrainment occurred under the extreme velocity conditions which were far from the rated condition in the reactor design of JSFR. Consequently, there is a chance for this design of the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> vessel to suppress the gas entrainment and cavitation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{hydrogenation}} is {{an important}} class of chemical reactions {{for the production of}} speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals. The challenges in this type of reactions are to control selectivity in hydrogenation of poly-functional molecules, and avoid the possible risk of reaction runaway due to the high exothermisity. In this project the fundamentals of liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions in a structured compact multifunctional reactor were investigated. This technology represents an advance over the existing hydrogenation technologies because it exploits the effects of reduced characteristic paths of mass and heat transfer, attained in <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> architecture with mm-scale reaction channels and integrated static mixers and micro-heat exchangers. Catalysts based on mesoporous synthetic carbons were developed especially for preparing micro-packed beds in the <b>compact</b> <b>reactor.</b> The investigation resulted in fundamental information on reactor performance for selected model reactions, heat transfer efficiency of the integrated micro-heat exchangers, development of continuous tandem reaction, and evaluation of developed catalysts for hydrogenation and hydrodehalogenation reactions under the continuous flow conditions being used. The results demonstrate that the structured compact multifunctional reactor might be a promising technology to transfer conventional heterogeneous catalysis to flow regime.

Integrated <b>compact</b> <b>reactor</b> technology should be particularly attractive to the fine chemistry and pharmaceutical industries.

Staged injection was shown to be beneficial; however, this was likely to be due to the development of a more uniform hydrodynamic regime of two-phase flow along the packed reaction channel.
