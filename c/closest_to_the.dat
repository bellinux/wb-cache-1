5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E

5|$|The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun, {{and hence}} closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, {{it is also}} the {{farthest}} above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.|$|E
5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched {{nucleic acid}} structure that contains four double-stranded arms joined together.

5|$|During {{human and}} all {{vertebrate}} development, {{a series of}} pharyngeal arch pairs form in the developing embryo. These project forward {{from the back of}} the embryo towards the front of the face and neck. Each arch develops its own artery, nerve that controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. The arches are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the arch <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head of the embryo, and the fifth arch only existing transiently.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated {{near where the}} atmosphere is <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields {{by as much as}} one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).|$|E

Some sections have been converted to concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has disappeared from the creeks, particularly those <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. Introduced species including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E

Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E

However, other researchers {{do not include the}} Akidnognathidae in the Whaitsioidea. Phylogenies by Huttenlocker et al. found that the Akidnognathidae was instead <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chthonosauridae, with the two forming the sister group to the group containing the Whaitsioidea and the Baurioidea. The topology recovered by the 2016 analysis of Huttenlocker et al. is shown below.|$|E

The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E

The feud was not news to them, for it had lurked at their scientific meetings for two decades. Most of them had already taken sides.|$|E
