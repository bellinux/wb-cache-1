The influence of temperature on the viscosity is indicated to be an important factor in bubble release and maintenance of wall thickness in thick-walled mouldings.

40|$|Compression <b>moulded</b> <b>contact</b> lenses are {{produced}} by placing fluid between two moulds and squeezing the fluid outwards to form {{the shape of the}} lens. A common problem seen in this process is that at times the fluid moves outwards asymmetrically, resulting in partially formed lenses.

A simple model with one curved surface and one flat surface is considered first. This assumption is verified by a more realistic model that investigates the effects of curvature on the dynamics of the fluid. The simple model is modified to include the effect of surface tension. The results of this model show that surface tension plays no role in the fluid dynamics for this particular fluid. A second modified model allows for lateral movement of the lower mould.

40|$|The formula {{based on}} keratometric {{readings}} {{which is generally}} used is unsatisfactory for fitting contact lenses after penetrating keratoplasty, possibly owing to lack {{of information on the}} peripheral corneal toricity. In these studies a photokeratoscope was used to examine the entire graft topography. In all cases the corneal configuration became more normal after suture removal, but a considerable toricity still remained, especially near the graft-host junction. One month after removal of sutures spherical hard contact lenses (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) were fitted to 30 patients in accordance with data obtained by computerised analysis of the photokeratograms. Of the 30 patients (contact lens wearers) 27 (90 %) obtained a stable vision of better than 20 / 30 for eight hours daily, and 24 (80 %) achieved a stable vision of 20 / 20 for their full waking hours. After one year the contact lens wearers showed a significant decrease in the extent of astigmatism when compared with the non-contact-lens wearers (10 patients). These results suggest that the photokeratoscope can be more useful than ordinary keratometers in fitting contact lenses after keratoplasty, and that hard <b>contact</b> lenses have <b>moulding</b> effects on the graft topography...|$|R

For high temperatures, the mechanical glass behaviour {{is assumed to be}} as a viscous incompressible material. Its viscosity is strongly temperature dependent and the process involves large displacements and large strains. Therefore, the finite element modelling of such a process needs to take account of large geometrical transformations. From the numerical point of view, this problem can be studied by means of a solid approach where the degrees of freedom are displacements. This modelling is highly non-linear. Moreover, the numerical convergence can be affected on account of the mechanical <b>contact</b> between the <b>mould</b> and the glass. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a linear finite element formulation for 3 D glass forming where the degrees of freedom are velocity and hydrostatic pressure.

Models are formed and compared with experimental measurements to enable clarification of the glass properties that {{should be used in}} the optimisation process and have been suggested in previous {{research work}}s. Two cases of heat transfer are considered in the models firstly the case of both conductive and radiative are present and then the case of radiative (reheat). The models developed during the study are based on one-dimensional heat transfer. The model is based on the period of the formation process starting from {{the point at which the}} molten glass is brought into <b>contact</b> with a <b>mould</b> until the time at which the formed glass is inverted. The models are concerned with the changes in temperature profile during this period at both the centre and the surface of the glass depending on the mode of heat transfer considered, the properties of the glass, and the properties of the tooling. The properties of the glass considered in the models include the absorption coefficient, refractive index, heat transfer coefficient, internal and external emissivity, specific heat and conductivity. In the radiation case the modelling results show the internal emissivity has a little effect on the surface temperature while the external emissivity has an effect temperature fall.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{simulate}} the two-dimensional, transient and continuous heat transfer during the thermoset Automated Tape Laying (ATL) process. The heat transfer analysis is coupled with a cure kinetics model of the thermoset prepreg tapes used for the process. Unlike most studies, the process is modelled in a Lagrangian framework and is based on the realistic boundary conditions of the ATL such as the stepwise laying down of the tapes. The model results provide information about the temperature values at any time and any location inside the thermoset composite tapes. The temperature simulation results of the model were compared with experiments. Three layers of unidirectional prepreg tapes were laid down on an aluminium mould by the TU Delft ATL machine. The experimental results were obtained from thermocouples and pyrometers placed at various locations in the lay-up and on the robotic head, respectively. The comparison between the numerical and experimental results generated three main findings. First, the pyrometer values and the thermocouple values provide insight into how important is the <b>contact</b> between the <b>mould</b> and the first layer. Secondly, the temperature fading out which was witnessed by the thermocouple measurements and could not entirely be captured by the model provided information about the influence of the heat transfer coefficients on the model predictions. Thirdly, the peak temperature magnitudes of the numerical predictions appeared to generally compare well with the experimental results. Overall, the code can be used for different parameter values such as different line speed, heated length and power of the heat source and, can predict the temperature distribution inside the composite.

40|$|Methods for the {{assessment}} of curved, rotationally symmetric surfaces in three dimensions are developed and outlined in this thesis. The assessment of electrical switching <b>contacts,</b> <b>contact</b> lens <b>moulds</b> and aspherical leps surfaces is demonstrated. Discrete data for surface assessment is obtained by surface measurement with a profilometer. Hence, surface measurement refers to simultaneous measurement of surface form and surface irregularity. The data is defined in a Cartesian co-ordinate system, and a data set consists of up to 27, 000 discrete points on an uniform grid. The grid spacing in x and y is typically between 25 um and 125 um. The resolution of the data in the vertical axis is lOnm (Inm = 10 " 9 metre). The key aspects of the research are as follows: A method for data interpretation is proposed. The method is primarily intended to simplify surface assessment of aspherical surfaces. It consists of three key elements: pre-processing, form characterisation and data decomposition into error types. Pre-processing detects the position and orientation of a surface. The surface is then aligned and a separation of surface geometry from position and orientation is achieved. For pre-processing four algorithms are developed, outlined and compared. Form characterisation of rotationally symmetric, aspherical surfaces is then considered. A least squares method is used to fit discrete data to a general solution function in explicit notation. Various problems related to form characterisation with explicit functions are addressed and solutions are presented. Finally, methods for data decomposition into error types are presented. A standardised decomposition method (BS-ISO 10110 - 5) is compared with an alternative method that is developed in this research. General recommendations for the measurement and {{the assessment}} of aspherical surfaces are given. A method for the selection of a form characterisation algorithm {{for the assessment}} of nominally spherical surfaces is proposed. Many different sphere fitting algorithms are reported in literature and the best-fit parameters, centre co-ordinates and radius, vary on the same set of discrete data with the algorithm that is used for form characterisation. Five sphere fitting algorithms are investigated in this research: linear and non-linear least squares sphere fit, minimum zone sphere fit, four-point sphere fit and sphere fit by error curve analysis. In conclusion to the investigation it is proposed to use the surface irregularity distribution as a criteria for the selection of a sphere fitting algorithm. The data sampling strategy, distribution of discrete points within a segment and size and location of a segment on a surface, is also investigated. General recommendations for the measurement and the assessment of nominally spherical surfaces are given. The idea of computer aided surface assessment (CASA) is evolved. In CASA, data visualisation and data interpretation are combined for processing of discrete data from the measurement of a surface.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{physical}} and chemical properties of mould fluxes are important to the successful operation of continuous casting machines. The principal role of mould fluxes is to provide lubrication between the solidifying steel and the mould but mould fluxes also significantly influence heat transfer between the stand and the mould. Heat extraction from the steel being cast has a marked effect {{on the quality of the}} final product and several defects in cast products can be related to mould flux performance. Heat transfer in mould flux is complicated by the fact that the flux partially solidifies when in <b>contact</b> with the <b>mould.</b> Different rates of solidification of mould fluxes and the resultant structures are critical to the heat transfer characteristics of the mould. Mould fluxes are largely made up of oxides which can form crystalline or glassy solids on cooling from a melt, depending on composition and cooling rate. It is known that heat transfer in a crystalline material differs from heat transfer in the glassy or liquid form of the same material due to the differing heat transfer mechanisms operating in each state. In order to understand heat transfer through mould flux, it is essential to understand the contribution of liquid, glassy, and crystalline structures to the overall heat transfer. This in turn requires an understanding of the solidification behaviour of mould fluxes. Until recently, this knowledge has been based mostly on empirical studies, though more recent research has attempted to relate observed crystallization and glass forming phenomena to fundamental principles. Special techniques have been developed to study mould flux solidification, however, the thermal conditions and the mould flux structures' obtained during casting are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Methods such as differential thermal analysis, quench tests, high temperature microscopy, single and double hot thermocouple techniques, confocal microscopy and others have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to quantify crystallization and glass formation in mould fluxes.

40|$|It {{is known}} that a newly formed glass {{container}} will only possess a very small fraction of its theoretical strength. This suggests that damage occurs {{on the surface of}} the glass melt during the forming process due to glass to <b>mould</b> <b>contact</b> and hot glass handling. It might be expected that any damage inflicted on the surface of a glass article during manufacture would heal at the elevated manufacturing temperatures used, however this does not appear to be true. Therefore, the actual mechanism by which glass strength is reduced during forming needs to be fully understood and the work presented in this thesis addresses this problem. Experiments, therefore, have been carried out here which simulate the formation of glass articles using an experimental pressing rig by systematically altering processing parameters such as the mould material, surface fmish of the mould, pressing temperature and atmosphere. Processing parameters that are used industrially for the formation of glass containers were generally reproduced wherever possible in order to investigate the glass-to-mould interaction. The interaction of both a cast iron mould material and carbon-carbon composite materials with a soda-lime-silica glass were examined using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in order to determine the type and extent of surface damage formed. The surfaces of the pressed glass samples made were found to contain defects of embedded particles and indented dimples. The embedded particles found were usually due to bulk material transfer from the plunger material used. The texture found {{on the surface of the}} pressed glass samples was found to be directly affected by the surface fmish of the plunger. Pressing glass samples using a cast iron plunger at an initial plunger temperature below 450 °C resulted in a randomly rippled 'chilled' surface. As the initial temperature of the plunger was increased, the surface texture of the pressed glass became a closer replica of the plunger surface. The use of vacuum assistance to form the glass samples also resulted in the surface of the pressed glass becoming a closer replica of the original plunger surface, even at lower pressing temperatures. The surfaces of the cast iron and carbon-carbon composite plungers appeared to have been affected by the initial plunger temperatures used. As the initial pressing temperature was increased, the amount of oxidation for both material types increased. In the case of the carbon-carbon composite materials investigated, both the matrix and fibres were found to have broken down at the pressing temperatures used. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, of the pressed glass surfaces and the plunger materials indicated that sodium ions had migrated from the glass melt to the plunger surface during forming...|$|R
40|$|In die casting, heat {{transfer}} {{is controlled by}} the properties of the casting-die interface, due to the high thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the die. Higher {{heat transfer}} rates result in higher productivity in the die casting process along with finer microstructure with superior part qualities. In die casting processes, the use of numerical simulation to predict the mould filling, solidification, and the distribution of temperature in the die has become an important development in foundry technology and cast product developments. The effectiveness of the simulation is dependent on the accuracy of the heat transfer data at the metal-mould boundary used in the simulation software. For these reasons, accurate knowledge about the heat transfer between the casting and the die during the die casting process has become an important issue for most researchers in this field. This investigation studies the interfacial heat transfer during the casting and solidification of light alloys in Gravity (GDC) and High Pressure (HPDC) Die Casting processes. Suitable experimental methods and sensors have been developed that enable the measurement of temperatures, in-cavity pressure and a range of process parameters. Heat Transfer Gauges have been manufactured, accurately calibrated and integrated into the dies for both investigated processes. These gauges measure the casting surface temperature with a pyrometric chain and the temperature through the die wall at different depths with very thin K-type thermocouples. Extensive industrial trials were performed using Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg, A- 9 Si- 3 Cu and AZ 91 D alloys. From the temperature measurements, the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) and heat flux density (q) at the casting-die interface have been evaluated using an inverse method. The obtained results have been correlated with the process parameters and to the microstructure of the castings for some selected cases. In GDC, the results show that the applied coating on the die surface governs the heat transfer during solidification of the casting through its low effective thermal conductivity. The effective thermal conductivity of the coating is determined by the high level of porosity in its structure. For this reason, its chemical composition has a very limited influence on the peak value of heat transfer. However, the coating composition does influence the variation of the heat transfer coefficient with time during solidification. The variation of HTC at the castingdie interface has been divided into three main stages according to the conditions of contact during casting and solidification: liquid-solid, semisolid-solid and solid-solid contact. The HTC at each of these stages is dominated by different process parameters. A secondary peak {{in the evolution of the}} HTC has been observed at the end of the semisolid-solid stage. This secondary peak was attributed to the exudation of solute rich eutectic liquid onto the surface region of the casting enabling fresh liquid <b>contact</b> with the <b>mould</b> coating. In HPDC the value of the HTC is much larger than that determined in GDC ((105 Wm- 2 K- 1 compared to 103 Wm- 2 K- 1 in GDC). The variation of HTC with time is also very rapid since the heat flux density is much greater than that in GDC. The rapid variation of the HTC is attributed to the degradation of contact between the casting and the die occurring during solidification. The second stage velocity and the impact pressure caused by the sudden deceleration of the piston as the cavity was filled have a significant influence on the interfacial heat transfer during HPDC. This impact pressure is different from the intensification pressure which is applied during the third stage of the casting process. The values of the peak heat transfer coefficient showed no dependence on intensification pressure in our trials. Analytical models have been developed to predict the thermal contact resistance (TCR) at the liquid-solid interface in general. Contact topography and interface characteristics are included in the model through die surface roughness and the mean trapped air layer between the casting and the die. The mean trapped air layer is determined from the mechanisms of contact at the liquid-solid interface. Two different contact mechanisms have been considered; liquid-porous solid and liquid-non porous solid contact. In the liquid-non porous case, the air is trapped and compressed inside the microcavities. However, when the solid surface is porous, the air is not trapped and can escape through the pores. In this situation, the contact conditions are determined by the pressure, surface tension of the liquid and the surface roughness characteristics of the die or coating. The proposed models determine the radius and the density of the microcontact points for a given condition of contact. The density and the radius of contact spots have been integrated into a classical thermal flux tube theory in order to calculate HTC at the casting-die interface. The models have been applied to the casting-die interface in GDC and HPDC. The calculated TCR is found to agree well with the experimentally determined results. The models provide valuable information about the role of the casting-die interface in heat transfer during GDC and HPDC processes. The results show that the effect of the measured parameters such as pressure and roughness on the HTC at the casting-die depends on the mechanisms of contact. For HPDC, the evolution of the HTC with time has been associated with the presence of a rapidly solidified region on the casting surface which forms early during solidification due to the high thermal gradient. However, in GDC the relatively low thermal gradients are associated with microstructures more consistent with the formation of a mushy zone across the casting...|$|R

Slumped glass foils are also considered as substrates for X-ray optics being developed in other projects; for example, the X-ray Surveyor mission being developed at SAO/CfA in USA, and the AXYOM project being developed in Italy. They both foresee the use of piezo-electric actuators to correct the shape errors of the mirrors. The Brera Astronomical Observatory (INAF-OAB, Merate - Italy) has been working, from 2009 till 2013, under ESA contract aimed to develop in Europe a Slumped Glass Optics (SGO) technology, alternative to the one based on silicon pores, and based on the slumping of thin glass foils, in parallel to the work being carried out at NASA/GSFC and other institutes. The INAFOAB innovation is the use of pressure in the hot slumping process to replicate the mould figure. This technology is coupled with an integration process able to damp low frequency errors. My Ph. D. activity, carried out at the INAF-OAB, is devoted to the advancement in the hot slumping technology assisted by pressure, for the production of glass mirrors for future X-ray telescopes. As a preliminary work, I have developed a new method to precisely characterise the mid frequency errors of the glass foils. An existing model, developed by Jimenez-Garate in 2003 to account for the relaxation of ripples in the slumped glass foil when in contact with the slumping mould, was modified to include the application of pressure, and the model was compared to the experimental results. The pressure was found to be essential, also from the the theory viewpoint, to reduce mid-frequency errors in the profile of slumped glass foils, which crucially degrade the performances of the optics. As for the slumping process, I have introduced a new glass material (Corning Eagle XG) combined with the Schott Zerodur K 20, already chosen at earlier times as slumping mould material for its anti-sticking properties. I have developed cleaning protocols, used different thermal cycles and different pressures conditions, and reconditioned the pressure control system. I have also optimised the mould height with experiments based on Finite Element Analysis, and reduced the thermal gradients inside the mould and the glass foils. The final result obtained in this research are slumped glass foils with angular resolution improved from the initial 7 arcsec to 2. 2 ± 0. 3 arcsec in single reflection, as expected from metrology at 1 keV X-ray energy and 0. 7 incidence angle, and computed by simulating a perfect integration. This result has to be compared with 2 arcsec defined as the error budget allocated for the slumped glass foils. About 1 arcsec is due to replication of the mid-frequency errors in the slumping mould which, owing to the improved result in the slumping, are now a limiting factor in the quality of the slumped glass foils. From the roughness point of view, the contribution to the HEW is guaranteed to be less then 1 arcsec at 1 keV, with an rms improvement from 21 to 11 Å throughout my Ph. D. Moreover, the last tests carried out proved that the roughness of the slumped glass foils can be further reduced to _ 7 Å, making the technology attractive also for higher X-ray energies and higher incidence angles. The glass foils slumped during this Ph. D. have been used for the production of two SGO Proof Of Concept prototypes (POC) for the ATHENA mission: the POC# 3, (with 2 glass foils assembled) is characterised by HEW value of 5. 5 arcsec at 0. 27 keV in the best portion of the module, as tested at the PANTER facility; the POC# 4 (with 8 glass foils) has expected HEW of about 15 arcsec from metrological data, but the result in X-ray was much higher because of accidental problems during the integration. The next prototype, the POC# 5 (with the best eight glass foils produced during my Ph. D. activity), will soon be integrated and tested in X-rays, to assess the improvement already proven by metrology and simulations. Some of the produced slumped glass foils have also been used for studies of active profile corrections with piezoelectric elements, both for the AXYOM project and X-ray Surveyor mission. Alternative materials and techniques have been used in this research to further improve the result. To reduce the surface micro-roughness of the slumped glass foils, I have proven that the slumping technique with pressure application can also be suited in the indirect slumping, in which the optical surface of the glass is not in <b>contact</b> with the <b>mould,</b> thus preserving its initial surface smoothness. Moreover, the dip coating technique was studied to fill the micro-pores present {{on the surface of the}} glass foils slumped with the direct technique. Alternative materials for the slumping mould were tested, defining Si 3 N 4 as a very promising candidate, owing to its higher rigidity with respect to Zerodur K 20 and therefore preferable to avoid mould deformations with the slumping, as experienced with K 20. The Gorilla glass (normally used for smartphones and tablets), was proven to preserve the surface quality of the glass foils, once slumped and chemically tempered to increase the mirror endurance against the vibrations experienced at launch. Finally, I have also studied the scattering and the reflectivity properties of multilayer coatings for X-ray optics. I have upgraded an IDL code to simulate the roughness growth in the multilayer deposition process, extending the computations from periodic to the more general case of graded multilayers. I have also contributed to the X-ray measurements at the BEAR beamline of the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, on multilayers deposited on glass, silicon and electroformed nickel, for the polarimetric LAMP projec...|$|R
