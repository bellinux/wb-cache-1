25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, {{parboiled}} rice (also known as <b>converted</b> <b>rice)</b> {{is subjected to}} a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.|$|E

While in the United Kingdom, Mars learned of Erich Huzenlaub's work with rice. Huzenlaub's London based company was Rice Conversion, Ltd. The two {{eventually}} formed Mars and Huzenlaub in Houston, Texas, which gave Forrest Mars partial ownership of the Huzenlaub Process rice conversion patent. In 1942, through Mars's guidance and sponsorship, Huzenlaub created, together with Houston food broker Gordon L. Harwell, the company <b>Converted</b> <b>Rice,</b> Inc., which sold its entire output to the U.S. and British Armed Forces. The advantage of this product was that it could be air-dropped to troops in the field without risk of weevil infestation, and it could be cooked more quickly than other rice products. Additionally, the <b>converted</b> <b>rice</b> product would retain more nutritional value. In 1944, with additional financing from the Defense Plant Corporation and an investment by Forrest Mars, it built a second large plant. In 1959, Forrest Mars purchased Erich Huzenlaub's interest in the company and merged it into his Food Manufacturers, Inc..|$|E

50|$|Developments {{regarding}} {{the research and}} technology of Philippine agriculture are currently in the works. Most of the researches are inclined in solving the problem of increasing hunger in the country by creating a more efficient and cheaper process of yielding produce. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is an international research consortium, including the Philippines, which serves to improve the rice production and quality through biotechnology and research. One of their ongoing research involves changing the normal C3 carbon fixation mechanism of rice into a supercharged photosynthetic mechanism, C4 carbon fixation. <b>Converting</b> <b>rice</b> from a C3 plant into a C4 plant would be beneficial because the latter can efficiently produce more yield than the former in a given and limited amount of resources (land, water, and fertilizer) which bodes well to the Philippines' situation. IRRI have made calculations which shows that <b>converting</b> <b>rice</b> into a C4 plant would increase the yield at around 30-50%, demonstrating a double water-use efficiency, and providing more at less fertilizer usage. Other rice varieties {{have been developed to}} increase efficiency without sacrificing the quality too much. PSB Rc26H (Magat), PSB Rc72H (Mestizo), and PSB Rc76H (Panay) are some of the rice hybrids developed but only Mestizo is currently available for planting. The texture and taste quality of Mestizo is comparable to the normal grain, IR64.|$|R
50|$|Parboiled rice (also called <b>converted</b> <b>rice)</b> is rice {{that has}} been {{partially}} boiled in the husk. The three basic steps of parboiling are soaking, steaming and drying.

The process consisted first in vacuum drying the whole grain, then steaming, and finally vacuum drying and husking. Besides increasing rice's nutritional value, it also made it resistant to weevils and reduced cooking time. Erich Huzenlaub visited a number of rice millers in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi in 1942. He met American entrepreneur and food broker Gordon Harwell, who was in contact with Forrest Mars Sr.. They financed and built up a plant for paraboiled rice in Houston, Texas, in which paraboiled rice was made after the Huzenlaub Process.|$|E

40|$|Rice {{fields are}} an {{important}} habitat for waterbirds. Knowledge {{of the availability of}} this habitat is important since the reduction in the area of natural wetlands has <b>converted</b> <b>rice</b> fields into vital refuges. This paper presents a method for mapping habitat availability in rice fields according to different waterbirds’ habitat preferences and examining its phenology during the crop cycle. Data from bird censuses carried out in the Doñana rice fields were analysed to determine the habitat preferences of 22 species of waterbird at different stages in the rice production cycle. Discriminant function analysis of seven Landsat images was used to classify paddy field stages. The phenology of habitat availability in rice fields during autumn and winter was examined. Waterfowl and waders preferentially used the ‘flooded’ and ‘mudflats with water’ paddy field stages, respectively, and the ‘rice growing’ and ‘dry’ stages were rejected by waterbirds. The area of preferred habitats within rice fields increased during autumn; subsequently, the area of the ‘flooded’ paddy fields decreased in January, whereas that of ‘mudflats with water’ remained available until March. The automatic classification of paddy field stages with Landsat images allowed habitat availability for different species of waterbirds to be monitored and provides relevant information for understanding behavioural and population responses in waterbirds that use rice fields. After examining the phenology of the availability of habitat and comparing it with dates of arrival and departure of migrant waterbirds, best crop practices could be defined to favour waterbirds (i. e. adjusting harvest, ploughing and flooding dates). Taking into account climatic change and loss of wetlands this method could help in the integration of agriculture and conservation, in particular in areas where there is no remaining natural wetland habitat.

The effects of <b>converting</b> double <b>rice</b> cropping to vegetables on CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were examined using a static chamber method in southern China from July 2012 to July 2013. The results indicate that CH 4 fluxes could reach 31. 6 mg C m- 2 h- 1 under rice before land conversion. The cumulative CH 4 emissions for fertilized and unfertilized rice were 348. 9 and 321. 0 kg C ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively. After the land conversion, the cumulative CH 4 emissions were - 0. 4 and 1. 4 kg C ha- 1 yr- 1 for the fertilized and unfertilized vegetable fields, respectively. Similarly, the cumulative N 2 O fluxes under rice were 1. 27 and 0. 56 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 for the fertilized and unfertilized treatments before the land conversion and 19. 2 and 8. 5 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, after the land conversion. By combining the global warming potentials (GWPs) of both gases, the overall land-use conversion effect was minor (P = 0. 36) with fertilization, but the conversion reduced GWP by 63 % when rice and vegetables were not fertilized.

Results: The obtained results showed that at the first of composting process, the temperature was sharply increased and after that dropped and reached to the ambient temperature. The C/N ratio was decreased in studied Diy beds during preparing and vermicompost processes.
