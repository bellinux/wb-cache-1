40|$|The use of Diels Alder cycloaddition {{chemistries}} {{to access}} a {{diverse range of}} useful cyclic structures is well established throughout literature. However, {{the value of the}} product may be enhanced further still by linking this reaction with subsequent (biocatalytic) steps to create novel, structurally demanding, optically pure compounds. This project investigates the linking of Diels Alder (DA) chemistry to the enzyme, transketolase (TK) as a model integration pathway of a chemical syntheses and a biological transformation. The two-step process aims to provide a framework to synthesise small structurally diverse compounds with high enantiomeric excess. The demand for optically pure compounds is becoming a necessity due to the adverse affects frequently introduced by racemic compounds and the cost implications of the material possessing often only 50 % active compound. Recombinant wild type Eschericha coli transketolase (EC 2. 2. 1. 1) (WT-TK) was overexpressed in E. coli for the biocatalytic step of this two step synthesis. A substrate walking approach whereby a range of sequentially linked cyclic aldehydes, were applied to wild type transketolase and potential activity detected. Transketolase mutants, previously constructed based on information derived from the structural position within the active site of the dimeric enzyme were subsequently screened for activity with the cycloadduct of the Diels Alder reaction as aldehyde acceptor substrate for TK. Following identification, selection, culturing and sequencing of variants indicating enhanced activity towards the novel, bulky, hydrophobic, <b>cyclic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> the enantioselectivity and absolute stereochemistry of the product were determined. Activity displayed by wild type transketolase indicated an 18, 000 fold activity improvement. Michaelis- Menten kinetic parameters were subsequently determined to have an apparent Km of 69. 9 mM, kcat of 17. 5 s- 1 and a vmax of 0. 07 mM. min- 1 and preliminary process compatibility including product and substrate inhibition issues were highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 8670 - 8680 The {{presence}} of carbonyl compounds (CCs) in wines has sparked {{the interest of}} researchers in several countries. The quantification {{of some of these}} compounds {{has been used as a}} parameter of quality for many fermented beverages. Although present in minute quantities (except for acetaldehyde), they have a strong olfactory impact. In addition, the CCs found in wines have a strong affinity for bisulfite and can form stable adducts, which will also interfere in the characteristics of aroma. The greatest challenge, however, is to predict which CCs have the strongest affinity for S(IV) and what conditions favor this interaction. To better understand the reaction of CC–bisulfite adduct formation (HASA), this study has evaluated the profile of 22 CCs in a “synthetic wine” containing bisulfite and in 10 real samples of different wines from the São Francisco Valley, northeastern Brazil. On the basis of principal component analysis (PCA) and dissociation constants, the results revealed that aliphatic aldehydes form adducts with S(IV), whereas ketones, <b>cyclic</b> <b>aldehydes,</b> and trans-alkenes interact weakly and are found predominantly in their free form. These results revealed also that pH 10 and 11 were defined as the most appropriate for CC–SO 2 adduct dissociation, and the total CCs were quantified reliably...|$|R

40|$|Background Fermentation of {{bioethanol}} using lignocellulosic biomass as a {{raw material}} provides a sustainable alternative to current biofuel production methods by utilising waste food streams as raw material. Before lignocellulose can be fermented it requires physical, chemical and enzymatic treatment {{in order to}} release monosaccharides, a process that causes the chemical transformation of glucose and xylose into the <b>cyclic</b> <b>aldehydes</b> furfural and hydroxyfurfural. These furan compounds are potent inhibitors of Saccharomyces fermentation, and consequently furfural tolerant strains of Saccharomyces are required for lignocellulosic fermentation. Results This study investigated yeast tolerance to furfural and hydroxyfurfural using a collection of 71 environmental and industrial isolates of the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its closest relative Saccharomyces paradoxus. The Saccharomyces strains were initially screened for growth on media containing 100 mM glucose and 1. 5 mg ml- 1 furfural. Five strains were identified that showed a significant tolerance to growth {{in the presence of}} furfural and these were then screened for growth and ethanol production in the presence of increasing amounts (0. 1 - 4 mg ml- 1) of furfural. Conclusions Of the five furfural tolerant strains S. cerevisiae NCYC 3451 displayed the greatest furfural resistance, and was able to grow in the presence of up to 3. 0 mg ml- 1 furfural. Furthermore, ethanol production in this strain {{did not appear to be}} inhibited by furfural, with the highest ethanol yield observed at 3. 0 mg ml- 1 furfural. Although furfural resistance was not found to be a trait specific to any one particular lineage or population, three of the strains were isolated from environments where they might be continually exposed to low levels of furfural through the on-going natural degradation of lignocelluloses, and would therefore develop elevated levels of resistance to these furan compounds. Thus these strains represent good candidates for future studies of genetic variation relevant to understanding and manipulating furfural resistance and in the development of tolerant ethanologenic yeast strains for use in bioethanol production from lignocellulose processing...|$|R

40|$|The enzyme {{transketolase}} (TK) (EC 2. 2. 1. 1) catalyses a reversible asymmetric carboncarbon bond forming reaction, where a two carbon ketose donor {{is transferred}} to an aldose acceptor. The use of hydroxypyruvate (HPA), a non-phosphorylated ketol donor with subsequent loss of carbon dioxide renders the reaction irreversible generating the dihydroxyketone product. Several years ago the TK gene from the plasmid of E. coli (BJ 502 /pKD 112 A) was incorporated into a high copy plasmid leading to the overexpression of the protein in E. coli, a suitable host for industrial processes. The TK condensation of HPA with glycoladehyde and propanal, in analogous but separate experiments, has been described in the literature. The on-going development of the enzyme TK as a practical biocatalyst performed {{on a small scale}} recently led to the discovery of the first biomimetic TK reaction. The aims of the PhD project were principally two-fold; to explore both biomimetic and biocatalytic routes to α,α’-dihydroxyketones. Firstly, investigation of the new one pot synthesis of racemic dihydroxyketones; in terms of substrate scope of the reaction, including aromatic, aliphatic hydrophobic aldehydes as substrates. Donors other than hydroxypyruvate (HPA) were also investigated to assess the general synthetic utility of the reaction. Reaction optimisation studies and preliminary mechanistic studies were performed. In addition, investigations into the development of an asymmetric organocatalytic reaction were pursued. Secondly, libraries of TK mutants were also screened against a range of non-natural substrates. A colorimetric assay for screening active mutants in a 96 well plate format was used to identify sucessfully a number of active mutants with enhanced substrate specificity towards novel cyclic and aromatic acceptor molecules, as well as being used for determining initial rate velocities. A chiral assay as a means to determine the absolute stereochemistry, using chiral derivatising agents (CDAs) was established which was used with HPLC for successful characterisation of the dihydroxyketone motifs. Chapter 1 of this thesis is an introduction to the important role of thiamine dependent enzymes in synthesis, in particular transketolase: the structure, mechanism and its usage in industry is covered. Chemical synthetic routes to ketodiol motifs are also mentioned.

The differences between the aldehyde to ketone ratios for a series of S-O isomers, where the aryl substituent changes, has been rationalized in terms of the mmigratory aptitude of the aryl group.
