25|$|Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, {{who was one}} of {{the fathers}} of <b>cellular</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{developed}} in 1931–1949 years the so-called Fresh cell therapy. Fresh cell therapy is mainly the use of live animal embryo organs cells which are injected into the patient with the purpose of achieving a revitalizing effect. These cells are generally extracted from sheep’s fetuses because in comparison to other animals, like pigs, rabbits and cows, sheep are clean animals and rarely contact diseases. Of course animal cells are not able to be included in human tissue, but they can secrete factors for rejuvenating. That's why this rejuvenation technology, despite the harsh criticism is practiced to this day.|$|E

Currently <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies,</b> such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are produced at a small scale on a case-by-case basis, usually in a clinical or near-clinical setting. Meeting the demand for future <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies</b> will require a robust and scalable manufacturing process that is either designed around or controls the variation associated with biological starting materials. Understanding variation requires both {{a measure of the}} allowable variation (that does not negatively affect patient outcome) and the achievable variation (with current technology).

40|$|AbstractAmyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{and spinal}} muscular atrophy (SMA) are prototypical motor neuron diseases that result in progressive weakness {{as a result of}} motor neuron dysfunction and death. Though much work has been done in both diseases to identify the cellular mechanisms of motor neuron dysfunction, once motor neurons have died, one of potential therapies to restore function would be through the use of cellular transplantation. In this review, we discuss potential strategies whereby <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies,</b> including the use of stem cells, neural progenitors and cells engineered to secrete trophic factors, may be used in motor neuron diseases. We review pre-clinical data in rodents with each of these approaches and discuss advances and regulatory issues regarding the use of <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies</b> in human motor neuron diseases...|$|R

These cells are being looked at by scientists as a new and more effiecient way to treat diseases of the liver particularly because of the problem arising from a lack of liver donors.

40|$|The 2007 report {{describes}} {{the current status}} of HSCT activity in Europe, highlights the increasing role of allogeneic HSCT in treatment of AML and gives the first quantitative information on novel <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies.</b> In 2007, there were 25 563 first HSCTs, 10 072 allogeneic (39 %), 15 491 autologous (61 %) and 3606 additional transplants reported from 613 centers in 42 countries. The main indications were leukemias (8061 (32 %; 89 % allogeneic)); lymphomas (14 627 (57 %; 89 % autologous)), solid tumors (1488 (6 %; 96 % autologous)) and nonmalignant disorders (1302 (5 %; 91 % allogeneic)). Peripheral blood was the main source of stem cells for autologous HSCT (98 %) and the predominant source for allogeneic HSCT (71 %). Among allogeneic HSCTs, the number of unrelated donor grafts equaled the number of HLA-identical sibling donor grafts for the first time (47 % each). AML was the most frequent indication for allogeneic HSCT (32 % of all allogeneic HSCTs), with an increase of 247 (8 %). Information on novel <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies</b> was collected for the first time; there were 212 mesenchymal SCTs and 212 HSCTs for nonhematopoietic use. The indications for the latter were cardiovascular disorders (97; 46 %), neurological disorders (94; 44 %) and tissue repair (21; 10 %).

40|$|Problem statement: Organ {{transplantation}} is a life-saving {{and increasingly}} common procedure, as it often {{serves as the}} only treatment available for end-stage organ disease. Although the constant development of new and more effective immunosuppressive drugs has revolutionized the prevention and treatment of acute graft rejection, these drugs have significant toxicity, greatly increase patient susceptibility to neoplasms and infection and exert little impact on chronic rejection. Approach: The literature was reviewed to illuminate the mechanisms by which the anti-donor immune response is initiated and how <b>cellular</b> <b>therapies</b> impact this response. Results: Data show that Donor Specific Transfusion, Apoptotic Cell therapies and Dendritic Cell therapies all function {{as a source of}} alloantigen to suppress the anti-donor T cell response. Conclusion: <b>Cellular</b> <b>therapies</b> hold promise in the prevention of solid organ allograft rejection, but require optimization and study in large animal models before clinical implementation. ...|$|R
