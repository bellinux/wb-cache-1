5000|$|The <b>sleeve</b> <b>carried</b> {{the motto}} [...] "Dedicated to the {{original}} spirit of the Olympic Games" [...] as the single was released {{at the start of}} the 1984 Summer Olympics. The extended version, subtitled [...] "International Remix", featured Jones singing in English, German and French.|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{feature is the}} stationary slotted sleeve valve enclosing the single combustion chamber, and its co-axial slotted <b>sleeve</b> <b>carried</b> by the rotating cylinder barrel. This feature enables the charging air to enter the combustion chamber and allows evacuation later of the products of combustion to the expander cylinders and pistons.|$|R
50|$|And for its color, {{let it be}} that of {{the lion}} - a golden sable, to be <b>carried</b> in the <b>sleeve</b> of a yellow robe; or the colour of a red bear, or {{a black and white}} bear, or striped like a dragon, so that there may be dogs {{appropriate}} to every costume in the Imperial wardrobe.|$|R
50|$|The title makes {{references}} to old science fiction magazines (Astounding and Amazing Stories), the concept being that {{each piece of}} music (and its title) would be interpreted as an individual science fiction story. The record cover is a parody of the cover of these magazines, while the inner <b>sleeve</b> <b>carried</b> small ads, with each band member having their own product (e.g. Dr Brock's cure for piles, Paul Rudolph's Manly Strapon, and Simon King's Pleasure Primer).|$|R
5000|$|George {{talks to}} his campus-psychiatrist friend, who observes Barbara {{at a party}} and tells George of a {{specialist}} he knows. Barbara agrees that something may be wrong. After many tests, the specialist concludes {{through the process of}} elimination that Barbara has Alzheimer's. In an effort to cope with a mind that is constantly losing things, Barbara begins to put labels, instructions, and reminders, everywhere—on bottles, doors, the telephone. George discovers a note she has been <b>carrying</b> up her <b>sleeve.</b> On it, Barbara has written [...] "George".|$|R
5000|$|According to Robert van Gulik, {{the common}} use of [...] "loaded sleeves" [...] {{facilitated}} an unexpected escape {{for a group}} of foreign nuns threatened by a mob during an anti-Western uprising in China. The cornered nuns, believing {{they were going to be}} killed, reportedly raised their hands to pray. The people standing nearest incorrectly identified the bulky objects in the upraised folds of cloth, interpreting them to be dangerous Loaded Sleeves. They backed away, opening a path through the crowd, and the nuns escaped. The bulky objects were, in fact, their breviaries, which the nuns habitually <b>carried</b> in the <b>sleeves</b> of their robes.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 was a {{challenging}} {{year for the}} band. Franco's health was in obvious decline. He had by now moved permanently to Brussels. He did not play much and when he did, could only manage about twenty minutes. The band started to fall apart with the defection of Malage de Lugendo and Dizzy and Decca who returned to Kinshasa to pursue other opportunities. Later that year Sam Mangwana teamed with Franco to release the album Forever. The album <b>sleeve</b> <b>carried</b> a photograph of Franco who appeared emanciated, and obviously in ill-health. It {{turned out to be}} Franco's last album.|$|R
50|$|Remington derringers often played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the exploits of James T. West, fictional Secret Service agent, in the American television series The Wild Wild West (1965 - 1969). West carried up to three derringers: one as a concealed carry backup gun to his holstered and openly carried full sized revolver. This derringer was carried either in a vest pocket or an inside pocket of his jacket. Another derringer was <b>carried</b> as a <b>sleeve</b> gun under his right shirt sleeve, and the third was broken into two parts with the barrel-chamber assembly hidden in the hollowed out heel of one boot and the frame hidden in the heel of the other.|$|R
50|$|The {{fit of the}} {{surgical}} splint is clinically proved. After that, the splint is attached using a three-point support pin system. Prior to the attachment, irrigation with a chemical disinfectant is advised. The pins are driven through defined sheaths from the vestibular to the oral side of the jaw. Ligaments anatomy should be considered, and if necessary decompensation can be achieved with minimal surgical interventions. The proper fit of the template is crucial and should be maintained throughout the whole treatment. Regardless of the mucosal resilience, a correct and stable attachment is achieved through the bone fixation.The access to the jaw can now only be achieved through the sleeves embedded in {{the surgical}} template. Using specific burs through the sleeves the mucosa is removed. Every bur used, <b>carries</b> a <b>sleeve</b> compatible to the sleeves in the template, which ensures that the final position is achieved but no further progress in the alveolar ridge can take place. Further procedure {{is very similar to}} the traditional implant placement. The pilot hole is drilled and then expanded. With the aid of the splint, the implants are finally placed. After that, the splint can be removed.|$|R
30|$|These {{observations}} can {{be interpreted}} as follows. Two spliced bars were disconnected near the middle section of a sleeve. As a result, the middle part of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>carried</b> almost all the accumulative tensile loading transferred from the embedded bar and, therefore, resulted in peak stress. In the transverse direction, the strain condition depended on the combination of two factors. The first one was the Poisson effect because sleeves were tensile loaded longitudinally resulting in transverse shrinkage. The second factor was split expansion in the radial direction induced by the filled grout due to bar-grout bond, which caused the sleeves to dilate transversely. Consequently, different sleeve configurations influenced the two factors, resulting in various strain distributions in the transverse direction which can be different from the observation in this study (Einea et al. 1995; Ling et al. 2012).|$|R
5000|$|The same song lineup was reused in 1976, after Bell Records {{evolved into}} Arista Records (with music mogul Clive Davis in charge), for {{a far more}} {{successful}} compilation, The Monkees Greatest Hits. In the UK, Bell's distributors, EMI, issued this album in a different cover under the title 'The Monkees' (the same title as their 1966 debut album) on their budget Sounds Superb label (a spin off label from their Music For Pleasure label) with the catalogue number SPR 90032 in 1978. The album sleeve can be viewed at http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=231341. In 1983 it was again re-issued as MFP50499 with the title The Best Of The Monkees. This release used the same LP master as the number stamped into the deadwax {{was the same as}} for the Sounds Superb release, and the rear <b>sleeve</b> <b>carried</b> the statement [...] "Previously released as 'The Monkees' (SPR 90032)." [...] The sleeve for this release can be viewed at http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=388166.|$|R
40|$|The edibility of {{different}} Elaeis sp. breeding populations present in Benin was {{tested for the}} leaf miner Coelaenomenodera lameensis Berti (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a major oil palm pest in Africa. Experiments <b>carried</b> out in <b>sleeves</b> revealed the oviposition capacities of females and the mortality rates for the different developmental stages by comparing the populations found on two breeding populations of Elaeis oleifera (HBK) Cortes, four of Elaeis guineensis Jacquin and four (E. guineensis[*]×[*]E. oleifera) [*]×[*]E. guineensis backcrosses. Females laid their eggs similarly on all breeding populations, with a preference for the E. guineensis La Mé origin. The average hatching rate reached 80 % for the La Mé origin as opposed to 28 % for the Deli origin. The mortality rates for the larval instars were greater on E. oleifera, on certain backcrosses and on the Deli origin of E. guineensis. Development at the second- and third- larval instars was the most affected, with a mortality rate of {{three to five times}} greater than that seen on La Mé. Epidermis and cuticle measurements indicated which breeding populations were suitable or unsuitable for the development of C. lameensis. E. guineensis, with its thin epidermis (12 [*]µm) and cuticle (2 [*]µm), proved to be highly susceptible to C. lameensis attacks. On the other hand, E. oleifera, which is very resistant, exhibited a thicker epidermis (17 [*]µm) and cuticle (4 [*]µm). The breeding populations were thus classified according to the positive or negative influence they exerted on the insect's egg laying and feeding. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
