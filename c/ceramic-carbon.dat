The baseline thermal protection, which was to be capable of withstanding temperatures of 1,400-1,600° C for a minimum of 20 minutes and studied by Dassault and SEP, would have consisted of carbon elements with an anti-oxidant coating applied to portions of the nose and leading edges of the wings, while thermal tiles were to have covered the underside of the wing and fuselage. These tiles, which were to be fastened into place, would have employed thin, reinforced <b>ceramic-carbon</b> honeycomb composite insulating layers separated by thin sheets of metal alloy to reflect the heat; an alternative concept for the tiles would have employed higher metallic portions in place of ceramics. The upper surfaces of the vehicle, which {{would have been}} subject to less heat than the lower surfaces, would have used flexible blanket-like low-density, glassfibre-ceramic layers.|$|E
40|$|A new sol-gel derived <b>ceramic-carbon</b> {{composite}} electrode was fabricated {{by the use}} of CuI as modifier. The electrocatalytic {{activity of}} the copper iodide modified sol-gel derived <b>ceramic-carbon</b> composite (CIM-SGD-CCC) electrode was examined for the oxidation of hydrazine. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to study the electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of the modified electrode. Results showed that the CIM-SGD-CCC electrode has very high catalytic activity for electrooxidation of hydrazine. This proves that the copper iodide bears the main role in electro-catalytic oxidation of hydrazine. This modified electrode shows fast amperometric response with the range from 1 μ mol L- 1 to 40 μ mol L- 1 and the limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 524 μ mol L- 1 for hydrazine. The relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) was 0. 72 % for 5 successive assays. High stability, good reproducibility, rapid response, easy surface regeneration and fabrication are the important characteristics of the proposed electrode...|$|E
40|$|Extremely intense {{development}} of civilization requires from foundry casting technologies very high quality and not expensive castings. In the foundries, {{there are many}} treatments that allow increasing of the final properties of produced castings such as refining, modification, heat treatment, etc. One of the methods of increasing {{the quality of the}} casting by removing inclusions from the liquid alloy is filtration. The use of <b>ceramic-carbon</b> foam filters in filtration process is still analysed phenomenon that allows improving the final properties of castings. A modern method of research, testing and synthesis of innovative chemical compositions allows improving the properties of such filters. In the paper the evaluation of application properties of developed <b>ceramic-carbon</b> bonded foam filters is presented. The quality of the foam filters is evaluated by Computer Tomography and foundry trials in pouring of liquid metal in test molds.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the processing and microstructure of <b>ceramic–carbon</b> composites is critical to development of these composites for applications needing electrically conducting, thermal shock resistant ceramic materials. In the present study green compacts of carbon ceramic composites were prepared either by slurry processing or dry powder blending {{of one or more}} of the three — clay, glass, alumina and carbon black or graphite. The dried green compacts were sintered at 1400  °C in flowing argon. The ceramic carbon composites except the ones without clay addition showed formation of silica nanowires. The silica nanowire formation was observed in both samples prepared by slip casting and dry powder compaction containing either carbon black or graphite. TEM micrographs showed presence of carbon at the core of the silica nanowires indicating that carbon served the role of a catalyst. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) suggested that the silica nanowires are amorphous. Prior studies have reported formation of silica nanowires from silicon, silica, silicon carbide but this is the first report ever on formation of silica nanowires from clay...|$|E

Alumina-carbon nanofibres (CNFs) and silicon carbide-CNFs nanocomposites with {{different}} volume fraction of CNFs (0 - 100 vol. %) {{were obtained by}} spark plasma sintering. The effect of CNFs content on the tribological behaviour in dry sliding conditions on the <b>ceramic-carbon</b> nanocomposites has been investigated using the ball-on-disk technique against alumina balls. The wear rate of ceramic-CNFs nanocomposites decreases with CNFs increasing content. The friction coefficient of the Al 2 O 3 /CNFs and SiC/CNFs nanocomposites with high CNFs content {{was found to be}} significantly lower compared to monolithic Al 2 O 3 and SiC due to the effect of CNFs and unexpectedly slightly lower than CNFs material. The main wear mechanism in the nanocomposite was abrasion of the ceramic and carbon components which act in the interface as a sort of lubricating media. The experimental results demonstrate that the addition of CNFs to the ceramic composites significantly reduces friction coefficient and wear rate, resulting in suitable materials for unlubricated tribological applications. © 2011.

40|$|This {{review is}} devoted to {{discussing}} {{the state of the}} art in the relevant aspects of the synthesis of novel precious and non-precious electrocatalysts. It covers the production of Pt- and Pd-based electrocatalysts synthesized by the carbonyl chemical route, the synthesis description for the preparation of the most catalytically active transition metal chalcogenides, then the employment of free-surfactants synthesis routes to produce non-precious electrocatalysts. A compilation of the best precious electrocatalysts to perform the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is described; a section {{is devoted to}} the synthesis and electrocatalytic evaluation of non-precious materials which can be used to perform the HOR in alkaline medium. Apropos the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the synthesis and modification of the supports is also discussed as well, aiming at describing {{the state of the art}} to improve kinetics of low temperature fuel cell reactions via the hybridization process of the catalytic center with a variety of carbon-based, and <b>ceramic-carbon</b> supports. Last, but not least, the review covers the experimental half-cells results in a micro-fuel cell platform obtained in our laboratory, and by other workers, analyzing the history of the first micro-fuel cell systems and their tailoring throughout the time bestowing to the design and operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the bulk}} {{polycrystalline}} <b>ceramic-carbon</b> nanotube (CNT) composites developed to date, reinforcing CNTs {{have been present}} just at the matrix grain boundaries, with the grain interiors being nearly completely devoid of CNT; thus severely limiting the improvements achieved in fracture and wear properties. Against this backdrop, bulk polycrystalline Al 2 O 3 -based composites, having multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) present within the matrix grain interiors (not just at grain boundaries), have been developed in this work for the first time. Such microstructure development has been rendered possible by an innovative, but facile, wet-chemical synthesis route (sans ball-milling) involving incorporation of well-dispersed MWCNTs directly into matrix sol, followed by rapid gelation (within a few seconds) and sintering (inclusive of crystallization step). Intragranular MWCNT reinforcements (in "sol-gelled" composites) led to significant improvements in indentation-induced crack propagation resistances and abrasive wear resistances, as compared to "conventionally" prepared Al 2 O 3 -MWCNT composites (i. e., "ball-milled" counterpart) having the same contents of MWCNT, but present only at grain boundaries. Wear rates recorded with the "sol-gelled" Al 2 O 3 - 2. 5 vol% MWCNT are lower than those for monolithic Al 2 O 3 and "ball-milled" counterpart by similar to 95 % and similar to 90 %, respectively. Such improvements, as never achieved before, are a consequence of reinforcing the matrix grain interiors with MWCNTs...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of energy conversion and storage devices {{is at the}} forefront of research geared towards a sustainable future. However, there are numerous issues that prevent the widespread use of these technologies including cost, performance and durability. These limitations can be directly related to the materials used. In particular, the design and fabrication of nanostructured hybrid materials is expected to provide breakthroughs for the advancement of these technologies. This tutorial review will highlight block copolymers as an emerging and powerful yet affordable tool to structure-direct such nanomaterials with precise control over structural dimensions, composition and spatial arrangement of materials in composites. After providing an introduction to materials design and current limitations, the review will highlight some of the most recent examples of block copolymer structure-directed nanomaterials for photovoltaics, batteries and fuel cells. In each case insights are provided into the various underlying fundamental chemical, thermodynamic and kinetic formation principles enabling general and relatively inexpensive wet-polymer chemistry methodologies for the efficient creation of multiscale functional materials. Examples include nanostructured ceramics, <b>ceramic-carbon</b> composites, ceramic-carbon-metal composites and metals with morphologies ranging from hexagonally arranged cylinders to three-dimensional bi-continuous cubic networks. The review ends with an outlook towards the synthesis of multicomponent and hierarchical multifunctional hybrid materials with different nano-architectures from self-assembly of higher order blocked macromolecules which may ultimately pave the way for the further {{development of}} energy conversion and storage devices. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
