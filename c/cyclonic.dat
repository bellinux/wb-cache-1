5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite <b>cyclonic</b> surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a <b>cyclonic</b> storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
5|$|The 2002 West Bengal cyclone (JTWC designation: 04B, officially {{known as}} Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm BOB 04) was a deadly {{tropical}} cyclone that affected India and Bangladesh in November2002. The sixth tropical cyclone and fourth <b>cyclonic</b> storm of the 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it {{developed in the}} Bay of Bengal northeast of Sri Lanka on November10, as a tropical depression. After tracking northeast, the system strengthened into a <b>cyclonic</b> storm on November11, as maximum sustained winds exceeded 65km/h (40mph). On November12, it further intensified into a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm. Later that day, the storm made landfall on Sagar Island in West Bengal with winds of 100km/h (65mph). After moving inland, it rapidly weakened and dissipated over Bangladesh on November12.|$|E
5|$|The nascent system quickly organized, {{aided by}} the {{decreasing}} wind shear, {{as well as a}} surge in the monsoon. The IMD upgraded the depression to a <b>cyclonic</b> storm at 03:00UTC on May17. At 12:00UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing warnings on the system with its own designation Tropical Cyclone 02B. With weak steering currents, the storm meandered over the central Bay of Bengal, executing a small <b>cyclonic</b> loop over 30hours. The cloud pattern organized into a central dense overcast that was initially irregular in nature. However, the storm quickly intensified on May18, strengthening into a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm and later very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm. During this time, the cyclone turned eastward under the influence of a ridge over India to the north.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the season, the IMD {{monitored}} ten depressions, {{three of}} which became <b>cyclonic</b> storms. The strongest storm {{of the year was}} Super <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Gay. Crossing the Malay Peninsula into the Bay of Bengal on November4, Gay {{became one of the most}} powerful systems on record in the basin, attaining an estimated pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Collectively, the storms were responsible for at least 1,785fatalities, 1,445 of which were due the disastrous flooding triggered by the July <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm, and more than $25million in damage.|$|E
5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a <b>cyclonic</b> loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the <b>cyclonic</b> loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the <b>cyclonic</b> loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded {{the system to}} a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded the system to a <b>cyclonic</b> storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|Cyclogenesis is the {{development}} or strengthening of <b>cyclonic</b> circulation in the atmosphere (a low-pressure area).|$|E
5|$|Late on June 3, the IMD {{upgraded}} {{the storm}} to Very Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Gonu. With warm waters, low amounts of vertical wind shear, and favorable upper-level outflow, Gonu strengthened further to attain peak 1-min sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph) and gusts to 315km/h (195mph), about 285km (175mi) east-southeast of Masirah Island {{on the coast}} of Oman. The IMD upgraded it to Super <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Gonu late on June 4, with peak 3-min sustained winds reaching 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated pressure of 920mbar. This made it the first super <b>cyclonic</b> storm in the Arabian Sea on record.|$|E
5|$|Mid–August, 1995– Strong rip {{currents}} from Hurricane Felix kills five people, while persistent <b>cyclonic</b> winds caused extensive beach erosion.|$|E
5|$|Physically, the <b>cyclonic</b> {{circulation}} {{of the storm}} advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must conserve its angular momentum, this flow configuration induces a <b>cyclonic</b> gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs {{even if there is}} zero environmental flow.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season had no bounds, but {{tropical}} cyclones in the North Indian Ocean tend to form between April and December, with {{peaks in}} May and November. The 1970 season saw {{a total of}} seven <b>cyclonic</b> storms, of which three developed into severe <b>cyclonic</b> storms. The Bay of Bengal was more active than the Arabian Sea during 1970, {{with all of the}} three severe <b>cyclonic</b> storms in the season forming there. Unusually, none of the storms in the Arabian Sea made landfall this year. The most significant storm of the season was the Bhola cyclone, which formed in the Bay of Bengal and hit Bangladesh on November 12. The storm killed at least 500,000, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{velocity}} gradients or horizontal {{wind shear}} (size of cyclone, {{the intensity of}} cyclone, proximity to the cyclone, and local scale <b>cyclonic</b> convection effects).|$|E
5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} October 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north. It gradually intensified and turned to the northeast, becoming a <b>cyclonic</b> storm on October 20. The storm became the second severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm of the season the following day, and turned onto a more northerly track towards the Ganges Delta. The storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of October 23. The storm then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on October 24.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a <b>cyclonic</b> storm the next day. The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance is MFR's generic {{term for a}} non-frontal {{area of low pressure}} that has organized convection and definite <b>cyclonic</b> surface wind circulation. The system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28knots (50km/h, 32mph).|$|E
5|$|After peaking in intensity, {{the storm}} began {{weakening}} due to increasing easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing {{the center of}} circulation from the deepest convection. Early on May14, the IMD downgraded the storm to a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm. Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May14, convection had largely dissipated, {{with the exception of}} a small area near the center, and the system weakened to minimal <b>cyclonic</b> storm status. Thunderstorm activity continued to wax and wane as the storm turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the storm to weaken further to a deep depression on May16. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able to move more steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May18. On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a <b>cyclonic</b> storm, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85km/h (50mph). At about 10:00UTC on May19, the storm made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar. The storm rapidly weakened into a depression and later degenerated into a low pressure area on May20, and was no longer discernible on satellite imagery by the next day.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone {{bypassed}} Socotra, its convective core became better defined due {{to improved}} outflow. On 2November, Chapala entered the Gulf of Aden, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record in that region. At 12:00UTC that day, the IMD downgraded {{the system to}} a very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm, after Chapala had been an extremely severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm for 78hours. The structure became disorganized that day due to increased easterly wind shear and interaction with the Arabian Peninsula to the north, causing cooler and drier air to enter the circulation. Around this time, the storm began moving more to the west-northwest toward Yemen, rounding the southwestern periphery of a ridge. Between 01:0002:00UTC on 3November, Chapala made landfall near Mukalla with winds of 120km/h (75mph). This marked the first hurricane-intensity landfall for Yemen on record, and the first severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm to hit the country since May 1960. According to the JTWC, Chapala moved ashore and immediately turned back over water, although the agency soon reassessed the center as being over land. Chapala quickly weakened over land, degenerating into a depression by 00:00UTC on 4November, and weakening into a remnant low pressure area three hours later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a <b>cyclonic</b> supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical <b>cyclonic</b> tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Cyclogenesis is the {{development}} or strengthening of <b>cyclonic</b> circulation in the atmosphere. Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in {{the development}} of some sort of cyclone. It can occur at various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm on June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. Later, it became the only super <b>cyclonic</b> storm, which is a tropical cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone for the strongest tropical cyclone in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any cyclone in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike the Arabian Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. Additionally, the storm was only the second <b>cyclonic</b> storm on record to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Keila (IMD designation: ARB 02, JTWC designation: 03A) was {{the first}} named storm of the 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. A weak system for much of its duration, Keila {{developed}} in the western Arabian Sea in late October 2011, amid an area of marginally favorable conditions. On November2, it briefly organized enough to be classified as a <b>cyclonic</b> storm, which has maximum sustained winds of at least 65km/h (40mph). Given the name Keila by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm quickly moved ashore southern Oman near Salalah, and weakened while meandering over the country. The remnants soon after moved offshore, dissipating on November4.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Komen was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal. The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July26 over the Ganges delta and moved in a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) <b>cyclonic</b> storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, a {{tropical}} cyclone officially called Very Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm BOB 01 produced the worst flooding in Sri Lanka in 56years. The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it {{developed over the}} Bay of Bengal on May10. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the system to intensify steadily while moving northwestward. The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) on May13, making it a very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a <b>cyclonic</b> storm. It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 8 a {{depression}} formed in the south-central Bay of Bengal. It moved very slowly to the north, becoming a <b>cyclonic</b> storm the next day. It continued to intensify as it approached {{the head of the}} Bay, becoming the third severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm of the season on November 11. That evening it reached its peak with winds of 185km/h (115mph) with a well-developed eye and became the strongest storm of the season. It then made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan during the night of November 12. The cyclone weakened rapidly as it moved inland and dissipated the next day over south Assam.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Oman cyclone (JTWC designation: 01A, officially {{known as}} <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm ARB 01) was an {{uncommon}} tropical cyclone that struck the Dhofar region of Oman in May 2002. The first storm of the 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed on May6 in the Arabian Sea, and it maintained a general west-northwest track {{for much of}} its duration. The system reached <b>cyclonic</b> storm status on May9, meaning it attained winds of greater than 65km/h (40mph), and on May10 it made landfall near Salalah; shortly thereafter it dissipated. The storm was rare, {{in the sense that}} it was one of only eleven tropical cyclones on record to approach the Arabian Peninsula in the month of May.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} storm {{of the season}} was <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Hibaru, which formed southeast of Sri Lanka in January. After nearly five months of inactivity, two depressions formed {{toward the end of}} June on opposite sides of India. The depression in the Arabian Sea was one of only two in that body of water during the year, the other of which formed in September and killed 13people. The other was a depression that formed over land and killed 26people in Madhya Pradesh, followed by another depression in July that killed one person. A series of deadly storms affected southeastern India beginning in September; a depression killed six people in Madhya Pradesh, <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Pyarr killed 80people, an unclassified tropical storm killed 16people in nearby Bangladesh, and a deep depression in October killed 100people in Andhra Pradesh. December was active, with <b>cyclonic</b> storms Baaz and Fanoos hitting southern India, resulting in 11fatalities, and a deep depression remaining over waters {{in the middle of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|The term typhoon is the {{regional}} {{name in the}} northwest Pacific for a severe (or mature) tropical cyclone, whereas hurricane is {{the regional}} term in the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic. Elsewhere {{this is called a}} tropical cyclone, severe tropical cyclone, or severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{steering}} influence of an upper-level ridge to its northeast, BOB03 {{began to take}} a more northwesterly course. The ridge also provided a highly conducive environment for intensification and eventually became positioned atop the strengthening <b>cyclonic</b> storm, slowing the cyclone and allowing it to generate good outflow. With these conditions in place, BOB03 entered a phase of rapid intensification, strengthening faster than climatological rates. BOB03 strengthened into a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm at 03:00UTC on 27October and attained very severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm intensity just nine hours later with the storm centered 650km (405mi) south of Chittagong, Bangladesh. An eye emerged on visible satellite imagery early on 28October, and at 15:00UTC that day, the IMD classified BOB03 as a super <b>cyclonic</b> storm, the highest rating on the IMD's cyclone scale. Using the Dvorak technique, the IMD estimated that BOB03 reached its peak intensity three hours later with maximum sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 912mbar (hPa; 26.93inHg); this made BOB03 the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean by pressure with sustained winds at the time matched by only two other known cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. At the time, the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone was the only storm in the region of comparable intensity. Although the storm's organization and appearance deteriorated as it neared land, BOB03's intensity held steady up until it made landfall on the Odisha coast between Puri and Kendrapara at 06:00UTC on 29October.|$|E
5|$|Upon being classified, the {{tropical}} cyclone was moving northwestward {{under the influence}} of a ridge over India. Its outflow to the north and south became better defined, although its proximity to the equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to wind shear. Early on November29, the IMD classified the system as a depression, and throughout the day it rapidly intensified to become a <b>cyclonic</b> storm; a <b>cyclonic</b> storm is a tropical cyclone with at least 65km/h (40mph) winds sustained for 3minutes. Around that time, the JTWC assessed the cyclone as reaching peak winds of 120km/h (75mph), sustained for 1minute, along with gusts to 150km/h (90mph). Late on November29, the cyclone weakened slightly, only to regain its peak intensity by November30; at that time, it developed a banding eye, and was located about 1500km (900mi) southeast of the coast of Somalia. At 1200UTC on November30, the IMD issued its first complete advisory on the cyclone, naming it Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Agni and estimating peak winds at 100km/h (65mph); the agency predicted the storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening. At its peak, the cyclone had a barometric pressure of 985mbar.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters. However, increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm status and later to <b>cyclonic</b> storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the country since 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant low over Iran through June 8.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{just north}} of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the {{waterway}} between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This {{marked the first time}} on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00UTC on November9, the center was beginning to become exposed from the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00UTC on November9, Megh weakened further into a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm, and degraded further to a <b>cyclonic</b> storm by six hours later. While just offshore Yemen, the circulation slowed and turned to the northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00UTC on November10 the storm weakened to a deep depression, and three hours later Megh made landfall in southwestern Yemen northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55km/h (35mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00UTC on November10.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, the system {{took on a}} slower and more westerly path across the Bay of Bengal. Gradually strengthening, the system attained typhoon intensity (or modern-day Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm-equivalent) at 00:00UTC on November26. Shortly after reaching this strength, the cyclone began to curve northward, rounding the western periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over Indochina. Due to the ridge's broad size, the tropical cyclone was steered generally due north rather than northeast. Gradual intensification continued as the storm progressed closer to the coasts of Bangladesh and East India. At around 12:00UTC on November29, the tropical cyclone made landfall near the border between Bangladesh and West Bengal {{at the mouth of}} the Hooghly River. At the time, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph); this was the cyclone's peak intensity. After landfall, the storm slowly weakened over Bangladesh and was last noted as a <b>cyclonic</b> storm-equivalent with sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph) on November30.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00UTC on October27, the IMD {{upgraded}} Nilofar to a {{very severe}} <b>cyclonic</b> storm. The storm was rapidly intensifying at the time, after the wind shear had decreased, and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19km (12mi). At 09:00UTC on October28, the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph); at the time, the agency anticipated further strengthening due to the favorable conditions and good organization. At 18:00UTC on October28, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). At the time, it was the third-strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea. On October29, Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear, and the convection diminished in intensity. At the same time, the storm turned northeastward while rounding the ridge to the east. Increasingly cooler and drier air, as well as cooler waters, caused the storm to degrade rapidly. The eye, previously small and well defined, dissipated by 06:00UTC on October29. Later that day, the center began decoupling from the convection, a sign of rapid weakening, and by 21:00UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe <b>cyclonic</b> storm. Early on October30, the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm, and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection. At 18:00UTC that day, the JTWC posted their final advisory. Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October31, and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Extremely Severe <b>Cyclonic</b> Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-strongest cyclone in the Arabian Sea. In late October 2014, {{it reached}} peak maximum {{sustained}} winds estimated between 205km/h (125mph) and 215km/h (130mph). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Nilofar; the name {{refers to the}} water lily, and was suggested by Pakistan. The western fringes of the storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman, killing four people.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November10, three ships {{reported}} a <b>cyclonic</b> circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of 70mph (110km/h). It was a large system, and would likely have been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November12 before being merging with another system.|$|E
