50|$|In 1946, the Loi Lamine Guèye granted {{some limited}} {{citizenship}} rights to natives of the African colonies. The French Empire was renamed the French Union on 27 October 1946, {{when the new}} constitutution of the French Fourth Republic was established. In late 1946 under this new constitution each territory was {{for the first time}} (excepting the Four Communes) able elect local representatives, albeit on a limited franchise, to newly established General Councils. These elected bodies had only limited <b>consultative</b> <b>powers,</b> although they did approve local budgets. The Loi Cadre of 23 June 1956 brought universal suffrage to elections held after that date in all French African colonies. The first elections under universal suffrage in French West Africa were the municipal elections of late 1956. On 31 March 1957, under universal suffrage, territorial Assembly elections were held in each of the eight colonies (Togo as a UN trust Territory was by this stage on a different trajectory). The leaders of the winning parties were appointed to the newly instituted positions of Vice-Presidents of the respective Governing Councils — French Colonial Governors remained as Presidents.|$|R
5000|$|The modern idea of inner-party {{supervision}} {{came with}} the reestablishment of the CCDI in 1978. Deng was in the forefront already in 1980 to institutionalise the discipline inspection system;"it is most important to get supervision and inspection institutionalized within the Party". Despite this, the work on this never took off during Deng's own tenure. While several party documents were published on the issue, such as the [...] "Provisional Stipulations of Enhancing the Intra-Party Discipline Inspection by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission" [...] in 1987, [...] "Opinion on Establishing a System of Democratic Assessment of Party Members by the Organizational Department of the CCP" [...] in 1988 and [...] "Several Stipulations on the System of Democratic Life Meetings for the Leading Party Officials {{at or above the}} County Level by the CCP Central Committee" [...] in 1990, actual publication of regulation were few and far between. Efforts on institutionalizing the system blew of steam early on, and did not regain steam until the 1990s. This is partly to blame on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Seeing how the party public image was in decline due to its poor anti-corruption efforts the CPC responded by attacking [...] "official speculation", the dominant form of corruption at the time. The 6th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee (held in 1990) established a taskforce on drafting what would become the [...] "Internal Supervision Regulation". The first draft was published in 1991, but work on it was abandoned. The idea resurfaced in the [...] "The CPC Central Committee's Decision on Several Important Issues Concerning the Party's Construction" [...] in 1994, and a taskforce responsible for drafting the document was established. The new taskforce was empowered full investigative and <b>consultative</b> <b>powers,</b> and worked until 2000 when the second draft was issued. Work stopped yet again from 2000 until the 16th National Congress (held in 2002). The 16th Central Committee established a third taskforce, which published three drafts in April 2003. A period of consultation ensued, in which the taskforce sent the draft to leading cadres, provincial committees and lower-level committees. Several revisions were made, and in December 2003 the 16th Politburo, on behalf of the 16th Central Committee, approved the draft and issued it under the name [...] "Internal Supervision Regulation". It was promulgated in 2004.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} that Regional Parliamentary Assemblies (RPAs) and International Parliamentary Institutions (IPIs) {{are relevant}} to the promotion of human rights. They have consistently promoted human rights, in particular through committees responsible for handling issues of human rights. Their significance to the promotion of human rights lies in their position as oversight actors, legislators of human right oriented laws and their role in the ratification and domestication of human rights treaties. The thesis concludes that the Pan-African Parliament (PAP), {{as is the case with}} other RPAs and IPIs, is equally relevant to the promotion of human rights in Africa. Given its powers, the PAP s mandate is however limited to the promotion of human rights. The thesis thus places particular focus on the Parliament s actual practice and potential role in relation to the promotion of human rights in Africa. In the main, the thesis illustrates that the role of the PAP in the promotion of human rights in Africa has thus far been negligible as the Parliament has done little to promote human rights in Africa. The thesis further reveals that the inadequate promotion of human rights by the PAP exists despite the fact that it should be occupying a unique position within the African human rights system. This state of affairs is a result of a host of factors that have been identified in the study as including the absence of full legislative powers, the limited budgetary powers and the undemocratic appointment of members of the PAP. The thesis further reveals that the Parliament s relationship with national parliaments, civil society, national human rights institutions sub-regional bodies and other AU institutions is also negligible. To that end, the Parliament has been described as a talk shop, a name befitting an institution that undertakes workshops, seminars and conferences largely for the benefit of its parliamentarians. The thesis illustrates that the success of the PAP is dependent on several factors, such as its cooperation with member states, national parliaments, sub-regional parliaments, other AU organs, the larger network of civil society and national human rights institutions. This thesis concludes that the PAP is capable of using its current <b>consultative</b> <b>powers</b> to become an influential talk shop as regards the promotion of human rights and the decision-making process of the AU in general. The thesis further concludes that the Parliament must learn from the experiences of other international parliamentary institutions and must explore imaginative ways according to which it could deal more pragmatically with human rights issues.

Presentations {{by the team}} of ACP and European experts (see Appendix 11) were well received and there was active participation in plenary and work group sessions. Discussions were intense and the delegates achieved consensus {{on a range of}} issues. The meeting agreed as follows: 1. The CTA S&T Strategies Programme should add value to existing initiatives and focus on: Facilitating the policy dialogue on Science, Technology and Innovation (ST&I) for Agricultural and Rural development. These dialogues should be promoted at the national, regional, ACP and ACP-EU levels. Information management and communication on ST&I for agricultural and rural development and facilitate exchange of information, experiences and technologies. Knowledge development with emphasis on building capacity for enhancing participation in ST&I policy dialogues, developing national science, technology and innovation systems and developing negotiations and lobbying skills. Website should include strategic links to other websites with relevant content and complement existing initiatives. Website should be targeted to all major stakeholders: farmers´ organizations and other actors and users in the agricultural and rural communities including representatives of ministries with responsibility for agriculture, trade, science & technology, education, finance and the research community. Information should be provided in the form of briefs and should promote technologies and best practices relevant {{to the needs of the}} actors and in support of the policy dialogues. The term ´informal´ was not appropriate for a structure of a scientific nature. The newly created group should have <b>consultative</b> <b>powers</b> and provide information to CTA which will, in turn, formulate recommendations, as needed, for the ACP member states on S&T for agricultural and rural development. The name of the group should be the Advisory Committee on Science and Technology for ACP Agricultural and Rural Development. The mandate of the group should eventually extend beyond CTA and draw its legitimacy from the ACP region/group. C CTA should establish a standard communication system to enable members to interact (conferences, electronic discussions) with each other. The name of the group will be the Advisory Committee on Science and Technology for ACP Agricultural and Rural Development. The core group will comprise of persons from the 6 ACP regions, representative of miscellaneous stakeholders, competent professionals in the relevant domains, regional institutions and the Programme Coordinator, Science and Technology Strategies, CTA. The Advisory Committee will serve as an advisory body on Science and Technology with respect to issues impacting on ACP agriculture (including marine resources and forestry) and support CTA in enhancing cooperation and dialogue and encouraging greater integration of Science and Technology strategies in support of ACP agricultural and rural development. The Advisory Committee will meet once annually and as needed at the request of CTA to dialogue on emerging issues and trends impacting on ACP agriculture (including marine resources and forestry), chart the S&T work programme / areas of emphases for the upcoming year/s and finalize any position papers which need to be presented to relevant international agencies to influence decision making in a timely manner. The Advisory Committee will from time to time during the year provide alerts and information on relevant S&T issues and contribute to developing policy guidelines / positions and S&T strategies for achieving sustainable development with respect to the attainment of food security goals, improved productivity at the farm level and national and regional /or international competitiveness. These guidelines will be circulated to member governments and institutions through the focal points on S&T to galvanize wider dialogue on the issues and strategies.

500|$|The CEUNPA {{proposes that}} the UNPA's begin as a <b>consultative</b> body whose <b>powers</b> could be {{augmented}} as it {{evolved into a}} directly elected assembly: [...] "Step by step, it should be provided with genuine rights of information, participation and control vis-à-vis the UN and the organizations of the UN system." [...] An article in the Asian-Pacific Law & Policy Journal notes that precedents for this idea include the British Parliament, French Estates-General, U.S. Congress, and Europarl, which are all systems in which, over time, power shifted to directly elected officials: [...] "In the past, fledgling democracy has always had to compromise {{with the realities of}} power and evolve step-by-step, where possible. This is often accomplished {{in the form of a}} 'non-democratic' additional house in the parliamentary structure. Thus, in Britain, the necessity of compromise of the 'common people' with the powers and interests of the armed and titled nobility necessitated a bicameral system incorporating the House of Lords, as well as the House of Commons. The French Estates-General included similar power blocs as 'estates' or functional separate houses, and the United States Senate reflected a necessary compromise of the interests of less populous states hesitant to subject themselves to 'democratic inundation' by the more populous states." ...|$|R

The final positions will be posted on the CTA web site ?Knowledge for Development? and circulated to policy makers and other related national and regional institutions through the national nodes. The Advisory Committee will support CTA in identifying suitable institutions for building knowledge at the national, regional and international levels in support of Science and Technology policy formulation and strategic decision making for improving the performance of ACP agriculture. The Advisory Committee recognizes that policy formulation is a national responsibility and policies give a country its competitive advantage. Hence, information will be provided only as a guide to support more informed decision making. 6. There is need to enhance the Science Technology and Innovation Policy dialogue in ACP countries and that ACP countries cannot afford to not improve the STI policy framework and noted: The disconnect that exists between Ministries responsible for S&T policy making, other relevant ministries and agencies, stakeholders and actors; similarly, that a disconnect exists between what is produced and consumed and priorities of research and development and market realities. The disarticulated process with emphasis on flows from science to market and cautioned that development is not a linear process flow through a ´pipeline´. That policy decisions are usually not based on research results as there is a severe lack of data and where data exist, there is limited dissemination. There was an urgent need to revitalize agricultural research and training and design measures to strengthen the institutions of higher learning in agriculture and update the curricula. Recommended that CTA approach the ACP Group to support regional conferences to debate the issues and chart the way forward. Improved information flows among system actors to enhance research and production. Improved understanding among the actors and more informed decision making. Greater learning pathways as information gaps are closed. Externally driven development agenda with little scope for substantive contribution from local actors. Lack of suitable representatives with requisite competences for policy analysis, particularly for interpreting global governance rules Weak financial commitments. Vested interests, both local and external which often exert negative impacts on the direction of policy. 10. That the strategic priorities for enhancing the policy dialogue are: Consensus building among stakeholders. Identification of problems and constraints and determination of the solutions. Focus on poverty reduction and sustainable development. Recognized that the poor must be involved in the process and be given the necessary support and incentives to actively participate in the system of innovation while at the same time building their capacity to optimize S&T. That in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) policies are not well articulated and the infrastructure to support SI is inadequate. There is inadequate networking among ACP actors and considered this a critical difference between developed countries and LDCs. Recommended that linkages be strengthened. That there are several actors in the Innovation System and that there was need to prioritize them. That the rapid changes taking place on a global scale require that ACP countries be able to respond quickly. That ACP countries can view the innovation process through several mechanisms. 13. There is need to carry out a S. I. analysis (sectoral, national, regional - across economic zones) in the various countries but recognized that this would depend on the availability of resources. Noted that stakeholders must own the process. 14. Strengthening Science Technology and Innovation (S. T. I.) systems must be considered a priority for supporting economic development and poverty alleviation in ACP countries. 15. The objectives and the expected results of the meeting had been satisfactorily achieved. The Advisory Committee on Science and Technology for ACP Agricultural and Rural Development was launched in December 2003.
