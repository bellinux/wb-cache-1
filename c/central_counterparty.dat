40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether risk-based regulation is an efficient approach to the regime of <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> (CCPs) in the OTC derivatives market. The discussions below will first attempt to throw some light on the way risk-based regulation operates. They highlight the benefits, limits and complexities tied to the adoption of this approach to regulation. The core of the study in this paper is the analysis concerning the parameters that risk-based regulation offers to assess the current regime of <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> in the OTC derivatives market in the UK. The paper explores the UK risk-based model of regulation and supervision governing OTC derivatives. It is specifically focused on prudential supervision and conduct of business rules governing OTC derivatives transactions and the increasing tendency to use <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> CCPs. Additionally, this study will identify and assess the risks to the regulator’s objectives that are posed by the <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> CCPs, and to address those using various regulatory tools...|$|R

25|$|Derivative {{contracts}} are leveraged positions whose value is volatile. They are usually more volatile than their underlying asset. This {{can lead to}} credit risk, in particular counterparty risk: {{a situation in which}} one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation. In a safe trading environment, the parties to a trade need to be assured that the counterparties will honor the trade, no matter how the market has moved. This requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each counterparty, thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility. To prevent this, a clearing house interposes itself as a counterparty to every trade, in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended. This action is called novation. As a result, trading firms take no risk on the actual counterparty to the trade, but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> clearing. The clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient margining process.|$|E

[...] (All large-value financial transactions go through three steps.

While regulators' new guidelines eliminate systemic risk, this comes at the cost of an inefficiently overcollateralised clearing system. We discuss further approaches that contain systemic risk while reducing or eliminating overcollateralisation.

CCPs not only alter the direct interconnection of FIs through their balance sheets, they also affect FIs and the links between them indirectly through prices. Prices are endogenous and are not only determined by the actions of the FIs, but they in turn constitute imperatives for FIs to act through marking-to-market and risk-sensitive constraints, both natural ingredients of CCPs.
