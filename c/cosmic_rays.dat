5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> The peak flux of <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. <b>Cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E

That year, Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered the muon, using cloud chamber measurements of <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa's 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as mediating the nuclear force. Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays,</b> which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> contained electrons. They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{heliosphere}} {{and planetary}} magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> The density of <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> in {{the interstellar medium}} {{and the strength of}} the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays,</b> which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III {{for the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. <b>Cosmic</b> <b>rays,</b> which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|In Dorman (2004) it {{was made}} {{estimation}} of long-term <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity variation in near future based on solar activity data prediction and determined parameters of convection-diffusion and drift mechanisms. This gave possibility to made prediction of expected part of global climate change, caused by long-term <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> intensity variation. In this paper we use the model of <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> modulation in the Heliosphere which considers a relation between long-term <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> variations with parameters of the solar magnetic field. The later now can be predicted with good accuracy. By using this prediction, the expected <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> variations in the near Earth space also can be estimated with a good accuracy.

5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
