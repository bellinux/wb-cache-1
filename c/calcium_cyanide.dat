5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using carbon disulfide and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanide.</b> Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E

Oxygen in the medium was depleted by saturation of the incubation medium with N 2 and spontaneously by mitochondrial respiration followed {{by the addition of}} glucose/glucose oxidase. After the anaerobic state had been reached, ferricyanide has been added to support succinate-driven energization in the absence of oxygen. In the other set of the experiments KCN was added to block operation of the respiratory chain under aerobic conditions. Again, ferricyanide was added as an electron acceptor. Superoxide dismutase was added to trap superoxide anion radicals. Under either hypoxic conditions or in the presence of <b>cyanide,</b> <b>calcium</b> ions were shown to induce the permeability transition.

40|$|Continuous {{nondestructive}} {{monitoring of}} intracellular ionized calcium in isolated squid axons by differential absorption spectroscopy (using arsenazo III and antipyrylazo III) {{was used to}} study uptake of <b>calcium</b> by carbonyl <b>cyanide,</b> p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) - and (or) cyanide (CN) -sensitive and insensitive constituents of axoplasm. Known calcium loads imposed on the axon by stimulation produced proportional increments of free axoplasmic calcium. Measurement of increments in ionized calcium {{as a function of}} load confirmed earlier reports of buffering in normal and FCCP- and (or) CN-poisoned axons. Measurement of rates of calcium uptake by presumed mitochondria showed little uptake at ambient Ca below 200 [...] 400 nM, with sigmoidal rise to about 20 [...] 30 mumol/kg axoplasm per min (calculated to be about 200 mmol/kg mitochondrial protein per min) at 50 micrometer, indicating a functional threshold for presumed mitochondrial uptake well above physiological ionized calcium concentration. Treatment of stimulated axons with <b>cyanide,</b> to release <b>calcium</b> from presumed mitochondria, showed that the sensitivity to cyanide decreased progressively with time after stimulation (t 1 / 2 = 3 [...] 10 min) implying transfer of sequestered calcium into a less metabolically labile form...|$|R
40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} the role of selenium (Se) {{and the effects of}} Se supplementation especially in the bovine species. Selenium is an important trace element in cattle. Some of its roles include the participation in the antioxidant defense the cattle farms. The nutritional requirements of Se in cattle are estimated at 100 μg/kg DM (dry matter) for beef cattle and at 300 μg/kg DM for dairy cows. The rations high in fermentable carbohydrates, nitrates, sulfates, <b>calcium</b> or hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> negatively influence the organism’s use of the selenium contained in the diet. The Se supplementation may reduce the incidence of metritis and ovarian cysts during the postpartum period. The increase in fertility when adding Se is attributed to the reduction of the embryonic death during the first month of gestation. A use of organic Se in feed would provide a better transfer of Se in calves relative to mineral Se supplementation. The addition of Se yeasts in the foodstuffs of cows significantly increases the Se content and the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in milk compared to the addition of sodium selenite. The enzyme 5 -iodothyronine deiodinase is a seleno-dependent selenoprotein. It {{is one of the last}} proteins to be affected in the event of Se deficiency. This delay in response could explain the fact that several studies did not show the effect of Se supplementation on growth and weight gain of calves. Enrichment of Se in the diet did not significantly affect the slaughter weight and carcass yield of bulls. The impact and results of Se supplementation in cattle depend on physiological stage, Se status of animals, type and content of Se and types of Se administration. Further studies in Se supplementation should investigate the speciation of Se in food and yeasts, as well as understanding their metabolism and absorption. This constitute a path to exploit in order to explain certain different effects of Se. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Due to {{equilibrium}} {{constraints and}} the relatively slow kinetics of the cyanidation of gold ores, <b>calcium</b> or potassium <b>cyanide</b> {{is added to the}} leaching stage in excess to that required theoretically. This, in many situations, result in large concentrations of free cyanide present in the effluent streams from gold plants. In view of the toxicity of cyanide and the fact that cyanide is fatal in small dosages, authorities have been forced to tigl 1 ten up plant discharge regulations. Therefore, it is vital to remove cyanide from industrial effluent, not only to meet standard requirements, but also to recover the cyanide as a means of reducing chemical costs. The aim {{of this study is to}} recover, rather than destroy, free cyanide from effluent streams via a metal impregnated carbon-in-column configuration. The first part of the study focused on the mechanism of free cyanide recovery by metal impregnated carbon and the factors influencing the kinetics of the process in a batch reactor. The second part concentrates on the optimisation of such a process m a column configuration, and subsequently to recover the cyanide from the carbon. In the batch experiments it was found that impregnated metal carbon outperformed virgin carbon for free cyanide removal both from a kinetic and equilibrium point of view. Furthermore: the presence of other metal cyanides in solution with free cyanide has a negligible effect on the performance of the metal (silver) impregnated activated carbon to remove free cyanide. Moreover, scanning electron micrographs revealed distinct differences in appearance of metal impregnated carbons, which ultimately responds differently to the removal of free cyanide. Although the kinetics of adsorption in the column experiments was found to be slower when compared to that experienced in a batch reactor, preliminary results show that a column configuration could be suitable for a free cyanide recovery on a large scale. Furthemore, a sensitivity analysis using the kinetics of adsorption and equilibrium cyanide loading as criteria, has been conducted on the column configuration. In these studies the effects of different bed volumes, competitive adsorption with other species present, different flow rates, different column diameters and initial cyanide concentrations on the process have been evaluated. These results were plotted as break-through curves, and the mass transfer zone (MTZ) was determined. It was found that impregnation in an air atmosphere yields a product with a higher capacity than in a nitrogen atmosphere, compromising carbon through combustion. Under a nitrogen atmosphere a more robust product is formed. As can be expected, lower linear velocities and/or larger bed volumes as well as lower initial free cyanide concentrations improve the fraction of cyanide removed in a column configuration...|$|R

50|$|In April 1923, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, {{together}} with Adam Podoski, came to Chorzów. By then, almost all workers had been replaced, and the new, Polish-speaking crew brought the production to the pre-1921 level.

In 1923, 39,000 tons of <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanide</b> was produced at Chorzów; by 1929, the production grew to 166,000 tons.

50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>cyanide</b> is used almost {{exclusively}} in the mining industry. It serves as an inexpensive source of cyanide in many leaching or vat operation to obtain precious metals such as gold and silver from their ores.

Calcium cyanide's high toxicity to touch, inhale, or ingest makes it useful as a rodenticide. For example, {{it has been used}} in the management of the population of Indian crested porcupines (Hystrix indica). Its toxicity has been similarly exploited as an insecticide. However its high toxicity makes it unfavorable in many cases and oftentimes other less damaging chemicals are used instead.

5000|$|The {{most common}} killing agents are ether, {{chloroform}} and ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate has many advantages {{and is very}} widely used. Its fumes are less toxic to humans {{than those of the}} other agents and specimens will remain limp if they are left in an ethyl acetate killing jar for several days and the ethyl acetate is not allowed to entirely evaporate from the specimens. A disadvantage is that although the insects are quickly stunned by ethyl acetate it kills them slowly and specimens may revive if removed from the killing jar too soon. Potassium cyanide or other cyanide compounds including <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanide</b> are also used, but only by experts due to its extreme toxicity. It also has the disadvantages of making the specimens brittle when left in the jar for several hours and may also cause some discoloration of colored specimens. It does kill rapidly and the cyanide charge will last a long time. A few drops of acetic acid will increase the cyanide gas production. If the jar is not used for long periods it may dry out and produce little gas, therefore a few drops of water will also help get the process going again. The potassium cyanide slowly decomposes, releasing hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

This project continues a series of related investigations involving {{the development of}} IC techniques, based mainly on reversed-phase ion interaction chromatography (RPIIC), for the speciation of metallo-cyanide complexes formed during the cyanidation of auriferous ores [1 - 4]. The focus of this earlier work was concerned with the development of suitable methodology for the analysis of the products of the cyanidation process, such as those found in tailings dams and environmental samples. In contrast to the previous investigations, this project has focused on the determination of the various cyano species found during the extraction stage of the gold cyanidation process. These cyano species include uncomplexed ('free') cyanide, metallo-cyanide complexes, thiocyanate and cyanate. It {{should be noted that the}} terms 'free' and uncomplexed cyanide are not strictly interchangeable, especially in the presence of labile metallo-cyanide complexes. The change in emphasis from environmental monitoring to process control was originally suggested by Metana Minerals, as a means to improve the efficiency of their cyanide leaching operations.

40|$|The subject I {{have been}} asked to speak on is “Where Are We?” As I assess it, I think that we, those who are using bird {{management}} agents and methods, Federal, State, and other agencies representing research, extension and regulatory, and manufacturers of agents used in bird management, are {{standing in the middle of}} a busy intersection and the light has just turned yellow. Some of us have tape across our mouths and cotton stuck in our ears. I think that we have arrived at this intersection in a number of different ways. Some of us have taken separate paths, some have taken parallel roads, and in some cases we have crossed paths and actually taken the same road together in reaching that point in time where we are today. But I think that the future of bird management today relies a great deal on what we do in the very near future, and I am talking about this year, next year, and maybe the next three years. I am not going to address myself to the techniques used in bird management, but rather the administrative and perhaps political aspects that we need to consider as people interested in bird management. There is a new Federal Act that says that many pesticides will be restricted use agents, and to use such pesticides you will be a certified applicator. We see this as presenting a challenge, not as a hinderance. I do not think that this will affect operations, at least PCO operations, to any significant extent. However, EPA has taken another action which I think is very significant. They have taken the role of adversary in exploring the registration of a number of control agents. In particular at this point, they are examining the use of 1080, sodium cyanide, <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanide,</b> and strychnine as vertebrate pest control agents. Strychnine is the only one involved at the present for bird management practices.
