50|$|The deltoid {{originates}} on {{the lateral}} {{third of the}} clavicle, acromion and {{the crest of the}} spine of the scapula. It is inserted on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and <b>circumduction</b> of the shoulder. The supraspinatus also originates on the spine of the scapula. It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of the shoulder.|$|E
50|$|Orthopedic {{corrective}} treatments {{may also}} manifest into gait abnormality, such as lower extremity amputation, post-fracture, and arthroplasty (joint replacement). Difficulty in ambulation {{that results from}} chemotherapy is generally temporary in nature, though recovery times of {{six months to a}} year are common. Likewise, difficulty in walking due to arthritis or joint pains (antalgic gait) sometimes resolves spontaneously once the pain is gone. Hemiplegic persons have <b>circumduction</b> gait and those with cerebral palsy often have scissoring gait.|$|E
50|$|The humeroulnar joint (ulnohumeral or trochlear joint), {{is part of}} the elbow-joint. It {{composed}} of two bones, the humerus and ulna, and is the junction between the trochlear notch of ulna and the trochlea of humerus. It is classified as a simple hinge-joint, which allows for movements of flexion, extension and <b>circumduction.</b> Owing to the obliquity of the trochlea of the humerus, this movement does not take place in the antero-posterior plane of the body of the humerus.|$|E
50|$|The hip muscles act {{on three}} {{mutually}} perpendicular main axes, {{all of which}} pass {{through the center of}} the femoral head, resulting in three degrees of freedom and three pair of principal directions: Flexion and extension around a transverse axis (left-right); lateral rotation and medial rotation around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and abduction and adduction around a sagittal axis (forward-backward); and a combination of these movements (i.e. <b>circumduction,</b> a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).It should be noted that some of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.|$|E
5000|$|Circumlocution (also called <b>circumduction,</b> circumvolution, periphrasis, or ambage) is locution that {{circles around}} a {{specific}} idea with multiple words rather than directly evoking it with fewer and [...] words. It {{is sometimes a}} necessary tool of communication (for example, in getting around lexical gaps to overcome untranslatability), {{but it is also}} often a flaw in communication (for example, when it is a figure of speech that is unnecessarily ambiguous and obscure). Ambiguity means that information can have multiple meanings and can be misunderstood. Roundabout speech refers to using many words (such as [...] "a tool used for cutting things such as paper and hair") to describe something for which a concise (and commonly known) expression exists ("scissors"). The vast majority of definitions found in dictionaries are circumlocutory. Circumlocution is often used by people with aphasia and people learning a new language, where {{in the absence of a}} word (such as [...] "abuelo" [...] grandfather in Spanish) the subject can simply be described ("el padre de su padre" [...] the father of one's father). Euphemism, innuendo, and equivocation are different types of ambiguous and roundabout language, also called circumlocution.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to test the experimental conditions which lead to the best determination of the glenohumeral joint rotation centre in vivo with two shoulder circumductions (30 °, 130 ° abduction) and two relative displacements (humerus with respect to scapula or clavicle). Nine subjects perform <b>circumduction</b> movements of small magnitude. Three functional methods were used to estimate the glenohumeral joint rotation centre: Invariant Point (IP), Helical Axes (HA), Sphere-Fitting (SF), and. The dispersion of the CoR estimated for each method was calculated. The results have proved that the joint rotation centre obtained by each method is significantly different. In <b>circumduction</b> conditions, the distances between CoR estimated are less important for humerus/clavicle than humerus/scapula. For the relative displacement conditions, the distances between CoR estimated are less important for <b>circumduction</b> arm at 30 ° than <b>circumduction</b> arm at 130 °. The results have also revealed that the IP is more reliable than the other calculations as far as the dispersion criterion is concerned. Consequently, the <b>circumduction</b> with the arm at 30 ° of abduction (rather than 130 °) and considering the relative displacement of Humerus vs. Clavicle (rather than Humerus vs. Scapula) seems the more appropriate movement for the functional determination of the Glenohumeral joint centre...|$|E

40|$|Thumb {{rotation}} is {{an essential}} component of <b>circumduction</b> in order to achieve pulp to pulp contact. In order to evaluate opponensplasty, a device was developed to quantify thumb rotation utilizing a special jig to hold the hand and video analysis. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers (12 female and 15 male) were tested to obtain normative data. Thumb rotation was measured as the difference in angle between the thumb in abduction and extension and maximal <b>circumduction.</b> Rotation angles varied front 70 degrees to 110 degrees. No gender or right/left differences could be detected. We concluded that comparing rotation of the non-injured hand to the injured hand in evaluating opponensplasties can be used as an accurate measurement of thumb <b>circumduction</b> and opposition.

40|$|Although the orientations of {{the hand}} and forearm vary for {{different}} wrist rehabilitation protocols, their effect on muscle forces has not been quantified. Physiologic simulators enable a biomechanical evaluation of the joint by recreating functional motions in cadaveric specimens. Control strategies used to actuate joints in 5 physiologic simulators usually employ position or force feedback alone to achieve optimum load distribution across the muscles. After successful tests on a phantom limb, unique combinations of position and force feedback – hybrid control and cascade control – were used to simulate multiple cyclic wrist motions of flexion-extension, radioulnar deviation, dart thrower’s motion, and 10 <b>circumduction</b> using six muscles in ten cadaveric specimens. Low kinematic errors and coefficients of variation of muscle forces were observed for planar and complex wrist motions using both novel control strategies. The effect of gravity was most pronounced when the hand was in the horizontal orientation, resulting in higher extensor forces (p< 0. 017) and higher out-of-plane kinematic errors (p< 0. 007), {{as compared to the}} vertically 15 upward or downward orientations. Muscle forces were also affected by the direction of rotation during <b>circumduction.</b> The peak force of flexor carpi radialis was higher in clockwise <b>circumduction</b> (p= 0. 017), while that of flexor carpi ulnaris was higher in anticlockwise <b>circumduction</b> (p= 0. 013). Thus, the physiologic wrist simulator accurately replicated cyclic planar and complex motions in cadaveric specimens. Moreover, the dependence of muscle 20 forces on the hand orientation and the direction of <b>circumduction</b> could be vital in the specification of such parameters during wrist rehabilitation...|$|E

30|$|The <b>circumduction</b> {{motion of}} the wrist joint {{targeted}} for rehabilitation training herein is the action of moving the palm in a circular motion starting from the distal end of the ulna, as shown in Fig.  1 [7]. This “circumduction motion”, which {{is a combination of}} the palmar/dorsi flexion action and the radial/ulnar deviation action at the wrist joint, is a complex operation that simultaneously performs all the movements of the wrist joint, and has been adopted as a functional evaluation exercise for rehabilitation training. The device must satisfy all DOF of {{motion of the}} wrist joint to train the <b>circumduction</b> motion in the wrist joint. Furthermore, passive rehabilitation training requires the ability to move the palm, which typically weighs approximately 500  g (the body weight-corrected value for the palm assuming a body weight of 60  kg). The training device used in our proposed method satisfies the abovementioned conditions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} neck {{range of}} movement recording using three different methods goniometers (EGM), inclinometers (INC) and a three-dimensional video analysis system (IMG) in simultaneous and synchronized data collection. Twelve females performed neck flexion-extension, lateral flexion, rotation and <b>circumduction.</b> The differences between EGM, INC, and IMG were calculated sample by sample. For flexion-extension movement, IMG underestimated the amplitude by 13 %; moreover, EGM showed a crosstalk of about 20 % for lateral flexion and rotation axes. In lateral flexion movement, all systems showed similar amplitude and the inter-system differences were moderate (4 - 7 %). For rotation movement, EGM showed a high crosstalk (13 %) for flexion-extension axis. During the <b>circumduction</b> movement, IMG underestimated the amplitude of flexion-extension movements by about 11 %, and the inter-system differences were high (about 17 %) except for INC-IMG regarding lateral flexion (7 %) and EGM-INC regarding flexion-extension (10 %). For application in workplace, INC presents good results compared to IMG and EGM though INC cannot record rotation. EGM should be improved {{in order to reduce}} its crosstalk errors and allow recording of the full neck {{range of movement}}. Due to non-optimal positioning of the cameras for recording flexion-extension, IMG underestimated the amplitude of these movements. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
