25|$|In 1997, Limp Bizkit {{signed with}} Flip Records, a {{subsidiary}} of Interscope Records, and released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all to minimal response. Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A at Interscope. On October 23, 1997, Durst met the band Staind, but friction quickly emerged between the two over the cover art of Staind's album Tormented. Durst unsuccessfully attempted to remove Staind from a <b>concert</b> <b>bill</b> shortly before their performance, but after hearing the band play, he was so impressed that he signed them to Flip/Elektra, recorded a demo with the band, and co-produced their next album, Dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|The {{album is}} known for its graphic cover art. The cover depicts a bloody Barbie doll on a {{crucifix}} with nails hanging from a plastic frame, a buried person with a rosary protruding from the person's nose, and a knife impaling a Bible. This album cover appalled Limp Bizkit member Fred Durst so much that he attempted to remove Staind from a <b>concert</b> <b>bill</b> shortly before their performance. Durst thought that Staind were Theistic Satanists. Despite his attempts to stop the band from performing, Durst eventually changed his mind and allowed Staind to perform. After hearing Staind perform, Durst was so impressed that he signed them to Flip Records by February 1998. Durst produced Staind's second album Dysfunction (1999).|$|E

[...] Pearl Jam faced a relentless touring schedule for Ten. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band's Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters [...] decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of The Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the <b>concert</b> <b>bill.</b> Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that [...] "the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio." ...|$|E

500|$|Onstage tension {{began to}} grow between Kiedis and Frusciante. Kiedis {{recalled}} an argument after a show in New Orleans: [...] "We had a sold-out house and John just stood in the corner, barely playing his guitar. We came offstage and John and I got into it." [...] With the Peppers now playing shows at arenas rather than theaters, the promoters of the tour decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act. Kiedis contacted Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, {{and asked him if}} Nirvana would replace Pearl Jam on the tour—an offer Grohl accepted. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, however, refused to play with Nirvana as he once dated frontman Kurt Cobain's wife Courtney Love. The Pumpkins were, therefore, taken off the <b>concert</b> <b>bill</b> and replaced with Pearl Jam. Their first show with Nirvana was at the L.A Sports Arena. Kiedis considered their act to be [...] "raw energy; their musicality, their song selection, they were like a chain saw cutting through the night." [...] When the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished touring with Nirvana, they traveled to Europe, where Frusciante, in need of someone to connect to, brought along his girlfriend Toni Oswald. Kiedis said that [...] "John had broken our unwritten rule of no spouses or girlfriends on the road." [...] Briefly interrupting the European-tour, the Chili Peppers flew to New York City and performed on an episode of Saturday Night Live. The band played [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as the second number; a performance that Kiedis felt was sabotaged by Frusciante: ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{concerns}} about Diesel and Dust and Midnight Oil's attempts to express indigenous issues to white urban audiences - namely, the question [...] "who holds {{the power to}} tell whose history?"

Use of the bullroarer was criticised as belonging to sacred rituals, and therefore not appropriate for rock songs. [...] "The Dead Heart" [...] had been written in response to a request by organisers of the 1985 ceremony to return control of Uluru to its indigenous caretakers; Midnight Oil originally resisted being added to a <b>concert</b> <b>bill</b> that they believed should contain indigenous groups, but the organisers insisted, arguing that the band would reach a wider audience within the predominantly Caucasian urban centres. Midnight Oil requested that all royalties from the song go to indigenous communities. In addition, two indigenous groups, Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, toured with them.|$|E
60|$|Anne's {{mind was}} in a most {{favourable}} state for the entertainment of the evening; it was just occupation enough: she had feelings for the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least during the first act.
