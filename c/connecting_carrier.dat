50|$|When the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company of Chicago was {{incorporated}} in 1865 {{to consolidate the}} Chicago stock yards, its powers included {{the construction of a}} railroad outside the city limits (then Pershing Road and Western Avenue) to link the stock yards with the railroads entering Chicago south of Roosevelt Road.

In December 1865, the new Union Stock Yards and railroad opened, the latter beginning at the Illinois Central near 43rd Street and heading west, largely along 40th Street, to the Chicago and Great Eastern, and then turning north to parallel the latter company's line in Campbell Avenue until it reached the Chicago and North Western Railway at Ogden Avenue.

40|$|Chloroplasts are {{cytoplasmic organelles}} whose primary {{function}} is photosynthesis, {{but which also}} contain small, specialized and quasi-autonomous genetic systems. In photosynthesis, two energy converting photosystems are connected, electrochemically, in series. The <b>connecting</b> electron <b>carriers</b> are oxidized by photosystem I (PS I) and reduced by photosystem II (PS II). It has recently been shown that the oxidation reduction state of one <b>connecting</b> electron <b>carrier,</b> plastoquinone, controls transcription of chloroplast genes for reaction centre proteins of the two photosystems. The control counteracts the imbalance in electron transport that causes it: oxidized plastoquinone induces PS II and represses PS I; reduced plastoquinone induces PS I and represses PS II. This complementarity is observed both in vivo, using light favouring one or other photosystem, and in vitro, when site-specific electron transport inhibitors are added to transcriptionally and photosynthetically active chloroplasts. There is thus a transcriptional level of control that has a regulatory function {{similar to that of}} purely post-translational 'state transitions' in which the redistribution of absorbed excitation energy between photosystems is mediated by thylakoid membrane protein phosphorylation. The changes in rates of transcription that are induced by spectral changes in vivo can be detected even before the corresponding state transitions are complete, suggesting the operation of a branched pathway of redox signal transduction. These findings suggest a mechanism for adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry in which initial events involve a sensor of the redox state of plastoquinone, and may thus be the same as the initial events of state transitions. Redox control of chloroplast transcription is also consistent with the proposal that a direct regulatory coupling between electron transport and gene expression determines the function and composition of the chloroplast's extra-nuclear genetic system...|$|R
