40|$|Abstract: Cenomanian chalk–marl couplets from England {{represent}} the 20 ka Milankovitch precession cycle. Fossil communities from both <b>chalk</b> and <b>marl</b> are identified to test if the orbital fluctuations {{and the associated}} changes in substrate lithology and climate exerted any control on the benthic macrofauna. The material comprises washing residues of 24 bulk samples collected from <b>chalk</b> and <b>marl</b> half-cycles. A total of 5055 invertebrate specimens were retrieved and referred to 68 species, forming {{the basis for the}} recognition of six guilds. In general, the fauna is more diverse in <b>marl</b> than in <b>chalk,</b> but it is remarkable and somewhat surprising that the guild assemblages of <b>marl</b> and <b>chalk</b> show no difference. Thus the substrate character of the two lithologies did not exert any influence on the modes of life of the benthic fauna in spite of a difference in clay content of about 20 %. The fauna was clearly well adapted to both facies and thus to the fine grain size of the substrate rather than to lithology. The systematic difference in diversity between <b>chalk</b> and <b>marl</b> samples was possibly caused by long-term climatic and oceanographic changes and thus could represent a biological response to Milankovitch cyclicity. The Cenomanian chalk of the Anglo-Paris Basin is ideal {{for the study of the}} relationships between orbital cyclicity, sea-level changes and faunal variations. In SE England rhythmicall...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the many}} {{mosasaur}} remains collected worldwide, {{knowledge of the}} nature of their skin coverings remains in its early stages. Few mosasaurid specimens collected from around the world retain fossilized scale imprints. This lack {{may be due to the}} delicate nature of the scales, which nearly eliminates the possibility of preservation, in addition to the preservation sediment types and the marine conditions under which the preservation occurred. Until the discovery of several mosasaur specimens with remarkably well-preserved scale imprints from late Maastrichtian deposits of the Muwaqqar <b>Chalk</b> <b>Marl</b> Formation of Harrana in Jordan, knowledge {{of the nature of}} mosasaur integument was mainly based on very few accounts describing early mosasaur fossils dating back to the upper Santonian–lower Campanian, such as the famous Tylosaurus specimen (KUVP-1075) from Gove County, Kansas. Material from Jordan has shown that the bodies of mosasaurs, as well as the membranes between their fingers and toes, were covered with small, overlapping, diamond-shaped scales resembling those of snakes. Much like those of modern reptiles, mosasaur scales varied across the body in type and size. In Harrana specimens, two types of scales were observed on a single specimen: keeled scales covering the upper regions of the body and smooth scales covering the lower. As ambush predators, lurking and quickly capturing prey using stealth tactics, they may have benefited from the nonreflective, keeled scales.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-The Maastrichtian-Lower Eocene sediments on {{both sides}} of the {{northern}} Gulf of Suez can be subdivided into eight formal formations (including one group) and one informal formation that are described in detail. These lithostratigraphic units reflect three different environmental regimes of deposition or non-deposition. The first regime is characterised by uplift and erosion or non-deposition resulting mostly from the uplift of the Northern Galalal Wadi Araba structure, a branch of the Syrian Arc Foldbelt. The shallow water carbonate platform and slope deposits of the Late Campanian-Maastrichtian St Anthony Formation and the Paleocene-Lower Eocene Southern Galala and Garra Formations represent the second regime and are found north and south of the Northern Galala/Wadi Araba High. The third regime is represented by basinal <b>chalks,</b> <b>marls</b> and shales of the Maastrichtian Sudr Formation and of the Paleocene-Eocene Dakhla, Tarawan and Esna Formations, the Dakhla/Tarawan/ Esna informal formation and the Thebes Group. The distribution and lateral interfingering of the above mentioned environmental regimes reflect different vertical movements, changing basin morphology, sea level changes and progradation of shallow water sediments and is illustrated on 11 palaeogeographic maps. o 2001 Elsevier Science Limited.

2500|$|Given the {{previous}} survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route {{was investigated in}} the 1972–73 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible.

On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed [...] of [...] diameter tunnel to be driven.

In the 1986–87 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (<b>chalk</b> <b>marl</b> that made up 85% of the route) were investigated.

2500|$|On the English side, the stratum dip is {{less than}} 5°; on the French side this {{increases}} to 20°. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than [...] exist; on the French side, displacements of up to [...] are present owing to the Quenocs anticlinal fold. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the <b>chalk</b> <b>marl.</b> On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side.

2500|$|On the French side, {{owing to}} the greater {{permeability}} to water, earth pressure balance TBMs with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial , but then operated as open, boring through the <b>chalk</b> <b>marl</b> stratum. This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of [...] allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs. Six machines were used, all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels. Towards {{the completion of the}} undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled. A [...] gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.|$|E

2500|$|Precast {{segmental}} linings in {{the main}} TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key. On the French side, a [...] diameter [...] deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was [...] below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was first applied in the <b>chalk</b> <b>marl</b> here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff - same place as the marine tunnels - not from Folkestone. The platform {{at the base of}} the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary, which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the Foster Yeoman coastal super quarry at Glensanda in Loch Linnhe on the west coast of Scotland.|$|E

Over a 240-metre long section (70metres towards Britain, 170metres towards France), damage to the concrete extended {{as far back as the}} first set of reinforcement bars. Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further 190metres of tunnel length. In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and junction boxes over a length of 800metres. Five hundred metres of track had to be replaced, as did 800metres of overhead line, 800metres of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of 1,500metres.
