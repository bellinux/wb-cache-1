These clays include fireclays, ball <b>clays,</b> <b>and</b> <b>kaolins</b> (Grim 1968). Konta (1979) classified the kaolintic clays for ceramic industries according to their content of the total coloring oxides, i.e. Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2, into two categories; the first grade (Seger 1 clays) contains less than 1.2 % of the coloring oxides, e.g., China clay, which is suitable for production of white-ware ceramics, e.g., porcelain tableware <b>and</b> electrical insulators. <b>Clays</b> rich in kaolinite containing higher than 1.2 % of total Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 are classified as Seger 2 clays, which are adequate for manufacturing colored and heavy clay-based ceramics and aluminosilicate refractories.

These two factors induce a high chemical variability, not only in the output of a single production centre, but even in the paste of a single pot, to an extent to which chemical compositions from one"workshop", or even one"pot", could be classified as having different provenances.

40|$|Abstract. Slip is a semifluid clayey type of {{material}} used in the ceramic industry for coating earthware products, such as bricks and tiles, thus providing distinct surface colors or patterns. In the present work a characterization was conducted to identify the mineralogical as well the chemical and physical properties of geological materials existing in the slip used by industries in the north region {{of the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The basic natural materials composing a slip, namely <b>clay</b> <b>and</b> <b>kaolin,</b> are responsible for changes not only the slip plasticity but also in its viscosity and adhesion {{to the surface of the}} ceramic piece. The slip characterization was performed in terms of particle size analysis, Atterberg limits and actual grain density. The chemical composition was obtained by X-ray fluorescence and the thermal properties by differential thermal analysis. The results indicated that marked differences exist between slip from distinct origins. A few slip samples failed to present the required properties...|$|E
40|$|Agglomeration {{not only}} affects {{fluidization}} behaviors but also generates secondary pollutants. However, adding Al-related minerals such as <b>clay</b> <b>and</b> <b>kaolin</b> is an {{efficient way to}} control the agglomeration. Complex compositions of minerals may influence Al inhibition on agglomeration. Accordingly, this study is carried out to estimate the effect of A) inhibition on defluidization observed in a fluidized bed incinerator by using different Al/Na ratios. Emission of pollutants (organics and heavy metals) during the defluidization process is also considered. Several characterization studies (i. e. XRD, ESCA, and SEM/EDS) are applied to identify the eutectics from the agglomerates after defluidization. The results show that Al extends the defluidization time significantly with Al increasing. At various operating conditions, such as operating temperature, gas velocity, and particle size of bed materials, Al inhibits agglomeration by ten times delay with comparison to previous work. Moreover, concentration of organics emitted increases with operating time at the initial combustion step. After defluidization, the concentration of organics decreases apparently owing to combustion heat accumulated at the surface of the sand bed. The emission concentrations of three volatile heavy metals were similar before defluidization, but they sharply increased after the system formed defluidization. The amount of heavy metals emitted followed the order Pb>Cd>Cr at various operating conditions. Results of experiments in emissions of organics and heavy metals performed different behavior during defluidization processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of sand {{was found to}} be governed by its chemical properties rather than its physical properties. Hence, it is important to determine the geochemistry properties of sand besides its physical properties. The thermal applied on the bentonite and kaolin is one of the important external elements for changing soil mechanical characteristics based on mineralogy and stress-strain relationship. It is for considering of mineralogy and mechanical properties of bentonite and kaolin to development a better construction material. To evaluation of bentonite <b>clay</b> <b>and</b> <b>kaolin</b> behavior when subjected to the thermal, several laboratory tests have been conducted to analysis of bentonite characteristics. This project aimed on determining the strength of sand, mixed with 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % of bentonite and kaolin with and without thermal added the bentonite and Kaolin for 300 'C for one hour. Bentonite and kaolin, in powdered forms, was mix with sand and compacted at optimum moisture content. The strength of the compacted samples was determined from direct shear test. It was observed that the material of bentonite and kaolin increased the cohesion of sand. The result shows that 1 % bentonite 300 'C gives higher shear strength of sand. This shows that the bentonite can be used to increase the strength soil than kaolin. This due to the fine nature of the materials that could fill the voids in the mixture but also contribute to decrease in friction angles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to bridge the}} gap between the wellknown characteristics of strain rate-independent elastic stiffness and of the time-dependent behaviour of clays at large strains. Effects of acceleration, strain rate and ageing are examined in the very small to small strain region, using results from tests on reconstituted London <b>Clay</b> <b>and</b> <b>kaolin.</b> Static measurements of the shear modulus at small strains, using local instrumentation, indicate that the shear modulus is rate-independent when the soil is subjected to elastic deformations only. Most often, in practice, soil specimens are left to rest between the compression and shearing stages, until deformations associated with creep become negligible. The testing strain rate imposed upon shearing induces a temporary acceleration of strains, which results in very high measured stiffnesses. Test data show, however, that when the shearing axial strain rate is of the same order of magnitude as that measured at the end of the compression/creep stage, the remaining plastic creep strains influence the measured stiffness, which is then measured to be comparatively low. Test data also seem to show that temporary strain acceleration may hide effects of recent stress path rotation. Additionally, bender element tests were performed during isotropic compression tests with changes in stress rate and creep stages. The data indicate that the strain rate affects the value of the dynamic shear modulus of the soil. It is suggested that the increase in dynamic shear modulus during short-term creep is caused by mechanisms linked to the gradual decrease in strain rate during creep, but further investigation would be needed to clarify which physical mechanisms. A new method to account for strain rate in evaluating the dynamic shear modulus of normally consolidated reconstituted clays is finally proposed. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on soil behaviour {{has been the}} subject of many studies in recent years due to an increasing number of projects related to the application of high temperature to soil. One example is the construction of facilities for the disposal of hot high level nuclear waste canisters (150 - 200 C) several hundred meters underground in the clay formations. Despite this, the effects and mechanism by which temperature affects the soil properties and behaviour are not fully known. A limited amount of reliable experimental data, technological difficulties and experimental methods employed by different researchers could have contributed to the uncertainties surrounding the soil behaviour at elevated temperature. Also several thermo-mechanical models have been developed for soil behaviour, but their validity needs to be examined by reliable experimental data. In this research, efforts have been made to improve the experimental techniques. Direct displacement measuring devices have been successfully used for the first time to measure axial and lateral displacements of clay samples during tests at various temperatures. The thermo mechanical behaviour of two reconstituted clays has been investigated by performing triaxial and permeability tests at elevated temperature. Undrained and drained triaxial tests were carried out on normally consolidated and over consolidated samples of M 44 <b>clay</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kaolin</b> C 1 C under different effective stresses, and at temperatures between 22 C and 100 C. Permeability tests were carried out on samples of M 44 clay at temperatures between 22 C and 50 C. The effects of temperature on permeability, volume change, pore pressure development, shear strength and stiffness, stress strain response and critical state parameters for different consolidation histories have been investigated by comparing the results at various temperatures. The results are also compared with the predictions of two models. It has been found that at elevated temperature the shear strength, friction angle and initial small strain stiffness reduce whereas permeability increases. The slope of the swelling line in the v-p� plane has been found to reduce with temperature. The slope of the isotropic normal consolidation line (INCL) and critical state line (CSL) in the v-p� plane have been observed to be independent of temperature, but both the INCL and the CSL shift downwards to lower locations as temperature increases. The deformations during drained cooling and re heating cycles have been found to be elastic and to simply reflect the expansivity of the soils solid particles. The thermal volume changes during undrained heating have been observed to be direct results of the thermal expansion of water and clay particles. The internal displacement measuring devices have been found to produce reliable data for the variation of strains at elevated temperature...|$|E

The paddy soils of {{the regions of}} Fukuokashi-kinko, Chikuho, Chikuzen-hokubu, and Chikuzenseibu which are derived from granitic material were characterized by the low <b>clay</b> content () <b>and</b> by <b>kaolin</b> mineral as the predominant clay mineral (50 - 70 % in the clay fraction). The paddy soils of the region of Chikushi-heiya which are derived mainly from crystalline schist contained relatively high amounts of chlorite <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> mica in the clay fraction. Regional distribution of the clay mineralogical composition is helpful to make a clay mineralogical map of Fukuoka prefecture {{for the evaluation of}} potential paddy-rice production and of the soil-conserving ability. 土壌環境基礎調査で集められた, 福岡県福岡市近郊, 筑紫平野, 筑豊, 筑前北部および筑前西部地域の水田土壌の粘土含量を測定し, 粘土画分の層状ケイ酸塩粘土鉱物を同定した. 粘土鉱物組成と粘土含量に基づき, 89 地点の試料の粘土鉱物組成区分を行った. 福岡市近郊, 筑豊, 筑前北部および筑前西部地域の土壌は, 花崗岩質の母材を反映して, 粘土含量 300 gkg^ 以下, 粘土画分中 50 ～ 70 %のカオリン鉱物を含み, 低粘土含量, カオリン鉱物主で特徴づけられた. 随伴鉱物の違いに伴い, 粘土鉱物組成区分には, 地域および地区により多少とも相違がみられた. 筑前北部地域の第三紀堆積岩由来堆積物を母材とする土壌では, 高い含量のスメクタイトが同定された. 一方, 筑紫平野地域の水田土壌は結晶片岩由来の堆積物に主に由来すると思われ, 相対的に多量の緑泥石, 2 : 1 型鉱物―緑泥石中間種鉱物, 雲母粘土鉱物を含んでいた. 今までに分析してきた他の地域の結果と合わせて, 福岡県全体を通しての水田土壌の粘土鉱物組成区分に基づく粘土鉱物組成図の作成は, 潜在物な水稲生産力並びに土壌の環境保全能を評価するうえで有用である...|$|R
