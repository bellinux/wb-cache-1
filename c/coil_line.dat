Wear {{debris in}} {{hydraulic}} oil causes {{most of the}} faults of hydraulic system and {{is also an important}} information carrier, so it is essential to check the condition of wear debris in hydraulic oil. On the basis of inductive principle and microfluidic chip technology, the design of a microfluidic chip of oil detection is presented in this paper. the relation between coil geometry parameters and inductive change of planar inductor are analyzed through the related experimental statistics, the result being that when the ferrous metallic particle flows through planar inductor, the measured inductance variation increases with the number of turns and decreases with the <b>coil</b> <b>line</b> width...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic hot {{embossing}} is {{an emerging}} technology enabling molding of thermo-plastic polymers in seconds. A stack of polymer foils is heated by the {{friction between the}} foils and protruding microstructures on a tool when ultrasonic vibrations are generated by a sonotrode. The polymer is molten and adapts {{to the shape of}} the microstructures on the tool. Thus, a micro structure is generated in much shorter time than by injection molding or hot embossing. The objective of this work was investigating how tools for ultrasonic hot embossing can be fabricated and what is the influence of the tool on the process. How the embossing energy is distributed in the whole process is briefly discussed in this thesis. When ultrasound is generated, the induced energy is mainly transferred to and absorbed in sonotrode, polymer stack, tool and anvil. At the interfaces, ultrasound is reflected and, this way, re-contributing to heat generation. Ultrasonic energy distribution analyses are based on temperature measurements in the embossing tools and dimension measurements on the embossed polymer micro structures. Embossing tools from aluminum, nickel, steel, polycarbonate (PC) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) were produced and embossed with high density polyethylene (HDPE). The cooling rates of different tools are compared while the energy distributed into embossed polymer and embossing tool was roughly calculated. Embossing tools with larger acoustic impedance compared to the embossed polymer reflect more ultrasound back to the polymer for melting. Embossing tools with higher heat conduction result in a faster cooling rate after embossing while with less heat capacity and density a higher peak temperature is achieved. The isolation at the interface between embossing tool and anvil affects the tool temperature and its cooling rate. Consequently, aluminum is more suitable for the sonotrode while nickel and steel are suitable for the tool. Embossing tools from PC and PEEK have shown limited lifetimes for ultrasonic hot embossing and, therefore, are no appropriate alternative. Various ways have been attempted to fabricate ultrasonic hot embossing tools. They are milling, nickel electroplating, lithography and silicon etching. New combinations of these ways were also developed to fabricate a tool with multi-level structures or enlarge the tool size. The operating steps, process parameters, challenges, precautions, advantages and disadvantages of these fabrication ways are discussed and compared. Among them, milling is the most promising way producing embossing tools allowing three-dimensional micro structures, up to more than several hundred micrometers in height and down to 50 µm in width. Besides, nickel electroplating was applicable to produce the tools with structure dimensions of less than 50 µm. The templates for electroplating were prepared by lithography and silicon etching. Liquid metals were also prepared to be employed as embossing tool. Their performance and the reasons of failure are discussed. Several micro devices were developed and fabricated demonstrating the fabrication of tools for ultrasonic hot embossing of three-dimensional micro structures. Design idea, production process and performance are introduced. A Fresnel lens was produced by ultrasonic hot embossing for the first time. Micro nozzles, 150 and 250 µm in diameter, which were used for gas/liquid dispersion, were produced by ultrasonic hot embossing and welding. The nozzle could sustain pressures as high as 29 MPa and 2. 5 MPa at 20 °C and 90 °C, respectively. The multi-phase dispersing ability was also proven. An electronic spiral coil forming a molded interconnect device (MID) was fabricated by ultrasonic hot embossing. The surface of the coil was not flat but bowed and the <b>coil</b> <b>line</b> was distributed along a three-dimensional spiral curve. The calculated and measured resonance frequencies of this coil combined with a capacitor were 1. 6 MHz and 1. 65 MHz, respectively. Several polymer surfaces were embossed with tools fabricated by x-ray lithography and electroplating of nickel and milling of aluminum with different structures designs for hydrophobic surfaces. The wettability of the embossed surface was investigated by contact angle measurements. The polymer surface embossed from the x-ray lithography and electroplating of nickel tool turned out being more hydrophobic than the one embossed from the aluminum tool. The contact regimes of the embossed surface from the two embossing tools were also theoretically analyzed. The last application was the ultrasonic hot embossing of nano-structures, 600 nm in height, on PC and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly (lactic acid) foils. The challenges and the solutions in ultrasonic hot embossing with this tool are introduced. Finally, the nanostructures were successfully embossed into these polymers...|$|E

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2016 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Elektrik tüketiminin artışı ve elektrik güç şebekesinin sürekli olarak büyümesi arıza akımlarının artmasını da beraberinde getirmektedir. Bu arızaları gidermek amacıyla kullanılan mevcut kesiciler ve koruma elemanları yeterli olmamakta ve şebekenin sağlıklı işleyişine devam edebilmesi için, oluşan bu arıza akımlarının koruma elemanlarının giderebileceği seviyeye sınırlandırılması gerekmektedir. Arıza akımı sınırlandırıcılarının (AAS) arızanın oluşmadığı normal çalışma durumlarında (ND), görünmez olmaları gerekmekle birlikte minimum güç tüketmeleri de beklenir. Bu şartları sağlamak için, arıza akımını sınırlaması istenen cihazın içerdiği nüvenin sürekli olarak doyumda olması gerekliliği söz konusudur. Böylece, bu tür AAS’lar doymuş bölge içerisinde görünmez olmakla birlikte bağlı oldukları şebekeden çektikleri güç miktarı da minimum seviyede kalmaktadır. Bu tez çalışmasında, özellikle doymuş nüveli arıza akımı sınırlayıcı tasarımı ele alınarak bu tasarımda karşılaşılan soruna argüman üretilme yoluna gidilmiştir. Bu kapsamda öncelikle, nüvenin hiçbir şekilde doyuma ulaştırılmayarak veya doyuma ulaşmamış bölgede çalıştırıldığı halde şebekeye karşı görünmez olup olamayacağı sorusunun cevabı araştırılmıştır. Bunun başarılması durumunda, nüvenin doyuma ulaşmasına gerek kalmayacak ve böylelikle bu görevi gören sürekli mıknatıslara ve/veya bobinin doğru akım (DA) ile sürekli olarak ikaz edilmesine gerek kalmayacaktır. Literatür araştırmaları sonucunda, doymamış bölge içerisinde başlangıç geçirgenliği olarak bilinen, manyetik alan şiddeti değerinin düşük miktarda olduğu bir bölgede düşük manyetik geçirgenliğe sahip düşük karbonlu çelik SAE 1020 vb. malzemelerin varlığı tespit edilmiş ve bu tez çalışması için ortaya konan argümanı destekleyecek değerlere sahip olduğu belirlenmiştir. Bu malzemelerin başlangıç manyetik geçirgenlikleri aynı zamanda hemen hemen sabit kabul edilebilir değerlere sahiptir. Bunun sonucunda, tespit edilen nüve malzemelerinin normal çalışma durumunda başlangıç geçirgenliği bölgesinde çalıştırılıp çalıştırılamayacağı konusu üzerinde durulmuştur. Bu amaçla, başlangıç manyetik geçirgenliğine sahip nüveli arıza akımı sınırlayıcı tasarımının şekli, boyutları ve ilgili parametreleri hesaba katılarak Maxwell sonlu elemanlar programında benzetimi gerçekleştirilmiştir. Elde edilen sonuçlar değerlendirildiğinde benzetimlerin ortaya konan argümanı destekleyici nitelikte olduğu görülmüştür. Başlangıçta gerçekleştirilen benzetimlerde girilen değerlere bağlı olarak tasarımların boyutları böyle bir arıza akımı sınırlayıcının uygulanabilirliğini pratik açıdan kısıtlayıcı nitelikte olmuştur. Bunun üstesinden gelmek için, tasarımda ve parametreler üzerinde değişikliklere gidilerek boyutların küçültülmesine çalışılmıştır. Boyutları küçültmek amacıyla nüveye hava boşluğu eklenmesi değerlendirilmiştir. Hava boşluğunun eklenmesi, nüvenin boyutlarını azaltmakla birlikte, arıza akımı sınırlama performansını da kötüleştirdiği ortaya çıkmıştır. Ancak, yapılan tasarımlarda hava ve nüve bileşenlerinden oluşan nüvenin sadece havadan oluşan nüveye göre daha iyi bir performans sergilediği gözlenmiştir. To {{meet the}} need of {{increase}} in electrical energy consumption and generation, setting parallel transmission lines up and existing of complex system {{as a result of}} addition of distributed generation sources to grid concludes increase in fault current levels. The increase of fault currents in this way causes the problems of the need to increase of withstand values of power electronics components, the danger occurred on power system hardware caused by higher mechanical forces and excess heating of transformer and the other components. In the case of clearing these increased faults, circuit breakers and similar protection devices are not providing the demanded limitation. Several types of solutions are proposed for this. These solutions are increasing capacity of circuit breakers, bus splitting and sequential breaker opening etc. The solution of increasing capacity of circuit breakers is not feasible because it requires so many of breakers to be changed. Bus splitting causes the loads not to be feeded by power sources in normal case of operation and requires developing additional control methods. Sequential breaker opening increases the total time to clear the fault current. Because of these problems, the fault current limiter usage motivation has been formed. Fault current limiters are expected to be activated so fast so that they can limit first peak of fault current. To make this happen, fault current limiters (FCL) using superconducting material naturally and hysterically passes into normal resistive mode fastly. Some FCL types which uses some switching elements uses magnetic field that is generated by parallel coil connected to them. This type of FCLs can use superconducting module which is missioned to switch the fault current to parallel <b>coil</b> <b>line.</b> Thanks to this method, superconducting material’s recovery period is so small that makes it available for other fault current. Also, superconducting element cooling capacity has been decreased by this method. The other method which uses flux-locking method also can have superconducting element or not. In this physical phenomenon, core that is used in design is “locked” by magnetic fluxes with opposite directions to each other and thus no magnetic flux can flow in the core material. As a result of that, the coil that is wounded to core “see” no reactance and becomes invisible to grid. At fault current mode of operation, one of these opposite magnetic fluxes beat the other and no longer the equality of magnetic fluxes happen. Because this change activates so fast, triggering into high reactance mode becomes so quickly that first peak of fault current is limited. FCLs are also expected to consume minimum energy and to drop minimum voltage across its terminal during the normal operation so that they become invisible in the grid. To ensure that, for example saturated core fault current limiters needs to be in saturated condition continuously. In this way, they are invisible with little energy consumption in saturated region for normal mode of operation. However, continuously saturating the cores causes continuous energy consumption from a DC supply or need to have superconducting cables. These requirements cause operating and/or installation costs to increase. This thesis work aims to eliminate the need to saturate cores. In this context primarily, {{the answer to the question}} that if design could be invisible or not without saturating the core or by operating the core in unsaturated region is researched. In the case of successing this, the need to saturate the core will be unnecessary and thus there will be no need to use permanent magnets and/or to continuously excite DC coils. From the literature search; some materials that have low magnetic permeability for low magnetic field intensity values which also named initial permeability region are identified. Initial magnetic permeability values of these materials would be accepted to have constant values for low magnetic induction. Firstly, low carbon SAE 1020 material is used and it is tried to be understood if this material could be operated in initial magnetic permeability region for normal mode of operation. For this purpose, shape, dimensions and related parameters of design are determined via calculation methods supporting the necessity of voltage drop to be in constraints and core operation curve to be in initial magnetic permeability region in normal mode of operation. This obtained design is simulated in MAXWELL program which uses finite element method. When obtained results are evaluated, simulations are observed to support the argument we had in beginning. Then, different core materials that are projected or not to be used in initial magnetic permeability region for normal mode of operation have been simulated. When resulted voltage drop and fault current limiting values are considered, low carbon SAE 1020 material is decided to have the best simulation results that satisfies the argument. At first simulations, design dimensions are observed to be useless from the point of practical usage. To overcome this, it was tried to reduce design on size by making definite changes on design and its parameters. In order to reduce the size of design, addition of some air gaps into core is evaluated. Adding some air gap reduced the size of core dimensions however this procedure worsened the fault current limiting performance. Although resulting this performance decrease in the FCL by introducing air gap, this core design shows better performance than air core coil. Same simulation studies are carried out using other some certain core materials without change on design parameters and as a result of air gap in core material dominating the core material, performance outputs on simulations are not significantly different than one another. In addition, the design with air gap is compared to saturated core FCL about fault current limiting device performance criterias and it has been observed that this design performance is worse than saturated type. Also, simulations are carried out to inspect the effect of power consumption in daily hours on same design. This change on power consumption in daily hours is inspected to cause the voltage drop on FCL. As a result of this inspection, least voltage is observed to drop in night period and most voltage is observed to drop in peak period. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
