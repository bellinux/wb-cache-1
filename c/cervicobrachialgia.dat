50|$|Mesotherapy {{treatments}} {{have been}} performed throughout Europe, South America, and more recently the United States for over fifty years. However physicians have expressed concern over the efficacy of mesotherapy, arguing that the treatment hasn't been studied {{enough to make a}} determination. The primary issue is that mesotherapy for the treatment of cosmetic conditions hasn't been the subject of gold standard clinical trials; however the procedure has been studied for the pain relief of other ailments, such as tendonitis, tendon calcification, dental procedures, cancer, <b>cervicobrachialgia,</b> arthritis, lymphedema, and venous stasis. Further, there have been case series and numerous medical papers on the mesotherapy as a cosmetic treatment, as well as studies that employ the ingredients used in mesotherapy.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{neck and}} arm pain or <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> {{commonly}} occurs with the degeneration of cervical spine. Authors investigated {{the usefulness of}} radiofrequency (RF) neurotomies of cervical medial branches in patients with <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> and analyzed the factors which can influence the treatment outcome. Demographic data, types of pain distribution, responses of double controlled blocks, electrical stimulation parameters, numbers and levels of neurotomies, and surgical outcomes were evaluated after mean follow-up of 12 months. Pain distribution pattern was not significantly correlated {{with the results of}} diagnostic blocks. Average stimulation intensity was 0. 45 V, ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 69, to elicit pain response in cervical medial branches. The most common involvement of nerve branches was C 4 (89 %), followed by C 5 (82 %), C 6 (75 %), and C 7 (43 %). Among total of 28 patients, nineteen (68 %) reported successful outcome according to outcome criteria after 6 months of follow-up (p= 0. 001), and eight (42 %) of 19 patients reported complete relief (100 %) of pain. Four patients showed recurrence of pain between 6 and 12 months. It was therefore concluded that cervical medial branch neurotomy is considered useful therapeutic modality for the management of <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> in selected patients, particularly in degenerative zygapophyseal disorders...|$|E
40|$|The classic <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> results acutely from {{cervical}} {{nerve root}} compression by disc herniation or subacutely by radicular compression after progressive spondylotic {{changes of the}} cervical spine. The clinical presentation includes local and radiating pain syndromes that can be accompanied by sensorimotor deficits. Besides the medical history and a targeted clinical examination, supplementary radiographic means should be undertaken to confirm diagnosis. If no urgent surgical indication exists, conservative therapy should be initiated. However, with varying results of conservative and surgical therapy, chronic impairment can occur...|$|E
40|$|Twenty eight {{patients}} with unilateral cervical radiculopathy were studied by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from nerve stimulation at {{the wrist and}} from skin stimulation at the first, third or fifth finger depending on the root involved. In order to evaluate the reliability of various "radicular SEP patterns" {{as described in the}} literature, absolute latencies and side-to-side differences of the brachial plexus component from the supraclavicular fossa (N 9), the medullary component (N 13) from the cervical vertebra Cv 7, and the primary cortical component (N 20, P 25) were assessed. Side-to-side differences of the amplitudes of N 20 /P 25 and of the conduction times across the intervertebral fossa (interval N 9 -N 13) were analysed. After nerve stimulation, 68 % of the patients had false negative findings on the symptomatic, while 36 % had positive findings on the asymptomatic side. After segmental stimulation, 72 % of the patients had false negative findings on the symptomatic, while 22 % had positive findings on the asymptomatic side. It is concluded that SEPs following nerve and segmental stimulation do not reliably confirm clear-cut already established diagnoses of unilateral radiculopathy with sensory and motor deficit. Therefore, they will not be helpful in the electrophysiological investigation of <b>cervicobrachialgias</b> of unknown origin...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} no {{conflict}} of interest for this study. Case report—A case of cervical metastases in a patient with preexisting cervical disc replacement and fusion (…) Recurrent cervical symptoms frequently occur after cervical disc replacement and fusion. To date, no algorithm for the diagnostic assessment of these symptoms has been established. We present a case report and {{review of the literature}} to illustrate the need for interdisciplinary diagnostics in recurrent cervico-brachialgia without pathological cervical imaging. The hospital chart, medical history, physical examina-tion, and imaging of a single patient were reviewed. A 53 -year-old man with preexisting cervical disc replacement and fusion presented with a new episode of <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> after a 2 -year symptom-free interval. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no pathological findings. Six months later the patient reported increasing symptoms including numbness and weakness of the right arm. Repeated cervical MRI and thoracic computed tomography revealed cervical metastases with intraspinal tumor growth and an underlying extensive small cell bronchial carcinoma. In recurrent <b>cervicobrachialgia,</b> without pathological cervical imaging, interdisciplinary diagnostics are needed. Basic diagnostic tests may assist to exclude severe non-vertebrogenic pathologies. 51 — 56 A case of cervical metastases in a patient with preexisting cervical disc replacement and fusion after 2 -year symptom-free interval: when do we need interdisciplinary diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Monostotic fibrous {{dysplasia}} of {{the spine}} is a rare entity. Only 26 cases, of which 11 were located in the cervical spine, {{are to be found}} in the literature. We report a 56 -year-old male patient with <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> of half year's duration. Radiographs showed a diffuse destruction of the vertebral body and the spinous process of C 4. A biopsy of the spinous process confirmed histopathologically a fibrous dysplasia. Due to minor symptoms, no surgical treatment was performed or is planned unless in case of increasing pain, an acute instability or neurological symptoms...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{adjacent}} segment degeneration following spinal fusion new techniques are being used. Lumbar disc arthroplasty yields mid term results equivalent to those of spinal fusion. Cervical disc arthroplasty is indicated {{in the treatment of}} <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> with encouraging initial results. The ability of arthroplasty to prevent adjacent segment degeneration has yet to be proven. Although dynamic stabilization had not been proven effective in treating chronic low back pain, it might be useful following decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis in degenerative spondylolisthesis. Interspinal devices are useful in mild lumbar spinal stenosis but their efficacy in treating low back pain is yet to be proven. Confronted with a growing number of new technologies clinicians should remain critical while awaiting long term results...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} an 11 -year-old female {{with a history}} of <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> and {{progressive}} weakness of the right arm. Cervical spine MRI showed an enhancing heterogeneous intradural mass occupying the right C 6 -C 7 foramen. She underwent a right C 6 -C 7 foraminotomy with a complete macroscopic removal of the lesion. Pathological examination revealed a synovial sarcoma. Treatment was completed by chemotherapy and proton radiotherapy, and the girl remained free of symptoms for 3 years. After appearance of new symptoms, a local recurrence was confirmed, and despite aggressive treatment with salvage chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the disease progressed beyond medical control, and the child died, 6 years after diagnosis. Early recognition of this rare entity compared to its more benign differential diagnosis is crucial, as an aggressive management is needed...|$|E
40|$|ROENTGENOLOGICALLY and pathologically, {{cervical}} discopathy is char-acterized by: decrease, loss or {{reversal of}} the physiologic lordotic curvature of the cervical spine, thinning and protrusion of an intervertebral disk, herniation of nucleus pulposus, increased vertebral mobility, vertebral dis-placement, apophyseal subluxation, constriction and deformation of the inter-vertebral foramina, hypertrophy of the yellow ligaments, and new bone formation involving apophyseal joints and adjacent vertebrae (discoosteo-phytosis). A cervical nerve root may suffer irritation or pressure {{as a result of}} any of the following pathologic changes of the cervical spine: disc protrusion or herniation; hypermobility, displacement and osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae adjacent to the pathologic disc. Due to the foregoing, cervical discopathy may produce a clinical syn-drome characterized by segmental sensory, motor and reflex changes. These include <b>cervicobrachialgia,</b> diminution of cutaneous sensibility, decreased muscle power, muscular wasting, and diminution of deep muscle reflexes...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} 31 -year-old female who was {{admitted}} to our neurology department for vertigo, partial left-sided hemihypesthesia and nuchal headache of subacute onset. Colour-duplex ultrasound disclosed bilateral low flow with a high resistance flow pattern in both vertebral arteries in the V 2 segments, while the basilar artery had normal flow. CT angiography and MRI ruled out any ischaemic cerebral infarct and disclosed a persistent hypoglossal artery (PHA) originating from the left internal carotid artery (ICA). The patient was eventually treated for <b>cervicobrachialgia.</b> Persistent carotid-basilar anastomosis such as PHA may account for an atypical stroke pattern in carotid disease, aneurysms and arterovenous malformations. In retrospect, PHA is amendable to colour-Duplex investigation due to an abnormal ICA flow and a discrepancy between the vertebral and basilar flow patterns. Ultrasound investigation of the vertebrobasilar system remains a challenge as variants appear frequently; hypoplasia of the vertebral arteries should thus be confirmed using CT or MR angiography...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous spinal {{epidural}} haematoma (SSEH) {{is widely}} recognised throughout the literature {{as a cause}} of myelopathy, radicular compression being very rarely reported. Surgical management is almost always recommended, especially in the cases of spinal cord compression. Conservative treatment is reported as a curiosity and only in the case of spontaneous improvement. This report presents the particular case of a 64 -year-old patient undergoing anticoagulant therapy that had a cervical radiculopathy due to a SSEH confirmed by MRI. The patient improved spontaneously and symptoms were solved with unconventional conservative treatment and without stopping the anticoagulant therapy. Conclusions: Spontaneous epidural haematoma must be kept in mind when patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy have a sudden onset of <b>cervicobrachialgia.</b> Even though most spinal surgeons advocate surgical treatment, a conservative approach may lead to a complete recovery and may be considered as a good option in the case of radicular involvement. Discontinuation of the anticoagulant therapy may not always be needed, especially when the clinical syndrome improves spontaneously...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of post-isometric relaxation (PIR) on pressure pain treshold and vibrotactile theshold in the area of myofascial trigger point. Methods: The change in pressure pain threshold and vibrotactile treshold was taken from the area above myofascial trigger point number one trapezius muscle - pars ascendens, and the vibration treshold at dorsum of metacarpal bone of the index finger. Fifty myofascial trigger points were examined (twenty-four from a group of probands with chronic cervicalgia or <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> syndrome, twenty-six in the control group). Results: The pressure pain threshold and vibrotactile threshold did not change after the PIR in the group of patients. But the threshold of vibration sense significantly decreased (nearly by 18 %, p = 0. 001). The result was opposite in the control group. Pressure pain threshold increased by 11 % (p < 0. 001) and vibrotactile threshold fell by almost 16 % (p = 0. 001). Vibration threshold did not change. Conclusions: The study confirmed that PIR can affect not only the pressure pain treshold, but also vibrotactile and even vibration treshold. PIR revealed an alteration to pain perception, vibrotactile and vibratin sensation in the group of patients. This alteration had not been obvious (visible) before [...] ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: To {{investigate}} the effect and complications after transforaminal injection for <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> caused by cervical disc herniation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing fluoroscopy-guided transforaminal injection for radiculopathy caused by cervical disc herniation. During {{the last seven}} years, 57 patients (39 female, 18 male, mean age 45. 6 years) experiencing cervical radiculopathy underwent cervical foraminal block guided by fluoroscopy by postero-lateral approach. The position of the needle was verified after injection of {{a small amount of}} contrast. A glucocorticosteroid was injected after 0. 5 ml of 2 % lidocaine. Results: The local with the highest prevalence of procedures was C 6 root (31 procedures); 14 patients underwent C 7 block, 7 had C 5 block, and 5 in C 4. Eight patients (14 %) had complications (3 syncopes, 3 transient hoarseness, one patient had worsening of symptoms and one patient had soft tissue hematoma). In total, 42. 1 % were asymptomatic after the procedure and therefore did not require surgery after the procedure. Other 57. 9 % had transient improvement, became asymptomatic for at least 2 months but required surgery due to the recurrence of symptoms. Conclusion: Cervical foraminal block for cervical disc herniation is a safe way to avoid surgery. Some patients still need surgery after the procedure, but the temporary improvement in symptoms gives the patient some relief while awaiting surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Motor {{conduction}} velocity may yield false-negative results in mild ulnar nerve entrapment at elbow (UNE). There {{is evidence that}} the clinical heterogeneity of UNE {{may be due to the}} different involvement of fascicles. We hypothesized that, if fibres to FDI are more damaged than fibres to ADM, a relative slowing of motor {{conduction velocity}} (CV) at the segment across the elbow recording from FDI (FDI-CV) versus CV at the same segment recording from ADM (ADM-CV) would occur. Methods: We calculated the ratio between FDI-CV and ADM-CV (IN-RATIO) in 60 consecutive UNE patients, 40 norms, and 16 patients with lower cervical radiculopathy. The UNE sample consisted of (1) patients with neurophysiological evidence (UNE NF+), (2) patients without neurophysiological evidence (UNE NF-). We evaluated the possible usefulness of the IN-RATIO to increase sensitivity in diagnosing UNE. Results: The IN-RATIO was lower in the UNE NF- than in norms (p < 0. 001) and <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> sample (p = 0. 02). We found that if the IN-RATIO is <= 0. 97, its sensitivity in diagnosing UNE NF- is 68 %, specificity 91 %. Conclusions: Fibres to FDI have a higher susceptibility to damage than fibres to ADM, and the IN-RATIO is a useful neurophysiological parameter to increase diagnostic sensitivity. Significance: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of a new neurophysiological parameter in improving diagnosis of UNE. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{present the}} results of {{treatment}} of patients with cervical discopathy by anterior cervical approach, discectomy and placement of a PEEK interbody cage without anterior plate fixation. Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional study from March 2013 to March 2015. Sixteen patients with radiculopathy or clinical signs of myelopathy were included; all patients underwent cervical surgery through anterior approach, discectomy, and placement of PEEK cages on three levels. Decompression levels were determined according to the correlation between preoperative radiological and clinical findings. Results: Sixteen patients predominantly male were included, with mean age of 50 years {{at the onset of}} the condition. Ten patients had involvement of C 4 -C 5, C 5 -C 6, C 6 -C 7 levels, and six patients C 3 -C 4, C 4 -C 5 and C 5 -C 6. Fourteen patients had <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> and two myelopathy. The preoperative visual analog scale average was 8 / 10 and the average postoperative value at 6 months was 3 / 10. At 6 months, there was no radiological evidence of recurrence. One patient had non-fatal complications. Conclusions: The treatment of cervical discopathy by anterior approach with interbody fusion with PEEK cage on three levels, with no plate fixation seemed to be safe and effective with better long-term results in terms of pain and myelopathy. The clinical results compare favorably with other similar series and, most importantly, the complications associated with anterior fixation plate are avoided...|$|E
40|$|Thymoma and thymic {{carcinoma}} {{are rare}} epithelial tumors, which originate from the thymus gland. According to the World Health Organization there are "organotypic" (types A, AB, B 1, B 2, and B 3) and "non-organotypic" (thymic carcinomas) thymomas. Type B 3 thymomas are aggressive tumors, which can metastasize. Due to the rarity of these lesions, only 7 cases of extradural metastasis {{are described in}} the literature. We report the first and unique case {{of a man with}} cervical intradural B 3 thymoma metastasis. A 46 -year-old man underwent thymoma surgical removal. The year after the procedure he was treated for a parietal pleura metastasis. In 2006 he underwent cervical-dorsal extradural metastasis removal and C 5 -Th 1 stabilization. Seven years after he came to our observation complaining left <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> and a reduction of strength of the left arm. He underwent a cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a new lesion at the C 5 -C 7 level. The patient underwent a surgery for the intradural B 3 thymoma metastasis. Neurological symptoms improved although the removal was subtotal. He went through postoperative radiation therapy with further mass reduction. Spinal metastases are extremely rare. To date, only 7 cases of spinal extradural metastasis have been described in the literature. This is the first case of spinal intradural metastasis. Early individuation of these tumors and surgical treatment improve neurological outcome in patients with spinal cord compression. A multimodal treatment including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiation therapy seems to improve survival in patients with metastatic thymoma...|$|E
40|$|Background. Clinical neurophysiologists {{observe a}} large number of examinees {{referred}} to a electromyographic (EMG) laboratory without clinical symptoms or signs of the peripheral nervous system lesion. Such referrals do not improve management of patients, but only unnecessarily burden examinees and laboratory personnel. The aim {{of the present study was}} to check appropriateness of referrals to electrodiagnostic examination, look for reasons for problems and suggest possible improvements. Methods. From the database of the Institute of Clinical Neurophysiology in Ljubljana all examinees evaluated by the author in a »general« EMG laboratory in the first 4 months of 2002 were included. From data about examinees, referral doctors, referral diagnoses, clinical symptoms and signs and electrophysiological findings, predictive values for neurological referral diagnoses and electrodiagnostic abnormalities were calculated using descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses. Results. Three hundred examinees (42 % men) were included. Neurological diagnosis was provided in 55 % of referrals. Electrodiagnostic abnormalities were found in 45 % of examinees (carpal tunnel syndrome 50 %, radiculopathy 25 %, other mononeuropathies 15 %, polineuropathy 9 %). In 9 % of examinees only clinical, and in 47 % neither clinical nor electrodiagnostic abnormalities were demonstrated. Using a multivariate analysis positive effect of referral with neurological diagnosis, of paraesthesiae and findings of weakness and sensory loss, and negative effect of pain and referral diagnosis <b>cervicobrachialgia</b> or lumboischialgia on pathological electrodiagnostic findings were found. Isolated pain and paraesthesiae (with carpal tunnel syndrome excluded) were particularly poor predictors of abnormal electrodiagnostic findings (9 % and 16 %, respectively). With exception of 20 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, none with normal clinical neurological examination had abnormal electrodiagnostic findings. Conclusions. Our study confirmed inappropriateness of electrodiagnostic examination as a screening tool for the peripheral nervous system lesions. Inappropriate referrals were due to poor evaluation of examinees before referral, and due to use of electrodiagnosis in screening of patients. We propose electrodiagnostic examination only of patients with unequivocal clinical signs of the peripheral nervous system lesion, and of patients with typical symptoms of the carpal tunnel syndrome. Referrals should include neurological diagnostic question and all relevant clinical data. This would reduce waiting time, save money, and improve evaluation of patients with peripheral nervous system lesions. </p...|$|E
