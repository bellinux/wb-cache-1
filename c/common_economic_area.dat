This paper aims to argue that the CEEA is not only a positive development for the economic growth of Russia, but that it is a condition for the country’s sustainable growth and productivity increase.

His opinion for the single currency and its economic base is that it won’t be stable when the countries do not work together on issues of economic and budgetary nature.|$|R
40|$|The {{stock market}} {{has been known to}} form {{homogeneous}} stock groups with a higher correlation among different stocks according to <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> factors that influence individual stocks. We investigate the role of <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> factors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage pricing model reflecting essential properties of <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> factors. We find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks increases as additional <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> factors are incorporated into our model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> factors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of deterministic factors. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1954 Nebraska Census of Agriculture divided Nebraska {{into eight}} <b>economic</b> <b>areas.</b> These <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> were {{determined}} {{by the type of}} agriculture prevalent in each. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 1 included the Sandhills ranching region of Nebraska. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 2 was located in the southwestern part of the state. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 a included the area beginning just west of North Platte, following the Platte River to just east of Grand Island. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 b is located in north central Nebraska just east of <b>Economic</b> <b>Areas</b> 1 and 3 a. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 4 lay along the Kansas border extending from Nuckolls County to the Colorado state line. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 5 included that land south of <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 b to the Kansas state line. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 6 was located in the northeastern area of the state. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 7 was situated in the southeastern section of the state. Several studies have previously been conducted in Nebraska concerning the occupational status of former vocational agriculture graduates. These studies were conducted on a local school basis. This study, however, was conducted on a statewide level. It was designed to determine the relationship of occupational factors of Nebraska’s farm males, graduated from high school nine to thirteen years earlier, to the <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> of Nebraska in which they lived on the day of graduation. The specific objectives of the study were to determine: The relationship between graduates’ occupations and selected home environmental characteristics by Nebraska economic area; The relationship between graduates’ occupational and educational background by Nebraska occupational area; and Some measures of occupational status of graduates by Nebraska <b>economic</b> <b>area.</b> Graduates included in the study were those whose fathers were farming on the day their sons graduated from high school or who had farmed during most of the time that their sons were in high school.

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} analysis if {{the traditional}} automotive distribution model, defining {{the position of}} automotive dealers in the distribution channel. Their business model is analyzed {{from the perspective of}} value-adding activities performed at each stage of the distribution process and {{from the perspective of the}} profit centers existing generally in the business model at present. The research further turns to the automotive distribution in Belarus. The analysis of the Belarusian automotive market cannot be thoroughly accomplished without analysis of the Russian market, since the two countries belong to the <b>common</b> free <b>economic</b> <b>area.</b> The current condition of the Belarusian automotive dealers is considered in context of the macroeconomic downturn and obscure prospects, which is certainly one of the major challenges the industry is facing. The decreasing purchasing power of the population, high interest rates and exacerbating competition negatively influence the performance measures of the automotive dealers and their growth potential. Apart from the currently unfavorable macroeconomic situation, which is generally considered as temporary, the analysis takes into consideration basic transformation trends observed in social and technological spheres. The developments in the technological sphere also bear conflicting implications for the Belarusian automotive dealers and should be therefore thoroughly analized. In order to understand the potential of the Belarusian automotive dealers to introduce the necessary changes to the existing business model the balance of power analysis will be carried out according to Porter’s Five Forces methodology. The analysis is important from the point of view of the extent of the changes, which dealers are able to accomplish with a reasonable level of risks. The SWOT analysis will be further carried out to highlight the existing advantages and disadvantages of the Belarusian automotive dealers combined with external factors, which might influence positively or negatively their position. This chapter deals with the actual implications of the trends highlighted previously for the automotive dealers and provides the basis of the analysis of a sample strategy, currently implemented by the leading Belarusian automotive dealer, which is elaborated on in the last chapter...|$|R

40|$|A {{question}} {{fundamental to}} {{sustainable economic growth}} is whether a poor region tends to grow faster than a rich one, such that the poor region catches up with the rich region {{in terms of the}} level of per capita income. In this article, we apply the spatial panel data approach to the analysis of regional income convergence across 177 <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> in the contiguous US states over the period from 1969 to 2009. Using data on per capita incomes in the functionally defined <b>economic</b> <b>areas,</b> we find that the absolute value of the estimated coefficient of the initial per capita income decreases in the spatial and time-period fixed effects spatial lag model and increases in the spatial and time-period fixed effects spatial error model. This result implies that the growth rate in a specific <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> will be not only directly affected by an exogenous shock introduced into that <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> but also be impacted more by both the indirect effects of the first-order neighboring <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> and the induced effects of the higher-order neighboring <b>economic</b> <b>areas.</b> This gives helpful hints on the issue of spatial interaction and regional policy coordination to start a virtuous circle of sustainable economic growth...|$|R
