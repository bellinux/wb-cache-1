40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{functional}} gene to complement a nonfunctional gene may depend upon the intracellular relationship of the two genes. If so, {{the function of the}} gene product in question must be limited in time or in space. CDC (cell division cycle) gene products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae control discrete steps in cell division; therefore, they constitute reasonable candidates for genes that function with temporal or spatial restrictions. In an attempt to reveal such restrictions, we compared the {{ability of a}} <b>CDC</b> <b>gene</b> to complement a temperature-sensitive <b>cdc</b> <b>gene</b> in diploids where the genes are located within the same nucleus to complementation in heterokaryons where the genes are located in different nuclei. In CDC X cdc matings, complementation was monitored in rare heterokaryons by assaying the production of cdc haploid progeny (cytoductants) at the restrictive temperature. The production of cdc cytoductants indicates that the cdc nucleus was able to complete cell division at the restrictive temperature and implies that the <b>CDC</b> <b>gene</b> product was provided by the other nucleus or by cytoplasm in the heterokaryon. Cytoductants from cdc 28 or cdc 37 crosses were not efficiently produced, suggesting that these two genes are restricted spatially or temporally in their function. We found that of the cdc mutants tested 33 were complemented; cdc cytoductants were recovered at least as frequently as CDC cytoductants. A particularly interesting example was provided by the CDC 4 gene. Mutations in CDC 4 were found previously to produce a defect in both cell division and karyogamy. Surprisingly, the cell division defect of cdc 4 nuclei is complemented by CDC 4 nuclei in a heterokaryon, whereas the karyogamy defect is not...|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} 18 independent recessive cold-sensitive cell-division-cycle (cdc) mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in nine complementation groups. Terminal phenotypes exhibited include medial nuclear division, cytokinesis, and {{a previously}} undescribed terminal phenotype consisting of cells {{with a single}} small bud and an undivided nucleus. Four of the cold-sensitive mutants proved to be alleles of CDC 11, while the remaining mutants defined at least six new cell-division-cycle genes: CDC 44, CDC 45, CDC 48, CDC 49, CDC 50 and CDC 51. —Spontaneous revertants from cold-sensitivity of four of the medial nuclear division cs cdc mutants were screened for simultaneous acquisition of a temperature-sensitive phenotype. The temperature-sensitive revertants of four different cs cdc mutants carried single new mutations, called Sup/Ts to denote their dual phenotype: suppression of the cold-sensitivity and concomitant conditional lethality at 37 °. Many of the Sup/Ts mutations exhibited a cell-division-cycle terminal phenotype at the high temperature, and they defined two new cdc genes (CDC 46 and CDC 47). Two cold-sensitive medial nuclear division cdc mutants representing two different cdc genes were suppressed by different Sup/Ts alleles of another gene which also bears a medial nuclear division function (CDC 46). In addition, the cold-sensitive medial nuclear division cdc mutant csH 80 was suppressed by a Sup/Ts mutation yielding an unbudded terminal phenotype with an undivided nucleus at the high temperature. This mutation was an allele of CDC 32.

40|$|In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell {{division}} cycle (CDC) genes {{have been identified}} whose products are required for the execution of different steps in the cell cycle. In this study, the fidelity of transmission of a 14 -kb circular minichromosome and a 155 -kb linear chromosome fragment was examined in {{cell division}}s where specific CDC products were temporarily inactivated with either inhibitors, or temperature sensitive mutations in the appropriate <b>CDC</b> <b>gene.</b> All of the cdc mutants previously shown to induce loss of endogenous linear chromosomes also induced loss of a circular minichromosome and a large linear chromosome fragment in our study (either 1 : 0 or 2 : 0 loss events). Therefore, the efficient transmission of these artificial chromosomes depends upon the same trans factors that are required for the efficient transmission of endogenous chromosomes. In a subset of cdc mutants (cdc 6, cdc 7 and cdc 16), the rate of minichromosome loss was significantly greater than the rate of loss of the linear chromosome fragment, suggesting that a structural feature of the minichromosome (nucleotide content, length or topology) makes the minichromosome hypersensitive {{to the level of}} function of these <b>CDC</b> <b>gene</b> products. In another subset of cdc mutants (cdc 7 and cdc 17), the relative rate of 1 : 0 events to 2 : 0 events differed for the minichromosome and chromosome fragment, suggesting that the type of chromosome loss event observed in these mutants was dependent upon chromosome structure. Finally, we show that 2 : 0 events for the minichromosome can occur by both a RAD 52 dependent and RAD 52 independent mechanism.

40|$|Temperature-sensitive mutants which {{arrest in}} the G 1 {{phase of the}} cell cycle have been {{described}} for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One class of these mutants (carrying cdc 28, cdc 36, cdc 37, or cdc 39) forms a shmoo morphology at restrictive temperature, characteristic of mating pheromone-arrested wild-type cells. Therefore, one hypothesis to explain the control of cell division by mating factors states that mating pheromones arrest wild-type cells by inactivating {{one or more of}} these <b>CDC</b> <b>gene</b> products. A class of mutants (carrying ste 4, ste 5, ste 7, ste 11, or ste 12) which is insensitive to mating pheromone and sterile has also been described. One possible function of the STE gene products is the inactivation of the <b>CDC</b> <b>gene</b> products in the presence of a mating pheromone. A model incorporating these two hypotheses predicts that such STE gene products will not be required for mating in strains carrying an appropriate cdc lesion. This prediction was tested by assaying the mating abilities of double mutants for all of the pairwise combinations of cdc and ste mutations. Lesions in either cdc 36 or cdc 39 suppressed the mating defect due to ste 4 and ste 5. Allele specificity was observed in the suppression of both ste 4 and ste 5. The results indicate that the CDC 36, CDC 39, STE 4, and STE 5 gene products interact functionally or physically or both in the regulation of cell division mediated by the presence or absence of mating pheromones. The cdc 36 and cdc 39 mutations did not suppress ste 7, ste 11, or ste 12. Lesions in cdc 28 or cdc 37 did not suppress any of the ste mutations.

In contrast, during infection or inflammation, cDCs become activated, express {{higher levels of}} cell surface MHC molecules, and induce strong adaptive immune responses. We recently identified a cDC-restricted zinc finger transcription factor, zDC (also known as Zbtb 46 or Btbd 4), that is not expressed by other immune cell populations, including plasmacytoid DCs, monocytes, or macrophages. We define the zDC consensus DNA binding motif and the genes regulated by zDC using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. By deleting zDC from the mouse genome, we show that zDC is primarily a negative regulator of <b>cDC</b> <b>gene</b> expression. zDC deficiency alters the cDC subset composition in the spleen in favor of CD 8 + DCs, up-regulates activation pathways in steady-state cDCs, including elevated MHC II expression, and enhances cDC production of vascular endothelial growth factor leading to increased vascularization of skin-draining lymph nodes. Consistent with these observations, zDC protein expression is rapidly down-regulated after TLR stimulation. Thus, zDC is a TLR-responsive, cDC-specific transcriptional repressor that is in part responsible for preventing cDC maturation in the steady state...|$|E

The DLY and ELY primary structures show that they maintain the signature motifs of the CDCs but lack an obvious secretion signal. Recombinant, purified DLY (rDLY) and ELY (rELY) exhibited cholesterol-dependent bind-ing and cytolytic activity and formed the typical large CDCmembrane oligomeric pore complex.

The function of this checkpoint in budding yeast requires the RAD 9 gene. Here {{we examine the}} role of the RAD 9 gene in the arrest of the 12 cell division cycle (cdc) mutants, temperature-sensitive lethal mutants that arrest in specific phases of the cell cycle at a restrictive temperature. We found that in four cdc mutants the cdc rad 9 cells failed to arrest after a shift to the restrictive temperature, rather they continued cell division and died rapidly, whereas the cdc RAD cells arrested and remained viable. The cell cycle and genetic phenotypes of the 12 cdc RAD mutants indicate the function of the RAD 9 checkpoint is phase-specific and signal-specific. First, the four cdc RAD mutants that required RAD 9 each arrested in the late S/G(2) phase after a shift to the restrictive temperature when DNA replication was complete or nearly complete, and second, each leaves DNA lesions when the <b>CDC</b> <b>gene</b> product is limiting for cell division. Three of the four CDC genes are known to encode DNA replication enzymes. We found that the RAD 17 gene is also essential for the function of the RAD 9 checkpoint because it is required for phase-specific arrest of the same four cdc mutants. We also show that both X- or UV-irradiated cells require the RAD 9 and RAD 17 genes for delay in the G(2) phase.

In this paper, we report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the complete SDC 25 gene. The SDC 25 gene {{is located on the}} chromosome XII close to the centromere. It is transcribed into a 4 -kb-long mRNA that contains an open reading frame of 1, 251 codons. Homology with the <b>CDC</b> 25 <b>gene</b> extends in the N-terminal part, although the degree of similarity is lower than in the C-terminal part. In contrast with the C-terminal part, the complete SDC 25 gene was found not to suppress the <b>CDC</b> 25 <b>gene</b> defect. A deletion in the N-terminal part restored the suppressing activity, a result which suggests the existence of a regulatory domain. The SDC 25 gene was found to be dispensable for cell growth under usual conditions. No noticeable phenotype was found in the deleted strain...|$|R
40|$|Budding {{cells of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possess a ring of 10 -nm-diameter filaments, of unknown {{biochemical}} nature, that lies just inside the plasma membrane in the neck connecting the mother cell to its bud (B. Byers and L. Goetsch, J. Cell Biol. 69 : 717 - 721, 1976). Mutants defective in any of four <b>genes</b> (<b>CDC</b> 3, CDC 10, CDC 11, and CDC 12) lack these filaments and display a pleiotropic phenotype that involves abnormal bud growth and cell-wall deposition and an inability to complete cytokinesis. We fused the cloned <b>CDC</b> 12 <b>gene</b> to the Escherichia coli lacZ and trpE genes and used the resulting fusion proteins to raise polyclonal antibodies specific for the <b>CDC</b> 12 <b>gene</b> product. In immunofluorescence experiments with affinity-purified antibodies, the neck region of wild-type and mutant cells stained in patterns consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>CDC</b> 12 <b>gene</b> product is a constituent of the ring of 10 -nm filaments. Without careful affinity purification of the CDC 12 -specific antibodies, these staining patterns were completely obscured by the staining of residual cell wall components in the neck by antibodies present even in the "preimmune" sera of all rabbits tested...|$|R
40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{synthesis}} {{was examined}} in asynchronous and synchronous cultures {{of a number}} of cdc (cell division cycle) temperature-sensitive mutant strains. The kinetics of DNA synthesis after a shift to the restrictive temperature was compared with that obtained after inhibition of protein synthesis at the permissive temperature, a condition that specifically blocks the initiation of new rounds of DNA replication, but does not block those in progress. Mutations in three <b>genes</b> (<b>cdc</b> 4, 7, and 28) appear to block a precondition for DNA synthesis since cells carrying these lesions cannot start new rounds of DNA replication after a shift from permissive to restrictive temperature, but can finish rounds that were in progress. These three genes are classified as having roles in the “initiation” of DNA synthesis. Mutations in two <b>genes</b> (<b>cdc</b> 8 and 21) block DNA synthesis, itself, since cells harboring these lesions that had started DNA synthesis at the permissive temperature arrest synthesis abruptly upon a shift to the restrictive temperature. Mutations in 13 other <b>cdc</b> <b>genes</b> do not impair DNA synthesis in the first cell cycle at the restrictive temperature...|$|R
40|$|Tetrahymena thermophila macronuclear histone H 1 is {{phosphorylated}} by a cdc 2 kinase, and H 1 phosphorylation regulates CDC 2 expression by {{a positive}} feedback mechanism. In starved wild-type cells, decreased {{expression of the}} <b>CDC</b> 2 <b>gene</b> is correlated with a global reduction in the phosphorylation of H 1 and reduced phosphorylation of H 1 in the region upstream of the <b>CDC</b> 2 <b>gene.</b> To determine whether the reduced H 1 phosphorylation upstream of the <b>CDC</b> 2 <b>gene</b> is merely a reflection of global dephosphorylation or is due to specific targeting of dephosphorylation of H 1 to the CDC 2 promoter during starvation, the CDC 2 promoter was mapped, and the distributions of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated H 1 across the <b>CDC</b> 2 <b>gene</b> were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Unphosphorylated H 1 is specifically enriched in a region of the CDC 2 promoter when the gene's expression is reduced during starvation but not when CDC 2 is highly active in growing cells. The region of unphosphorylated H 1 coincides with a region that is essential for CDC 2 expression. These studies are the first in vivo demonstration that the phosphorylation of H 1 is being regulated at a fine level and that unphosphorylated H 1 can be specifically targeted to a promoter, where it likely regulates transcription in a gene-specific manner...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in <b>CDC</b> <b>genes</b> of S. cerevisiae {{disrupt the}} cell cycle at {{specific}} stages. The experiments reported here demonstrate that two <b>CDC</b> <b>genes,</b> <b>CDC</b> 5 and CDC 27, {{are necessary for}} mitochondrial segregation {{as well as for}} nuclear division. The defect in the transmission of mitochondria was revealed by the examination of uninucleate and binucleate progeny of transient heterokaryons generated by using the kar 1 - 1 mutation that disrupts nuclear fusion. One of the parents lacked mitochondrial DNA (ρ 0) whereas the other parent had functional mitochondria (ρ+). When the parents of the heterokaryon were both wild-type (CDC), nearly all progeny received mitochondria at 21 ° and at 34 °. Thirty-four of the 36 cdc mutations tested had no defect in transmission of mitochondria to zygotic progeny in crosses in which one parent was a cdc mutant and the other parent was not (CDC). However, the cdc 5 and cdc 27 mutations prevented the transmission of mitochondria to cdc progeny at 34 ° but not at 21 °; CDC progeny received mitochondria at either temperature. This defect was observed in crosses of cdc 5 or cdc 27 by wild-type cells regardless of which parent donated mitochondria to the zygote. The defect in mitochondrial transmission cosegregated in meiotic tetrads with the defect in mitosis demonstrating that both are likely to be caused by the same temperature-sensitive mutation. These results indicate that the CDC 5 and <b>CDC</b> 27 <b>gene</b> products are essential in two motility-related processes: mitochondrial movement from the zygote to the progeny and in mitosis. —Furthermore, the results suggest that the function performed by the CDC 5 and <b>CDC</b> 27 <b>gene</b> products for mitochondrial transmission differ in some fundamental way from the function performed for mitosis. The function necessary for mitosis can be supplied to the cdc 5 (or cdc 27) nucleus by the CDC 5 (or CDC 27) nucleus in the same heterokaryon but the function necessary for mitochondrial transmission cannot. Perhaps the function needed for mitochondrial transmission must be performed in the cell cycle preceding the actual segregation of mitochondria whereas the function needed for nuclear segregation can be performed at the time that mitosis occurs...|$|R
40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>CDC</b> 25 <b>gene</b> encodes a nucleotide-exchange-factor (NEF) {{that can}} convert the {{inactive}} GDP-bound state of RAS proteins to an active RAS-GTP complex. CDC 25 can activate the yeast RAS proteins {{as well as}} the human H-ras protein. CDC 25 is a member of a family of yeast genes that likely encode NEFs capable of regulating the RAS-related proteins found in yeast. By aligning the amino acid sequence of <b>CDC</b> 25 -related <b>gene</b> products we found a number of conserved motifs. Using degenerate oligonucleotides that encode these conserved sequences, we have used polymerase chain reactions to amplify fragments of mouse and human cDNAs related to the yeast <b>CDC</b> 25 <b>gene.</b> We show that a chimeric molecule, part mouse and part yeast CDC 25, can suppress the loss of CDC 25 function in the yeast S. cerevisiae...|$|R

40|$|Previous genetic {{studies have}} shown that the fission yeast <b>cdc</b> 13 + <b>gene</b> product interacts closely with the cdc 2 + protein kinase during mitosis. Here, we have cloned the <b>cdc</b> 13 + <b>gene</b> from a S. pombe gene bank by {{complementation}} of the temperature-sensitive defect of a cdc 13 - 117 mutant strain. The complementing activity was localized to a 1. 9 -kb XbaI-NsiI DNA fragment, and nucleotide sequencing revealed a 1446 -bp open reading frame. The predicted amino acid sequence contained 482 residues and was not homologous to any protein in a protein database. The <b>cdc</b> 13 + <b>gene</b> function was confirmed to be essential for cell division since cells carrying a cdc 13 null allele arrested with a cdc phenotype. However, unlike any existing temperature-sensitive cdc 13 mutants, cdc 13 null mutants arrested in G 2 without septa or condensed chromosomes indicating that <b>cdc</b> 13 + <b>gene</b> function is required at or prior to the initiation of mitotis. cdc 13 - 117 mutant strains were found to be hypersensitive to the tubulin inhibitor thiabendazole. This observation suggests that the <b>cdc</b> 13 + <b>gene</b> product, which is required for mitotic initiation, may interact with microtubules...|$|R
