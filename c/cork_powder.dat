40|$|Cork {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} forest products in Portugal. The cork processing industry is highly resource-efficient, with the only residue, <b>cork</b> <b>powder,</b> which is too minor in quantity for agglomerate production. This work studied the usage of <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> for the production of added-value products via polyol liquefaction. Liquefactions were performed in a reactor using a mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) and glycerol as solvents, which were catalyzed by the addition of sulphuric acid. Several cork-to-solvent ratios, reaction temperatures, and reaction times were tested. Polyurethane foams were prepared by combining polyol mixtures with a catalyst, surfactant, blowing agent, and polymeric isocyanate. Mechanical tests of the produced foams were conducted, and compressive modulus of elasticity and compressive stress at 10 % deformation were determined. The results show that the best conditions for obtaining high liquefaction yields are as follows: 160 ºC for 1 h; glycerol-to-PEG 400 ratio of 1 : 9; cork-to-solvent ratio of 1 : 6; and 3 % H 2 SO 4 catalyst addition. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated that the lignocellulosic fractions of the cork were more selectively dissolved during acidified polyol liquefaction than the suberin.

40|$|Cork-polymer {{composites}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising fields of cork technology to create materials for a sustainable development. In this work, <b>cork</b> particles and <b>powder</b> were compounded with polypropylene (PP) by twin-screw extrusion and further processed by injection or compression moulding. The obtained PP/Cork injection moulded composites were used to investigate the tensile properties before and after water absorption (WA) tests. The addition of polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and stearic acid was evaluated. The composites show good distribution and dispersion of cork with interesting aesthetic characteristics. Low cork content (5 wt. %) reinforces the stiffness of the PP. The addition of PP-g-MA up to 8 wt. % promotes an increase on the tensile strength while the stearic acid contributes only with a slight increase on the tensile strain. The thermo-physical properties were investigated and the composites present lowWA. In general the tensile properties of the composites were not significantly affected after theWAtests. Moreover, theWAwas found to increase with an increase in cork content and was reduced with the PP-g-MA and stearic acid. It was also found, that cork act as nucleating agent and promotes antioxidant protection to PP. Both properties ameliorate with the increase of the cork content.

She rolled in the long Cape swell like a buoy; her foc's'le was a dog-kennel; Judson's cabin was practically under the water- line; not one of her dead-bights could ever be opened; and her compasses, thanks to the influence of the four-inch gun, were a curiosity even among Admiralty compasses. But Bai-Jove-Judson was radiant and enthusiastic. He had even contrived to fill Mr. Davies, the second-class engine-room artificer, who was his chief engineer, with the glow of his passion. The Admiral, who remembered his own first command, when pride forbade him to slacken off a single rope on a dewy night, and he had racked his rigging to pieces in consequence, looked at the flat-iron keenly. Her fenders were done all over with white sennit which was truly white; her big gun was varnished with a better composition than the Admiralty allowed; the spare sights were cased as carefully as the chronometers; the chocks for spare spars, two of them, were made of four-inch Burma teak carved with dragons' heads that was one result of Bai-Jove-Judson's experiences with the Naval Brigade in the Burmese war; the bow-anchor was varnished instead of being painted, and there were charts more than the Admiralty scale supplied. The Admiral was well pleased, for he loved a ship's husband - a man who had a little money of his own and was willing to spend it on his command. Judson looked at him hopefully. He was only a Junior Navigating Lieutenant under eight years' standing. He might be kept in Simon's Bay for six months, and his ship at sea was his delight.

40|$|<b>Cork</b> <b>powder,</b> {{the most}} {{important}} sub-product of cork processing, combined with thermoplastic matrixes like, high density polyethylene (HDPE), offer {{a new class of}} cork-polymer composite (CPC) materials with high added-value. Therefore, reinforcing strategies must be considered to increase the mechanical performance, especially when high content of <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> is added to the formulation. Coconut fibres have several advantages, such as, low density, renewable source, low cost and biodegradability. The use of these fibres on the reinforcement of CPC materials will not only contribute to improve the mechanical performance but also for increasing the amount of natural component present on the final composition. The main goal of this work was to prepare HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites reinforced with discontinuous coconut fibres (5 and 10 wt. %) with and without the addition of coupling agent (2 wt. %) by extrusion. The developed reinforced cork based composites were characterized regarding its morphology and mechanical performance. Optical micrographs have shown a homogeneous distribution of the fibres. The coupling agent effect on CPC performance was also investigated. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the reinforced composites were significantly improved with the addition of coupling agent. The use of 10 wt. % of coconut fibres in the presence of coupling agent promote an increase on maximum tensile strength of around 41 % comparing with the HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the tensile fractured specimens confirmed that the use of coupling agent promoted the interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the thermoplastic matrix. Since, like <b>cork</b> <b>powder,</b> coconut fibres have good thermal and acoustic properties, we consider that the novel reinforced CPC herein described have high potential to be used in building and construction systems and other structural 3 D applications.

Although strength is acceptable for 10 % cement replacement with cork ash (5 % loss at 90 days, compared to control), most durability properties (tested up to 6 months according to test type) reduced performance probably due to a broader pore structure caused by coarse particles in the ash which tested non pozzolanic.

The samples prepared from chemical activation of the biomass residues show reasonably high removal efficiencies along with fast rate of adsorption, which are in fact comparable to commercial carbons. The analysis of the carbon samples after adsorbing the analgesic showed that adsorbent–adsorbate affinity is stronger in hydrophobic carbons of basic character that contain a well-developed microporosity. These characteristics are however not sufficient for an overall performance of a carbon in acetaminophen removal. The carbon must also have a well interconnected pore network (to facilitate the accessibility of acetaminophen molecules, thus speeding up adsorption kinetics) and an adequate chemical composition, which ultimately leads to a high adsorption capacity.

In previous research, using only olive oil and cork waste, biomass pellets were obtained having high calorific values (20. 6 MJ/kg and 22. 2 MJ/kg), low moisture (8. 9 %) and relatively a low ash percentage (3. 9 %). Several new formulations and their relevance to the calorific value were now tested using other waste or by-products. The potential inclusion of olive leaves from the olive oil industry, grape husks and grape seeds from the winery industry and chestnut shells (outer shell and inner skin) from the chestnut industry has been analysed. This process will contribute to solving environmental problems resulting from the discharge of those waste and effluents and to create a viable and profitable alternative to their storage and/or deposition in landfill. The increase of other biomass sources for these types of process is extremely important from an environmental and economic management point of view. This research shows that the use of different types of raw materials as biomass sources (giving different pellets formulations) results in a different final product with different physical and chemical characteristics that may improve its quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of using stopper-derived cork {{as an effective}} biosorbent towards bivalent mercury at environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions was evaluated in this study. Only 25 mg/L of <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> was able to achieve 94 % of mercury removal for an initial mercury concentration of 500 mu g/L. It was found that under the conditions tested, the efficiency of mercury removal expressed as equilibrium removal percentage {{does not depend on}} the amount of cork or its particle size, but is very sensitive to initial metal concentration, with higher removal efficiencies at higher initial concentrations. Ion exchange was identified as one of the mechanisms involved in the sorption of Hg onto cork in the absence of ionic competition. Under ionic competition, stopper-derived cork showed to be extremely effective and selective for mercury in binary mixtures, while in complex matrices like seawater, moderate inhibition of the sorption process was observed, attributed to a change in mercury speciation. The loadings achieved are similar to the majority of literature values found for other biosorbents and for other metals, suggesting that cork stoppers can be recycled as an effective biosorbent for water treatment. However, the most interesting result is that equilibrium data show a very rare behaviour, with the isotherm presenting an almost square convex shape to the concentration axis, with an infinite slope for an Hg concentration in solution around 25 mu g/L...|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{activated}} carbon (AC) prepared from <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> {{was used in}} synthesis of AC stabilized nano-zero-valent iron (AC/NZVI) composite and evaluated phosphate (PO 43 −) removal efficiency from aqueous solution. The as-obtained AC/NZVI was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Response surface methodology based on a three-level, three-factor, Box–Behnken design (B.B.D.) has been employed for determination of optimal combination of three significant process factors or variables such as temperature, solution pH and AC/NZVI dose, for maximum removal of PO 43 − from aqueous solution. Based on B.B.D. experimental design, {{a limited number of}} experiments were performed in a cost-effective manner at initial PO 43 − concentration of 211  mg L− 1 as a fixed input parameter. A statistically validated quadratic model was developed to predict the responses in the form PO 43 − removal capacity from aqueous solution and adequacy of the model was evaluated using regression analysis and analysis of variance. The model predicted maximum PO 43 − removal capacity of the AC/NZVI was 152.12  mg g− 1 under the optimal condition of process variables (temperature 60  °C, pH 3.5, and AC/NZVI dose 0.4  g L− 1) which was strictly closer to the experimental value (151.10  mg g− 1) obtained in batch experiment under the same optimize condition of process variables. The result of the study inferred that all three factors {{had a significant impact on}} removal of PO 43 −.|$|E
40|$|Composites {{from high}} density {{polyethylene}} filled with <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> and coconut short fibres, in two different ratios, were prepared in a twin-screw extruder followed by compression moulding process. The main motivation of this work was to improve the mechanical performance without compromising the use of high weight percentage of natural component used {{in the preparation of}} cork-based composites. The morphology of the hybrid composites were more homogeneous {{in the presence of the}} coupling agent (CA) displaying enhanced fibre–matrix adhesion. Moreover, the use of CA based on maleic anhydride promotes a mechanical reinforcement effect on the tensile properties, including the elongation at break. The addition of coconut fibre resulted on an increase of 27 % in elastic modulus and 47 % in the tensile strength when compared with the unreinforced cork-based (50 – 50) wt. % composite. This work clearly shows that the addition of 10 wt. % of short-coconut fibres, randomly distributed, can be effectively used as reinforcing strategy of cork-based composite materials, preferably in the presence of 2 wt. % of CA. The work was performed within the project of Corticeira Amorim S. G. P. S. on the development of new products based in/with cork. We gratefully acknowledge to Amorim Revestimentos S.
