5|$|Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle (ca. 1270 – 3 March 1323), {{alternatively}} Andreas de Harcla, was {{an important}} English military leader in the borderlands with Scotland {{during the reign of}} EdwardII. <b>Coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> knightly family in Westmorland, he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland in 1311. He distinguished himself in the Scottish Wars, and in 1315 repulsed a siege on Carlisle Castle by Robert the Bruce. Shortly after this, he was taken captive by the Scots, and only released after a substantial ransom had been paid. His greatest achievement came in 1322, when he defeated the rebellious baron Thomas of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16–17 March. For this he was created Earl of Carlisle.|$|E

5|$|Capturing one of {{the alien}} troops and {{conducting}} the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially-created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found to be <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is {{the radiant}} of an annual meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors {{have an average}} velocity of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to be}} associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> small {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which {{are also a}} form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} the second most used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E

In cases where the intrusion is <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

5|$|Observations {{with the}} James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at a {{wavelength}} of 850μm show an extended flux of radiation {{out to an}} angular radius of 35arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani. The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35–75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30AU. This emission is interpreted as <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> young analogue of the Solar System's Kuiper belt: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25° {{to the line of}} sight.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> state of pure awareness, from the state of being.

The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco {{missed out}} on Juventus's 2013 Supercoppa Italiana victory, and he {{initially}} went scoreless in the 2013–14 season until finally netting a notable goal in a 3–2 win over rivals Milan on the 6 October 2013. Giovinco fell out of form again and struggled to gain playing time, {{but he managed to}} break his goal drought on 14 April 2014, with a goal against Udinese, taking the ball past a defender and scoring with a left footed curling shot from outside the box. Overall, Giovinco managed 2 goals in 17 Serie A appearances that season, and one goal in the Coppa Italia, as Juventus won their third consecutive Serie A title. During the 2014–15 season under Massimiliano Allegri, Giovinco scored two goals in a 6–1 win over Hellas Verona in the Coppa Italia, on 15 January 2015, helping Juventus to the quarter-finals of the competition; both of his goals came in the first half, with the first <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> free kick, and the second in injury time.|$|E
