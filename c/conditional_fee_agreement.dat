40|$|In {{both the}} United States and England, {{accident}} victims are often entitled to compensation from negligent defendants and the defendants’ liability insurers. Accident claimants {{in the two}} countries, however, have different ways of funding their claims and litigation. In the United States, claimants use the American-style contingent fee agreement to pay for lawyers. In England, claimants have relied on legal aid and the two-way costshifting “English Rule,” pursuant to which a prevailing party can recover his solicitor’s fees and litigation costs, including counsel’s fees, from the losing litigant. Over the last decade, dramatic changes {{have been made to}} the English litigation funding system for many areas of law, particularly personal injury (with the exception, to date, of clinical negligence). The English eliminated legal aid and suddenly introduced the <b>conditional</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreement,</b> without changing the English Rule. Between 2000 and 2003, disputes were continual, as claimants and their representatives pushed the new rules to the outer limits, and defendant liability insurance companies resisted in any way they could. This article will explain the contentious debate. Part II will compare the American and the traditional English way of funding personal injury litigation, particularly minor road accident cases. Part III will discuss some background factors that influenced the recent changes in England. Part IV will examine the first revised litigation funding system, and Part V will demonstrate how the development of after-the-event insurance and the second revised litigation funding system ameliorated some problems but also generated new ones. Part VI will discuss the consequences of the second revised litigation funding system, with particular emphasis on the development of claims management companies, the extensive satellite litigation and, where appropriate, comparisons to the U. S. Supreme Court’s resolution of similar problems. Part VII will conclude by noting that there is now a moment of repose in the struggle but no guarantee that dramatic disagreement will not reappear...|$|E

Such companies used aggressive sales techniques and exaggerated claims, profiting from exorbitant commissions on after the event insurance policies.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of this volume {{together with the}} book Risk Assessment in Litigation published by Butterworths in 2001. The research presented as a whole represents work conducted over the period from 1999 to 2013 focussing on the assessment of risk in civil litigation in England and Wales {{in the context of}} <b>conditional</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreement</b> and after the event insurance. The published works that form part of the thesis collectively present ‘doctrinal’ and ‘empirical’ legal research, terms considered {{in the light of the}} published works and the research underlying them. The initial research project commenced in 1999 and was funded by the European Social Fund, Blake Lapthorn solicitors and Litigation Protection Limited (an insurance intermediary). That project researched the question of whether and if so how a method or methods of risk assessment could be devised that could form the basis of a training programme for litigation solicitors. The outcomes of that research were a set of risk assessment methods that were later formed into a continuing professional development format and delivered across England and Wales. The methods were also incorporated into the book Risk Assessment in Litigation and into Butterworths Costs Service. The thesis sets out via the published works that a positive answer can be and was given to the initial research question. Part of that answer involves defining and researching tacit knowledge and the difficulties inherent in the transfer of tacit knowledge all of which is explored in chapter four: What is legal research? The present volume develops the topic of probability theory as applied to risk assessment in litigation and reviews the treatment of that topic in the original publication Risk Assessment in Litigation and takes the debate further in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Motto & Ors v Trafigura Ltd & Anor [2011] EWCA Civ 1150 where the book is cited in the judgment of Lord Neuberger MR. The research presented in this thesis also {{consists of}} detailed analysis of the law relating to the funding of civil litigation under conditional fee agreements and after the event legal expenses insurance. Over the period 1999 to 2013 the published works show a development of the law in this field and a change in government policy in respect of the regulation of conditional fee agreements with attendant changes to the law and therefore the practice of litigation. The impact on risk in litigation of these changes is considered in detail in the published works...|$|E
40|$|The {{costs and}} the funding of {{litigation}} are central features of all civil justice systems. However, these issues have received relatively little attention by academic writers in general, and by comparative lawyers in particular.

On the basis of a number of selected case studies, it compares court charges, lawyers’ fees and expenses for witnesses and the rules for cost shifting across legal systems. With regard to funding of litigation, we discuss contingency <b>fees,</b> success <b>fees,</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreements,</b> legal expenses insurance and the role of third party funders...|$|R
50|$|Legal aid in England and Wales is {{administered}} by the Legal Aid Agency (until 31 March 2013 by the Legal Services Commission), and is available for most criminal cases, and many types of civil cases. Exception include libel, most personal injury cases (which are now dealt with under <b>Conditional</b> <b>Fee</b> <b>Agreements,</b> a species of contingent fee), and cases associated with the running of a business. Family cases are also sometimes covered. Depending on the type of case, legal aid {{may or may not be}} means tested and in some cases legal aid can be free to those on benefits, out of work and have no savings or assets.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} what we {{know about}} clients’ views of lawyers and advice agency workers from research in Scotland and England and Wales. New forms of litigation, including <b>conditional</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreements,</b> set up new areas of difficulty between lawyers and clients and current ethical rules may not cover the needs of new forms of legal service. Blumberg’s “confidence game”, Ericson and Baranek’s concentration on outcome, that sense of fairness which Caspar, Tyler and Fisher refer to and Felstiner’s concepts of “substantive justice” and “procedural justice” all provide different views of lawyer-client relations. This literature provides a depressing picture of the profession against some more positive findings. The paper ends by asking how the needs of clients might be addressed at the professional association, the entity and the individual lawyer’s levels. And the poem by Browning is also considered.

40|$|For many decades, {{defamation}} law in England in Wales has predominantly {{only had}} to deal with material that has been published via printed publications, radio and television. As such, defamation law has been tailored to best suit these media. Since the introduction of the Internet, defamation law has been tested to its limits with a number of commentators arguing that it is not equipped to deal with the uniqueness of the online publications. Consequently, Internet service providers, content hosts and Internet users are all at risk of being held as the publisher and being sued for defamation, potentially, anywhere in the world, even if they had no prior knowledge of the material in question. Previous research regarding the Internet and defamation has been scarce. This research has set out to gain a greater understanding of the problems facing Internet service providers and the threats to freedom of expression on the Internet caused by defamation law, procedures and practice. This has been achieved by conducting an indepth desk research of academic text, press commentary and case law followed by interviews with Internet service providers, content hosts and lawyers with an expertise of defamation. Initial assumptions were that defamation law, procedures and practice was threatening freedom of expression on the Internet. This proved to be correct and of great concern to the Internet publishing community. It was also found that defamation law procedure and practice was in many cases efficient in the removal of alleged defamatory (Internet based) material and in its attempt to restore a person s reputation. It has been concluded that parts of defamation law in England and Wales could be revised to improve the preservation of freedom of expression on the Internet. Furthermore, current defamation law coupled with defamation procedures and practice are leaving Internet publishers vulnerable to vexatious claims of defamation.
