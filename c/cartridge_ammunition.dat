Some {{are used as}} primary explosives, namely lead picrate or potassium picrate which find their use as primers for <b>cartridge</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Picrates of some metals tend to be significantly more sensitive to impact, friction and shock than picric acid itself. As a result, storage of picric acid (or mixtures containing it) in metal containers is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of accidental explosion.|$|E

The rimfire round is commonly packaged in boxes of 50 or 100 rounds, {{and is often}} sold by the 'brick', a carton containing either 10 boxes of 50 rounds or loose cartridges totalling 500 rounds, or the 'case' containing 10 bricks totalling 5,000 rounds[...]22 LR ammunition is among the least costly <b>cartridge</b> <b>ammunition</b> available.|$|E

The ban does not affect Northern Ireland.|$|E

These revolvers were generally loaded with a [...]457" [...] diameter lead ball (48-gauge), ensuring a good seal in the chamber.

50|$|The {{standard}} {{weapon of}} a modern soldier is an assault rifle, which, like other small arms, uses <b>cartridge</b> <b>ammunition</b> in a size specific to the weapon. Ammunition is carried on the person in box magazines specific to the weapon, ammo boxes, pouches or bandoliers. The amount of ammo carried {{is dependent on the}} strength of the soldier, the expected action required, and the ability of ammunition to move forward through the logistical chain to replenish the supply. A soldier may also carry a smaller amount of specialized ammunition for heavier weapons such as machine guns and mortars, spreading the burden for squad weapons over many people. Too little ammunition poses a threat to the mission, while too much limits the soldier's mobility.|$|E
