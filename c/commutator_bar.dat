40|$|A {{flexible}} {{approach to}} dynamically predict {{the performance of}} brush-commutation machines is presented. A circuit component called a <b>commutator</b> <b>bar</b> is introduced to model the relative position of a commutation segment to a brush, and a commutation model is introduced to model its characteristics. The circuit that describes the connection of all coils to all <b>commutator</b> <b>bar</b> components is coupled with transient finite element analysis. Simulated results at no-load and load operations are presented and compared with the measured data. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of error minimization {{as a result}} of noncontact measurement of the distance between eddy-current converter and commutator has been shown. The problem was solved by means of adjustment in transfer constant of the device measuring channel in the process of measuring distance to arbitrary taken <b>commutator</b> <b>bar</b> according to the method proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} and theoretical study of direct current heteropolar machines with superconducting field windings {{was conducted with}} the aim of proving their technical feasibility and to indicate their advantages and disadvantages over machines of more conventional design. These studies were conducted in conjunction with extensive tests on small superconducting D. C. machines of various formats. Three stages of machine development occurred. In the first stage machine the superconducting field winding was shielded from armature reaction fluxes with the aid of iron and compensating windings. In the second stage machine the superconducting field winding was subjected to the full effects of the armature reaction fluxes. Tests conducted with these machines indicated that the operation of the superconducting field winding was not influenced by the flow of armature currents. A third, four pole superconducting D. C. machine which exhibits all the advantages gained by using superconductors in the field windings has been constructed. This machine has most of the construction features of a full size prototype machine for future industrial applications. As a result of difficulties encountered in inducing the superconducting state into the field windings operational tests on this machine could not be conducted. Possible reasons for the difficulties are discussed with the result that some of the reasons are rejected and measures that could overcome the difficulties are forwarded. The project began with no experience in cryogenics, cryostat design and construction nor superconductivity. Consequently details of practical techniques utilised during the project are included. Continued development of superconducting heteropolar D. C. machines should prove that the design and operation of a prototype machine with a rating in excess of 10 MW is possible. This is essential if this type of machine is to make any impact in the future. Providing the expectation that voltage per <b>commutator</b> <b>bar</b> limits can be substantially increased is realised, machine ratings that are limited only by armature cooling should be possible...|$|E
50|$|These {{were used}} where high {{starting}} torque was required. They started as repulsion motors, {{but once they}} were running at a sizable fraction of full speed, the brushes were lifted mechanically and all <b>commutator</b> <b>bars</b> were short-circuited together to create {{the equivalent of a}} squirrel-cage induction motor.|$|R
50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all <b>commutator</b> <b>bars</b> together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage rotor. As well, when close to operating speed, better motors lifted the brushes out of contact.|$|R
50|$|A Gramme machine, Gramme ring, Gramme magneto, or Gramme dynamo is an {{electrical}} generator that produces direct current, {{named for its}} Belgian inventor, Zénobe Gramme, and was built as either a dynamo or a magneto. It was the first generator to produce power on a commercial scale for industry. Inspired by a machine invented by Antonio Pacinotti in 1860, Gramme was the developer of a new induced rotor in form of a wire-wrapped ring (Gramme ring) and demonstrated this apparatus to the Academy of Sciences in Paris in 1871. Although popular in 19th century electrical machines, the Gramme winding principle is no longer used since it makes inefficient use of the conductors. The portion of the winding on {{the interior of the}} ring cuts no flux and does not contribute to energy conversion in the machine. The winding requires twice the number of turns and twice the number of <b>commutator</b> <b>bars</b> as an equivalent drum-wound armature.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{focuses on}} sensorless control of low load brushed DC motor {{that is used}} in the {{actuators}} made by the Honeywell company. The first part provides an introduction into motor control and common used methods of speed and position sensing of brushed DC motor. Sensorless method of sensing described in this work is the detection of commutation pulses from the signal of motor current. These pulses are caused by brushes leaping over the <b>commutator</b> <b>bars.</b> Correct evaluation of commutation pulses can provide the information about velocity and position of the motor. This relatively new method of detection of commutation pulses is investigated and arising problems are demonstrated on measured samples of signal. Suitable methods of signal processing are then proposed. Infallibility of these signal processing methods is then proved on the set of signals measured under circumstances of supply voltage and abrasion. Then it is decided which signal processing method that sensorless control system can use is the best...|$|R
40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning <b>commutator</b> <b>bars</b> are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the brush holder box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C. The paper offers an electromechanical alternative of design to the electrohydraulic actuators, with a ball-screw gear of the actuation mechanism, possessing a number of advantages. </p...|$|R
40|$|In a {{classical}} educational approach the DC commutator generator {{is presented in}} the schematic form, as given in Fig. 1, and run of its electromotive force- in Fig. 2. The DC commutator generator is consisted of: − the motionless stator which can be schematically presented in the form of pair of permanent magnets (Fig. 1, where: „N” – north pole, „S ” – south pole), producing constant magnetic field of B intensity and the sense from „N ” to „S” − the rotor rotated with ω 2 velocity by an external mechanical force. On the rotor winding turns are winded in which the electromotive force e, (EMF), is induced. The force can be described as follows: e = ⏐k · B · sin(ω 2 t) ⏐ (1) where: k – design coefficient of a given generator B – magnetic field intensity ω 2 – instantaneous angular velocity of generator rotor − the commutator, i. e. the ring fastened on the rotor and made of a conductive material. The ring is cut into segments which are electrically insulated from each other and form the so called <b>commutator</b> sectors (<b>bars).</b> To each of the sector the end of winding turn is connected; the commutator serves this way as a mechanical electric current rectifie...|$|R
