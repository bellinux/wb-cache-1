Day-old male broiler chicks (1, 200) were used in an experiment to evaluate the efficacy of <b>cupric</b> <b>citrate</b> supplementation (75 mg Cu kg- 1) during the 1 - 21, 22 - 42 or 1 - 42 d periods in comparison to an unsupplemented diet and a diet supplemented with cupric sulfate (200 mg Cu kg- 1, 1 - 42 d). A randomized block design was used, with five treatments, six replicates and 40 birds per pen. The diets, based on corn and soybean meal, and water were offered ad libitum during the 42 -day experimental period. Over the entire period, there was no effect of copper supplementation (P> 0. 05) on bird live weight, weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion and mortality. <b>Cupric</b> <b>citrate</b> supplementation on the 22 - 42 d period resulted in worse feed conversion as compared to broilers receiving cupric sulfate (2. 014 vs. 1. 967, P < 0. 05). Copper residues in the litter were reduced when broilers were fed <b>cupric</b> <b>citrate,</b> as compared to cupric sulfate (P < 0. 01). The absence of response to copper supplementation {{can be attributed to}} the environmental and sanitary rearing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of dietary copper sources and concentrations on serum immune indices and the protegrin- 1 (NPG 1) expression level in the bone marrow of weaning piglets. A total of 80 crossbred piglets (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire), with the average age of 21 days and the initial body weight of 7. 00 ± 0. 03 kg, were randomly assigned to five treatments for 14 days by different kinds of diet. The dietary treatments were: 1, basal diet; 2, basal diet + 20 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4; 3, basal diet + 20 mg/kg Cu as <b>cupric</b> <b>citrate</b> (CuCit); 4, basal diet + 180 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4; 5, basal diet + 180 mg/kg Cu as CuCit. The results showed that compared with basal diet, supplementation with 20 mg/kg Cu as CuCit had no significant difference on growth performance (P> 0. 05). The incidence of diarrhoea was reduced by 71. 57 % and serum lysozyme concentration was increased by 170. 73 % (P 0. 05). The mRNA expression level of NPG 1 was significantly increased by 2. 32 -fold (P< 0. 01). However, the other three trial groups showed no significant differences on the experimental results compared with the basal diet group. These results indicated that supplemental 20 mg/kg Cu as CuCit could increase serum lysozyme concentration and NPG 1 mRNA expression level, and reduce the incidence of diarrhoea in weaning piglets...|$|E
40|$|Objective The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>cupric</b> <b>citrate</b> (CuCit) on growth performance, antioxidant indices, serum lipid metabolites, serum immune indices, and tissue residues of copper (Cu), zinc, and iron in weaned pigs. Methods A total of 180 weaned pigs (Duroc×Landrace×Large White) with an average body weight of 8. 98 ± 1. 21 kg were randomly assigned to a corn-soybean meal control ration, or 4 similar rations with 30, 60, 120, or 240 mg/kg Cu as CuCit. All diets contained 10 mg/kg Cu as cupric sulfate from the vitamin-mineral premix. The experiment was divided into two phases: 0 to 14 d (phase 1) and 15 to 28 d (phase 2). Results Average daily gain (ADG; linearly, p< 0. 01) and average daily feed intake (ADFI; linearly and quadratically, p< 0. 05) were affected by an increase in CuCit during phase 2. Overall period, ADG (p< 0. 05) and ADFI (p< 0. 01) were linearly increased with increasing dietary levels of CuCit. Serum malondialdehyde concentrations (p< 0. 05) and glutathione peroxidase activity (p< 0. 01) linearly decreased and increased respectively with an increase in CuCit. Serum levels of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase were linearly affected with an increase in CuCit (p< 0. 01). Hepatic malondialdehyde levels decreased with an increase in CuCit (linearly and quadratically, p< 0. 01). Serum total cholesterol concentrations were quadratically affected (p< 0. 05) and decreased in pigs fed Cu as CuCit at 60 and 120 mg/kg and increased in pigs fed 240 mg/kg Cu as CuCit. Serum high-density lipoprotein concentrations were linearly affected with an increase in CuCit (p< 0. 01). Serum IL- 1 β levels were quadratically affected (p< 0. 05) by dietary treatment. Compared with other treatments, 240 mg/kg Cu from CuCit quadratically increased hepatic (p< 0. 01) and renal (p< 0. 05) Cu concentrations, and quadratically decreased hepatic and renal iron concentrations (p< 0. 05). Conclusion Cu administered in the form of CuCit at a dosage range of 30 to 60 mg/kg, effectively enhanced the growth performance and antioxidant status of weaned pigs...|$|E
