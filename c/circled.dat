5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then <b>circled</b> the supply wagons in a defensible area.

50|$|The 1 <b>Circle</b> is {{generally}} a large <b>circle</b> of multiple colors, {{while the rest}} of the <b>circle</b> tiles consist of smaller <b>circles,</b> each <b>circle</b> being of one color.

5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton {{on the morning}} of December 26, 1776, Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania. He subsequently decided to attack the British forces before going into winter quarters. On December 29, he led his army back into Trenton.

That night, he evacuated his position, <b>circled</b> around General Lord Cornwallis' army, and went to attack the British garrison at Princeton.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they <b>circled</b> around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E

50|$|Circle: There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to complete this element.

To increase the difficulty of a <b>circle</b> a team can include step sequences, traveling, and changes of rotational direction.
