It seemed as if because of this appointment, Yudhoyono could be considered one of Wahid's men, however Yudhoyono would break ranks from Wahid in July 2001 when the latter was facing impeachment. In desperation, Wahid issued a decree freezing the People's Representative Council (DPR) and then asked Yudhoyono to declare {{a state of emergency}} to further strengthen his position.

25|$|A {{large number}} of the {{evacuees}} were also directed to the nearby Concordia University, where the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is located. The CSU cancelled all remaining Orientation activities, and instead used its venues to temporarily shelter the evacuated Dawson students and provide them with food, water, blankets, and phones to reach other loved ones. A coordination team {{was put in place}} from the CSU and the DSU used the Sir George Williams campus as a temporary <b>crisis</b> <b>centre</b> and offered counselling (psychologist, psychiatrist) to traumatized students and staff. Claude Dauphin (Mayor of the borough of Lachine and Vice-President of the City of Montreal executive committee) had a very close relationship with both of the student unions during the night of the events; Dauphin went to the CSU office's the night of the shooting to meet with both unions to inform them of what the city was doing, and to ask how he could help.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the historical development and current therapeutic practices {{of two of}} Ireland’s feminist-inspired rape <b>crisis</b> <b>centres</b> (Dublin and Galway). The {{focus is on the}} perspective of workers in these centres, whether as volunteers or paid employees. A number of spokes persons and workers in each centre were interviewed over a 15 month period. These interviews form the bulk of the primary data and are used throughout. Interviewees were questioned on a range of policies operating at the centres: recruitment, selection, training and legal issues. Although at the outset the case study was not designed to allow comparisons to be drawn between the two centres concerned, major differences in policy and approach between the Dublin and Galway Rape <b>Crisis</b> <b>Centres</b> lead to inevitable comparison. Indeed, these differences inspired many of the conclusions of the study. Where as one centre continues to operate according to the feminist analysis which first inspired rape <b>crisis</b> <b>centres</b> in the West, the other has adopted a hierarchical management structure with severely curtailed opportunities for volunteer input. While superficially using a similar therapeutic model, the two centres in fact operate from radically opposed premises. This thesis argues that the loss of a feminist perspective on rape reduces the long-term effectiveness of rape <b>crisis</b> <b>centres</b> since without such a perspective, the conditions giving rise to rape are not addressed. Instead the symptoms of rape are “managed” by “professional experts”...|$|R

Officials have also stated that they are coordinating with Indonesian Students Legislative Council Forum. The Indonesian telecommunication company Telkomsel offered free calling services and phone facility services in Meurudu and Ulee Glee, and added that they are coordinating with the local government to assist the victims. The National Mandate Party (Bahasa Indonesia: Partai Amanat Nasional) had also offered its help to the victims.

50|$|Rape {{and sexual}} {{violence}} affects {{a significant proportion}} of the population. In the UK around 1 in 4 women (24%) are sexually assaulted during their lifetime, and there are about 80,000 incidents of rape or attempted rape every year. A study by Durham University found that Rape <b>Crisis</b> <b>centres</b> are highly effective in supporting women who have been sexually assaulted. Nicole Westmarland and colleagues asked women who had used Rape <b>Crisis</b> <b>centres</b> {{about the ways in which}} the support they received had helped them in their lives. The number of people who said that they felt in control of their life doubled following Rape Crisis counselling, and mental health symptoms such as flashbacks and panic attacks were alleviated in around a third of the women who had initially reported these problems.|$|R

The 600-strong 4th Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade represented the strongest ZNG unit in the area, while the JNA is estimated by Croatian sources to have deployed approximately 1,500 troops against Drniš. On 20 September, all Croatian combat troops in Drniš area were subordinated to Luka Vujić. The western bank of the Krka River and approaches to Vodice were controlled by the 3rd Battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade. While small arms were sufficient to arm a part of the battalion at a time, the battalion did not have any heavy weapons.|$|E

50|$|Rape Crisis: Responding to Sexual Violence, by Helen Jones and Kate Cook charts {{the history}} of the Rape Crisis movement, from its great successes in {{supporting}} victim-survivors of sexual violence, to its significant losses as the number of Rape <b>Crisis</b> <b>centres</b> has dwindled. In the preface, former Chair of Rape Crisis Nicole Westmarland describes the book as an opportunity for people outside the Rape Crisis movement to understand its work and motivations. She describes Rape Crisis' journey as simultaneously depressing and inspiring. On the one hand the movement by its very nature highlights the ubiquitous nature of rape, and many Rape <b>Crisis</b> <b>centres</b> face a continuous battle to secure adequate funds; yet on the other hand Rape Crisis acts as a testament to the bravery of victim-survivors of sexual assault, and the strength of those who work to support them.|$|R

In September 2011, Rihanna released [...] "We Found Love", the lead single from her sixth studio album, Talk That Talk; its music video caused controversy from some activist groups, including The Rape <b>Crisis</b> <b>Centre</b> in the UK. Christian youth pastors and the Ulster Cancer Foundation also criticized the video for Rihanna's portrayal of sexual intercourse while {{under the influence of}} illegal drugs, not being a role model to young girls and women and for smoking in the video. Despite the criticism, the video won the awards for Video of the Year at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

500|$|After {{returning}} to London, Mills asked Karmal to marry her. Karmal said yes, but on one condition: [...] "I told her I couldn't marry {{her until she}} did something about her compulsive lying, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eight weeks. She admitted she had a problem {{and said it was}} because she'd been forced to lie as a child by her father". Although Mills proposed to Karmal, she later said that every man she has been out with [...] "has asked me to marry him within a week". The couple married on 6 May 1989. While married to Karmal, she suffered two ectopic pregnancies, so Karmal paid for her to go on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex-wife (with whom Mills had become friends) in 1990, but Mills ended up living with her ski instructor, Miloš Pogačar, shortly before the Croatian War began. Mills set up a refugee <b>crisis</b> <b>centre</b> in London, helping over 20 people to escape the war. She drove to deliver donations to Croatia, taking modelling assignments in Austria on the way to pay for the trip, later saying that she [...] "worked on the front line in a war zone in the former Yugoslavia for two years where there were mines everywhere that weren't marked". Karmal and Mills were divorced in 1991 and Mills was later engaged to Raffaele Mincione (a bond dealer for the Industrial Bank of Japan) in 1993.|$|E
