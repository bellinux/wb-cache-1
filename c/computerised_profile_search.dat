40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} automated domain discovery for topological <b>profile</b> <b>searches</b> in protein structures. The method is used in a system TOPStructure for fast prediction of CATH classification for protein structures (given as PDB files). It is important for <b>profile</b> <b>searches</b> in multi-domain proteins, for which the profile method by itself tends to perform poorly. We also present an O(C(n) k +nk 2) time algorithm for this problem, compared to the O(C(n) k +(nk) 2) time used by a trivial algorithm (where n is {{the length of the}} structure, k is the number of profiles and C(n) is the time needed to check for a presence of a given motif in a structure of length n). This method has been developed and is currently used for TOPS representations of protein structures and prediction of CATH classification, but may be applied to other graph-based representations of protein or RNA structures and/or other prediction problems.

40|$|We {{developed}} a combinatorial search algorithm {{which we call}} best <b>profile</b> <b>search</b> for the global optimization of protein structures. This algorithm finds near optimal solutions in {{an early stage of}} the optimization. We {{developed a}} protein structure scoring function which depends on the distances and orientations of amino acid pairs. We devised an iterative procedure in order to improve the predictive power of the scoring function: We use this best <b>profile</b> <b>search</b> optimization procedure for the ab initio computation of low energy structures of a test set of proteins using our scoring function. This set of ab initio structure calculation is embedded into a second level of optimization: The mean RMSD results of the structure optimizations are taken as an objective function for a simulated annealing procedure. The simulated annealing algorithm minimizes the geometric mean RMSD deviations of the computed structures with respect to their native structures. RESULTS: With the developed scoring function we obtain for proteins of the test set for ab initio structure optimizations a RMSD deviation of 5. 2 Angstroem in the geometric mean, taking the best structure among the top ten scoring structures found during structure optimization...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the expression of genes, including ameloblastin (Ambn), amelogenin X chromosome (Amelx) and enamelin (Enam) during early (pre-secretory) tooth development. The expression of these genes has predominantly been studied at post-secretory stages. Deoxyoligonucleotide microarrays were used to study gene expression during development of the murine first molar tooth germ at 24 h intervals, starting at the eleventh embryonic day (E 11. 5) and up to the seventh day after birth (P 7). The <b>profile</b> <b>search</b> function of Spotfire software was used to select genes with similar expression profile as the enamel genes (Ambn, Amelx and Enam). Microarray results where validated using real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and translated proteins identified by Western blotting. In situ localisation of the Ambn, Amelx and Enam mRNAs were monitored from E 12. 5 to E 17. 5 using deoxyoligonucleotide probes. Bioinformatics analysis was used to associate biological functions with differentially (p ≤ 0. 05) expressed (DE) genes. Microarray results showed a total of 4362 genes including Ambn, Amelx and Enam to be significant differentially expressed throughout the time-course. The expression of the three enamel genes was low at pre-natal stages (E 11. 5 -P 0) increasing after birth (P 1 -P 7). <b>Profile</b> <b>search</b> lead to isolation of 87 genes with significantly similar expression to the three enamel proteins.

Several novel discoveries are presented including the discovery that a domain of unknown function (DUF 283) found in Dicer proteins is related to double-stranded RNA-binding domains.

40|$|Motivation: Sensory domains {{that are}} conserved among Bacteria, Archaea and Eucarya are {{important}} detectors of common signals detected by living cells. Due to their high sequence divergence, sensory domains {{are difficult to}} identify. We systematically look for novel sensory domains using sensitive profile-based searches initiated with regions of signal transduction proteins where no known domains can be identified by current domain models. Results: Using <b>profile</b> <b>searches</b> followed by multiple sequence alignment, structure prediction and domain architecture analysis, we have identified a novel sensory domain termed FIST, which is present in signal transduction proteins from Bacteria, Archaea and Eucarya. Chromosomal proximity of FIST-encoding genes to those coding for proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and transport suggest that FIST domains bind small ligands, such as amino acids.

40|$|Motivation: A typical PSI-BLAST search {{consists}} of iterative scanning and alignment {{of a large}} sequence database during which a scoring profile is progressively built and refined. Such a profile can also be stored and used to search against a different database of sequences. Using it to search against a database of consensus rather than native sequences is a simple add-on that boosts performance surprisingly well. The improvement comes at a price: we hypothesized that random alignment score statistics would differ between native and consensus sequences. Thus PSI-BLAST-based <b>profile</b> <b>searches</b> against consensus sequences might incorrectly estimate statistical significance of alignment scores. In addition, iterative searches against consensus databases may fail. Here, we addressed these challenges {{in an attempt to}} harness the full power of the combination of PSI-BLAST and consensus sequences...|$|R
