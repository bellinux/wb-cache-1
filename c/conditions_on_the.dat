Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable <b>conditions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
