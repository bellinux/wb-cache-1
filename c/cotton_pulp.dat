The rheological properties of <b>cotton</b> <b>pulp</b> dissolved in ionic liquids have been investigated by steady shear and oscillatory shear measurements. The influences of experimental parameters, such as the reaction temperature, additives on the solubility and degree of polymerization (DP) of regenerated cellulose were also studied. The results show that 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([bmim]Cl) was a good solvent to dissolve <b>cotton</b> <b>pulp</b> and the solubility can reach 13 wt% at 90 degrees C, but the DP remarkably decreased from 510 to 180 within 7 h.

In the steady shear measurement, all the solutions show a shear thinning behavior at high shear rates. In addition, a mechanism of the dissolution of cellulose in [bmim]Cl was proposed.

Recovering <b>cotton</b> <b>pulping</b> black liquor (CPBL) is difficult due to its low lignin content. This study presents corn stover pretreatments using CPBL alone and {{in combination with other}} agents to improve the cost-effectiveness of the biomass-to-sugar conversion. The results showed that 78. 4 %, 74. 9 % and 82. 1 % of the lignin was removed after pretreatment with sodium hydroxide (SHP), CPBL (CPBLP) and CPBL combined with sodium sulfite (SS-CPBLP). Accordingly, the glucose and xylose contents in the pretreated corn stover increased to more than 62 % and 24 % after CPBLP and SS-CPBLP, respectively, which was comparable to SHP. Moreover, the total sugar yield of CPBLP and SS-CPBLP was 66. 4 % and 75. 3 %, which was 2. 9 % and 11. 8 % higher than that of SHP (63. 5 %), respectively. The lignin content in the black liquor rose from 6. 9 g/L to 17. 8 g/L, and the sulfonation degree of the black liquor reached 0. 8 mmol/g after SS-CPBLP, which had a positive effect on further lignin utilization. The results indicate that the use of CPBL for corn stover pretreatment not only efficiently produced fermentable sugar products, but also presented a solution to the CPBL pollution issue.

At temperatures below 90 °C almost no water evaporation was observed due to possible strong interactions between water and [bmim][Cl]. For temperatures above 100 °C the vaporised steam condenses and is recycled in the liquid phase. It was demonstrated that dissolution was increased as temperature increases. The various periods of time applied in the pre-treatment {{had no effect on}} the dissolution. Pre-treatment performed at high pressures, such as 3.2 MPa, increased the legume straw dissolution while retaining the initial lignin content found in the original biomass [55]. A 20 % water content in the IL provided the best dissolution of legume straw. These results enabled an optimised pre-treatment at 150 °C for 2  hours under ambient pressure, with a maximum of a 29.1 wt% legume straw dissolved in the aqueous-[bmim][Cl] mixture with water content of 20 wt%. The optimised process demonstrated a lignin extraction of 48.2 % from the original lignin content in the legume straw. However, only 32.4 % was recovered by adding water as a precipitate solvent. The biomass regeneration provided cellulose with an amorphous structural conformation as occurred in pre-treatments with dried ILs [55].
