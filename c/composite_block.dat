50|$|In March 1995 Guo et al. {{were the}} first to report the use of a laser to ablate a block of pure {{graphite}}, and later graphite mixed with catalytic metal. The catalytic metal can consist of elements such as cobalt, niobium, platinum, nickel, copper, or a binary combination thereof. The <b>composite</b> <b>block</b> is formed by making a paste of graphite powder, carbon cement, and the metal. The paste is next placed in a cylindrical mold and baked for several hours. After solidification, the graphite block is placed inside an oven with a laser pointed at it, and argon gas is pumped along the direction of the laser point. The oven temperature is approximately 1200 °C. As the laser ablates the target, carbon nanotubes form and are carried by the gas flow onto a cool copper collector. Like carbon nanotubes formed using the electric-arc discharge technique, carbon nanotube fibers are deposited in a haphazard and tangled fashion. Single-walled nanotubes are formed from the block of graphite and metal catalyst particles, whereas multi-walled nanotubes form from the pure graphite starting material.|$|E

First, a basic heuristic block-loading algorithm is introduced. This algorithm loads one block, determined by a block selecting algorithm, in one packing phase, according to a fixed strategy, until no blocks are available. Second, the concept of <b>composite</b> <b>block</b> is introduced, the difference between traditional block and <b>composite</b> <b>block</b> being that <b>composite</b> <b>block</b> can contain multiple types of boxes in one block under some restrictions.

40|$|Abstract. We study modular, {{automatic}} code generation from hierarchical block diagrams with synchronous semantics. Such diagrams are {{the fundamental}} model behind widespread {{tools such as}} Simulink and SCADE. Modularity means code is generated for a given <b>composite</b> <b>block</b> independently from context, that is, without knowing in which diagrams this block {{is going to be}} used. This can be achieved by abstracting a given macro (i. e., <b>composite)</b> <b>block</b> into a set of interface functions plus a set of dependencies between these functions. These two pieces of information form the exported interface for a block. This approach allows modularity to be quantified, in terms {{of the size of the}} interface, that is, the number of interface functions that are generated per block. The larger this number, the less modular the code is. This definition reveals a fundamental trade-off between modularity and reusability (set of diagrams the block can be used in) : using an abstraction that is too coarse (i. e., too few interface functions) may create false input-output dependencies and result in dependency cycles due to feedback loops. In this paper we explore this and other trade-offs. We also show how the method can be extended from a purely synchronous block diagram model to triggered and timed block diagrams, which allow for modeling multi-rate systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Reconstruction {{materials}} {{currently used}} in clinical for osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB) are unsatisfactory {{due to a}} variety of reasons. Rifampicin (RFP) is a well-known and highly effective first-line anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drug. Poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) are two promising materials that have been used both for orthopedic reconstruction and as carriers for drug release. In this study we report the development of a novel anti-TB implant for osteoarticular TB reconstruction using a combination of RFP, PDLLA and nHA. RFP, PDLLA and nHA were used as starting materials to produce a novel anti-TB activity implant by the solvent evaporation method. After manufacture, the implant was characterized and its biodegradation and drug release profile were tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the implant was also evaluated in pre-osteoblast MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells using multiple methodologies. A RFP/PDLLA/nHA composite was successfully synthesized using the solvent evaporation method. The composite has a loose and porous structure with evenly distributed pores. The production process was steady and no chemical reaction occurred as proved by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Meanwhile, the <b>composite</b> <b>blocks</b> degraded and released drug for at least 12 weeks. Evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells verified that the synthesized <b>composite</b> <b>blocks</b> did not affect cell growth and proliferation.

The <b>composite</b> <b>blocks</b> showed appropriate properties such as degradation, drug release and biosafety to MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells.

Termites offered composite blocks of wood and rubber matched for mass were the slowest to show a preference for the solid wooden block and this preference was the least definitive of any treatment, which indicated that mass and/or damping may play a role in food assessment. This result clearly shows that the termites were not fooled by composite blocks matched for mass or frequency, which implies that they probably employ more than a single simple measure in their food assessment strategy.
