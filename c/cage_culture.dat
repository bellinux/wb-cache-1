50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{aquaculture}} practices in the country. These are: <b>cage</b> <b>culture</b> with cages made of steel frames, cages of bamboo or net or wood; rice-fish culture in irrigated areas; pond culture in small ponds created in rural areas in lowland areas, basically to meet family requirements; and the rain-fed culture in irrigated paddy lands in agricultural fields under suitable agro-climatic conditions. In <b>cage</b> <b>culture</b> the fish catches are species of tilapia (90% sex reversed), snakehead (Channa micropeltis) and (Channa striata), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and pangasius (Pangasius bocourti).

40|$|The marine water area of Serangan Island {{has been}} used for several {{activities}} such as aquaculture, captured fisheries, ships transportation, tourism and also area for leachate discharge from Suwung waste area. Those activities resulted in the decrease of water quality which has negative effect on the <b>cage</b> net <b>culture</b> activities, especially that low water quality decrease the immune system of the cultured organisms. So far, the feasibility of water quality for <b>cage</b> net <b>culture</b> activity in Serangan Island has not been identified.

30|$|Trochus {{addition}} in cages at one trochus per cage did {{not produce}} any effect on turf algal cover and spat survivorship, indicating below threshold grazer density for algal cover control. A similar effect was observed {{in the culture of}} giant clams with trochus, where a trochus density of five per cage (0.36  m 2 with 18 -mm mesh, equivalent to 14  m- 2) {{did not produce}} enhancement in clam survivorship and growth, while a higher density (ten per cage, equivalent to 28  m- 2) did produce such effect (Clarke et al. 2003). A threshold grazer density should, then, be determined when incorporating trochus in <b>caged</b> <b>culture</b> of other reef organisms. This threshold trochus density may be dependent to the nature/type of co-cultured organism and to the culture setup or site. Some organisms may be more sensitive to algal effects and therefore require a higher grazer density. Since there was no observed effect of trochus treatment on spat survivorship in the in situ nursery culture (where environmental parameters were found to be different to that in the hatchery), even at two per cage trochus density, the efficiency of trochus to enhance the survival of coral spat in <b>caged</b> <b>culture</b> is then variable in different culture conditions. For hatchery conditions, the recommended density of trochus to effectively control turf/filamentous algae and thereby enhance spat survivorship is at least eight sub-adult individuals per square meter of cage surface area.|$|R

50|$|In <b>cage</b> <b>culture,</b> several {{different}} methods {{are used for}} feeding farmed fish - from simple hand feeding to sophisticated computer-controlled systems with automated food dispensers coupled with in situ uptake sensors that detect consumption rates. In coastal fish farms, overfeeding primarily leads to increased disposition of detritus on the seafloor (potentially smothering seafloor dwelling invertebrates and altering the physical environment), while in hatcheries and land-based farms, excess food goes to waste and can potentially impact the surrounding catchment and local coastal environment. This impact is usually highly local, and depends significantly on the settling velocity of waste feed and the current velocity (which varies both spatially and temporally) and depth.|$|E
50|$|Canada {{has been}} using the net pen system since the 1970s. Net pen, or cage, {{technology}} started to be used seriously in Canada in the early 1980s in New Brunswick when joint government /private projects introduced cage technology from Norway. <b>Cage</b> <b>culture</b> started seriously in B.C. in the late 1980s. Smaller scale <b>cage</b> <b>culture</b> developed in freshwaters as well, including Georgian Bay, Ontario and Lake Diefenbaker, Sask. and B.C. The oldest operating cage farm in Canada is actually in Georgian Bay.The conventional net-pen is an open mesh net that is suspended within a framework constructed of steel, wood or plastic, that floats at the surface and {{held in place by}} down-haul weights. The arrangement of the cages (net pens) varies considerably. On Canada's east coast typical cages are circular and constructed of high density poly pipe (HDPE). The cages are 60m to 150m in circumference and moored individually within a grid system. On the west coast the cages are often steel with 8 to 24 cages in a group, half on each side of a main walkway. The cages are typically 15m to 30m across and 15m to 30m deep. Natural currents bring fresh, oxygenated water to the net pens and carry away soluble waste. The solid waste fecal material and uneaten feed settle to the ocean bottom near the cage site. Note that the amount of uneaten feed is negligible because the farmers cannot afford to waste feed, which is typically about 60% of their production cost.|$|E

50|$|Pond {{culture is}} the most common system in the country. Other forms of fish culture such as <b>cage</b> <b>culture</b> are only {{starting}} to be discussed especially by the emerging commercial fish farmers. Previously farmers, 99 percent of whom were subsistence fish farmers, had ponds ranging anywhere from 50 m² to 200 m². The majority (an estimated 60 percent) remain at subsistence level of production with little or no technical inputs or management. With the drive to commercialise aquaculture, production efforts to increase the pond surface have resulted in a current average of 500 m² per pond. Farmers at this level have adopted the use of inputs such as quality fish seed and feed. The feed, however, is still usually made on-farm using formulae provided by the Aquaculture Research and Development Centre, Kajjansi.|$|E

Trout is farmed along the high mountain in Lydenburg area, Kwazulu-Natal Drakensberg and the Western Cape. Other freshwater species cultivated on a small scale include catfish, freshwater crayfish and tilapia species. Marine aquaculture is a fast developing sector, with a focus on mussels, oysters, abalone, seaweeds and prawns.

50|$|Fry {{are raised}} in either sea cages, large saline ponds (Philippines), or {{concrete}} tanks (Indonesia, Taiwan). Milkfish reach sexual maturity at 1.5 kg, which takes {{five years in}} floating sea cages, but eight to 10 years in ponds and tanks. Once they reach 6 kg, (eight years), 3-4 million eggs are produced each breeding cycle. This is mainly done using natural environmental cues. However, {{attempts have been made}} using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-A) to induce spawning. Some still use the traditional wild stock method — capturing wild fry using nets.Milkfish hatcheries, like most hatcheries, contain a variety of cultures, for example rotifers, green algae, and brine shrimp, as well as the target species. They can either be intensive or semi-intensive. Semi-intensive methods are more profitable at US$6.67 per thousand fry in 1998, compared with $27.40 for intensive methods. However, the experience required by labour for semi-intensive hatcheries is higher than intensive.Milkfish nurseries in Taiwan are highly commercial and have densities of about 2000/L. Indonesia achieves similar densities, but has more backyard-type nurseries. The Philippines has integrated nurseries with grow-out facilities and densities of about 1000/L. The three methods of outgrowing are pond culture, pen culture, and <b>cage</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Asian {{green mussel}} has {{separate}} sexes and fertilizes externally. There {{are a very}} few functional hermaphrodites (<0.1%). The mussel's sexual development was shown {{to be affected by}} temperature. Spawning ordinarily occurs twice a year between early spring and late autumn; however, the mussels found in the Philippines and Thailand are known to spawn all year round.The zygote transforms to a larva 7-8 hours after fertilization. The larvae stay in the water column for 10-12 days before undergoing metamorphosis into a juvenile and settling onto a surface. The juveniles become sexually mature when they are 15-30 mm in length, a size reached within 2-3 months.
