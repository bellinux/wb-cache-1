So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like {{they really wanted to}} know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
500|$|Knut's {{remains were}} {{exhibited}} in Berlin's Museum of Natural History, although this decision has caused some controversy with fans. A full-sized sculpture covered in Knut's pelt {{was presented to}} the public on 16 February 2013. It went on display in the entrance hall of the museum where it was viewed free of charge until 5 May. It will later be used for an exhibition on climate change and environment protection. Museum spokeswoman Gesine Steiner stated that [...] "It's important to make <b>clear</b> <b>we</b> haven't had Knut stuffed. It is an artistically valuable sculpture with the original fur." ...|$|E
500|$|Hockey {{attempted}} to resolve his dilemma by declaring that as leader he {{would allow a}} conscience vote on the ETS legislation. Abbott rejected Hockey's declaration, and reneged on his earlier indication that he would withdraw his candidacy for Hockey. Abbott stated: [...] "It now seems pretty <b>clear</b> <b>we</b> could change the leader to Joe and these offensive bills could still go through the Parliament". On Hockey's candidacy, Turnbull claimed that Hockey had pledged {{his opposition to the}} spill motion. However, it was expected that if the spill motion succeeded, Hockey would stand for the leadership against Turnbull and Abbott. Hockey was generally expected to win the ballot and become leader. [...] To the end, Turnbull refused to stand aside as leader, insisting he would defeat the spill motion. Hockey later alleged that Turnbull had promised he would not stand against Hockey if the spill motion was successful. Turnbull denied that he had given, and therefore broken, any such undertaking.|$|E

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's <b>clear</b> <b>we</b> have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|Having {{claimed the}} {{election}} was entirely without irregularities, the United States government hailed Diệm as a new hero of the [...] "free world". Senator Mike Mansfield (D-MT) claimed the referendum [...] "was a reflection of their [...] search for a leader who would respond to their needs... they sensed that Diệm could provide that kind of leadership." [...] Mansfield had been a professor of Asian history before entering politics; as a result his opinions about Vietnam were more influential and held in high regard by his fellow senators. Archives of policy discussions show that the Americans were concerned more about the negative image created by Diem's autocratic and antidemocratic style among the international community, rather than its possible effects on national cohesion. The US State Department spokesman said [...] "the people of Viet-Nam have spoken, and we, of course, recognise their decision". An official congratulatory statement from the department said [...] "The Department of State is gratified that according to reports the referendum was conducted in such an orderly and efficient manner and {{that the people of}} Viet-Nam have made their choice unmistakably <b>clear...</b> <b>we</b> look forward to a continuation of the friendly relations between the Government of Viet-Nam and the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{usage of}} the safety car came under {{criticism}} from figures within the sport. Fernando Alonso disagreed with the decision to start under the safety car as he felt it prevented him from attacking Vettel, while Sauber technical director James Key thought his team was put at a disadvantage when Kobayashi could not defend against the quicker cars after the fifth safety car period. Martin Brundle, who competed in Formula One for twelve years, stated [...] "the fact that the drivers came in almost immediately for intermediate tyres tells me that, {{on the face of}} it, the safety car was out too long", and felt that the safety car [...] "should be a last resort, not a default option." [...] However, he recognised that FIA race director Charlie Whiting had to consider the driver's visibility, and inexperience using the Pirelli wet-weather tyres led to caution. Jarno Trulli however agreed with the FIA's decisions, in particular the length of the red flag delay: [...] "It was right to wait that long; track conditions had to improve {{in order to make the}} cars drivable again. They did everything right." [...] De la Rosa and di Resta also agreed with the decision to halt the race, and Whiting stating that [...] "when it rained it was quite <b>clear</b> <b>we</b> needed to stop the race." [...] Whiting went on to say that the opinions of the drivers were taken into account on the decision to halt the race, although he also considered the possibility of a suspension benefiting those drivers.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{stressed}} he {{was merely}} concurring in {{the judgment of the}} Court because he believed that it reached the right result.

[...] Where the language of those laws is <b>clear,</b> <b>we</b> are not free to replace it with an unenacted legislative intent." [...] He also questioned whether the Court's discussion of Chevron deference was correct or appropriate.|$|E

2500|$|ANU is {{well known}} for its history of student {{activism}} and, in recent years, its fossil fuel divestment campaign, {{which is one of the}} longest-running and most successful in the country. The decision of the ANU Council to divest from two fossil fuel companies in 2014 was criticised by ministers in the Abbott government, but defended by Vice Chancellor Ian Young, who noted:On divestment, it is <b>clear</b> <b>we</b> were in the right and played a truly national and international leadership role. [...] e seem to have played a major role in a movement which now seems unstoppable. As of 2014 ANU still had investments in major fossil fuel companies.|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, the Congolese {{government}} sent {{representatives to}} Nairobi {{to negotiate with}} a potential collection of 20 armed groups, who {{had been invited to}} foster peace talks in hopes of ending the conflict and settling issues in what was praised as a brave [...] "first step" [...] towards peace. According to Congolese information minister Lambert Mende, [...] "We want this to be an inclusive process. We don't want to leave anyone out." [...] However, the main rebel group, Laurent Nkunda's CNDP rebels, declined to attend, as did Congolese President Joseph Kabila, as both were after bilateral talks. CNDP spokesman Bertrand Bisimwa stated that this was because the group had not been informed about the decision to invite other groups, including government-aligned militias; he affirmed the rebel decision to have one-on-one talks with the government, stating, [...] "Our position is very <b>clear.</b> <b>We</b> will negotiate with the government and no one else. The government can negotiate with whomever it wants. But any attempt to impose Amani (previous peace talks) on us will fail." ...|$|E

[...] When asked about plans to continue the Innocence + Experience Tour after the Joshua Tree Tour 2017, the Edge said, [...] "We feel like that tour wasn't finished. So right now, we'd love to finish that tour. I would imagine it's gonna be with very similar production components... But we like that tour and that project wasn't completed. It is still alive in our minds creatively." [...] On 1 November 2017, the band officially announced the Experience + Innocence Tour as a sequel of the Innocence + Experience Tour, with concerts in North America during 2018 in support of Songs of Experience.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Chisholm {{joined the}} Sport Relief telethon by {{appearing}} in a Never Mind the Buzzcocks special. Chisholm {{also participated in}} a three-mile [...] "Sport Relief Mile" [...] run. In 2013, Chisholm joined Jack Dee, Dara Ó Briain, Greg James, Chelsee Healey and Philips Idowu in Through Hell and High Water, a Comic Relief challenge which involved British celebrities canoeing the most difficult rapids of the Zambezi River. They raised over £1 million for the charity. [...] In 2014, Chisholm travelled to Ghana to support a charity campaign by Procter & Gamble that provides African children with clean drinking water. The project involved the use of purification sachets that changes the water from stagnant to drinkable. She said, [...] "I've been on charity trips to Africa before. They can be harrowing, but this one was really positive and inspiring. Already it's changing people's lives. When we first arrived, three of the girls took us down to the local water supply, which is basically a big lake shared with animals, so that water can be very dangerous. Using the sachets, {{in half an hour}} the water goes from black to <b>clear.</b> <b>We</b> drank it as well. It's completely and utterly safe." [...] Chisholm also supported a homeless charity by donating funds raised from her annual calendar.|$|E
2500|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] " [...] are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) want nothing to do with native people but yet they're trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very <b>clear.</b> <b>We</b> want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 25 November 2014, the {{findings}} of a British parliamentary inquiry into the murder of Lee Rigby were published. The report found that the death could not have been prevented, although his killers had appeared in seven intelligence investigations. In December 2012, Michael Adebowale had discussed killing a soldier on Facebook with a foreign-based extremist known as [...] "Foxtrot". The UK authorities did not have access to the details of the conversation until June 2013, when they were disclosed to GCHQ. The Intelligence and Security Committee stated [...] "Had MI5 had access to this exchange, their investigation into Adebowale would have become a top priority." [...] Facebook said that it did not comment on individual cases, but responded that [...] "Facebook’s policies are <b>clear,</b> <b>we</b> do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes." [...] In an interview with BBC News on 26 November 2014, Richard Barrett, the former Director of Global Counter-terrorism at MI6, said that it was unfair to expect companies to monitor websites for all potentially extremist content. Facebook had blocked seven of Adebowale's accounts prior to the killing, five of which had been flagged for links with extremism. The accounts had been flagged by an automated process, and no person at Facebook had manually checked the accounts.|$|E
