40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} prickle discomfort sensations of wool fabrics are primarily determined by the mean fiber diameter of the wool. It is also known that differences in wool fiber curvature (crimp) affect softness of handle of greasy wool and of wool textiles. In a replicated experiment, we investigated if wearers could detect the effect of using 17 µm superfine wool of low (74 °/mm) or high (114 °/mm) fiber curvature, and when the wools were blended with 17 µm cashmere (fiber curvature 49 °/mm) in differing proportions, on four comfort sensations. Eight single jersey knitted fabrics were assessed under a controlled protocol using forearm sleeves made of the test fabric and a control fabric. Data (37 sensorial assessments of high curvature wool fabrics; 38 sensorial assessments of low curvature wool fabrics) were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis (restricted maximum likelihood), which included fixed effects for wool type and blend ratio and a random effect for participant. The use of a <b>control</b> <b>sleeve</b> fabric reduced variance due to participant effects by providing an anchor for each sensation over time. Wool fiber curvature affected participant assessment of breathability, comfort, feel after exercise (damp/dry) and skin feel (prickly/soft), with preferred values associated with high curvature (crimp) superfine wool.

40|$|The {{relationships}} were investigated between the prickle discomfort scores, assessed by human response from wearer trial garment assessment, and sleeve trial, Wool ComfortMeter (WCM) and Wool HandleMeter (WHM) assessments of fabrics, and fiber diameter characteristics including mean fiber diameter (MFD). Sleeve trial assessment followed exercise, {{the use of}} a <b>control</b> <b>sleeve</b> to reduce participant variance and four sensory traits. WHM provides eight handle parameters calibrated against a panel of experts. Four scenarios were evaluated: sleeve trial assessment with MFD; sleeve trial assessment with MFD and WCM; sleeve trial assessment with MFD, WCM and WHM parameters; and sleeve trial assessment with WCM and WHM parameters. Data were analyzed using correlation and forward stepwise general linear modeling. There was no evidence that the incidence of fibers coarser than 30 µm aided the prediction of prickle discomfort once MFD had been accounted for in the models. There were significant correlations between the WCM measurement and each sleeve trial attribute. There was no significant correlation between WHM parameters and sleeve trial assessments. The sleeve trial attribute of ‘skin feel’ offers potential to improve the predictions made of wearer trial prickle discomfort when used in association of the WCM with or without data on fabric MFD. There was little evidence to support using WHM parameters with or without the WCM in predicting wearer assessed prickle discomfort of fabrics. These results indicate that the rapid evaluation of fabrics using sleeve trial assessment can provide cost effective ranking of consumer preferences...|$|E

40|$|A {{sleeve valve}} is under {{development}} for ground-based forced response testing of air compression systems. This valve {{will be used}} to inject air and to impart momentum to the flow inside the first stage of a multi-stage compressor. The valve was designed to deliver a maximum mass flow of 0. 22 lbm/s (0. 1 kg/s) with a maximum valve throat area of 0. 12 sq. in (80 sq. mm), a 100 psid (689 KPA) pressure difference across the valve and a 68 F, (20 C) air supply. It was assumed that the valve mass flow rate would be proportional to the valve orifice area. A static flow calibration revealed a nonlinear valve orifice area to mass flow relationship which limits the maximum flow rate that the valve can deliver. This nonlinearity was found to be caused by multiple choking points in the flow path.

We hypothesized that SR stimulation when applied with a sleeve would enhance proprioception relative to the <b>control</b> and <b>sleeve</b> alone conditions. Methods Using a cross-over within subject design, twenty-four healthy subjects were tested under four combinations of conditions: electrical stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/no sleeve, and stimulation/no sleeve. Joint position sense (proprioception) was measured as the absolute mean difference between a target knee joint angle and the knee angle reproduced by the subject. Testing was conducted during both partial-weight bearing (PWB) and non-weight bearing (NWB) tasks. Differences in joint position sense between the conditions were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance testing. Results Joint position sense error during the stimulation/sleeve condition (2. 48 ° ± 1. 32 °) was found to be more accurate (P Conclusion These results suggest that SR electrical stimulation when combined with a neoprene sleeve is an effective modality for enhancement of joint proprioception in the PWB knee.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether calf compression sleeves (CS) affects physiological and biomechanical parameters, exercise performance, and perceived sensations of muscle fatigue, pain and soreness during prolonged (~ 2 h 30 min) outdoor trail running. Methods: Fourteen healthy trained males took part in a randomized, cross-over study consisting in two identical 24 -km trail running sessions (each including one bout of running at constant rate on moderately flat terrain, and one period of all-out running on hilly terrain) wearing either degressive CS (23 ± 2 mmHg) or <b>control</b> <b>sleeves</b> (CON, & 4 mmHg). Running time, heart rate and muscle oxygenation of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (measured using portable near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored continuously. Muscle functional capabilities (power, stiffness) were determined using 20 s of maximal hopping before and after both sessions. Running biomechanics (kinematics, vertical and leg stiffness) were determined at 12 km·h− 1 at the beginning, during, and at the end of both sessions. Exercise-induced Achilles tendon pain and delayed onset calf muscles soreness (DOMS) were assessed using visual analog scales. Results: Muscle oxygenation increased significantly in CS compared to CON at baseline and immediately after exercise (p & 0. 05), without any difference in deoxygenation kinetics during the run, and without any significant change in run times. Wearing CS was associated with (i) higher aerial time and leg stiffness in running at constant rate, (ii) with lower ground contact time, higher leg stiffness, and higher vertical stiffness in all-out running, and (iii) with lower ground contact time in hopping. Significant DOMS were induced in both CS and CON (> 6 on a 10 -cm scale) with no difference between conditions. However, Achilles tendon pain was significantly lower after the trial in CS than CON (p & 0. 05). Discussion: Calf compression did not modify muscle oxygenation during ~ 2 h 30 of trail running but significantly changed running biomechanics and lower limb muscle functional capabilities toward a more dynamic behavior compared to control session. However, wearing compression sleeves did not affect performance and exercise-induced DOMS, while it minimized Achilles tendon pain immediately after running...|$|R

40|$|DOE has {{selected}} the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) {{design for the}} Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project. The NGNP will demonstrate {{the use of nuclear}} power for electricity and hydrogen production. It will have an outlet gas temperature in the range of 900 °C and a plant design service life of 60 years. The reactor design will be a graphite moderated, helium-cooled, prismatic or pebble-bed reactor and use low-enriched uranium, Tri-Isotopic (TRISO) -coated fuel. The plant size, reactor thermal power, and core configuration will ensure passive decay heat removal without fuel damage or radioactive material releases during accidents. The NGNP Materials Research and Development (R&D) Program is responsible for performing R&D on likely NGNP materials in support of the NGNP design, licensing, and construction activities. Today’s high-temperature alloys and associated ASME Codes for reactor applications are approved up to 760 °C. However, some primary system components, such as the Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) for the NGNP will require use of materials that can withstand higher temperatures. The thermal, environmental, and service life conditions of the NGNP will make selection and qualification of some high-temperature materials a significant challenge. Examples include materials for the core barrel and core internals, such as the <b>control</b> rod <b>sleeves.</b> The requirements of the materials for the IHX are among the most demanding. Selection of the technology and design configuration for the NGNP must consider both the cost and risk profiles to ensure that the demonstration plant establishes a sound foundation for future commercial deployments. The NGNP challenge is to achieve a significant advancement in nuclear technology {{while at the same time}} setting the stage for an economically viable deployment of the new technology in the commercial sector soon after 2020. A number of solid solution strengthened nickel based alloys have been considered for application in heat exchangers and core internals for the NGNP. The primary candidates are Inconel 617, Haynes 230, Incoloy 800 H and Hastelloy XR. Based on the technical maturity, availability in required product forms, experience base, and high temperature mechanical properties all of the vendor pre-conceptual design studies have specified Alloy 617 as the material of choice for heat exchangers. Also a draft code case for Alloy 617 was developed previously.

40|$|Lightweight alloy {{materials}} such as magnesium and aluminum alloys are frequently employed in the automotive and manufacturing industry {{in order to improve}} vehicle fuel economy. This creates a pressing need for joining of these materials to each other, as well as to steels. Given the drastic difference in thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and the limited solubility of aluminum or magnesium in steel, dissimilar alloy fusion welding is exceptionally difficult. Refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW) is a solid-state joining technology which connects two materials together with minimal heat input or distortion. The RFSSW process involves a three-piece non-consumable tool with independently <b>controlled</b> <b>sleeve</b> and pin components, which rotate simultaneously at a constant speed with the sleeve penetrating into only the top sheet. Joining of Al 5754 alloy and DP 600 plate using friction stir seam welding is investigated. Two travel speeds of the shoulder are used to compare the mechanical and microstructural properties of the two kinds of welds made. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy are utilized to characterize the microstructure. Mechanical properties are evaluated using tensile testing. Joining of Al 6063 -T 6 and Zn coated DP 600 steel using RFSSW is studied. Spot welds could reach a maximum overlap shear load of 3. 7 kN when using a tool speed of 2100 RPM, a 2. 5 s welding time and 1. 1 mm of penetration into the upper Al 6063 sheet. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were conducted to characterize the interface, which revealed that zinc layer was displaced into the interface and upper sheet, which may facilitate the bonding between the two sheets. Microhardness measurements reveal that the fracture path propagates through the soft heat affected zone of the Al alloy during overlap shear testing. Joining of Mg alloys ZEK with Zn coated DP 600 steel sheets by RFSSW is also studied here. In joints between ZEK 100 and DP 600, the maximum overlap shear fracture load is 4. 7 kN, when a 1800 RPM tool speed, 3. 0 s welding time and 1. 5 mm penetration into the upper ZEK 100 sheet is applied. SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that a continuous layer of FeAl 2 particles accommodate bonding of the ZEK 100 and DP 600 sheets, which appears to have originated from the galvanized coating on the DP 600. If the zinc layer is removed then the maximum overlap shear fracture load is 3. 1 kN. X-ray diffraction analysis of the interface between the Mg alloy and the DP 600 steel on the Mg side also revealed that intermetallic (IMCs) such as FeAl 2 existed as an interfacial layer between the two sheets.

40|$|The Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) is a {{relatively}} new kind of transmission which shows increased efficiency and comfort compared to manual transmissions. Its construction is much like two parallell manual transmissions, where the gearshifts are controlled automatically. The gear-shift of a manual transmission involves a synchronization process, which synchronizes and locks the input shaft to the output shaft via the desired gear ratio. This process, which means transportation of a synchronizer sleeve, is performed by moving the gear shift lever which is connected to the sleeve. In a DCT, there is no mechanical connection between the gear-shift lever and the sleeve. Hence, an actuator system, controlled by a control system, must be used. This report includes modelling, control system design and simulation results of a DCT synchronization process. The thesis work is performed at GM Powertrain (GMPT) in Trollhättan. At the time of this thesis, there is no DCT produced by GM, and therefore the results and conclusions rely on simulations. Most of the used system parameters are reasonable values collected from employees at GMPT and manual transmission literature. The focus of the control design is to achieve a smooth, rather than fast, movement of the synchronizer sleeve. Simulations show that a synchronization process can be performed in less than 400 ms under normal conditions. The biggest problems <b>controlling</b> the <b>sleeve</b> position occur if there is a large amount of drag torque affecting the input shaft. Delay problems also worsen the performance a lot. An attempt to predict the synchronizer sleeve position is made and simulations shows advantages of that. Some further work is needed before the developed control software can be used on a real DCT. Investigations of sensor noise robustness and the impact of dogging forces are the most important issues to be further investigated. Implementation of additional functionality for handling special conditions are also needed...|$|R
40|$|Choke valves {{are widely}} used in the oil&gas {{industry}} to control the fluid flowing in the system. Some of these valves rely on a "cage and sleeve" functioning, in which an outer, sliding <b>sleeve</b> <b>controls</b> the flow rate by overlapping the holes of an inner, fixed cage. The regulation characteristic of choke valves is typically quantified by the opening curve, which is {{the plot of the}} flow coefficient versus the valve opening. Experimental tests performed on a ???cage and sleeve??? choke valve revealed that the orientation of the holes of the cage affects significantly the flow coefficient. This work focuses on the worst situation encountered, in which an anomalous decreasing trend in the opening curve for large valve openings is accompanied by strong vibrations of the device. CFD simulations were run to provide a physical interpretation of this unexpected result. Due to the complexity of the flow field structure at the origin of this behavior particular attention was paid in properly defining the CFD model; the turbulence model and the differencing scheme for the convective fluxes were found to be the most significant parameters. The CFD runs allowed attributing the anomalous trend of the opening curve to the peculiar interactions of the jets within the cage.

We hypothesized that pneumatic compression sleeves worn on the legs during pneumoperitoneum could abolish the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the legs and so eliminate these adverse hemodynamic changes. Design Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with an additional calibration group. Setting A regional referral center. Patients Forty-five consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who developed hemodynamic changes on induction of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum were randomized to 3 groups. Interventions Low-pressure, nonsequential pneumatic compression sleeves, wrapped around the legs, were used to equilibrate the pressure gradient in the study group and to gradually exceed it in the calibration group. In the <b>control</b> group, no <b>sleeves</b> were used. Main Outcome Measures Transesophageal Doppler cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance were monitored noninvasively. Results: The {{creation of}} positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum caused a significant decrease of cardiac output and stroke volume and increased systemic vascular resistance. In the experimental groups of patients, pressurizing the sleeves to the pneumoperitoneal pressure caused a significant increase of cardiac output (from 4. 82 to 6. 74 L/min), increased stroke volume, and decreased systemic vascular resistance (P<. 001). This was not seen in the control group. Additional gradual pressure increase in the sleeves of the calibration group produced no further improvement.

Summerlee drew him on with his chorus of subacid criticism, while Lord John and I laughed at the contest and the lady, her hand upon his <b>sleeve,</b> <b>controlled</b> the bellowings of the philosopher. Life, death, fate, the destiny of man--these were the stupendous subjects of that memorable hour, made vital by the fact that as the meal progressed strange, sudden exaltations in my mind and tinglings in my limbs proclaimed that the invisible tide of death was slowly and gently rising around us. Once I saw Lord John put his hand suddenly to his eyes, and once Summerlee dropped back for an instant in his chair. Each breath we breathed was charged with strange forces. And yet our minds were happy and at ease. Presently Austin laid the cigarettes upon the table and was about to withdraw.|$|R
40|$|Cocoa pod borer (CPB; Conopomorpha cramerella) and Phytophthora pod rot (PPR; Phytophthora palmivora) {{are serious}} pest and disease on cocoa {{plantations}} in Indonesia. Both pest and disease have been controlled with limited success using cultural {{practices such as}} pruning, frequent harvesting, sanitation, plastic sleeving, and chemical pesticides. An experiment was conducted on cocoa plantings in Pinrang Regency, South Sulawesi during the wet season of 2008 / 09 to test the effect of pod sleeving (with transparent degradable and non-degradable plastic bags) and nematode application on CPB and PPR infestation. The nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae (10, 000 active juveniles per pod) was sprayed three times at intervals of 10 and 20 days. Pod damage by CPB was observed at harvest time, while PPR disease incidence was evaluated every week until harvest time. Results showed that all pods in the field were infested by CPB as indicated in <b>control</b> samples. Pod <b>sleeving</b> using both non-degradable and degradable plastics significantly reduced pod damage by CPB, from 62. 3 % in the control treatment compared to 8. 4 % in the CPB treatment. A combination of pod sleeving and nematode application had a synergistic reduction of pod damage by CPB resulting in totally healthy pods. Pod sleeving with degradable and non-degradable plastics also reduced pod damage by PPR significantly. Pod sleeving with non-degradable plastic suppressed the disease incidence almost zero until 6 weeks after sleeving {{and the rate of}} disease incidence was 3. 6 % per week. However, with degradable plastic, the disease suppression was even longer (7 weeks after sleeving), indicating that the degradable plastic is more effective. Combination of sleeving and nematode application slightly increased PPR infection. Sleeved pods in general had lower rates of PPR infection compared to pods treated with nematode or untreated pods (control). In these two applications, the rate of disease incidence was 7. 8 % and 8. 3 % per week respectively. The study implies that biological control using entomopathogenic S. carpocapsae and degradable plastic sleeves are effective and environmentally-friendly to control C. cramerella and P. palmivor...|$|R
