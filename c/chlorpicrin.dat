50|$|CNS (1942-1943): Chloracetophenone solution, {{a liquid}} {{that is a}} mixture of CN Gas (Chloracetophenone) {{dissolved}} in <b>Chlorpicrin</b> or Chloroform. It becomes a potent lachrimator ("Tear gas") when it vaporizes into a gas upon exposure.|$|E
5000|$|The Edgewood Chemical Activity (abbreviated ECA) was a U.S. Army site {{located in}} Edgewood, Maryland that stored {{chemical}} weapons. Its construction {{was started by}} Ordnance Corps in November 1917 and completed {{in less than a}} year. The arsenal was to employ about 10,000 civilian and military personnel in fabrication of chemical weapons and filling gas shells with phosgene, <b>chlorpicrin,</b> chlorine and mustard gas. [...] Since 1941, the U.S. Army stored approximately five percent of the nation's original chemical agent in steel ton containers, at the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground.|$|E
5000|$|The M1 grenade {{could be}} filled with any {{of a number of}} {{chemical}} compounds depending upon the effect required, in both lethal and non-lethal combinations. Most fillers were liquid compounds selected because they were activated by exposure to the air, thus not requiring a detonator. AC filler (Hydrocyanic Acid) was a blood agent. CNS (Chloracetophenone solution) was a tear gas made from CN gas (Chloracetophenone) dissolved in <b>Chlorpicrin</b> and Chloroform. M1 (B Chlorvinyldichlorarsine, or [...] "Lewisite") was a liquid that turned into a powerful vesicant gas upon exposure that chemically burned the surfaces of exposed skin and lungs.|$|E
50|$|Cases of {{dermatitis}} {{caused by}} pesticide exposures, tabulated by the Division of Dermatology, Saku Central Hospital, Japan, from 1975 to 2000 are described. Dermatitis cases gradually decreased from 1975 to 2000, presumably accelerated by the phase-out of dermatitis-causing pesticides, including difolatan fungicide and salithion, an organophosphorous insecticide. Cases of chronic and solar dermatitides gradually decreased, {{which may be}} explained by reductions in the use of allergenic or photosensitive sulfur agents and organophosphates. However, the ratios of chemical burns from irritant pesticides—calcium polysulfide, dazomet, methyl bromide, <b>chlorpicrin,</b> paraqat/diquat, organophosphorus, quintozene, and glyphosate—rose in those years. Chemical burns from calcium polysulfide were responsible for most of the severe cases.|$|E
