40|$|The Digital Interactive Venus Atlas (DIVA) is {{a remote}} sensing {{information}} {{system for a}} catalog of SAR radar image data from the Magellan mission to Venus (1990 [...] 1994). The system consists of a Java based user interface accessible via the WWW, an image map pyramid covering almost the entire Venusian surface, a remote interface to a data archive and a metadata catalog to retrieve quicklooks and information about the data sets available. DIVA makes intensive use of Java's multi-threading capabilities to avoid the performance penalties of traditional WWW-based interfaces. Its {{state of the art}} user interface consists of a scalable, <b>clickable</b> <b>image</b> <b>map</b> for interactive formulation of spatial queries. It provides fast and easy access to the image catalog in a platform-independent way. 1 Introduction Information systems which facilitate access to remote sensing data through integration with geographic context information and spatial query processing capabilities are quickly becoming the nor [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We present aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH {{photometry}} and Bayesian photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects {{detected in}} the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), 8, 042 of which are detected at the 10 -sigma level (e. g., i'< 29. 01 or z'< 28. 43). Most of our objects are defined identically {{to those in the}} public STScI catalogs, enabling straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC 3 PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. The NIC 3 magnitudes are found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to objects of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of - 0. 30 +/- 0. 03 mag in J and - 0. 18 +/- 0. 04 mag in H. The offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC 3 images combined with non-linearity measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the original Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). To accommodate these galaxies, we have added two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0. 04 * 1 +z_spec out to z < 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including Sersic index and asymmetry.

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{unsuccessful}} negotiations were commenced between the NFB and Target Corporation in May 2005, which continued until January 2006. In May 2005, the NFB wrote to Target, {{asking for it}} to make its website accessible {{to people who are}} blind. The NFB requested that Target optimize its website accessibility for the blind by adopting standards promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 standards, specifically encouraging Target to adopt the alt attribute for <b>clickable</b> <b>images</b> featured on the website.
