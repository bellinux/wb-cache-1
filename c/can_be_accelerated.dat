In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated.

25|$|While electrodynamics {{holds that}} {{the speed of light}} in a vacuum is a {{universal}} constant (c), the speed at which light propagates in a material may be significantly less than c.

25|$|The {{notion of}} an interim state of souls after death {{developed}} only gradually, partly because it was of little interest as long as Christians looked for an imminent end of the world. The Eastern Church came to admit {{the existence of an}} intermediate state, but refrained from defining it, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the belief in prayer for the dead that was a constant feature of both Eastern and Western liturgies, and which is unintelligible without belief in an interim state in which the dead may be benefited. Christians in the West demonstrated much more curiosity about this interim state than those in the East: The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity and occasional remarks by Saint Augustine give expression to their belief that sins can be purged by suffering in an afterlife and that the process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accelerated</b> by prayer.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} instance, {{breaking}} the scheme {{is even more}} straightforward. Since {{there are only a}} limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack. One way to do this is to write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts – a technique sometimes known as [...] "completing the plain component". The example given is for the ciphertext [...] "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter. This attack <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accelerated</b> using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.|$|E
500|$|Decompression <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accelerated</b> {{by the use}} of {{breathing}} gases during ascent with lowered inert gas fractions (as a result of increased oxygen fraction). This will result in a greater diffusion gradient for a given ambient pressure, and consequently accelerated decompression for a relatively low risk of bubble formation. Nitrox mixtures and oxygen are the most commonly used gases for this purpose, but oxygen rich trimix blends can also be used after a trimix dive, and oxygen rich heliox blends after a heliox dive, and these may reduce risk of isobaric counterdiffusion complications. Doolette and Mitchell showed that when a switch is made to a gas with a different proportion of inert gas components, it is possible for an inert component previously absent, or present as a lower fraction, to in-gas faster than the other inert components are eliminated (inert gas counterdiffusion), sometimes resulting in raising the total tissue tension of inert gases in a tissue to exceed the ambient pressure sufficiently to cause bubble formation, even if the ambient pressure has not been reduced {{at the time of the}} gas switch. They conclude that [...] "breathing-gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression".|$|E
500|$|Players {{have the}} option to develop their character. At the {{beginning}} of the game, players create their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several races, including humans, orcs, elves and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures, and then customizing their character's appearance. Over the course of the game, players improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas. There are eighteen skills divided evenly among the three schools of combat, magic, and stealth. When players have trained skills enough to meet the required experience, their character levels up. Each time their character levels, the players may choose to select a skill-specific ability called a perk, or store perk points for later use. Earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series used a character class system to determine which skills would contribute to the character's leveling, but Skyrim allows players to discover preferred skills as they play the game and rewards them with more experience when a frequently used skill is leveled. A head-up display (HUD) appears when any of the player's three main attributes (health, magicka, and stamina) are being depleted. Attributes regenerate over time, although this process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accelerated</b> by using potions or regenerative spells. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes damage, and the loss of all health results in death. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, certain poisons, and by being struck by lightning-based attacks. Stamina determines the player's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, performing heavy [...] "power attacks", and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be viewed in 3D, which may prove essential in solving puzzles found in dungeons.|$|E
40|$|Various {{theories}} have predicted the deep Dirac levels (DDLs) in atoms for many years. However, {{the existence of}} the DDL is still under debating, and need to be confirmed experimentally.

In this paper, we propose a new experimental method to study the DDL levels by monitoring nuclei's orbital electron capture life time in plasma induced by high intensive lasers. If a DDL exists, a nuclear electron capture rate could be enhanced by factor of over $ 10 ^ 7 $, which makes it practically detectable in nowadays high intensive laser environments...|$|R

2500|$|Vertical and {{horizontal}} tasting involves {{a range of}} vintages within the same grape and vineyard, or the latter {{in which there is}} one vintage from multiple vineyards. [...] "Banana" [...] flavors (isoamyl acetate) are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as [...] "medicinal" [...] or [...] "Band-Aid" [...] (4-ethylphenol), [...] "spicy" [...] or [...] "smoky" [...] (4-ethylguaiacol), and rotten egg (hydrogen sulfide). Some varieties can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the presence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's soil. Wine aroma comes from volatile compounds released into the air. Vaporization of these compounds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accelerated</b> by twirling the wine glass or serving at room temperature.

2500|$|In the vineyards, {{there is}} also a growing {{distinction}} being made between [...] "ripe" [...] and [...] "unripe" [...] tannins present in the grape. This [...] "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that [...] "riper" [...] tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. [...] As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as [...] "softer" [...] and less tannic. This process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accelerated</b> by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the regularization properties of semiiterative regularization methods in Hilbert scales for linear ill-posed problems and perturbed data.
