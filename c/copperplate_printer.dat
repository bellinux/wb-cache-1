5000|$|John Brandard was {{the second}} of three sons born to Thomas Brandard (d. 1830), {{engraver}} and <b>copperplate</b> <b>printer,</b> of Barford Street, Deritend, Birmingham, and his wife, Ann. His older brother was Robert Brandard. John Brandard was baptized on 13 March 1812 at St Martins church in Birmingham. He {{began his career as}} an engraver, mainly of commercial designs. On 17 January 1833 he married Maria Chater at Edgbaston in Birmingham. They had five children, one of whom, Walter Robert Brandard (1842-1869), was also briefly a designer of sheet music covers. He worked in a lifelong partnership with the lithographic printers M. & N. Hanhart, for whom he produced designs for Louis-Antoine Jullien from 1844 until 1856, when Jullien was ruined following a fire which destroyed his entire stock of music."Brandard took the chromolithograph, which had been first used in connection with music in 1841, to an incredibly high level of sophistication, using half a dozen or more stones to produce a single image, printed on paper of a far higher quality than had been used for this purpose hitherto... The colours red and blue predominate in his palette of the 1840s, along with some exquisitely diaphanous draughtsmanship and plentiful use of gold, especially in filigree borders. This latter was something Brandard may have learned when copying medieval illuminations for the Hanharts’ bound music albums. His covers convey an illusion of luxury and refinement, and are clearly aimed at the wealthier sections of society..." ...|$|E
40|$|Based {{upon the}} unparalleled {{collection}} of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Literature {{held at the}} American Antiquarian Society, this comprehensive directory contains 2, 600 entries documenting the activity of individuals and firms involved in the manufacture and distribution of childrens books in the United States chiefly between 1821 and 1876. Nationally known firms such as McLoughlin Bros. and non-profit publishers like the American Sunday-School Union are included, as well as prominent educational pioneers such as Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Samuel Griswold Goodrich, and William Bentley Fowle. The directory also reflects the dynamic growth of childrens book production in the major publishing centers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia [...] {{as well as in}} regional markets such as Rochester, Mobile, Atlanta, Cincinnati, and San Francisco. In short, the Directory documents both a book industry and an American childrens literature that are coming of age in the midst of stunning technological advances, sweeping social change, and great economic upheaval. The main file (accessed through the Download button to the right) includes name, dates of operation, and address. Other files are as indicated. In toto, the files include: Heading (name of person or firm), Street address, City, State (two-digit postal code), Country (countries outside of the United States; used to document people/firms operating in both the United States and another country such as England); Chronological Date Range of Street Addresses; Role, and Notes. “Role” refers to the following terms: Agent Amateur printer Amateur publisher Binder Binding designer Bookseller <b>Copperplate</b> <b>printer</b> Editor Electrotyper Engraver Games publisher Importer Ink maker Lithographer Lithotyper (Stereotyper) Paper dealer Paper manufacturer Printer Publisher Self-publisher Stationer Stereotyper Wholesale bookseller The Note index file contains more information about the entry, such as dates of books issued by the individual/firm that are held at the American Antiquarian Society. This information is particularly useful to track the activity of persons and firms operating in towns and smaller cities for which no published street directory could be located. The Note index also includes citations to published sources about the individual or firm whenever available. As many of these individuals and firms indexed also manufactured and distributed books for adults, the Directory will prove to be a crucial resource for researchers, collectors, book dealers, and virtually anyone seeking a better understanding of American publishing during the nineteenth century.
