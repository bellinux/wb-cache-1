50|$|Falconbridge Limited in mid-1981 {{commissioned}} a copper smelter and refinery near Timmins, Ontario, to treat concentrate from its Kidd Mine.

50|$|Electrodeposited copper adheres quite {{firmly to}} the {{stainless}} steel {{so that it does}} not detach during refining. The vertical edges of {{the stainless steel}} plates are covered with tight-fitting polymer edge strips to prevent copper depositing {{around the edge of the}} cathode plate and so make it easier to strip the <b>cathode</b> <b>copper</b> from them. The bottom of the cathode plates were masked with a thin film of wax, again to prevent the copper depositing around the bottom edge. Wax was used rather than an edge strip to avoid having a ledge that would collect falling anode slimes and contaminate the <b>cathode</b> <b>copper.</b>|$|E
