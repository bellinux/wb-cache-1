The atomic europium is prepared using a resistively heated oven. Magnetic orientation and linear alignment of the atoms are achieved by laser pumping the atoms with <b>circularly</b> and linearly <b>polarised</b> light. The atoms are ionised by linearly polarised synchrotron radiation of the BE 3 beam-line at HASYLAB. The linear alignment dichroism (LAD) and linear magnetic dichroism in the angular distribution (LMDAD) are measured. The dichroism in the 4 d photo-emission is compared to two different Hartree-Fock calculations. The first calculation {{takes into account the}} recoupling of the half filled 4 f shell. In the second calculation the configuration mixing of the valence electrons is examined. The influences of both effects on the dichroism are studied by comparison with the experimental data. The LMDAD of atomic europium is compared to the CMD of a thin film of solid gadolinium. Strong similarities of the fine structure of both magnetic dichroisms are observed, corroborating inner atomic character of dichroism.

This latest development has demanded more capacity and higher bandwidth in communication links. Static links, which {{are the focus of}} this thesis, {{are an integral part of}} this mobile system in delivering high capacity data transmission using backhauls or nomadic links. Multi polarised antennas with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any antenna is elliptically polarised as it can never be perfectly <b>circularly</b> or linearly <b>polarised.</b> This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and cross-polar linear components, which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual elliptically polarised antenna prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign. Results concluded that at short distances with low scattering in the channel and directional antennas, elliptically polarised antennas provide improved multiplexing gain over dual linear polarisations.

40|$|The new optical {{particle}} spectrometer AIITS (Aerosol Ice Interface Transition Spectrometer) is {{the next}} instrument in the Small Ice Detector (SID) family. Like SID 3, it acquires two-dimensional forward scattering patterns from particles in the size range from about one to a few hundred micrometers (depending on variable settings). The patterns allow quantifying the phase, habit and fine surface features of large aerosol and ice crystals, which are frequently {{too small to be}} adequately characterised using traditional imaging techniques. Two 2 D-forward scattering patterns are recorded per particle using two high-resolution cameras. The cameras fire simultaneously, recording the scattering pattern via a beamsplitter. AIITS can be configured such that the cameras measure either perpendicular polarisations (i. e. P-polarisation with one camera, S-polarisation with the other) or to have a different gain setting on each camera to encompass a larger dynamic range. The incident beam can be either <b>circularly</b> or linearly <b>polarised.</b> Backscatter depolarisation is also measured. The camera and beam configuration must be selected pre-flight.

Three-photon excitation via single rotational levels of the b(1 Σ+g) valence state was used to study np (n= 3 – 10) and nf (n= 4 – 9) Rydberg states converging on O 2 +X(2 Π 1 / 2,g) and X(2 Π 3 / 2,g). The excitation pathway picks out non-predissociated states that are singlet in the (Λ,S) coupling scheme – suitable for np states for n ≥ 8, or are linear combinations of equal weight of singlet and triplet-spin states in the (Ω,ω) coupling scheme which {{was found to be}} suitable for nf states for all values of n. * OTR/RI study of Rydberg and ion-pair states in I 2 Optical triple resonance (OTR) together with resonance ionisation (RI) has been used to study the ungerade manifold of molecular iodine between 57000 and 73000 cm- 1 via the E 0 g+(3 P 2) ion-pair state.

Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarised antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarised signals, and vice versa.|$|E

The interaction between a target analyte (the biological molecule) and the probe results in a modulation of the polarisation of the emission, which is readily, studied using <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> luminescence spectroscopy. <b>Circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> luminescence spectroscopy {{is based on}} the differential emission of left and right circularly polarized radiation by luminescent chiral systems.

The systems used in this study are the luminescent Lanthanide (III) ion complexes, which have proven to be a productive area of research due to their unique optical properties enabling their use in a wide range of applications. A major drawback to using Lanthanide (III) ion is their low extinction coefficients; hence the antenna effect is often used to overcome this problem. In this way, the antenna chromophore absorbs incoming radiation and transfers the energy to the Lanthanide leading to indirect excitation of the Lanthanide (III) ion.
