40|$|Many European {{countries}} have recently implemented civic integration programmes. This kind of policy requires that newcomers meet integration requirements {{in order to}} enter, reside, enjoy social benefits or naturalise in the host country. Migrants are expected to attend language and <b>citizenship</b> <b>courses</b> and/or to take tests after entering in the host country. The immigrant’s failure or non-completion of the programme tends to be sanctioned by refusal of a permit, financial penalties, a loss of social benefits, etc. The content and structure of these programmes vary widely in terms of scope, goals, target groups and institutional actors involved. In this paper, I deal with some crucial questions raised by such policies {{through the lens of}} political theory. First, what can be expected from newcomers, in terms of culture, language or skills? Second, I will show that it is relevant to reverse the point of view and to ask: what can be expected from the “old-comers” in order to integrate newcomers? What {{is the role of the}} citizenry in making (new) citizens? The question is especially important because integration has been increasingly presented as a ‘two-way process’ or as a ‘contract” between the host society and the immigrants: what does it mean and imply? Third, the mandatory language and country-knowledge requirements are particularly significant in their scope and substance. Such a situation raises new challenges to liberal states that should find a balance between policies seeking social cohesion but being also respectful of the immigrants’ moral autonomy...|$|R

Based on methodological and investigator triangulation methods, our aims were to analyze the level of {{satisfaction with}} the Welcome and Integration Contract of Luxembourg (Contract d’accueil et d’integation CAI) and its respective activities (<b>citizenship</b> <b>courses,</b> language courses and an orientation day). First, 233 out of 1084 Non-EU immigrant beneficiaries responded to a self-administrated questionnaire. Second, 11 semi-structured focus groups with 50 volunteers were conducted around four themes: Quality of activities, organization, availability of support personnel and utility of the information received. More than 72 % of the participants were very satisfied with the quality, organisation and availability of personnel, in regard to the information session and the civic courses. Divergences exist because various needs were recognized. Potential activities to reduce the quality gap were proposed, for instance the creation of an interactive online platform where the beneficiaries could regularly get information and, exchange experiences and/or help each other whenever possible. The dynamism and interactivity in the focus groups revealed that the users would like to actively contribute to improving the process. Indeed, the needs and requirements of each immigrant group cannot be totally covered by these activities as they stand.

40|$|Social {{mobility}} {{is a key}} {{concept in}} neighbourhood-based policies in Europe and the US. The Dutch neighbourhood approach often implies physical restructuring combined {{with a range of}} economic and social mobility strategies such as counselling, <b>citizenship</b> <b>courses,</b> debt relief, work training / placement programs and language courses. However, the financial crisis has caused substantial cutbacks in government funding. This adds to the general retrenchment of the welfare state. A broader issue is how these larger developments precipitate in local contexts and to what extent they will harm local social interventions to support upward steps in education, employment and housing. Which elements (if any) of local interventions should be maintained in order to prevent crumbling of positive results of regeneration efforts to date? We will address these issues by a longitudinal panel study of residents in Hoogvliet, a borough of Rotterdam. After the 2007 baseline measurement, the follow-up study is currently conducted. The main objective {{of this study is to}} assess social mobility patterns and outcomes of various social and physical interventions with regard to social mobility of Hoogvliet residents, especially individuals receiving long-lasting support or counselling, which is now reduced or completely stopped. As this research project is only in its very early stages, the paper will do several things. First, we provide a literature review which focuses on larger societal trends which affect social mobility strategies, such as the ‘Big Society’ concept.

40|$|Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are all {{examples}} of European {{countries that have}} implemented civic integration programs. The diffusion of civic integration courses, requirements and tests for newcomers reveals a convergent trend in immigration integration policies. This kind of policy requires that newcomers meet integration requirements in order to enter, reside, reunite with their families, enjoy social benefits and naturalize in the host country (Kostakopoulou 2010). Migrants are expected to attend language and <b>citizenship</b> <b>courses</b> and/or to take integration tests after entering in the host country (since 2006 the Netherlands, pioneers in the field, have implemented tests to be taken before and in the home country of the migrants). The immigrant’s failure or non-completion of the program tends to be sanctioned by refusal of a residence permit, financial penalties, a loss of social benefits, etc. The content and structure of these programs vary widely in terms of scope, goals, target groups and institutional actors involved. This diversity mainly derives from the different historical backgrounds, societal models, as well as patterns and traditions of migration flows. However, beyond the factual analysis {{of the content of}} civic integration programs, my purpose is to analyze some crucial questions raised by such policies through the lens of political theory. It is a good opportunity to question the conceptual frame underpinning the contemporary civic integration discourses. This paper is divided into three parts. In the first section, I discuss the very notion of integration and its implications. Next, the second section is devoted to an analysis of the consequences of the binding character of such programs, and the ways to monitor the success of a migrant after completing a civic integration program. Finally, in the third section I question the real target of such policies: are they aimed at inclusion or exclusion? In conclusion, this paper aims at analyzing the implications of the deep changes experienced by European integration policies. Beyond the understanding of these issues, a broader reflection on the concepts of citizenship, immigration, integration and boundaries is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Germany, The United Kingdom and the United States are {{countries}} with {{high numbers of}} immigration and {{an increasing number of}} migrants who obtain the citizenship of the host country. Besides controlling migration inflows strong institutions of integration are needed. Policy makers in all three countries are discussing potential instruments for {{a better understanding of the}} rights and responsibilities that come with naturalization, how basic information on the political system, the state and society can be conveyed and how a feeling of belonging to the host nation can be encouraged. These aspects are central points of a larger complex, which could be called a culture of integration. In the United States this culture of integration and naturalization has a long tradition: <b>citizenship</b> <b>courses</b> and <b>citizenship</b> tests are to ensure that naturalization applicants receive civic education; through "civil religion" and an almost holy significance of the American nation for the individual, a strong patriotism and a feeling of national loyalty expressed by symbols, celebrations and festival days Americans and immigrants are united beyond ethnic belonging or different religious denominations. This strong patriotism is passed on by national institutions (schools, army) and in everyday life. The significance of belonging and identifying with the United States is also expressed in very festive naturalization ceremonies. Even if organised as large-scale events the naturalization ceremonies still have collective and binding effects. Naturalization in the United States is very much seen as a step in the integration process, not as its completion. Access to American citizenship consequently is relatively easy. In the United Kingdom policy makers are also discussing ways of making the acquisition of citizenship more valuable. The currently applied “mail order approach” will be reformed. Naturalization ceremonies are planned to give added significance to naturalization. The wording of the current oath of allegiance will be modified to a more modern citizenship pledge. Germany is also rethinking its traditional approach to naturalization. With the reform of the Citizenship Law in 2000 it was made easier for immigrants to acquire the German citizenship. As part of the development of a new culture of integration, including a nation-wide integration program, the symbolic side of naturalization is promoted by introducing naturalization ceremonies. They are meant as a gesture of welcome and can be understood as an offer to identify as part of a new German nation. "[author´s abstract...|$|R
