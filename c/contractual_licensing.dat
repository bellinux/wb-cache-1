The thesis consists of four parts. The first part focuses on the institute of <b>contractual</b> <b>license</b> in general. It outlines its conception and basic definitional framework. It reflects the function and the position which the institute of license contract occupies in the Czech rule of law as well as its shift within the framework of Czech private law recodification. It presents diverse typology of <b>contractual</b> <b>license</b> and in the process it thoroughly focuses on its modifications, respectively on marginal agreement models such as franchise agreement and know how agreement. The second part of the thesis continues with text dedicated to the institute of license contract with international element. It presents its general classification and it also analyzes sources of its modification.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{licensing}} models are per single user (named user, client, node) or per user {{in the appropriate}} volume discount level, while some manufacturers accumulate existing licenses. These open volume license programs are typically called open license program (OLP), transactional license program (TLP), volume license program (VLP) etc. and are contrary to the <b>contractual</b> <b>license</b> program (CLP), where the customer commits to purchase {{a certain number of}} licenses over a fixed period (mostly two years). Licensing per concurrent/floating user also occurs, where all users in a network have access to the program, but only a specific number at the same time. Another license model is licensing per dongle which allows the owner of the dongle to use the program on any computer. Licensing per server, CPU or points, regardless the number of users, is common practice as well as site or company licenses. Sometimes one can choose between perpetual (permanent) and annual license. For perpetual licenses one year of maintenance is often required, but maintenance (subscription) renewals are discounted. For annual licenses, there is no renewal; a new license must be purchased after expiration. Licensing can be host/client (or guest), mailbox, IP address, domain etc., depending on how the program is used. Additional users are inter alia licensed per extension pack (e.g. up to 99 users) which includes the base pack (e.g. 5 users). Some programs are modular, so one will have to buy a base product before they can use other modules.|$|R

To accomplish the goals of the wiki, both copyright law and <b>contractual</b> <b>licenses</b> are needed allow unlimited republication, editing (or creation of derivative works), and waiver of control (or integrity) over the resulting publication. This article explores the legal structures and normative rules likely to develop in socially edited content for the Wikis of the future. In keeping with the public migration to attributed online content, this article suggests that collaborative authorship must adapt its normative expectations regarding attribution. Improved attribution will benefit the accuracy and reliability of all social media and new sources, a critical step if news and other content providers hope to regain public trust. For wikis, and particularly for those with academic content, sites should emphasize attribution, content resiliency and audience relevance. These parameters should be integrated into the reporting software. In this way, contributors who have made quantitatively and qualitatively significant submissions can be recognized by research sponsors and academic employers. The ability for academics and researchers to demonstrate their success in creating and disseminating knowledge would propel the continued expansion of social editing resources and public information they generate without harming the open and egalitarian values of wiki culture. At the same time, today’s participants increasingly want to be recognized for their part in social networks and media activities. As part of the newly identified curatorial audience, today’s media consumers participate by creating content, collecting media, commenting on works, and building community around their various interests. Commercial content producers have been driven to reinvent their production and distribution methodology to meet the participatory role of this curatorial audience. Wikis are highly susceptible to these forces and will inevitably evolve to incorporate other forms of social media. Wiki’s traditional norms include a social networking of authorship which excluded not only control and integrity of works but also the sublimation of attribution for particular authors. While collaborative authorship is being embraced by the curatorial audience, the lack of attribution may be running counter to the developing social networking expectations.

50|$|This {{contest in}} {{objectives}} will normally be settled by a compromise of expectations. One {{of the key}} elements {{of this process is}} the royalty applied, amplified here. The royalty is not a single separate element but is a composite of the rate, the length of time over which it applies, the unit base of its calculation, the 'remaining life' of the licensed right (for instance, the balance life of a patent), supportive assistance and other <b>contractual</b> obligations. Other <b>license</b> metrics, such as exclusionary rights modify the rate.|$|R

As is standard procedure in copyright cases, Beastie Boys then asked the court for Newton's lawyers to reimburse Beastie Boys' lawyers for $492,000 in legal fees, but the court declined to award costs.|$|R
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} owners often seek {{to provide access}} to their patented or copyrighted works {{while at the same time}} imposing restrictions on that access. One example of this approach is “field-of-use” licensing in patent law, which permits licensees to use the patented invention but only in certain ways. Another is open-source licensing in copyright law, where copyright owners typically require licensees that incorporate open-source software in other products to license those other products on an open-source basis as well. Surprisingly, though, the legal requirements for granting restricted access are unclear. The source of the lack of clarity is the ill-defined nature of a “license,” which is the usual means of granting access to intellectual property. Must a license be a contract? If so, then the imposition of restrictions presumably must satisfy the rules of contract formation. Or could a license be merely a unilateral commitment to allow limited access to intellectual property, as many open-source advocates contend? If so, then an intellectual property owner could grant access to its property while imposing restrictions to which a licensee has not consented, and of which the licensee might not even be aware. This article argues that the weight of judicial authority and sound policy support a contractual approach. A requirement that license restrictions be imposed only by contract ensures that intellectual {{property owners}} obtain both the consent of licensees to the restrictions and consideration sufficient to make the contract enforceable. As in contract law more generally, these requirements facilitate certainty, predictability, and care in entering productive relationships. Consent is especially important as intellectual property is passed downstream through the distribution chain, because it ensures that downstream market participants are aware of the limitations on their use of intellectual property. Simple notice, which some have proposed as an alternative to contract, has shortcomings that make it a poor criterion for the establishment of infringement liability. The article suggests, though, that in some circumstances notice of an upstream violation of a <b>contractual</b> <b>license</b> should indeed be sufficient to establish liability. Specifically, when a downstream user intentionally induces infringement by an upstream supplier, the downstream user should be liable. In such circumstances, the intent element serves as a substitute for the assent of contract law...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} intermingling {{of civilian}} and military space activities could lead to serious, and perhaps unintended, consequences. While international space law is very permissive with regard to military uses of space, there are considerable legal and security implications resulting from military and civilian dependence on the same space services. From a military perspective, intentional reliance on civilian systems must address, inter alia, national security concerns, <b>contractual</b> obligations, <b>licensing</b> restrictions, liability, and long-term political relationships, while respecting {{the interests of the}} commercial sector. Policy decisions leading to an increase in civilian-military space interdependence must also consider potential impacts of this symbiosis on trade, international relations, and the conduct of armed hostilities. The thesis addresses these and certain related issues in four chapters. The first chapter explores the depth of the interdependence of military and civilian users on the same space systems. The second chapter considers the implications of dual use space technologies, such as proliferation concerns. The third chapter discusses various legal mechanisms States employ to address security issues involving space activities. The final chapter outlines legal restrictions on the use of space assets by armed forces...|$|R

We examine licensing contracts between Spanish and foreign firms during the 1960 s and early 1970 s using a new data source of 925 contracts. The link between patenting and licensing is also analyzed. The work provides evidence to support the hypothesis that the moral hazard problem truly influences the type of payment established in arm's-length contracts when there is an important technological gap between unaffiliated firms. This study also shows that the payment chosen depends on the size of the licensee firm. Copyright 2009 The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Associazione ICC.

40|$|While the {{literature}} on licensing through the Transaction Costs lens is rather extensive, {{the role played by}} third parties in the licensor-licensee relationship has received very limited attention. However, although licensing agreements are essentially dyadic exchanges, licensors and licensees frequently decide to resort to services developed by third parties in order to ease and support their licensing relationships. This support can be required at one or more contractual level(s) : the identification of a licensing partner, the negotiation of the licensing contract, the monitoring of the licensing relationship, and the enforcement of the <b>licensing</b> <b>contractual</b> terms. In this paper, I propose, first, a typology of support services developed by third parties. Second, in line with the Transaction Costs arguments, I develop propositions regarding the incentives for licensing partners to resort to support services develop by third parties. I argue that this resort is contingent to the levels of asset specificity and uncertainty characterizing the licensing transaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} {{an incomplete}} contract {{model of the}} licensing relationship that is susceptible to the moral hazard problem. The optimal <b>contractual</b> form of <b>licensing</b> derived in the model generates predictions {{that seem to be}} consistentwith actual practice. For instance, the introduction of inputs that are not contractible and costly explains the prevalence of royalty contracts in the licensing relationship. Moreover, the model is able to relate the size of the royalty rate to theparameters that represent the environments under which the concerned parties operate. The framework also provides a rigorous evaluation of the recent debate on the issue of technology licensing and competitiveness in the global economy. In addition,the difficulty that the licensor faces in controlling the use of information in the development of related products in the future can also explain the rationale for including grant-back clauses in licensing contracts. Finally, the model can be naturally extended to analyze the choice of a technology holder between direct investment and licensing in an attempt to serve a foreign market. ...|$|R

That is the first requirement of applicability of investment regime to state undertakings. Despite state undertakings was seen as wide concept (by some tribunals) {{the language of the}} clause and prevailing view support undertakings must be limited to contractual undertakings (in practice some viewed that Umbrella Clause can be extended to municipal law obligations)). However, for the purpose of attribution of contracts under international law, states must be involved. But international obligation only arises when state abuses its contractual undertaking. When contracts are concluded by private parties, the investor must demonstrate that that private party was exercising the element of governmental function when it entered into on behalf of particular state. And also, breach must arise from the exercising of granted public function. This will narrow the types of <b>contractual</b> undertakings to <b>licenses,</b> concessions or stabilization clauses.

The images are often intellectually essential for scholarly study and teaching, and they are sometimes economically valuable for production of the coffee mugs and note cards sold in museum shops and elsewhere. Though the law is unclear regarding copyright protection afforded to such images, many museum policies and licenses encumber the use of art images with <b>contractual</b> terms and <b>license</b> restrictions often aimed at raising revenue or protecting {{the integrity of the}} art. This article explores the extent to which museums have strained the limits of copyright claims and indeed have restructured concepts of ownership and control in ways that curtail the availability and use of art images far beyond anything that may be grounded in the law. This article examines the relevant copyright law applicable to the making and use of reproductions of art images, and it identifies the challenging pressures that museums face as they strive to make policies in the context of law but that also serve the multiple competing interests coming to bear on officials and decision makers inside museums. The article analyzes selected policies from major museums and provides an original construct of forms of “overreaching” that often appear in written standards offered by museums for the use of images. The analysis of policies also demonstrates that museums have choices in the shaping of institutional policies, and that breaking away from familiar policy terms can sometimes better serve institutional and public interests...|$|R
40|$|Grid and Cloud Computing {{have become}} very popular over the years. Cloud {{computing}} received a real boost through several commercial offers by big companies initially selling their spare CPU cycles {{to the general public}} and now making business with dedicated resources. This scheme gets adopted more and more, and there is a strong demand to not only run home-grown software in the Grid or Cloud, but also licensed, off-the-shelf software created by Independent Software Vendors (ISV). However, current licensing methods have several aspects that severely limit the usability of licensed software in these environments. First of all, licensing models do not always allow running licensed soft- ware outside the administrative domain stated in the license agreement. There are other common <b>contractual</b> measures in <b>license</b> agreements to protect the ISV's ownership of the code and stop users from using the code in an unlawful manner. While technical measures exist to cover traditional licensing scenarios, largely distributed environments spanning different administrative domains pose new challenges to the technical implementation of license management. A small number of projects have already tried to tackle the problem from the technical point of view. Some of them technically bent the existing licensing solution and opened them up to the public world, e. g. by setting up authenticated proxies and pretending that external requests to the license server come from the internal network [2, 3]. These techniques, while technically feasible, kept the original licensing mechanisms and may have bent contractual obligations in some cases. In the SmartLM project [1], we've developed a solution, which allows license servers to issue tokens of limited lifetime for the execution of a job. We've managed to avoid the necessity of being connected to the license server all the time. Thus, compute jobs can be moved wherever they need to go. In order to avoid that the user has any added value from using the token multiple times, the token is bound to exactly one set of input data using cryptographic methods. SmartLM also tackles the legal and business aspects, by including ISVs and business experts in the development of new licensing models. The technical measures described in this work incorporate their requirements...|$|R
30|$|At {{the heart}} of triple helix {{innovation}} lies the realisation that intra-helical knowledge is an inter-helical innovation asset. As with every other asset, the valorisation of intra-helical knowledge through inter-helical triple helix research productivity ultimately requires commodification. The commercial value of a commodity depends entirely on its marketability which, in turn, entirely depends on its transferability—either in toto or as regards its innate utilisation and consumption entitlements. Transferability is impossible without the legal (hence, enforceable) recognition and protection of ownership, control and disposition rights that make the commodity a commodity {{in the first place}} (Todeva 2005, 2013). In other words, both marketable property rights in knowledge assets and the legal (and, often, exclusive) ownership, control, utilisation and disposition rights vested in a property holder (i.e. asset owner) need to be institutionally recognised and protected by law ex ante of any (ability of) valorisation. If the organisational and institutional design (of triple helix intermediation) indeed matters for purposes of the performance, growth and sustainability of firms, ‘quasi-firms’ (Etzkowitz 2003 b) and other (quasi-)entrepreneurial ventures (including real-world triple helix projects) (Fitjar et al. 2014; Garrett-Jones et al. 2013; Klerkx and Leeuwis 2008; Roberts 2004), then law, in particular, the legal organisational setup and control of such firms and other ventures, constitutes a crucial, indeed, foundational ingredient of their overall institutional governance and efficiency equilibria (La Porta et al. 2000; Maughan and McGuinness 2001). Law and its organisational tools institute both the individual enabling structures and the global infrastructure for innovation and entrepreneurship to occur and to create economic value. Law and legal organisation also decide to whom the economic benefits of innovation and entrepreneurship activity will accrue. The creation and distribution of social welfare gains qua law, thus, also drive innovation and entrepreneurship intermediation. Here, the productive focus may be more on the provision of value-added innovation services (Wright et al. 2008 : 1206) rather than on the development of innovative goods or technologies. Still, for intermediation (and intermediary knowledge and services) to constitute an innovation asset—thus, for a market for intermediation services to exist in the first place—the law has to similarly recognise such services as a valuable commodity, has to support their marketability in predictable and enforceable <b>contractual</b> buy-sell or <b>licensing</b> transactions and has to ultimately decide to whom the economic gains of intermediation activity will accrue—both, direct gains (i.e. financial income) and indirect gains (i.e. new innovation assets created through intermediated team productivity). To paraphrase Tuunainen (2005 b: 285), the triple helix and its intermediation may ‘be conceptualized in terms of historically-evolving local activities where researchers [, firms and government agencies] make use of heterogeneous sets of cultural resources [including legal resources] to achieve their particular objectives.’ Given that a particular society’s provision of legal resources is neither accidental nor ad hoc—in other words, that such provision has to be planned, organised, structured and specifically legislated ex ante—there are two possible avenues for the legal support and organisation of triple helix intermediation: either a given legal jurisdiction can adapt existing legal property and governance structures to accommodate and recognise triple helix innovation assets (as well as their ownership and control), or the same jurisdiction can adopt new, sui-generis property and governance structures by legislative action in order to properly domicile and organise such assets as public goods.|$|R
