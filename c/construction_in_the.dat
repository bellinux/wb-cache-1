5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor costs have eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E

5|$|A {{neighborhood}} variously called East Hackensack or New Hackensack {{was established}} along a ridge {{on the east}} bank of the Hackensack River, site of a Native American trail that followed the river's path along what is now River Road, with the earliest known buildings constructed dating {{back as far as}} 1704. Other early European settlements were established along what became Teaneck Road, which is the site of a number of Dutch stone houses that remain standing since their <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1700s, several of which {{have been added to the}} National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|DM's {{expansion}} {{would require}} the construction of 281 miles (452km) of new track, upgrading 598 miles (962km) of existing track (including all of the railroad's mainline track in Minnesota), new mainline connections Owatonna and Mankato, Minnesota, and three new rail yards. The plan would be the largest new railroad <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909.|$|E

In the mid-1950s director John Huston came to town with Gregory Peck to film a scene from his adaptation of Moby-Dick in front of the Seamen's Bethel. Although it was the only scene in the film actually shot in the city, it sparked a resurgence of tourist interest when it was released.|$|E

5|$|The defences at Sedan also lacked any mines. The French Second Army was {{guarding}} a {{front of}} , {{and was given}} only 16,000 mines. Of that number, 7,000 {{were given to the}} cavalry divisions that were intended to delay a German advance through southern Belgium as well as to blockhouse points along the Franco–Belgian border. That left 2,000 for the defence of the river Meuse. Of those, the 55th Infantry Division got 422. Not all of these were laid, and some barriers were moved during the bunker <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sedan sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{station and}} parking tower {{are the main}} {{architectural}} structures. They are the landmarks of Zuoying, and their scale meets {{the conditions of the}} environment. As the major public <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, the station applies glass screens to frame Half-Screen Mountain in the backdrop, a technique referred to as “scenery-borrowing.” The glass screens are supported by a colonnade on the ground floor. As one of the architectural characteristics of southern Taiwan, the colonnade here can relieve the pressure the building might bring to the streets.|$|E
5|$|The time of {{the present}} church's {{construction}} cannot be exactly defined.

One author has placed its <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 13th or early 14th century and others include the 11th century among the possibilities.|$|E

5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was {{the construction of a}} dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its <b>construction.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.|$|E

5|$|Andrić {{initially}} had {{a precarious}} {{relationship with the}} communists because he had previously been an official in the royalist government. He returned to public life only once the Germans had been forced out of Belgrade. Na Drini ćuprija was published in March 1945. It was followed by Travnička hronika that September and Gospođica (The Young Lady) that November. Na Drini ćuprija came {{to be regarded as}} Andrić's magnum opus and was proclaimed a classic of Yugoslav literature by the communists. It chronicles the history of the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge and the town of Višegrad from the bridge's <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century until the outbreak of World War I. The second novel, Travnička hronika, follows a French diplomat in Bosnia during the Napoleonic Wars. The third, Gospođica, revolves around the life of a Sarajevan woman. In the post-war period, Andrić also published several short story collections, some travel memoirs, and a number of essays on writers such as Vuk Karadžić, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, and Petar Kočić.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
