50|$|The {{standard}} requires <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>IFRSs</b> {{which are}} relevant to the specific circumstances of the entity. In a situation where no specific guidance is provided by IFRSs, IAS 8 requires management to use its judgement to develop and apply an accounting policy that is relevant and reliable. Changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors are generally accounted for retrospectively, unless this is impracticable; whereas changes in accounting estimates are generally accounted for prospectively.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} corporate governance structures on the levels of <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>IFRSs</b> disclosure requirements by companies listed on the stock exchanges of two leading MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries, Egypt and Jordan. This study employs a cross-sectional analysis of a sample of non-financial companies listed on the two stock exchanges {{for the fiscal year}} 2007. Using an unweighted disclosure index, the study measures the levels of compliance by companies listed on the two stock exchanges investigated. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses are used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. In addition, the study uses semi-structured interviews in order to supplement the interpretation of the findings of the quantitative analyses. An innovative theoretical foundation is deployed, in which compliance is interpretable through three lenses - institutional isomorphism theory, secrecy versus transparency (one of Gray’s accounting sub-cultural values), and financial economics theories. The study extends the financial reporting literature, cross-national comparative financial disclosure literature, and the emerging markets disclosure literature by carrying out one of the first comparative studies of the above mentioned stock exchanges. Results provide evidence of a lack of de facto compliance (i. e., actual <b>compliance)</b> <b>with</b> <b>IFRSs</b> disclosure requirements in the scrutinised MENA countries. The impact of corporate governance mechanisms for best practice on enhancing the extent of compliance with mandatory IFRSs is absent in the stock exchanges in question. The limited impact of corporate governance best practice is mainly attributed to the novelty of corporate governance in the region, a finding which lends support to the applicability of the proposed theoretical foundation to the MENA context. Finally, the study provides recommendations for improving de facto <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>IFRSs</b> disclosure requirements and corporate governance best practice in the MENA region and suggests areas for future research...|$|E
