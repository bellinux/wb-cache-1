5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but <b>can</b> <b>on</b> rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they <b>can,</b> <b>on</b> occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|Criminal {{cases with}} an assumed {{perpetrator}} {{are sent to}} the public prosecutor, who will consider issuing an indictment.

Cases with more than six years maximum penalty will normally be carried out with public prosecutors prosecuting. Either party <b>can,</b> <b>on</b> specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the court of appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Norway.|$|E

5|$|The White House sent a {{cable to}} the US Embassy, Saigon on November 4 agreeing that Cẩn {{and his mother}} needed evacuation. General Đổ Cao Trí, the {{commander}} of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế, privately told Cẩn that the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam. On 5 November, Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Trí was then told that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon, immediately for his own protection. Trí would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy officials would meet <b>Cẩn.</b> <b>On</b> the journey to the capital, Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The palace, like Windsor Castle, {{is owned}} by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. It is not the monarch's {{personal}} property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and StJames's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Sovereign; they <b>can,</b> <b>on</b> occasion, be viewed by the public at the Queen's Gallery, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World WarII. The palace's state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms. In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.|$|E

25|$|The {{expected}} {{cash flows}} from such projects {{depend on a}} number of factors. These include the services the facility provides as well as the regulatory regime under which it operates. Facilities that operate primarily to take advantage of commodity arbitrage opportunities are expected to have different cash flow benefits than ones primarily used to ensure seasonal supply reliability. Rules set by regulators <b>can</b> <b>on</b> one hand restrict the profit made by storage facility owners or on the other hand guarantee profit, depending on the market model.|$|E
25|$|However, even a {{government}} {{with a healthy}} majority <b>can</b> <b>on</b> occasion find itself unable to pass legislation. For example, on 9 November 2005, Tony Blair's Government was defeated over plans which would have allowed police to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without charge, and on 31 January 2006, was defeated over certain aspects of proposals to outlaw religious hatred. On other occasions, the Government alters its proposals to avoid defeat in the Commons, as Tony Blair's Government did in February 2006 over education reforms.|$|E
25|$|The GDR {{had some}} seventy decorations for persons or groups it wished to recognize, and it {{bestowed}} them liberally.

25|$|Since {{transmission}} electron goniometry {{is based}} on Bragg’s Law for the transmission (Laue) case (diffraction of electron waves), interzonal angles (i.e. angles between lattice directions) can be measured by a procedure that {{is analogous to the}} measurement of interfacial angles in an optical goniometer on the basis of Snell’s Law, i.e. the reflection of light. The complements to interfacial angles of external crystal faces <b>can,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, be directly measured from a zone-axis diffraction pattern or from the Fourier transform of a high resolution TEM image that shows crossed lattice fringes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match, AJ Styles faced Shane McMahon. During the match, Styles {{attempted}} a springboard 450° splash on Shane, who countered into a triangle choke on Styles, who then countered into a one-armed Styles Clash on Shane for a near-fall. After the referee was knocked down, Styles attempted a Coast-to-Coast on Shane, who countered by attacking Styles with a trash can. Shane then performed a Coast-to-Coast into a trash <b>can</b> <b>on</b> Styles for a near-fall. Shane attempted a Leap of Faith through an announce table on Styles, only for Styles {{to move out}} of the way and Shane fell through the announce table. As Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane, Shane countered into a float-over DDT on Styles. Shane attempted a shooting star press on Styles, who avoided the move and performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Out of Reach {{has been}} reissued along with Can's 1979 self-titled release Can (which {{is also known}} as Inner Space, named after the band's {{recording}} studio). Various other reissued versions of this album do exist on CD, such as the issue of Out of Reach (without <b>Can)</b> <b>on</b> MagMid (TKO Magnum Music) in the United Kingdom, although it is considerably more difficult to find than other Can albums in general. However, this album, being the only Can album that features no input from Holger Czukay (as its 1979 followup Can had some editing by Czukay), has been disowned by the band in recent years as it is not listed as part of Can's discography on their official website, and was not remastered on CD in the 1990s, nor was it reissued on Super Audio CD in the mid-2000s as all the other Can studio albums were.|$|E

25|$|The Green Sun Princes' {{disadvantage}} is {{that they}} are few in number; only 50 infernal essences are controlled by the Yozis, and they do not yet have the ability to corrupt further Solar Essences as the Deathlords <b>can.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the Infernals have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. The Infernals are closely tied to their Yozi masters, and experience Urge, psychological motivations towards missions set by their patrons. Unlike Abyssals, Infernals rarely regret their state, and instead revel in their mission to overthrow the upstart gods and return creation to its original rulers. It is implied, however, that due to the inherently poor treatment by the Yozis (being unable to fully comprehend things outside of their domain and thus with little respect for anything else) and obvious insanity, the vast majority will grow dissatisfied and go rogue, using their link to Primordial power to mutate into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision they possess.|$|E
25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly <b>can</b> <b>on</b> the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
25|$|Sudden {{changes in}} the atmosphere's {{vertical}} moisture content and temperature profiles <b>can</b> <b>on</b> random occasions make UHF, VHF and microwave signals propagate hundreds of kilometers up to about 2,000 kilometers (1,300mi)and for ducting mode even fartherbeyond the normal radio-horizon. The inversion layer is mostly observed over high pressure regions, but there are several tropospheric weather conditions which create these randomly occurring propagation modes. Inversion layer's altitude for non-ducting is typically found between 100 meters (300ft) to about 1 kilometer (3,000ft) and for ducting about 500 meters to 3 kilometers (1,600 to 10,000ft), and {{the duration of the}} events are typically from several hours up to several days. Higher frequencies experience the most dramatic increase of signal strengths, while on low-VHF and HF the effect is negligible. Propagation path attenuation may be below free-space loss. Some of the lesser inversion types related to warm ground and cooler air moisture content occur regularly at certain times of the year and time of day. A typical example could be the late summer, early morning tropospheric enhancements that bring in signals from distances up to few hundred kilometers for a couple of hours, until undone by the Sun's warming effect.|$|E
