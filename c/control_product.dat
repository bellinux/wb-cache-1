25|$|A {{biological}} <b>control</b> <b>product</b> {{has been}} under development since the late nineties. It {{is based on a}} naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungus (i.e. insects-infecting fungus), Metarhizium acridum. Species of Metarhizium are widespread throughout the world, infecting many groups of insects, but show a low risk to humans, other mammals and birds. The species M. acridum has specialised on short-horned grasshoppers, to which group locusts belong, and has therefore been chosen as the active ingredient of the product.|$|E
2500|$|Laboratory {{tests can}} help {{determine}} the shelf life of a package and its contents {{under a variety of}} conditions. This is particularly important for foods, pharmaceuticals, some chemicals, and a variety of products. The testing is usually product specific: the mechanisms of degradation are often different. Exposures to expected and elevated temperatures and humidities are commonly used for shelf life testing. [...] The ability of packaging to <b>control</b> <b>product</b> degradation is frequently a subject of laboratory and field evaluations.|$|E

40|$|An {{economical}} {{and practical}} {{alternative to the}} standard end-of-pipe odour control methods is the application of liquid odour <b>control</b> <b>products.</b> Currently, there are no established product-testing methods. The data that are available are often of questionable quality and may have limited relevance to waste management. Waste facilities receive differing streams of waste at varying loading volumes. Whilst in operation this exposes <b>control</b> <b>products</b> {{to a wide variety}} of environmental conditions, further increasing the difficulty of selecting an effective means of control. The current study initially identifies commercially available odour <b>control</b> <b>products</b> applicable for solid and liquid waste management operations. Bench-scale batch absorption tests have been carried out to investigate odorous gas abatement for a range of selected commercial products and water at a range of pH values. Hydrogen sulphide was the test odorous gas, as it is commonly associated with waste processes. Gas-phase volumetric mass-transfer coefficients (K(G) a) have been calculated to determine mass-transfer performance. The development of a pilot-scale spray tower is then presented as the testing apparatus for future work. This is an attempt to construct a repeatable testing method for evaluating abatement performance of odour <b>control</b> <b>products,</b> and <b>control</b> the problems encountered when applying odour <b>control</b> <b>products</b> to open sites. K(G) a values and data collected from tests in this study will be considered in future work as design parameters for the rig...|$|R
