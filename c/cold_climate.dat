5|$|Edinburgh Zoo is a zoological park in Edinburgh, Scotland {{which opened}} on 22 July 1913. Edinburgh had {{previously}} been home to a zoological garden which failed to thrive. The new zoo is owned and run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and initially opened as the Scottish National Zoological Park. Modern zoological methods allowed animals to survive in Edinburgh's <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also {{perhaps because of the}} <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> of England.|$|E

After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a <b>cold</b> <b>climate,</b> it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the main mast.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals {{would never be able to}} live in a <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E

5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca, as the {{indigenous}} {{groups in the}} west of Colombia, developed a variety of textiles from fique or cotton. Cords were made of fique or human hair. The people of the <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> Altiplano {{did not have a}} major cotton production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the Muzo in the west, Panche in the southwest, Guane in the northwest, and the Guayupe in the east. From the raw cotton, the Muisca women made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union had 26 major ports, {{eleven of}} them inland ports. There were 70 ports in total. None of the ports could be {{considered}} major by world standards. By the 1980s the majority of Soviet ports were lagging behind the First World technologically. There were also {{a high number of}} surplus workers, many of whom would become redundant if the USSR would introduce new, more advanced, technology. Also, in the northeast territories of the USSR most ports were closed down due to <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b> It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|By October 1906, {{many in the}} U.S. government, {{including}} Secretary of State Elihu Root, {{were worried}} that war could break out in the Pacific between the United States and Japan. However, the Aleutian Islands {{were believed to be}} of little strategic importance to the United States, and were ignored by a number of pre-war strategies formulated by the U.S. armed forces, including the Naval War Board's 1896 plan, which would have brought only a few scout ships to the Islands. In 1911, the Naval War Board considered three options through which Japan could mount an invasion of the United States, one of which involved an attack on the Aleutian Islands. However, this option was discarded by the Board owing to the <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> of the islands.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a <b>cold</b> <b>climate),</b> members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies {{can last}} for some {{considerable}} time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b> This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name forma rainierensis. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, {{such as in the}} redwood forests, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma wilsonii. American mycologist R. H. Petersen described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} gold fields, most took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway in Southeast Alaska. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River and sail {{down to the}} Klondike. Each of them was {{required}} to bring a year's supply of food by the Canadian authorities {{in order to prevent}} starvation. In all, their equipment weighed close to a ton, which for most had to be carried in stages by themselves. Together with mountainous terrain and <b>cold</b> <b>climate,</b> this meant that those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Two {{primarily}} terrestrial mammalian species {{inhabit the}} archipelago: the Arctic fox and the Svalbard reindeer. There are 15 to 20 types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears. About 30 types of bird are found on Svalbard, {{most of which}} are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million individuals during late summer. Sixteen bird species are on the IUCN Red List. In particular, Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding grounds for seabirds. Svalbard has permafrost and tundra, with both low, middle and high Arctic vegetation. There have been found 165 species of plants on the archipelago, although vegetation only covers 10% of the island group. Low precipitation gives the archipelago a steppe climate; however plants still have good access to water because the <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> reduces evaporation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to demonstrate that the perceived importance of wages is a function of thermal climate and national wealth. As hypothesized, analyses of 37 nationally representative samples of 22 483 blue- and white-collar workers and 5544 managers show that wages are perceived as more important in poorer countries with <b>colder</b> <b>climates</b> (e. g., Azerbaijan) than in richer countries with <b>colder</b> <b>climates</b> (e. g., Canada) and in poorer and richer countries with temperate climates (e. g., Uganda, Singapore).

5|$|Conditions in the Virungas {{were very}} harsh for the RPF. At an {{altitude}} of , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the high-altitude <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b> Kagame {{spent the next two}} months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. Alexis Kanyarengwe, a Hutu colonel who had previously worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation; the appointment of Kanyarengwe was motivated by a desire to appear inclusive, but most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Rank and file numbers grew steadily, with volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldiers' conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population. Certain offences, such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.|$|E
5|$|About 1272, {{work began}} on {{building}} a new cathedral in Östra Aros near the Fyris River to the south. It was constructed {{on the site of}} the earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, located almost exactly where the cathedral's chancel now stands. It was here that Sweden's patron saint Eric Jedvardsson had attended mass before he was murdered in 1160. The name of Uppsala was kept, and the surrounding town Östra Aros soon changed its name accordingly. The relics of Saint Eric, the treasure of Uppsala, were moved from Gamla Uppsala to the new site in 1273, along with the formal move of the archbishopric. The church was designed by French architects although the name of the author of the detailed initial plans who supervised work until 1281 has not been recorded. In 1287, a promissory note drawn up by the provost of Paris covers the expenses to be incurred by master builder Étienne de Bonneuil and his assistants in travelling to Sweden to work on the construction of a cathedral at Uppsala. Étienne is credited with work at the east and south chapels of the chancel, the transepts and probably the south portal, although in most of his work he appears to have meticulously followed the plans of his predecessor. Progress was slow as a result of the <b>cold</b> <b>climate,</b> the plague and many financial difficulties. It was not until the end of the 14th century that work on the initial plans was completed, thanks in particular to the contribution of the master builder Nikolaus från Västerås who began construction of the nave.|$|E
