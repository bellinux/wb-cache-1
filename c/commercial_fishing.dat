5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned <b>commercial</b> <b>fishing</b> on the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to <b>commercial</b> <b>fishing</b> in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen target many sharks {{for their}} jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely {{an object of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>fishing,</b> {{although}} its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.|$|E

40|$|Appearance {{traits in}} fish, those {{external}} body characteristics that influence consumer acceptance at point of sale, {{have come to}} the forefront of <b>commercial</b> <b>fish</b> farming, as culture profitability is closely linked to management of these traits. Appearance traits comprise mainly body shape and skin pigmentation. Analysis of the genetic basis of these traits in different fish reveals significant genetic variation within populations, indicating potential for their genetic improvement. Work into ascertaining the minor or major genes underlying appearance traits for <b>commercial</b> <b>fish</b> is emerging, with substantial progress in model fish in terms of identifying genes that control body shape and skin colors. In this review, we describe research progress to date, especially with regard to <b>commercial</b> <b>fish,</b> and discuss genomic findings in model fish in order to better address the genetic basis of the traits. Given that appearance traits are important in <b>commercial</b> <b>fish,</b> the genomic information related to this issue promises to accelerate the selection process in coming years...|$|R

Despite his efforts to maintain a steady fish supply through egg-collecting and fish-rearing, salmon catches on the Rogue, rising in some years and falling in others, generally declined over time.

5|$|The {{effect that}} seamounts have on fish populations {{has not gone}} unnoticed by the <b>commercial</b> <b>fishing</b> industry. Seamounts were first {{extensively}} fished {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the <b>commercial</b> <b>fishing</b> industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
