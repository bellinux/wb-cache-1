The equivalent circuit is a quarter-wave short circuited transmission line, the line having characteristic impedance 25812. 807449 Ohm, the von Klitzing constant. A similar line, <b>closed</b> <b>on</b> <b>itself</b> after a twist (as in a Moebius strip), not only justifies the charge and mass, but also the angular momentum of the electron. 1 -Forewords The electric charge is quantized. This means that it has only one elementary charge "e " and multiples of value "e", the electron charge. This is a fact: the electron is an elementary quantum of charge "e". More. The electron is an elementary quantum of mass m or energy at rest "E". Energy {{is associated with a}} frequency through the expression "is equal to h nu”. The letter "h " is Planck's constant. The Greek letter "nu " is the frequency. This too must be noted and taken as fact...|$|E
40|$|In this research, the {{examined}} area is localized in the Sassari {{region and}} affects a geographical {{sector of the}} Mannu hydrographic basin of Portotorres: the Giunche Valley. This area, that includes some municipal territories like Ossi, Tissi, Usini, Florinas, Ittiri, Siligo and Banari, is delimited from natural borders as watersheds that divide the Mannu large basin in more subsystems including, precisely, the sub-basin of Giunche Valley, vasts 50 kmq. The landscape is characterized from a set of undulating hills, sometimes steep and harsh, mainly submitted as in the antiquity as today to the pastoral exploitation and, moderately, to agricultural exploitation. The research aims to understand the settlement dynamics in this region during the Early History. It was found that Nuragic populations have implanted several permanent establishments (“nuraghi” and villages of huts), on heights and on hills, which carry out a decisive control on natural resources and, above all, on the main stream, that constituted {{an important source of}} economy and represented an important communication route for people, artifacts and knowledge. Different community meeting places accompany the seats of life like cultural order (temples) or in funerary environment (Giants tombs). From the analysis is clear that the Giunche Valley wasn’t <b>closed</b> <b>on</b> <b>itself</b> but was in constant contact with the surrounding territories. </br...|$|E

40|$|It {{has often}} been stated that Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} and aurorae are intermediate between those of Earth, where the dominant processes are solar wind driven(1), and those of Jupiter, where processes are driven by a large source of internal plasma(2 - 4). But this view is based on information about Saturn that is far inferior {{to what is now}} available. Here we report ultraviolet images of Saturn, which, when combined with simultaneous Cassini measurements of the solar wind(5) and Saturn kilometric radio emission(6), demonstrate that its aurorae differ morphologically from those of both Earth and Jupiter. Saturn's auroral emissions vary slowly; some features appear in partial corotation whereas others are fixed to the solar wind direction; the auroral oval shifts quickly in latitude; and the aurora is often not centred on the magnetic pole nor <b>closed</b> <b>on</b> <b>itself.</b> In response to a large increase in solar wind dynamic pressure(5) Saturn's aurora brightened dramatically, the brightest auroral emissions moved to higher latitudes, and the dawn side polar regions were filled with intense emissions. The brightening is reminiscent of terrestrial aurorae, but the other two variations are not. Rather than being intermediate between the Earth and Jupiter, Saturn's auroral emissions behave fundamentally differently from those at the other planets. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The scheme consists of three non-linear coils having star-connection without zero wire. Weberampere characteristics correspond to similar parameters of separate frames of a magnetic conductor. It has been accepted that a magnetic flow of every frame is <b>closed</b> <b>on</b> <b>itself</b> without passing into other frame of the magnetic conductor. Electromagnetic state of equivalent diagram {{has been described by}} a system of differential equations which were solved with the help of MathCad program. Investigations have resulted in calculation of functions for magnetic frame induction and magnetizing current and their harmonic compositions; dependence of actual amplitude for magnetic field induction on amplitude of the main harmonic induction has been determined in the paper. While executing experiments it has been revealed the following: induction amplitude of the main harmonic in the magnetic field within frames of the magnetic conductor is higher in comparison with the design induction value by 15. 5 %; due to non-linearity of weber-ampere characteristics in frames and properties of 3 -phase system harmonic components, which are multiple of three, are initiated in the functions of magnetic induction for separate frames; high-order harmonics of function for magnetic frame induction being imposed on the main harmonic decrease an actual amplitude of magnetic field induction practically up to the design induction value within the operational range of the actual amplitude and in this context coefficients of high-order harmonics change insignificantly; harmonic components, which are multiple of three, are absent in magnetizing currents.  </p...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now well}} known that edge {{localized}} modes (ELMS) lead to the ejection {{of a number of}} filamentary structures into the scrape-off layer (SOL). ELMS thus generate structures with excess energy and density. Recent results show that ELM filaments also carry current. Furthermore it can be conjectured that ELM filaments leave corresponding holes behind. If such a hole is able to reach a resonant magnetic surface it may <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>itself</b> and thus increase its lifetime significantly, thereby becoming detectable. We presume that the Palm Tree Mode (PTM) is a signature of such an event. Understanding PTMs therefore enhances our knowledge of ELMs and edge physics and contributes to the verification of ELM models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

We investigate the dependence of this probability upon the size r of a protein bridge and/or the presence of a kink at half DNA length. The DNA is modeled by the Worm-Like Chain model, and the probability of loop formation is calculated in two ways: exact numerical evaluation of the constrained path integral and the extension of the Shimada and Yamakawa saddle point approximation. For example, we find that the looping free energy of a 100 base pairs DNA decreases from 24 kT to 13 kT when the loop is closed by a protein of r = 10 nm length. It further decreases to 5 kT when the loop has a kink of 120 degrees at half-length. Comment: corrected typos and figures, references updated; 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.

40|$|The elegant {{analysis}} of De Wit and Koehler on {{the interaction of}} dislocations with an applied stress in anisotropic crystals is extended {{to the case of}} a uniformly varying stress field. As in Reference (1), the energy of a segment of the curved dislocations considered here is taken to be that for a long straight dislocation of the same orientation. This assumption is valid if (a) the orientation dependance of the core energy is negligible or it is {{the same as that of}} the elastic energy, and (b) the radius of curvature of the dislocation is large compared to the distance to a free surface which is parallel to the slip plane. The analysis was developed to investigate the case of dislocations near a free surface under conditions where (b) is satisfied. A detailed verification of (a) must await further analysis, but it is clear that unless the dislocation approaches the free surface to within a few core radii, the elastic energy will dominate. The differential equation for the equilibrium shape of a dislocation in a linearly varying stress is first presented. The equilibrium shape of a dislocation in its slip plane is then found. Unlike the solutions for a uniform stress field, the equilibrium curve does not <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>itself.</b> The equilibrium shapes are shown to imply critical source lengths between pinning points, beyond which the dislocation is unstable and acts as a Frank-Read source. The critical length is found to be dependant on the direction of the Burgers vector (or the direction of bowing) when the Burgers vector is not perpendicular to the stress gradient...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{competing}} dynamics model and the effective potential formalism for studying phase stability during mechanical milling of Ag-Cu and Cu-Fe systems.

For the Ag-Cu system, the dynamical phase diagram exhibits a miscibility gap that <b>closes</b> in <b>on</b> <b>itself</b> at low temperatures, due to the exponentially decreasing thermal diffusivity (and hence, increasing influence of ballistic diffusivity) with decreasing temperature.

Further, Peirce’s thought offers suggestions for tackling some of the most stubborn problems in contemporary philosophy, thereby enabling us to shoulder once more the philosophical responsibility which has been abdicated by much of twentieth-century philosophy.
