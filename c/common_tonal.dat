5000|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{are designed}} with a different approach than that used to design sound reinforcement system power amplifiers and home [...] "hi-fi" [...] stereo systems. Audio amplifiers generally are intended to accurately reproduce the source signal without adding unwanted tonal coloration (i.e., they have a flat frequency response) or unwanted distortion. In contrast, most guitar amplifiers are intended to provide tonal coloration and/or overdrive (distortion of various types) that can add to a guitar signal. A <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> coloration sought by guitarists is rolling {{off some of the}} high frequencies. Along with a guitarist's playing style and choice of electric guitar and pickups, the choice of guitar amp model is a key part of a guitarist's unique tone. Many top guitarists are associated with a specific brand of guitar amp. As well, electric guitarists in blues, rock and many related sub-genres often intentionally choose amplifiers or effects units with controls that distort or alter the sound (to a greater or lesser degree).|$|E
40|$|A new formal {{analysis}} of the tonal accent contrast in Urban East Norwegian (UEN), is developed in this paper, based on Optimality Theory. In opposition to the widespread assumption that the contrast is based on privativity, this paper represents {{a return to the}} position that the contrast derives from different timing of a common underlying melody. Surface privativity, i. e. the absence vs. presence of an H, that can be observed in the contrast between accent 1 and 2 in Urban East Norwegian,, is analyzed as the result of marked (accent 1) vs. unmarked (accent 2) association of a <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> input. The marked status of accent 1 follows from lexical pre-linking, protected by high-ranking faithfulness, which overrides (unmarked) association driven by the markedness constraints alone...|$|E

While these traditional standards are most <b>common,</b> for <b>tonal</b> or aesthetic reasons luthiers more commonly experiment with different tonewoods on basses than with electric guitars (though this is changing), and rarer woods like walnut and figured maple, as well as exotic woods like bubinga, wenge, koa, and purpleheart, are often used as accent woods in the neck or on the face of mid- to high-priced production basses and on custom-made and boutique instruments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Image mosaicing is {{stirring}} {{up a lot}} of interests in the research community for both its scientific significance and potential spinoff in real world applications. Being able to perform automatic image alignment in a <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> and spatial reference can trigger a wide range of higher level image processing tasks such as panoramic image construction, scene depth computation, resolution enhancement, motion detection and tracking using non stationary camera. In this work we propose a fully automated real time on-line mosaicing algorithm able to build high quality seam-free panoramic images. Moreover, the whole approach does not exploit any a priori information regarding scene geometry, acquisition device properties or feedback signals, thus resulting in a fully image based solution. Extensive experiments have been accomplished to assess the quality of the attained mosaics by using them as the background to perform motion detection and tracking with a Pan Tilt Zoom camera. ...|$|E
40|$|Western-enculturated {{listeners}} {{use different}} tonal schemas when listening to major versus minor mode (e. g., C. L. Krumhansl and E. J. Kessler, 1982, Tracing the dynamic changes in perceived tonal organization in a spatial representation of musical keys, Psychological Review, Vol. 89, pp. 334 – 368). To avoid possible tonal ambiguity, {{one might expect}} composers to attempt to disambiguate or clarify the mode soon after a work begins. The major mode is the most <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> schema in Western music, so listeners might expect that an unknown work {{will be in the}} major mode. This suggests that composers might tend to cue listeners sooner when presenting works in the (rarer) minor mode. In this article, we report on 2 studies that test the hypothesis that mode-defining pitches occur earlier for minor-mode works. Surprisingly, the studies do not support this hypothesis: in fact, mode-defining scale tones (mediant and submediant) appear significantly later in notated music than in scrambled versions of the same scores, regardless of the mode. Repercussions of the results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Liszt {{scholarship}} of recent decades has produced research along many lines of inquiry in an endeavor to increase {{recognition of the}} composer {{as one of the}} most important and influential musical figures of the nineteenth century. While a great deal of this discourse has been devoted to uncovering Liszt’s influence on the twentieth century on many fronts, there has been a noticeable lack of substantive investigation of the ways in which Liszt sowed the seeds of the musical Impressionism of Debussy and Ravel through the evocative writing of his nature pieces for piano. This study aims to fill that void by exploring the ways in which this influence came about, first through an examination of his most significant pieces of nature music, followed by an illumination of the innovative framework of suggestive writing that he pioneered through these pieces. Specifically, the study will detail the ways in which Liszt achieved vivid sensual and pictorial suggestion through a number of compositional strategies: 1) the subversion of <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> practices; 2) the manipulation of the musical canvas to influence perceptions of time and physical distance; 3) the development of a vocabulary for pictorial suggestion that was idiomatic to the piano; and 4) the use of performative gesture to enhance the meaning of such vocabulary. Finally, this framework will be applied to the Impressionistic piano pieces of Debussy and Ravel to reveal their debts to Liszt’s innovative writing, which have often been obscured by the differences in surface aesthetic. In the end, the conclusions drawn from this study suggest that Liszt’s legacy in this regard extends well beyond the music of the French Impressionists, exerting direct and indirect influence on all subsequent composers of evocative piano music...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} impart how Lowell Liebermann {{incorporates}} <b>common</b> practice <b>tonal</b> elements into his twentieth-century Concerto for Piccolo. This {{will be shown}} through {{a detailed analysis of}} the three-movement work highlighting how the composer uses characteristics of common practice tonality as compiled by Joseph Straus in the third edition of his text, Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory. This document is organized into five sections. The first explains background information on the concerto as well as presents the parameters to be used for the analysis. The second through fourth sections provide an analysis of each movement in chronological order, detailing how the characteristics for tonality are used or if they are dismissed in favor of more contemporary compositional techniques. The final section provides an overview of the tonal attributes of the entire work based on the detailed analyses provided for each movement. The closing statement aims to round out the discussion and reiterate why this concerto is a valuable addition to the piccolo’s repertoire. Advisor: Stanley V. Kleppinge...|$|R

Although it is <b>common</b> for "replacive" <b>tonal</b> {{patterns}} {{to be assigned}} by wordlevel morphological constructions, it is far less common for such overriding schemas to be assigned by specific phrase-level syntactic constructions. Kalabari, an Ijo language of Nigeria, does exactly this: Whenever the noun is preceded by a modifier, it loses its tones and receives different "melodies" depending on the constructional word class of the preceding specifier/modifier, either /HL/, /HLH/, /LH/, or /L/. In this paper, we first document the assignment of these different syntactic melodies and then provide evidence for how they developed diachronically. We then present a brief survey of other linguistic phenomena which partially resemble the Kalabari system, but conclude that tone is the only phrasal phonological property that can be assigned by construction from word to word...|$|R
50|$|Tonal {{languages}} are {{found throughout the}} world but are predominantly used in Africa. Both the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoi-San phyla are fully tonal. The large majority of the Niger-Congo languages is also tonal. Tonal {{languages are}} {{also found in the}} Omotic, Chadic and South & East Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic. The most <b>common</b> type of <b>tonal</b> system opposes two tone levels, High (H) and Low (L). Contour tones do occur, and can often be analysed as two or more tones in succession on a single syllable. Tone melodies play an important role, meaning that it is often possible to state significant generalizations by separating tone sequences ("melodies") from the segments that bear them. Tonal sandhi processes like tone spread, tone shift, downstep and downdrift are common in African languages.|$|R

Michael Kibbe (1945 -) (dramatic duet for baritone and cello) The music for this recital was chosen with two main criteria in mind: 1) to challenge myself in preparing music {{from some of}} the larger, collective forms of the standard vocal literature; and 2) to prepare and present music which is of special interest to me from both a musicalogical and performance viewpoint. 	The first criteria was fulfilled by selecting, for the opening half of this recital, an entire German solo cantata with instrumental accompaniment and a complete cycle of French melodies. The second criteria was fulfilled by programming solely American songs for the second half of this recital. 	Johann Sebatstian Bach???s Cantata BWV 82 (Ich habe genug) opens the recital. This work, written for the Festival of the Purification of Mary, stands at the crossroads between Bach???s earlier cantata style of arias, choruses and chorale verses and his later, more operatic style of cantata, using the da capo aria and secco recitative between arias. Using Biblical text for only the first aria, Bach paints three different musical pictures of the poet???s longing for the peace of death in the arms of Jesus while unifying them within a <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> basis. The opening aria, in c minor, is a long and passionate cry for relief from the sufferings of the world, requiring great vocal intensity and stamina to carry the long, arching phrases to their conclusion. The second aria, in the relative E major, is a slumber song whose flowing melody requires delicacy and tenderness of presentation. The concluding aria, returning to c minor, contrasts the opening aria by requiring extended coloratura to express the ecstatic expectation of death within robust, dance-like music. 	Completing the cantata is Gabriel Faure???s cycle of four melodies, L???Horizon Chimerique, Op. 118, written in 1922 and the last of Faure???s many melodies. The theme of the cycle is much the same as the cantata ??? the desire to escape the sufferings of the earth. The poet, Jean de la Ville de Mirmont, dreams of the sea as his escape but in the end must return to land, leaving a feeling of longing and resignation not found in the cantata. The challenge of the cycle is to combine the flowing melodic lines and the syllabically set poetry with the piano accompaniment to create the moods and feelings of the breezes, the sea, and the moon and the land.

40|$|Allusions, Illusions and Delusions (2013) is {{an eight}} minute work for full {{orchestra}} that blends elements of lyricism with fast kinetic music, orchestral tutti with smaller groupings and solos, and familiar harmonic language with more exotic combinations. The piece {{begins with a}} bang, employing a figure that blurs the distinction between major and minor triads. After the ensuing short introduction, the flugelhorn’s lyrical theme becomes the main focus; indeed, elements of this solo line help to shape the entire piece. Following an expansive orchestral tutti built on this theme, the line and the ensemble are broken down and small groups of instruments begin a climb to the fast section of the piece. The longest portion of the score, this fast section takes the listener on a roller coaster ride with sharp turns and many ups and downs. The ride continues building more and more intensity and energy until the climax, marked in the score “huge and bombastic. ” As this cacophonous “wall of sound” dies down, four solo strings and a clarinet emerge, recalling moments of the flugelhorn solo. A solo bucket muted trumpet presents a final paraphrase of the theme, bringing the piece to a calm and soothing resolution. Allusions, Illusions and Delusions takes its title from elements of the piece itself and {{from a number of}} external influences. The lyrical flugelhorn solo beginning at measure 27, the rapidly changing harmonies of the fast section, polychordal segments (such as the Eb major/d minor simultaneous sonority found in measures 87 through 89), and the climax at J, allude to the sounds of triadic harmonies from <b>common</b> practice <b>tonal</b> music. Aspects of these harmonies also create a sense of illusion: The main melodic and harmonic sounds used in the piece are intervals of seconds and thirds, and their inversions. By using minor seconds simultaneously as melodic and harmonic intervals, the quality of a triad or chord is often blurred, fooling the listener into thinking that they are hearing a triad, when five or more notes might actually be present. Delusion refers to the way a listener might react to the music. Often listeners invent a story to go along with a piece of music as a way for them to organize and understand the musical journey that they are experiencing. When there is no extra-musical idea tied to the piece at all, as in this instance, listeners might well be deluding themselves...|$|R
