The aim {{of this study was to}} identify suboptimal care during standardised simulated scenarios and to identify the potential <b>causation</b> <b>factors.</b> MethodsParticipants were emergency department and operating theatre staff in Sydney, Australia. Incidents of suboptimal care were identified during scenarios and were analysed by thematic qualitative assessment methods. Potential <b>causation</b> <b>factors</b> were elicited both during and immediately after the scenarios and during facilitated debriefings. <b>Causation</b> <b>factors</b> were attributed to any of seven pre-defined categories. ResultsSeventy-three simulations occurred over 9 month period in 2011. 270 doctors, 235 nurses and 11 students participated. 194 incidents of suboptimal care were observed and attributed to 325 <b>causation</b> <b>factors.</b> There were 76 knowledge deficits, 39 clinical skill deficits, 36 leadership problems, 84 communication failures, 20 poor resource utilisations, 23 preparation and planning failures and 47 incidents of a loss of situational awareness. Clinically important themes were: paediatric life support, drug choice and doses, advanced airway and ventilation, intravenous fluids and recognition of the deteriorating patient. Recurring incidents included the failure to recognise a cardiac arrest, inadequate fluid resuscitation and incorrect medication dose administration.

The study is performed by modelling the <b>causation</b> <b>factor</b> for a ship-to-ship collision scenario. The assessment is provided in terms of the probability distribution of the time required to the officer on the watch (OOW) to complete a foreseen procedure aimed at avoiding a collision with another ship. The time needed to identify and agree the evasive manoeuvre with the second ship is evaluated for the two layouts, considering also a probabilistic occurrence of disturbances distracting and delaying the OOW during the procedure. Bayesian networks are employed to model the scenario. A general increment of the reactivity of the OOW in the integrated bridge is seen, represented by a shorter time to complete the procedure and by a reduced probability of being interrupted. The overall effect is an increase in the time available to put into practice the manoeuvre itself and, eventually, to avoid the collision...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{interaction}} between and consequences of <b>causation</b> <b>factors</b> is essential when designing active safety measures. There is frequently a lack of adequate details in the area of causation, especially pertaining to Single-Vehicle Crashes (SVCs). This study describes the in-depth and on-scene investigations of 38 SVCs that took place in Gothenburg, Sweden. The <b>causation</b> <b>factors</b> involved were analysed using the Driving Reliability and Error Analysis Method (DREAM). The 38 SVCs were grouped into four scenarios. In the first scenario, vehicles drifted out of lane due to driver fatigue, sleepiness or distraction. In the second, an undetectable reduction in road friction caused experienced drivers to lose control in curves. Loss of control in curves was also a factor in scenario three, partly due to high speed. In this scenario, drivers overestimated their driving skills or had limited experience of the vehicle or the curve. In the final scenario, alarmed drivers lost control as a result of excessive steering-wheel manoeuvres. This study demonstrates a methodology {{that can be used to}} explain how a combination of factors may increase the risk of SVCs...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there can}} be various causes of dog pancreatitis, such as drugs, fatty diet, trauma, etc., the {{pathophysiology}} is very complex. [...] Pancreatitis can be idiopathic; no real <b>causation</b> <b>factor</b> can be found. Obese animals as well as animals fed a diet high in fat may be more prone to developing acute and chronic pancreatitis. [...] Certain breeds of dogs are considered predisposed to developing pancreatitis including miniature schnauzers, Cocker Spaniels, and some terrier breeds. Miniature Schnauzers as a breed tend toward developing hyperlipidemia, an excess of circulating fats in the blood. The breed {{which appears to be}} at risk for the acute form of pancreatitis is the Yorkshire Terrier, while Labrador Retrievers and miniature Poodles seem to have a decreased risk for the acute form of the disease. It is suggested that genetics may play a part in the risk factor. Dogs suffering from diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease (hyperadrenocorticism), hypothyroidism and epilepsy are at increased risk for pancreatitis. Diabetes and hypothyroidism are also associated with hyperlipidemia. Those with other types of gastrointestinal conditions and dogs who have had previous pancreatitis attacks are also at increased risk for the disorder.|$|R

40|$|The strong {{prevalence}} of human error as a crash <b>causation</b> <b>factor</b> in motorcycle accidents calls for countermeasures that help tackling this issue. Advanced rider assistance systems pursue this goal, providing the riders with support and thus {{contributing to the}} prevention of crashes. Importantly, the systems can only enhance riding safety if the riders use them. For this reason, acceptance is a decisive aspect {{to be considered in}} the development process of such systems. In {{order to be able to}} improve behavioural acceptance, the factors that influence the intention to use the system need to be identified. This paper examines the particularities of motorcycle riding and the characteristics of this user group that should be considered when predicting the acceptance of advanced rider assistance systems. Founded on theories predicting behavioural intention, the acceptance of technologies and the acceptance of driver support systems, a model on the acceptance of advanced rider assistance systems is proposed, including the perceived safety when riding without support, the interface design and the social norm as determinants of the usage intention. Since actual usage cannot be measured in the development stage of the systems, the willingness to have the system installed on the own motorcycle and the willingness to pay for the system are analysed, constituting relevant conditions that allow for actual usage at a later stage. Its validation with the results from user tests on four advanced rider assistance systems allows confirming the social norm and the interface design as powerful predictors of the acceptance of ARAS, while the extent of perceived safety when riding without support did not have any predictive value in the present study...|$|R

Synergies between limestone and slag have been suggested to enhance the performance of such cement.
