5|$|An {{amino acid}} is also {{amphoteric}} {{with the added}} complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid–base equilibrium in which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic <b>carboxyl</b> group, forming a zwitterion.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining <b>carboxyl</b> group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two <b>carboxyl</b> groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) were chemically {{treated in}} acidic KMnO 4 solution. XRD, nitrogen physisorption, FTIR and chemical titration {{were used to}} investigate {{the influence of the}} treatment conditions on the surface structure, the bulk structure, the types and the amounts of the formed surface oxygen-containing functional groups of CNTs. The results show that the structure is not changed clearly after treatment and the formation of oxygen-containing groups, e. g., <b>carboxyls,</b> on the CNT surface is dependent on the treatment conditions. Under the present conditions, the concentration of the employed sulphuric acid and the weight ratio of the solid KMnO 4 and CNTs have clear influence on the formation of <b>carboxyls,</b> however, by comparison, the influence is slight when the treatment temperature is above 95 degrees C. With the increasing of the amount of <b>carboxyls,</b> the dispersion of the corresponding Pd-Pt metal particles supported on CNTs is increased and the catalytic activity is promoted in the profile reaction of naphthalene hydrogenation to tetralin.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} amino acid residues adjacent to the catalytic site of pepsin-like enzymes, we analyzed and compared the crystal structures of these enzymes, their complexes with inhibitors, and zymogens in the active site area (a total of 82 structures). In addition to the water molecule (W 1) located between the active <b>carboxyls</b> and playing a role of the nucleophile during catalytic reaction, another water molecule (W 2) at {{the vicinity of the}} active groups was found to be completely conserved. This water molecule plays an essential role in formation of a chain of hydrogen-bonded residues between the active site flap and the active <b>carboxyls</b> on ligand binding. These data suggest a new approach to understanding the role of residues around the catalytic site, which can assist the development of the catalytic reaction. The influence of groups adjacent to the active <b>carboxyls</b> is manifested by pepsin activity at pH 1. 0.

These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain <b>carboxyl</b> of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInternal proton {{displacements}} {{in several}} membrane photosynthetic enzymes are analyzed {{in relation to}} general mechanisms of enzymatic catalysis. In the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) and in bacteriorhodopsin (BR), carboxy residues (Glu- 212 in the RC L-subunit and Asp- 96 in BR) serve as indispensable intrinsic proton donors. Both <b>carboxyls</b> are protonated prior to the proton-donation step, because their pK values are shifted to ≥ 12. 0 by the interaction with the protein and/or substrate. In both cases, the proton transfer reactions are preceded by conformational changes that, supposedly, let water interact with the <b>carboxyls.</b> These changes switch over the pK values of the <b>carboxyls</b> to ≤ 6. 0 and 7. 1 in the RC and BR, respectively. The sharp increase in the proton-donating ability of the <b>carboxyls</b> drives the reaction cycles. This kind of catalytic mechanism, where a strong general acid or base emerges, when needed, {{as a result of}} a conformational change can be denoted as a conformationally controlled pK-switching. Generally, the ability of enzymes to go between isoenergetic conformations that differ widely in the reactivity of the catalytic group(s) may be of crucial importance to the understanding of enzymatic catalysis. Particularly, the pK-switching concept could help to reconcile the contradictory views on the functional protonation state of the redox-active tyrosine YZ in the oxygen-evolving photosystem II. It is conceivable that YZ switches its pK from ∼ 4. 5 to ≥ 10. 0 upon the last, rate-limiting step of water oxidation. By turning into a strong base, tyrosine assists then in abstracting a proton from the bound substrate water and helps to drive the dioxygen formation...|$|R

Using GCMC simulations of adsorption on realistic VPC models differing in porosity and containing the most frequently occurring carbon surface functionalities (<b>carboxyls,</b> hydroxyls and carbonyls) and their mixtures, it is concluded that the maximum adsorption calculated from the DA model is not strongly affected by the presence of oxygen groups. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the remaining two parameters of this model i. e. the heterogeneity parameter (n) and the characteristic energy of adsorption (E 0).

The {{results show that the}} bulk structure and the texture of the CNTs were unchanged, but phenolic hydroxyls and <b>carboxyls</b> appeared on the surface. The total concentration of these groups increases with the microwave power to 100 W, then decreases. The phenolic hydroxyls and <b>carboxyls</b> on the CNTs interact with Ru ions during the preparation of Ru/CNTs resulting in highly dispersed Ru particles.

40|$|Understanding {{the thermal}} {{reduction}} of graphene oxide (GO) {{is important for}} graphene exfoliation, and chemical and morphological modifications. In this process, the role of trapped water {{and the evolution of}} oxygen during annealing are still not well-understood. To unravel the complex mechanisms leading to the removal of oxygen in reduced GO, we have performed in situ transmission infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements of GO films upon thermal annealing at 60 - 850 degrees C in vacuum (10 (- 3) - 10 (- 4) Torr). Using cluster-based first-principles calculations, epoxides, ethers (pyrans and furans), hydroxyls, <b>carboxyls,</b> lactols, and various types of ketones and their possible derivatives have been identified from the spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the interactions between randomly arranged nearby oxygen species are found to affect the spectral response (red and blue shifts) and the overall chemistry during annealing. For instance, the initial composition of oxygen species (relative amounts and types of species, such as hydroxyls, <b>carboxyls,</b> and carbonyls) and reduction times determine the final oxygen concentration (% of initial concentrations), varying from similar to 46 - 92 % in multilayer GO to similar to 3 - 5 % in single-layer GO. In the multilayer case, there is no dependence on the layer thickness. An important indicator of the reduction efficiency is the relative concentration of carbonyls at intermediate annealing temperatures (similar to 200 degrees C). These observations suggest that thermal annealing can foster the formation of free radicals containing oxygen in the presence of trapped water in GO, which further attack <b>carboxyls,</b> hydroxyls, and carbonyls, preferentially at edges rather than on basal plane defects. These findings impact the fabrication of electronics and energy storage devices. close 14814614...|$|R

5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and <b>carboxyl</b> (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the <b>carboxyl</b> end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E

The pulp oxidized by the US-TEMPO-system had higher <b>carboxyls</b> content and ca. 10 % increase in nanocellulose yield when compared to the TEMPO-system without sono catalysis. In the second option ultrasound pretreated pulp was oxidized using the TEMPO-system. Although there was no gain in <b>carboxyls</b> content in this process versus the oxidation with TEMPO-system without ultrasound treatment, a higher degree of fibrillation was obtained after ultrasound treatment. In the third case the TEMPO oxidized pulp was subjected to mechanical and ultrasound treatments for nanocellulose production. Under similar treatment time the subsequent ultrasound treatment achieved higher nanocellulose yield than the subsequent mechanical treatment.

5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the <b>carboxyl</b> {{groups of}} glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues.

Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface.

5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to <b>carboxyl</b> terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E

The polysaccharide/protein ratios {{of these two}} pairs of conjugates were similar. The two synthetic schemes bound the linker to the <b>carboxyls</b> of the type 8 CP by carbodiimide-mediated condensation. ADH was bound to the <b>carboxyls</b> of the protein, whereas SPDP reacted with the amino groups of the protein. Intermolecular linking of the carrier protein, caused by the carbodiimide during the conjugation reaction with the type 8 CP derivative, probably accounts for the larger size of the conjugates formed with ADH compared with those formed with SPDP. Both conjugates synthesized with ADH elicited higher levels of CP antibodies, especially after the first immunization, than did those prepared with SPDP. Similar levels of exoprotein A antibodies were elicited by both conjugates.
