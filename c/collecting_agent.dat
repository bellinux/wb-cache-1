40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that greater hierarchical distance between a subordinate and his boss {{makes it more}} difficult to share abstract and subjective information in decision making. A novel dataset put together from credit dossiers of large corporate loan applicants enables us to observe the information collected by loan officers, and how it is used by the ultimate loan approving officer. We find that greater hierarchical/geographical distance between the information <b>collecting</b> <b>agent</b> and the loan approving officer leads to less reliance on subjective information and more on objective information. By exploiting nonlinearities in the "assignment rules" that determine an applicant's hierarchical distance, and using information <b>collecting</b> <b>agent</b> fixed effects, we show that our result cannot be driven by endogenous assignment of applicants. We also find that higher frequency of interactions between the information <b>collecting</b> <b>agent</b> and loan approving officer, both over time and through geographical proximity, helps mitigate the effects of hierarchical distance on information use. Our results show that hierarchical distance influences information use, and highlights the importance of "human touch" in communication. The Author 2009.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{distributed}} {{medium access control}} scheme called opportunistic ALOHA for reachback in sensor networks with mobile agents. Each sensor transmits its information with a probability that {{is a function of}} its channel state (propagation channel gain). This function called transmission control is then designed under the assumption that orthogonal CDMA is employed to transmit information. The gains achieved in the throughput by use of transmission control are analyzed and evaluated numerically. The variation of the average number of transmitting users with distance from the <b>collecting</b> <b>agent</b> is analyzed. The proposed reachback protocol {{can be used in a}} variety of sensor network applications. We end by giving two examples of how the reachback protocol can be used by the sensor network to transmit information reliably to the <b>collecting</b> <b>agent.</b> The maximum rate at which the information can be reliably transmitted with the proposed schemes is evaluated as a function of the performance parameters of the reachback protocol...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is a {{recognized}} lack of Agent Oriented Methodologies to translate a detailed design to a software implementation; here we {{address this problem}} with a solution approach. Tropos {{is one of the}} most used methodologies to design agent systems and we use it to show a design for the Food <b>Collecting</b> <b>Agent</b> Problem. Our solution includes autonomous behaviour, beliefs, multiple roles playing, communication and cooperation in a simple way. We propose a method to generate a Prolog implementation from a Tropos detailed design, adding a step allowing relevant decisions being incorporated at design time. Besides we show how to get the Prolog implementation from this detailed design. Our experience shows that this proposal is an intuitive, direct and effective way to get a Prolog implementation for an agent system. We end the paper with illustrations about our collecting team in action. ...|$|E

40|$|Coal, in India and Worldwide, is cleaned {{predominantly}} by {{dense medium}} separations and jigging. But {{when it comes}} to cleaning of fine coals such as mine dust, slack coal, washing rejects and slurries, froth flotation method of coal cleaning has better efficiency and handling. In this method of wet cleaning, froth is made in a flotation cell by bubbling air through water in presence of frothing agents; on addition, pure and light coal adhere to air bubble while the dirtier part sinks to bottom of the cell. Thus clean coal is recovered from the collected froth amount. Density and wettability can be termed as the two bases of separation which are the inherent properties of the coal. In this current project froth flotation was being carried in a fixed froth flotation cell used in the laboratory. Runs of froth flotation have been carried out using the same stock of coal but varying the size of coal fines, concentration of coal slurries and different doses of <b>collecting</b> <b>agents</b> and of their mixtures. In order to quantitatively measure the effect, ash rejection, combustible recovery and efficiency were calculated.

40|$|This {{study is}} about an {{algorithmic}} dependence of Artificial Neural Network on Multilayer Perceptron (MPL) pertaining to the classification and clustering presentations for Mobile Adhoc Network vulnerabilities. Moreover, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is ubiquitous intelligent internetworking devices {{in which it has}} the ability to detect their environment using an autonomous system of mobile nodes that are connected via wireless links. Security affairs are the most important subject in MANET due to the easy penetrative scenarios occurred in such an auto configuration network. One of the powerful techniques used for inspecting the network packets is Intrusion Detection System (IDS); in this article, we are going to show the effectiveness of artificial neural networks used as a machine learning along with stochastic approach (information gain) to classify the malicious behaviors in simulated network with respect to different IDS techniques. The monitoring agent is responsible for detection inference engine, the audit data is collected from <b>collecting</b> <b>agent</b> by simulating the node attack and contrasted outputs with normal behaviors of the framework, whenever. In the event that there is any deviation from the ordinary behaviors then the monitoring agent is considered this event as an attack, in this article we are going to demonstrate the signature-based IDS approach in a MANET by implementing the back propagation algorithm over ensemble-based Traffic Table (TT), thus the signature of malicious behaviors or undesirable activities are often significantly prognosticated and efficiently figured out, by increasing the parametric set-up of Back propagation algorithm during the experimental results which empirically shown its effectiveness for the ratio of detection index up to 98. 6 percentage. Consequently it is proved in empirical results in this article, the performance matrices are also being included in this article with Xgraph screen show by different through puts like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Through Put(TP), and Average Delay(AD) ...|$|E

First, it is often hard to ascertain how much effort agents have put in acquiring information. Second, when agents have an interest in the policy outcome, they may manipulate information.

Eliminating manipulation of information, however, requires that the preferences of the policy maker and the adviser be aligned. Therefore, policy makers appoint advisers with preferences that are less extreme than their own. Copyright 2005 Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
