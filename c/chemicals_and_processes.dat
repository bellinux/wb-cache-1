40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{capabilities}} of zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films in sensing and actuating were investigated using micromachined micro-cantilevers. A heterogeneous piezoelectric cantilever was modeled to study its response under voltage and/or external mechanical loading. A ZnO thin-film micro-cantilever was designed {{based on the}} developed theoretical model. Simulated tip deflections of the micro-cantilever were on the nanometer level under typical electrical and mechanical input. A prototype was fabricated with microfabrication techniques. The ZnO thin film was sputtered at room temperature and demonstrated good compatibility with common <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> in micromachining. The fabricated micro-cantilever was experimentally characterized for its actuating and sensing performance. For actuator characterization tip deflection of the micro-cantilever was detected by a laser Doppler vibrometer, while for sensor characterization the micro-cantilever was calibrated as an acceleration sensor using a reference accelerometer. The experimental resonant frequency, actuating and sensing sensitivities agreed well the design specifications...|$|E

40|$|Acetic acid {{bacteria}} (AAB) have a {{long history}} of use in several fermentation processes. Their exploitation gradually emerged in biotechnologic applications, especially in the biosynthesis of useful <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> for the manufacture of several fermented food products. Taxonomic studies, from traditional to polyphasic approaches, have gradually allowed the proper classification of several ABB into distinct genera and species, among them, the bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) producers, notably Komagataeibacter xylinus. Despite the advantages in using specific (isolated) strains for biotechnologic processes toward controlling the kinetics and process yield, mixed culture fermentations may provide an interesting approach to tailoring the properties of BNC and to increase the product yield when aiming at industrial scale. Microbial population dynamics may play a synergistic role in the coordinative substrate consumption and metabolites production, especially if using complex media (as is the case with low cost substrates, eg, residues from other processes). This chapter will first review the main historic steps involved in the taxonomic classification of AAB.

40|$|As Florida’s {{population}} {{continues to}} grow and urbanization increases, traditional freshwater sources {{are in danger of}} being exhausted. Wastewater reuse programs offer a way to create a potable offset in order to protect these freshwater sources and the environments in which they are found. Reuse regulations for the disinfection of wastewater are increasingly becoming more stringent. In addition to tough regulations, operating costs have also become a driving force behind a movement to assess new and potentially economical <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> for disinfection. The objective of this thesis is to assess the disinfection performance of peracetic acid (PAA), an alternative chemical {{that can be used for}} the disinfection of wastewater in reuse programs. A pilot study was conducted at the Miller St. Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located near Orange Park, Florida. The pilot study consisted of three phases that were designed to determine the dosage of PAA required to meet Florida’s reuse regulations for treatment plants that provide high-level disinfection, quantify disinfection by-product (DBP) formation and aquatic toxicity, and investigate the effectiveness of utilizing multiple chemical injection points in series with smaller doses of acid. The results showed that the disinfection performance of PAA were comparable with the chlorination system currently in use at the plant when the proper dosage was used. In addition to its disinfection performance, the study showed that disinfection with PAA did not produce harmful amounts of DBP that are normally associated with chlorine-based disinfection...|$|E
40|$|Since United States of America federal {{legislation}} has required ozone depleting chemicals (class 1 & 2) to {{be banned from}} production, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and industry have been required to find other chemicals and methods to replace these target chemicals. This project was initiated as a development of a prioritization methodology suitable for assessing and ranking existing processes for replacement 'urgency. ' The methodology was produced {{in the form of}} a workbook (NASA Technical Paper 3421). The final workbook contains two tools, one for evaluation and one for prioritization. The two tools are interconnected in that they were developed from one central theme - chemical replacement due to imposed laws and regulations. This workbook provides matrices, detailed explanations of how to use them, and a detailed methodology for prioritization of replacement technology. The main objective is to provide a GUIDELINE to help direct the research for replacement technology. The approach for prioritization called for a system which would result in a numerical rating for the <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> being assessed. A Quality Function Deployment (QFD) technique was used in order to determine numerical values which would correspond to the concerns raised and their respective importance to the process. This workbook defines the approach and the application of the QFD matrix. This technique: (1) provides a standard database for technology that can be easily reviewed, and (2) provides a standard format for information when requesting resources for further research for chemical replacement technology. Originally, this workbook was to be used for Class 1 and Class 2 chemicals, but it was specifically designed to be flexible enough to be used for any chemical used in a process (if the chemical and/or process needs to be replaced). The methodology consists of comparison matrices (and the smaller comparison components) which allow replacement technology to be quantitatively compared in several categories, and a QFD matrix which allows process/chemical pairs to be rated against one another for importance (using consistent categories). Depending on the need for application, one can choose the part(s) needed or have the methodology completed in its entirety. For example, if a program needs to show the risk of changing a process/chemical one may choose to use part of Matrix A and Matrix C. If a chemical is being used, and the process must be changed; one might use the Process Concerns part of Matrix D for the existing process and all possible replacement processes. If an overall analysis of a program is needed, one may request the QFD to be completed...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{is part of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{within the}} Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). NIOSH, the federal agency {{responsible}} for research and prevention of workplace hazards, is headquartered in Washington, D. C., and has facilities in Anchorage, Alaska; Atlanta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; Morgantown, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Spokane, Washington. Currently, there are 127 million individuals, 16 years of age or older, in the United States workforce. The workforce is aging, becoming more ethnically and racially diverse, and includes more women. Safety and health hazards experienced by workers have implications for their personal lives, their productivity, and the productivity of the nation as a whole. According to a NIOSH-funded study published in 1997, work-related injuries cost the nation more than $ 145 billion and work-related diseases cost an additional $ 26 billion, making the total financial burden a staggering $ 171 billion (1992). While occupational health research has improved worker protection against many hazards and diseases, much remains to be done. Workers are still at risk for noise induced hearing loss and exposed to lead and silica, two long-recognized occupational hazards that cause chronic lung disease. As the workplace and workforce change, new hazards emerge. Violence is now a threat in the workplace, latex allergies are increasing among health care workers, new <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> place workers in danger, and the long-term effects of many exposures remain unknown. NIOSH continues to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses by conducting research, publishing recommendations for preventing work-related injuries and illnesses, and training professionals in occupational safety and health. An unhealthy working environment affects workers' health and productivity, and may even render them unable to work. The consequences of occupational safety and health hazards are reflected in the following statistics: In 1996 on a typical day in the United States, 16 workers died from injuries. Each day, an average of 137 workers died from work-related diseases. According to the National Safety Council, the costs for occupationally-related injuries exceeded $ 121 billion in 1996. NIOSH is committed to making the workplace a safer environment for all people. NIOSH is constantly faced with new challenges as the workforce grows older and changes in demographic composition, as individuals work longer hours, and as issues facing workers evolve. NIOSH has been conducting health research and making recommendations for preventing occupational illness and injury since its inception in 1970. The Occupational Safety and Health Act created both NIOSH and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), giving each unique responsibilities and placing them in different governmental departments. While NIOSH is charged with conducting research and implementing prevention activities, OSHA is required to promulgate regulations and enforce health and safety standards in the workplace and {{is part of the}} Department of Labor. FY 1997 marked completion of the transfer of the health and safety research programs from the former U. S. Bureau of Mines to NIOSH. In FY 1997, NIOSH's total operating budget was $ 173 million and NIOSH staff numbered 1, 364. As required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), NIOSH developed four Institute-wide strategic goals in FY 1997. The complete version of the NIOSH Strategic Plan is available on the NIOSH Home Page at [URL] These goals complement the goals set out by both DHHS and CDC. The four NIOSH goals [...] targeting of research, surveillance, prevention, and information dissemination and training [...] represent the broad spectrum of NIOSH's work. It is the interplay of these goals that has and will make the vision of this Institute [...] safer and healthier workplaces [...] a reality. To best describe NIOSH's accomplishments during FY 1997, this Report of Activities has been organized around the Institute's four strategic goals. This Report highlights the work of the Institute during FY 1997 and it is not an exhaustive account of Institute-wide activity. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "March 1999. ...|$|E
