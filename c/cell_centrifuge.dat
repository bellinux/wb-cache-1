40|$|Cell {{staining}} is {{a necessary}} and useful technique for visualizing cell morphology and structure under a microscope. This technique {{has been used in}} many areas such as cytology, hematology, oncology, histology, virology, serology, microbiology, cell biology, and immunochemistry. One of the key pieces of equipment for preparing a slide for cell staining is cytology centrifuge (cytocentrifuge) such as cytospin. However, many small labs do not have this expensive equipment and its accessory, cytoclips (also expensive relatively), which makes them difficult to study cell cytology. Here we present an alternative method for preparing a slide and cell staining {{in the absence of a}} cytocentrifuge (and cytoclips). This method is based on the principle that a regular <b>cell</b> <b>centrifuge</b> can be used to concentrate cells harvested from cell culture and then deposit the concentrated cell suspension to a slide evenly by using a cell spreader, followed by cell staining. The method presented is simple, rapid, economic, and efficient. This method may also avoid a possible change in cell morphology induced by cytocentrifuge...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{successfully}} delivered FITC and FITC-Dextran (70, 250 kDa) into canola protoplasts by <b>centrifuging</b> <b>cells</b> with different amounts of microbubbles at variable centrifuge speed. The efficiency is around 90 %, while cell viability remains high. Confocal microscopy images show that both FITC and FITC-Dextran are scattered inside the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. Pores are observed on canola protoplast cell membranes and <b>cell</b> walls when <b>centrifuged</b> with microbubbles, while the membrane of <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> alone remain intact and smooth. We hypothesize that the collision between the microbubbles and cells or the bursting of microbubbles {{are the main}} reasons for the formation of these pores. Biomaterials can diffuse into the cells once the pathway is created...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} the effects of enucleation and of inhibitors of mRNA synthesis (actinomycin D and cordycepin) on protein turnover of HeLa cells. Enucleation markedly inhibited the rate of protein degradation for short-lived proteins. However, <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> in the absence of cytochalasin B at the speed required to obtain cytoplasts showed protein degradation rates identical to those of cytoplasts, while inhibitors of mRNA synthesis did not affect the process. Although enucleation may affect degradation of specific proteins, these results suggest that centrifugation is largely responsible for the inhibition of protein degradation in cytoplasts...|$|R

30|$|The total biofilm biomass was {{determined}} for 5 slides {{that had been}} coated with E. coli biofilms and matured for 7  days. The glass slides were washed twice in phosphate buffer. In a pre-weighed centrifuge tube kept at 100 °C overnight, the biofilm was disrupted in sterile water using a vortex mixer for 30  minutes; the glass slide was removed and the <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> at 1851  g for 10  minutes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{centrifugal}} {{forces on the}} growth rate, longevity, and adsorption on glass of human embryonic diploid lung fibroblasts was studied. <b>Cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> at 120, 500, or 1, 500 × g at each passage had similar growth rates but their longevity decreased slightly with increasing force. These forces had no influence on the proportion of cells attaching to the glass. When the material in the first supernatant was recentrifuged at 2, 000 × g for 30 min and added to the cells precipitated in the first centrifugation, the longevity of these cells was increased by several cell divisions. Cells which were not centrifuged but added directly from the cell suspension in trypsin to the new culture grew at a slightly slower rate than the <b>centrifuged</b> <b>cells</b> and became senescent at an earlier time.

Cells cultured in gradient material (70 % Percoll) exhibited the same average density. At the various growth rates examined, {{the density of the}} individual cells in a steady-state population varied by less than 1 % of the mean in E. coli strains B/r and B, as well as K- 12.

40|$|Several {{reports have}} {{appeared}} in the literature of the variation of "density" among different types of dispersed cells and of physical separations based upon this property. (1, 2) Two general separation procedures have been used. Packed cell methods: <b>cells</b> are <b>centrifuged</b> from a suspension to form a viscous mass of packed cells, which is separated layerwise. Neutral density separations: <b>cells</b> are <b>centrifuged</b> in a dense liquid medium and are segregated into two fractions, one denser and one lighter than the suspending medium. With such methods the order of density of certain types of blood cells has been established.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} altered gravitational environments on T cell activation. We isolated human, naive T cells (CD 3 +CD 14 -CD 19 -CD 16 -CD 56 -CD 25 -CD 69 -CD 45 RA-) following IRB approved protocols. These purified T cells were then incubated with 6 mm polystyrene beads coated with OKT 3 (Ortho Biotech, Raritan, NJ) and antiCD 28 (Becton Dickinson (BD), San Jose, CA) at 37 C for 24 hours. Antibodies were at a 1 : 1 ratio and the bead-to-cell ratio was 2 : 1. Four incubation conditions existed: 1) static or " 1 g"; 2) centrifugation at 10 relative centrifugal force (RCF) or " 10 g"; 3) clinorotation at 25 RPM (functional weightlessness or " 0 g"); and 4) clinorotation at 80 RPM (" 1 g" plus net shear force approx. 30 dynes/sq cm). Following incubation, T cells were stained for CD 25 expression (BD) and intracellular calcium (ratio of Fluo 4 to Fura Red, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter EPICS XL, Miami, FL). Results: Static or " 1 g" T cells had {{the highest level of}} CD 25 expression and intracellular calcium. T <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> at 10 RCF (" 10 g") had lower CD 25 expression and calcium levels compared to the static control. However, <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> at 10 RCF had higher CD 25 expression and calcium levels than those exposed to 24 RPM clinorotation (" 0 g"). T cells exposed to 24 RPM clinorotation had lower CD 25 expression, but the approximately the same calcium levels than T cells exposed to 80 RPM clinorotation. These data suggest that stress-activated calcium channel exist in T cells and may play a role during T cell activation...|$|R

40|$|Flocculent Zymomonas mobilis {{breaks down}} in smaller flocs and {{individual}} <b>cells</b> when <b>centrifuged.</b> The main consequence {{of it is}} an increase in the dispersion of the sample, suggesting that the influence of the centrifugal force on the aggregation of cells is worth to study. The experiments showed that the degree of dispersion varied between 30 % and 100 % when the centrifugal acceleration changed from 25 g to 2500 g. Observation under the electronic microscope showed that a slimy material covered the cells recovered by gentle gravitational settling and, that the <b>centrifuged</b> <b>cells</b> presented a bare cell wall.

40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that Arthrobacter pyridinolis can {{transport}} and utilize d-glucose only after prior growth on certain Krebs cycle intermediates. In contrast, we found that d-fructose was taken up and metabolized by A. pyridinolis without special prior conditions of growth. d-Fructose was first converted to d-fructose- 1 -phosphate by a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) :D-fructose phosphotransferase. This activity required both supernatant and pellet fractions from d-fructose-grown <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> at 150, 000 × g. The d-fructose- 1 -phosphate formed was converted to d-fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate. Mutants deficient in PEP:d-fructose phosphotransferase and d-fructose- 1 -phosphate kinase, or d-fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphatase (FDPase) were unable to grow on d-fructose but retained the normal ability to use d-glucose. Mutants forming reduced amounts of FDPase were completely unable to grow on d-fructose but were still capable of limited growth on Krebs cycle intermediates. A requirement for higher levels of FDPase for growth on d-fructose than for growth on Krebs cycle intermediates was also indicated by the higher specific activities of FDPase in d-fructose-grown cells than in cells grown on l-malate or amino acids...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of cultured autologous keratinocytes with the dermal regeneration template Integra™ could offer increased possibilities for reconstructive surgery and wound healing. A single-step application of <b>cells,</b> <b>centrifuged</b> deep into an Integra™-like matrix at the silicone–matrix junction, {{has been described}} but might prove technically complex for clinical use. We have investigated the possibility of simplifying this procedure by applying cultured cells directly to {{the underside of the}} Integra™ or directly to the wound bed immediately prior to grafting. The objective was to see whether cells would migrate through the matrix in an upward direction. We tested the principle of this concept using a pig wound healing model. Integra™ was seeded directly with cultured cells and grafted onto fresh full-thickness wounds, or unseeded Integra™ was applied to freshly excised wound beds that had just been seeded with the same number of cells. Biopsies were taken at 3, 7, 11, and 14 days. Histological sections showed that the cells moved through the Integra™ to give a confluent surface epithelium. Direct seeding onto the Integra™ was the most efficient method. Transduction of cultured autologous keratinocytes in vitro with a MFGlacZnls retrovirus confirmed that the epidermis was derived from the cultured autologous keratinocytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of metabolic intermediates {{is a rich}} source of isotopic information for C- 13 metabolic flux analysis (C- 13 -MFA) and extends the range of its applications. The sampling of labeled metabolic intermediates is particularly important to obtain reliable isotopic information. The assessment of the different sampling procedures commonly used to generate such data, therefore, is crucial. In this work, we thoroughly evaluated several sampling procedures for stationary and non-stationary C- 13 -MFA using Escherichia coli. We first analyzed the efficiency of these procedures for quenching metabolism and found that procedures based on cold or boiling solvents are reliable, in contrast to fast filtration, which is not. We also showed that separating the cells from the broth is not necessary in isotopic stationary state conditions. On the other hand, we demonstrated that the presence of metabolic intermediates outside the cells strongly affects the transient isotopic data monitored during non-stationary C- 13 -labeling experiments. Meaningful isotopic data can be obtained by recovering intracellular labeled metabolites from pellets of <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> in cold solvent. We showed that if the intracellular pools are not separated from the extracellular ones, accurate flux maps can be established provided that the contribution of exogenous compounds is taken into account in the metabolic flux model...|$|R

50|$|Cytogenetics, {{the study}} of {{chromosomal}} material by analysis of G-Banded chromosomes, uses mitotic inhibitors extensively.

40|$|Fluorescence of the {{conjugated}} polyene fatty acid, {{parinaric acid}} (PnA), was studied in membranes of Escherichia coli during deenergization by colicin K. The {{free fatty acid}} and biosynthetically esterified forms of cis-PnA (9, 11, 13, 15 -cis,trans,trans,cis-octadecatetraenoic acid), {{both of which are}} sensitive to E. coli lipid-phase transitions, were compared. When free cis-PnA was added exogenously to respiring bacteria, dissipation of the energized state of the membrane resulted in a dramatic increase in cis-PnA fluorescence; all-trans-PnA was much less sensitive. Neither spectral shifts nor a change in cis-PnA fluorescence polarization were observed. Analysis of the PnA content of extracellular fractions of deenergized and control cells revealed a difference in probe distribution: the membranes of energy-poisoned E. coli bound about 77 % of exogenously added cis-PnA, whereas membranes of actively respiring controls bound only about 44 %. No fluorescence enhancement was observed in <b>cells</b> <b>centrifuged</b> to remove unbound cis-PnA before colicin treatment. When cis-PnA was biosynthetically esterified to phospholipids of an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of E. coli, the fluorescence did not change during membrane deenergization. In double-probe experiments, membrane deenergization resulted in fluorescence enhancement of exogenously added N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine, without change in esterified PnA fluorescence. We conclude that deenergization of E. coli membranes leads to increased binding and fluorescence of exogenously added PnA and cannot be detected from within the inner and outer membranes by PnA esterified in vivo...|$|R
