30|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have been}} under intense investigations {{during the past two}} decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties; however, there is still no commonly accepted growth mechanism to describe the growth behavior of CNTs. Here, we propose a nano Czochralski (CZ) model which regards the <b>catalytic</b> <b>growth</b> of a CNT as a CZ process taking place on the nano scale. The main idea is that, during the CNT growth, each catalyst particle acts as a nano crucible to nucleate and maintain the CNT growth, and the extruding CNT rotates relative to the nano crucible, leading to a chirality-dependent growth rate. In this case, the structural quality gradually changes along the CNT due to the dynamic generation-reconstruction-diffusion of defects during the CNT growth. The nano CZ mechanism may also apply to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>growth</b> of many other one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures (including various nanotubes and nanowires), thus further efforts will be stimulated in the quality and property control, as well as application explorations of these 1 D nanomaterials.|$|E

Within the nano-CZ mechanism, the catalyst particle acts as a nano crucible to nucleate and maintain the CNT growth, a chiral CNT grows in a screw extrusion manner.

It {{should be noted that}} there may be certain limitations to the nano-CZ mechanism, and the details of the CNT screw extrusion and the defect dynamics need further in-depth investigations. The proposed nano-CZ mechanism may also apply to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>growth</b> of many other 1 D nanostructures; the recent growths of ZnO nanotubes and nanowires have shown similar behaviors [46].

The resulting N-MLG exhibited higher catalytic activity than undoped graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as well as comparable catalytic activity to commercial Pt/C catalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, the catalytic activity was sensitive to N content and type, particularly the ratio of pyridinic-N to total N atoms.

Two typical approaches for the assembly are extensively used. One is the hydrothermal approach wherein graphene oxide powder and other precursors are mixed with water or organic solvents and then undergo a hydrothermal process [1 – 5, 7]. The other approach is the mixing of reduced graphene oxide with the other materials followed by post-thermal reduction [6, 8, 9]. In addition, the assembly of functional materials on continuous graphene films synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been attracting attention gradually, owing to the high quality of graphene films. For example, a thin amorphous aluminum oxide layer was deposited on a graphene film through atomic layer deposition to selectively decorate and passivate the edges of graphene nanoribbons [10]. ZnO was also deposited on CVD graphene, and the composite could be applied to a solar cell to replace ITO [11].
