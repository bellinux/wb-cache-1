50|$|The {{connecting}} rods are of forged aluminum and do provide some shock damping, {{which is why}} aluminum is used in place of titanium, because titanium {{connecting rods}} transmit {{too much of the}} combustion impulse to the big-end rod bearings, endangering the bearings and thus the crankshaft and block. Each <b>con</b> <b>rod</b> has two bolts, shell bearings for the big end while the pin runs directly in the rod.|$|E
50|$|By 1983, {{most of the}} original-cabbed DG {{class had}} been withdrawn, while the re-cabbed {{locomotives}} continued in service until they either suffered a mechanical failure, required major repairs or were withdrawn serviceable and placed in storage. On 28 August 1983, NZR operated a 'Farewell to the DG Class' excursion between Christchurch and Arthur's Pass on the Midland line. Hauled by recabbed DG 2007 and 'slave' unit DG 2468, {{the first and last}} DG class locomotives respectively, the excursion marked the end of the original DG class in regular service. The following month, DG 2007 failed when it threw a <b>con</b> <b>rod</b> through the engine block and was placed in storage, while DG 2468 was sold to the fledgling Weka Pass Railway shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Errors in {{construction}} {{resulted in a}} set of rebuilt sails that rotated clockwise. In 2009 the sails have been rebuilt so that they now correctly rotate anti-clockwise. A pump was acquired and in July 2009 it was refitted. Installation of the pump and connection to the <b>con</b> <b>rods</b> take place in August and September 2009, which now allows the Glynde Wind Pump to raise water again {{for the first time in}} over fifty years.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{these are}} [...] {{inline-four}} engines {{based on the}} Mazda MZR engine developed in cooperation with Mazda. Changes includes a billet crankshaft, barrel throttle bodies, new cylinder head with larger valves, pistons, <b>con</b> <b>rods</b> and camshafts. A detuned [...] version, targeting club racers, is sold to the consumer market. This engine retains the standard crankshaft, and has a different cylinder head. Both engines are built by Cosworth in Torrance, California, {{under the guidance of}} newly appointed technical designer Wayne Merry (formerly of Cosworth in Worcester UK).|$|R
50|$|Only one straight-seven {{engine for}} land {{propulsion}} {{is known to}} be in production, the AGCO Sisu 7-cylinder diesel engine. This engine configuration was chosen because of size, parts commonality, and power range issues. A straight-8 would be too long for the farm machinery application the engine was intended for, whilst a V engine would require a higher investment compared to the expected low sales volume for this power range. The straight-7 configuration is a lower investment because Sisu has reused cylinder heads from their I3 and I4 diesel lineups. This is possible because the cylinder volume, pistons and <b>con</b> <b>rods</b> are identical across the Sisu model range.|$|R
5000|$|The TU2 has a {{displacement}} of 1294 cc, with a bore of 75 mm and {{a stroke of}} 73 mm. Power was initially 95 PS (94 hp/70 kW), powering the Citroën AX Sport, but a slightly more powerful version of the TU24 was developed for the Peugeot 205 Rallye with a straighter intake manifold and slightly larger venturi size in the Weber carburttors. A new version with 100 PS (99 hp/74 kW) was created in 1992 for the Peugeot 106 Rallye, with {{the adoption of a}} Magneti Marelli fuel injection system and a catalytic converter. This version in the 106 Rallye uses a different taller TU3 aluminum block to the TU24 (whose block is based on a TU1), different <b>con</b> <b>rod</b> lengths and pistons to the TU24. The aluminium heads also differ slightly in port size and shape with different camshafts. The valve sizes are very slightly different with the TU24 being 39.3mm Inlet / 31.2mm Exhaust. TU2J2 being 39.5mm Inlet and 31.4mm Exhaust with slightly thinner valve stems to the TU24.|$|E

5000|$|Powertrain {{consists}} of AMG SPEEDSHIFT black series 5-speed automatic transmission mated to an AMG 3.2 liter V6 Kompressor engine with an output of 260 kW/349 hp and [...] @ 4,400 rpm. The engine {{is a special}} version of the 3.2 L (3199 cc) M112 E32, fitted with a helical twin-screw supercharger and water-to-air intercooler. The supercharger was developed in conjunction with IHI and features Teflon-coated rotors producing overall boost of 14.5 psi (1 bar). Compared to the standard M112 engine, the AMG version also has a new crankshaft, new <b>con</b> <b>rods</b> and pistons, an oil pump with a 70-percent increased capacity, lightweight camshafts, and stiffer valve springs for a redline of 6200 rpm, an increase of 200 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|... {* I cannot {{understand}} why 'Holbay' {{would have been}} formed in Sheffield, though I do not dispute whether an engineering company was formed by the brothers there. I knew of Holbay only as THE 1000cc Ford based engine to have in F3 {{towards the end of}} the 60's but after I moved to Suffolk I used Holbay Engineering Ltd to fit and ream new valve guides in a Lotus 912 head in 1987 when they were at 4, Betts Avenue, Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich. I spent time chatting to a long term employee who told me they were originally formed in Hollesley, associated with Hollesley Bay Young Offenders Prison, hence the chosen name Hol'Bay. The prison had various organisations supporting re-training of young offenders, one was for breeding and maintaining the Suffolk Punch breed of horses and Holbay was to provide engineering and workshop training for those of that inclination and I have seen Holbay engine plates showing 'Hollesley, Woodbridge, Suffolk' as the Holbay Co. address. Hand polishing of rockers, <b>con</b> <b>rods,</b> crankshafts and engine assembly was undertaken by these young persons who gained great self esteem from seeing the results of their work.} ...|$|R
50|$|Changes to {{the diesel}} engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, {{in line with}} the updated Defender models. This {{electronically}} managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different <b>con</b> <b>rods,</b> and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK). ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.|$|R

40|$|Variable {{compression}} ratio enables an engine to achieve increased efficiency at part loads, {{where the majority}} of driving occurs, without sacrificing full load power requirements or increasing the risk of engine knock. Although over 100 patents and patent applications exist none of these systems has been commercialized yet due to issues related to feasibility, cost and frictional loss. A new approach of a self controlling variable {{compression ratio}} connecting rod is presented that does not need a friction intensive external activation and that could even be retrofitted. The potential in fuel consumption and exhaust emission reduction as well as increased power and torque output for this concept has been verified in combustion simulations utilizing the latest research results related to the dynamic heat transfer in the combustion chamber from Professor Kleinschmidt from the University of Siegen, Germany. The self controlling variable compression ratio connecting rod allows the <b>con</b> <b>rod</b> to compress at high load conditions thereby increasing cylinder volume to alleviate combustion pressures and temperatures and therefore limit knock onset. The biggest efficiency gains can be achieved at medium load where the reduction of heat loss during the compression of the connecting rod plays a major role additional to the well known efficiency gains of an increased compression ratio. The combustion simulation results shows fuel consumption can be reduced by between 3 % and 5 % during part load and wide open throttle operation at various engine speeds. Emissions are also reduced significantly; particularly NOx and CO emissions were reduced by up to 35 %.

40|$|We use the Cosserat rod {{theory to}} present a uni 5 ed picture of jump phenomena, {{associated}} with looping, snap-through, pop-out, etc., in twisted clamped rods undergoing large de 6 ections. Both contact-free rods and rods with isolated points of self-contact are considered. Taking proper account of the symmetries of the problem we 5 nd that an arbitrary contact-free solution is fully characterised by four parameters; each point contact adds another two. A shooting method is used for solving the boundary value problem. An intricate bifurcation picture emerges with a strong interplay between planar and spatial <b>rod</b> <b>con</b> 5 gurations. We 5 nd new jump phenomena by treating the ratio of torsional to bending sti 8 ness of the rod as a bifurcation parameter.

40|$|A {{knowledge}} of the flow occuring in metal-forming processes is of great industrial importance, and the finite-element technique is the only form of deformation analysis which can predict {{the flow of the}} material. The examination of forging operations requires a full elasticplastic treatment to be used. This thesis is concerned with an elastic-plastic, finite-element program which has been developed to investigate three-dimensional examples of this process. The fundamental theory of the finite-element method is first introduced, and then the finite-element program is described in detail. The deformation, and distributions of hardness and die-interface pressure, predicted by this technique for the unlubricated upsetting of a rectangular block are compared with experimental results, and found to be in broad agreement, the differences being attributed to the incorrect imposition of very high friction by the friction-layer technique used in the analysis. With a corrected form of the friction technique, the finiteelement program predicts results for the axisymmetric friction-ring test and a new three-dimensional friction test which are in good agreement with experimental findings up to deformations of approximately 30 %; the friction-layer technique used successfully in previous axisymmetric treatments appears to be unsuitable for threedimensional formulations when large deformations are considered. The finite-element program developed here is shown to be capable of modelling an example of a more complicated three-dimensional forging, that of an automobile connnecting rod. The experimental measurements of cteformation and hardness for an aluminium <b>con</b> <b>rod</b> forged using graphite lubrication are found to be in good agreement with the finite-element predictions obtained assuming sticking friction conditions but not with the results of a zero-friction idealisation. Finally, suggestions are made for the future development of this technique...|$|E
