40|$|Received 19 December, 2009; Accepted 3 April, 2010) AbstractBackground and purpose: The <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> sutures are {{the most}} common suture {{materials}} in surgical operations. The purpose of this in-vivo study was to evaluate the histopathological inflammatory reaction incited by four different kinds of catgut suture materials. Materials and methods: Twenty five adult New Zealand White rabbits, weighing approximately 2 - 3 kg, were divided into 5 groups of 5 rabbits in each group. Four types of catgut sutures were implanted in the dorsum and thigh muscles. After 2, 7, 14, 21 and 60 days, the animals were sacrificed and the sutures, subcutaneous and muscle tissues were removed from the implanted areas. Results: Statistical analysis for comparison of each two suture materials showed significant differences between groups (p< 0. 05) while ETHICON suture showed minimum inflammatory reaction and was considered the best. Conclusion: Uncontrolled raw materials of the catgut suture from the intestine of particular animals may cause a variety of pathological effects beyond the threshold set for medical surgery.

Fifteen Sahel goats were randomly allocated into three groups A, B and C to quantitatively assay (ELISA) serum cortisol profiles following rumenotomy, as markers of surgical stress. Diazepam at 0. 2 mg/kg was administered intravenously to groups A and B with subsequent lidocaine HCl and bupivacaine inverted-L block respectively. Group C did not receive any treatment. <b>Chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> (CCG) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) sutures were used for rumen and abdominal muscles closure for groups A and B respectively and nylon for skin closure. Blood samples were taken at post anaesthetic induction (PAI) and post-surgery at 0, 5, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h. The Group A goats expressed serum cortisol that was significantly high 52. 76 ± 6. 12 ng/mL at 5 h post-surgery. At 8 h post-surgery serum cortisol for both groups A (72. 53 ± 3. 79 ng/mL) and B (61. 59 ± 3. 90 ng/mL) were at their peak. Serum cortisol levels compared to the baseline data were significantly different (P 0. 05).

The setting is the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria during a period when prosthetic mesh was not readily available. Patients and Methods: All the women who presented with incisional hernia between 1996 and 2005 were prospectively studied using a standard form to obtain information on pre-hernia (index) operations and possible predisposing factors. They all had open surgical repair and were followed up for 18 - 60 months. Results: Forty-four women were treated during study period. The index surgeries leading to the hernias were emergency caesarian section 26 / 44 (59. 1 %), emergency exploratory laparotomy 6 / 44 (13. 6 %), and elective surgeries 12 / 44 (27. 3 %). Major associated risk factors were the use of wrong suture materials for fascia repair, midline incisions, wound sepsis, and overweight.

METHODS: CORONIS was a pragmatic international 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial that examined five elements of the caesarean section technique in intervention pairs. CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Each site was assigned to {{three of the five}} intervention pairs: blunt versus sharp abdominal entry; exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair; single-layer versus double-layer closure of the uterus; closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal); and <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> versus polyglactin- 910 for uterine repair. Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision.

40|$|Animal {{experiments}} were performed with {{evaluation of the}} use of the neodymium-YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser in the trachea, bronchi, and pulmonary parenchyma. Histologic evaluation of incisions into the lung was assessed by multiple sections over a 5 -week period and comparisons were made of incisions closed with chronic catgut or coagulated with electric cautery or by the laser. These studies indicated that the laser is more effective in controlling parenchymal bleeding and air leaks than either the cautery or <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> and produces less local tissue reaction. The Nd-YAG laser has been used clinically to treat patients with inoperable obstructing and bleeding carcinomas of the trachea and main bronchi to open the involved airway and to restore pulmonary function. Fifteen patients have had 26 treatments using the Nd-YAG laser. Total laser time was limited to 15 minutes with 0. 5 -second pulses of 50 to 80 watts being delivered via the fiberoptic and straight bronchoscope as indicated. It is extremely effective in controlling hemoptysis from recurrent endobronchial lesions, and obstructing lesions in the trachea and main stem bronchus can be treated quite successfully with excellent palliation. It is apparent that continued clinical use of the Nd-YAG laser as palliative therapy for bleeding and obstructing tumors of the tracheobronchial tree is indicated and expanded use at the time of thoracotomy to control lung parenchymal bleeding and air leaks should be considered in the future...|$|E

The hemorrhoidal predicle was coagulated with Ligasure™ in the Ligasure™ group and transfied with 2 / 0 <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> in Ferguson’s method. In comparison with Ferguson’s method, Ligasure™ hemorrhoidectomy had a shorter operating time (29 vs 12. 5  min), less blood loss (22 vs 11. 5  ml), less post operative pain as measured on VAS scale and less postoperative complications including hemorrhage (10 % vs 3. 5 %), urinary retention (10 % vs 3. 5 %) and wound breakdown (20 % vs 14 %). The submucosal dissection technique with Ligasure™ coagulation of the hemorrhoidal pedicle is safe and effective. The blood vessels and tissue are reduced to a wafer thin seal with good hemostasis. Suturing is not required as the mucosal tissue over the pedicle is sealed off with the current. There is minimal lateral spread of either thermal or electrical energy.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{granulation}} tissue exposure on regeneration of sensory axons after a test crush lesion in rat sciatic nerves were studied. <b>Chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> threads were applied subcutaneously {{in the back}} of rats. Three weeks later the surrounding granulation tissue was isolated and transposed to the sciatic or tibial nerve in the same rat. Immunocytochemical, light and electron microscopic evaluation of the isolated granulation tissue revealed numerous EDI and ED 2 positive macrophages. After an additional three weeks the sciatic nerves were crushed and the axonal outgrowth lengths were measured by the pinch reflex test and by neurofilament staining 3 or 6 days later. The regeneration distances in the sciatic nerve exposed to granulation tissue were significantly longer compared with that of nerves to which only subcutaneous tissue was transposed. Thus, the nerve had become conditioned by the transposure of macrophage rich tissue. After the transposure macrophages were present close to the nerve at the time point of the test crush lesion, but no signs of degeneration or inflammation in the endoneurial space were observed. It was also found that the outgrowth lengths in the tibial nerve branch were consistently longer than in the peroneal branch of the sciatic nerve. It is concluded that granulation tissue, containing macrophages, can induce a conditioning effect in the sciatic nerve. We suggest that this effect is related to factors emanating from macrophages in the transposed tissue...|$|E

Pregnant women were eligible {{if they were to}} undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision. Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based allocation system to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. In this follow-up study, we compared outcomes at 3 years following blunt versus sharp abdominal entry, exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair, single versus double layer closure of the uterus, closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, and <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> versus polyglactin- 910 for uterine repair. Outcomes included pelvic pain; deep dyspareunia; hysterectomy and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies. Outcomes were assessed masked to the original trial allocation. This trial is registered with the Current Controlled Trials registry, number ISRCTN 31089967. Between Sept 1, 2011, and Sept 30, 2014, 13, 153 (84 %) women were followed-up for a mean duration of 3 · 8 years (SD 0 · 86). For blunt versus sharp abdominal entry {{there was no evidence of}} a difference in risk of abdominal hernias (adjusted RR 0 · 66; 95 % CI 0 · 39 - 1 · 11). We also recorded no evidence of a difference in risk of death or serious morbidity of the children born at the time of trial entry (0 · 99, 0 · 83 - 1 · 17). For exteriorisation of the uterus versus intra-abdominal repair there was no evidence of a difference in risk of infertility (0 · 91, 0 · 71 - 1 · 18) or of ectopic pregnancy (0 · 50, 0 · 15 - 1 · 66). For single versus double layer closure of the uterus there was no evidence of a difference in maternal death (0 · 78, 0 · 46 - 1 · 32) or a composite of pregnancy complications (1 · 20, 0 · 75 - 1 · 90). For closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum there was no evidence of a difference in any outcomes relating to symptoms associated with pelvic adhesions such as infertility (0 · 80, 0 · 61 - 1 · 06). For <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> versus polyglactin- 910 sutures there was no evidence of a difference in the main comparisons for adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy, such as uterine rupture (3 · 05, 0 · 32 - 29 · 29). Overall, severe adverse outcomes were uncommon in these settings. Although our study was not powered to detect modest differences in rare but serious events, there was no evidence to favour one technique over another. Other considerations will probably affect clinical practice, such as the time and cost saving of different approaches.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the tensile strength and suture degradation of 5 commonly used absorbable suture materials in different pH and bacteria inoculated media. Design: In vitro {{study of the}} tensile strength {{as well as the}} effect of pH and bacteria on suture degradation for 5 common absorbable suture materials. Setting: Surgical and Orthopaedics Research Laboratories in Prince of Wales Hospital, New South Wales (Tertiary Hospital/University of New South Wales, Australia). Participants: <b>Chromic</b> <b>catgut,</b> Vicryl, Caprosyn, Bio-Syn, and Maxon were immersed in sterile urine (control), Escherichia coli (E coli) medium, Proteus mirabilis medium (basic medium with pH of 7. 8), and acidic medium with pH 5. 6. The tensile strength and suture stability were analyzed after immersion in these media after 1, 7, 14, and 28 days. Three runs of test were performed using the universal tensile strength analyzer Mini Bionix (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, Minnesota), and statistical tests were performed on these results. Results: A decrease in suture tensile strength was noted in all 5 sutures with the Maxon suture showing the least deterioration followed by the Vicryl suture. A 1 -way analysis of variance test revealed a statistically significant decrease in suture tensile strength over the days of testing, and a post hoc Tukey test confirmed a significant decrease up to day 7 (p < 0. 01). The presence of E coli and higher urine pH lead to greater suture degradation, but these were not statistically significant. Linear regression model univariate analysis showed that time contributed to the most significant decrease in tensile strength followed by the types of suture materials tested. The types of media tested were not a significant predictor of tensile strength by itself. Conclusions: The Maxon suture showed greater suture tensile strength when compared with other sutures. The presence of pH and bacteria caused variable rates of suture degradation, but the result was not significant...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{measure the}} {{concentrations}} of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) and substance P(SP) in blood of rats before and after chronic constriction injury of trigeminal nerve,and to assess their significance in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia. Methods Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups(6 each) : surgical group(group A),sham operation group(group B) and control group(group C). The right infraorbital nerve(ION) of rats in group A was lightly ligated with <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> to induce chronic constriction injury(CCI). In group B,the ION was exposed only with the same procedure but without ligation. And the rats in group C received no operation. The response of rats to mechanical irritation was observed after operation. Blood samples were taken from all the 3 group of rats to measure the concentration of CGRP and SP by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) before operation and 3, 9 and 15 days after operation. Results Compared with group B and group C,allodynia to mechanical stimulation on the area dominated by ION was found from the 9 th to 15 th day after operation in group A. On the 3 rd day after operation,{{the concentrations of}} both CGRP and SP in the blood samples of group A,B and C showed no significant difference when {{compared with that of}} before operation(P > 0. 05),and on the 9 th and 15 th day after operation,concentrations of them increased in group A(P < 0. 05,P < 0. 01),while there was still no obvious change in group B and C when compared with that of before operation. Compared with group B and C,their concentrations in group A increased on 9 th and 15 th day after operation(P < 0. 05). Conclusions CCI-ION can result in trigeminal neuralgia in rats. The expression of CGRP and SP will increase when trigeminal neuralgia occurred. CGRP and SP {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Caesarean {{section is}} one of the most {{commonly}} performed operations on women throughout the world. Rates have increased in recent years – about 20 – 25 % in many developed countries. Rates in other parts of the world vary widely. A variety of surgical techniques for all elements of the caesarean section operation are in use. Many have not yet been rigorously evaluated in randomised controlled trials, and it is not known whether any are associated with better outcomes for women and babies. Because huge numbers of women undergo caesarean section, even small differences in post-operative morbidity rates between techniques could translate into improved health for substantial numbers of women, and significant cost savings. Design CORONIS is a multicentre, fractional, factorial randomised controlled trial and will be conducted in centres in Argentina, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan and Sudan. Women are eligible if they are undergoing their first or second caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision. Five comparisons will be carried out in one trial, using a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 fractional factorial design. This design has rarely been used, but is appropriate for the evaluation of several procedures which will be used together in clinical practice. The interventions are: • Blunt versus sharp abdominal entry • Exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair • Single versus double layer closure of the uterus • Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal) • <b>Chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> versus Polyglactin- 910 for uterine repair The primary outcome is death or maternal infectious morbidity (one or more of the following: antibiotic use for maternal febrile morbidity during postnatal hospital stay, antibiotic use for endometritis, wound infection or peritonitis) or further operative procedures; or blood transfusion. The sample size required is 15, 000 women in total; at least 7, 586 women in each comparison. Discussion Improvements in health from optimising caesarean section techniques are likely to be more significant in developing countries, because the rates of postoperative morbidity in these countries tend to be higher. More women could therefore benefit from improvements in techniques. Trial registration The CORONIS Trial is registered in the Current Controlled Trials registry. ISCRTN 31089967. </p...|$|E
40|$|O tratamento e a morbimortalidade dos pacientes com traumatismo hepático dependem do mecanismo da lesão e da conduta terapêutica, que inclui acompanhamento clínico, hepatorrafia, omentoplastia e próteses. O presente trabalho avaliou a recuperação hepática em presença de omentoplastia após lesão cortante do fígado de cão. Foram utilizados 15 cães machos, mestiços, com peso variando entre 7 kg e 12 kg, anestesiados com pentabarbitúrico endovenoso e submetidos a corte {{longitudinal}} no lobo esquerdo, medindo 2, 5 cm de profundidade e 8 cm de comprimento. Os animais foram divididos em três grupos (n= 5) : I- sem sutura (controle); II- sutura hepática apenas; III- sutura hepática com omentoplastia. O fio utilizado foi o categute cromado 4 - 0. Todos os animais do grupo I morreram no pós-operatório imediato, enquanto os cães dos grupos II e III suportaram bem os 28 dias de acompanhamento. À relaparotomia dos grupos II e III, encontraram-se múltiplas aderências ao fígado, que apresentou aspecto normal. No grupo III, o omento introduzido no ferimento hepático havia sido expulso e estava apenas aderido à cápsula do fígado macroscopicamente normal. À microscopia houve descontinuidade vascular e biliar entre os segmentos proximal e distal à hepatotomia. Os fenômenos cicatriciais foram mais exuberantes no grupo III, no qual se encontraram pequenas áreas do parênquima contendo fragmentos de omento. Concluindo, a omentoplastia facilitou o procedimento de reparo hepático, que, entretanto, não restabeleceu a contigüidade de vasos e ductos biliares. The {{treatment and}} the morbimortality of hepatic trauma {{depend on the}} mechanism of injury and therapeutical approach that includes clinical follow-up, hepatorrhaphy, omentoplasty and prosthesis. The present paper assessed the hepatic recoverance after hepatorraphy and omentoplasty for treatment of liver incision in dog. Fifteen male mongrel dogs weighing between 7 and 12 kg, were used. Under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (10 mg/kg), the animals were submitted to a 2. 5 cm deep and 8 cm long incision of the left liver lobe. The dogs were divided into three groups: 1 - without repair (control); II- only hepatic suture; III- hepatic suture and omentoplasty. The two repairs were performed with 4 - 0 <b>chromic</b> <b>catgut</b> thread. All animals of group I died during the early postoperative period. The dogs of the groups II and III supported the 28 day-follow-up without problem. At the relaparotomy of the groups II and III multiple adhesions to an aparently normal liver were found. In the Group III, the omentum introduced in the hepatic wound was expulsed and remained attached to the liver capsule. At microscopy, it was observed discontinuity of vessels and biliary ducts at the leveI of liver scar; the intensity of inflammatory phenomenon was {{more important in the}} Group III. Little sections of omental tissue were found inside the parenchima. In conclusion the omentoplasty helped the liver suture, but did not prevent the interruption of vessels and bile ducts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsPeripheral neuropathic pain is {{described}} as a pain state caused by an injury or dysfunction of the nervous system, and could have clinical manifestations such as hyperalgesia, allodynia and spontaneous pain. The development of neuropathic pain may depend on long-term forms of neuronal plasticity in the spinal cord (SC). Expression of the immediate early gene proteins (IEGPs) Arc, Zif 268, and c-Fos are implicated in establishment of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by conditioning stimulation (CS) of primary afferent fibres. However, the impact of the neuropathic state (Bennett's model) on CS-induced expression of IEGPs has not been studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the levels of Arc, c-Fos and Zif 268 immunoreactivity prior to and after conditioning stimulation in animals with developed neuropathic pain, with sham operated, non-ligated controls. MethodsTwenty-four animals were divided equally into the neuropathic and non-neuropathic groups. Neuropathic pain was induced in all animals by conducting a loose ligation of the sciatic nerve with <b>Chromic</b> <b>Catgut</b> 4. 0 sutures 7 days prior to conditioning stimulation or sham operation. The loose ligation was performed by placing sutures around the sciatic nerve compressing the nerve slightly just enough to reduce but not completely diminish the perineural circulation. A state of neuropathy was confirmed by a significant decrease in mechanical withdrawal threshold measured by von Frey's fibres. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on transverse sections obtained from the L 3 –L 5 segments of the SC at 2 and 6 h post-CS and IEGP positive cells were counted in lamina I and II of the dorsal horn. During statistical analyses, the groups were compared by means of analysis of variance (univariate general linear model). If significant differences were found, each set of animals was compared with the sham group with post hoc Tukey's multiple comparison test. ResultsStrikingly, all IEGPs exhibited a significant increase in immunoreactivity at both time points compared to time-matched, sham operated controls. Maximal IEGP expression was found 2 h after CS in neuropathic rats, and there was a smaller but still significant increase 6 h after CS. The unstimulated side of the dorsal horn in stimulated animals did not show any significant change of the number of IEGP positive cells and was approximately at the same level as sham operated animals. The number of IEGP positive cells in sham operated controls (non-neuropathic and non-stimulated animals) showed same immunoreactivity in 2 and 6 h post sham operation. Conclusions and implicationsThe neurophysiological process of neuropathic pain development is complex and needs to be studied further in order to clarify its nature and components. This present study is meant to reveal a step towards further understanding the role of Arc, c-Fos and Zif 268 in neuropathic pain. Moreover, this study might contribute to the knowledge base for further research on better therapeutic possibilities for neuropathic pain...|$|E
