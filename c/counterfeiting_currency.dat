40|$|Part 8 : ADVANCED FORENSIC TECHNIQUESInternational audienceCounterfeit {{currency}} {{varies from}} low quality color scanner/printer-based notes to high quality counterfeits whose production {{is sponsored by}} hostile states. Due to their harmful effect on the economy, detecting <b>counterfeit</b> <b>currency</b> notes is a task of national importance. However, automated approaches for <b>counterfeit</b> <b>currency</b> detection are effective only for low quality counterfeits; manual examination is required to detect high quality counterfeits. Furthermore, no automatic method exists for the more complex – and important – problem of identifying the source of counterfeit notes. This paper describes an efficient automatic framework for detecting <b>counterfeit</b> <b>currency</b> notes. Also, it presents a classification framework for linking genuine notes to their source printing presses. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection and classification frameworks have {{a high degree of}} accuracy. Moreover, the approach can be used to link high quality fake Indian currency notes to their unauthorized sources...|$|R
50|$|However, {{there are}} {{questions}} remaining {{about the level of}} government involvement in each of the criminal enterprises. There is little doubt that the North Korean state has been behind <b>counterfeiting</b> <b>currency,</b> human trafficking, the arms trade etc., but the level to which it has been involved in the drug trade {{after the collapse of the}} Public Distribution System in the 1990s is not clear as semi-private and private black markets have arisen since then and some high-ranking officials may only be engaged in illicit trade for personal benefit.|$|E
50|$|The alleged illicit {{activities}} of the North Korean state extend to the manufacture and sale of illegal drugs, the manufacture and sale of counterfeit goods, human trafficking, arms trafficking, <b>counterfeiting</b> <b>currency</b> (especially the United States dollar and Chinese yuan), and other areas. Many of these activities are undertaken at the direction and under the control of, the North Korean government and the ruling Korean Workers' Party, with their proceeds going towards advancing the country's nuclear and conventional arms production, funding the lifestyles of the country's elite, and propping up the national economy.|$|E

It had its major peak between 1920 and 1935 {{and some of its}} most famous practitioners were Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, and Lucio Urtubia. It was different from French illegalism because it was not thought of {{as a way of life}} but as a way of reaching political ends such as financing revolutionary activities, anarchist propaganda and the release of anarchist prisoners.|$|E

With the advent of new technology and {{the improvement of the}} average person's standard of living, triads have progressed to producing counterfeit goods such as watches, film VCDs / DVDs and designer apparel such as clothing and handbags. Since the 1970s, triad turf control was weakened and some triads shifted their revenue streams to underground as well as legitimate businesses.|$|E

Not long after, the Outfit carried out a raid on Baku's naval arsenal, during which several guards were killed. They also kidnapped the children of several wealthy figures in order to extract ransom money. He also co-operated with Himmat, the Muslim Bolshevik group, and was involved in assisting the arming of the Persian Revolution against Shah Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar.
