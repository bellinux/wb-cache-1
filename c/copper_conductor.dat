25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a <b>copper</b> <b>conductor</b> is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E
500|$|Chadwick {{set about}} {{acquiring}} a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components {{could be made}} in-house. He was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the Royal Society. To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, {{who had worked with}} Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the <b>copper</b> <b>conductor</b> for the coils. The cyclotron's 50-ton magnet was manufactured in Trafford Park by Metropolitan-Vickers, which also made the vacuum chamber. The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of £5,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the University and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his [...] (£8,243) Nobel Prize money.|$|E
2500|$|A Danish engineer, Carl Emil Krarup, {{invented a}} form of {{continuously}} loaded cable which solved these problems and the cable is named for him.

[...] This cable was the first use of continuous loading on any telecommunication cable.

2500|$|Mu-metal {{has similar}} {{magnetic}} properties to permalloy but {{the addition of}} copper to the alloy increases the ductility and allows the metal {{to be drawn into}} wire. [...] Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core <b>copper</b> <b>conductor</b> {{in much the same way}} as the iron wire in Krarup cable. [...] A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.|$|E

50|$|The common way to {{effectively}} bond different metallic surfaces of enclosures, electrical equipment, pipes, tubes or structures together {{is with a}} <b>copper</b> <b>conductor,</b> rated lugs and appropriate bolts, fasteners or screws.

50|$|Insulation {{thickness}} or type {{also has}} no audible effect {{as long as}} the insulation is of good quality and does not chemically react with the wire itself (poor-quality insulation has occasionally been found to accelerate oxidation of the <b>copper</b> <b>conductor,</b> increasing resistance over time).
