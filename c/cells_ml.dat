40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effectiveness of}} surface colonization by the epiphytic marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata firstly on a complex biofilm community on glass slides, and secondly, on the epiphytic community of Ulva australis. The effectiveness of P. tunicata was compared {{with the performance of}} Phaeobacter sp. 2. 10, also a marine epiphytic isolate in the U. australis colonization experiments. Pseudoalteromonas tunicata cells were able to colonize the glass slide community at densities found naturally in the water column (9. 7 × 104 <b>cells</b> <b>mL?</b> 1). However, P. tunicata was a poor invader of the epiphytic community on U. australis at densities of 106 <b>cells</b> <b>mL?</b> 1. At densities of 108 <b>cells</b> <b>mL?</b> 1, P. tunicata again exerted little impact on the epiphytic community. Phaeobacter sp. 2. 10 was also a poor invader at lower densities, but was able to invade and become dominant at densities of 108 <b>cells</b> <b>mL?</b> 1. Differences in the ability of P. tunicata and Phaeobacter sp. 2. 10 to invade natural communities may be due to differences in the antibacterial compounds produced by the two species. These experiments suggest that epiphytic communities may have protective effects compared with inanimate surfaces...|$|E

One important microorganism is the Thraustochytrid that is a fungoid protist and are common in marine and estuarine habitats. Numerous studies existed on the biodegradation and adsorption of Thraustochytrids on various substances but not on Bunker C oil. Thus, this study aimed to determine the adsorption capacity and mean biomass of Thraustochytrids in Bunker C oil using different cell densities measured in grams.

40|$|International audiencePico and {{nanoplankton}} communities {{from the}} Southwest Atlantic Ocean along the Brazilian Bight are poorly described. The hydrography {{in this region}} is dominated by a complex system of layered water masses, which includes the warm and oligotrophic Tropical Water (TW), the cold and nutrient rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and the Coastal Water (CW), which have highly variable properties. In order to assess how pico-and nanoplankton communities are distributed in these different water masses, we determined by flow cytometry the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and autotrophic pico and nanoeukaryotes along three transects, extending from 23 • S to 31 • S and 39 • W to 49 • W. Heterotrophic bacteria (including archaea, maximum of 1. 5 × 10 6 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1) were most abundant in Coastal and Tropical Water whereas Prochlorococcus was most abundant in open-ocean oligotrophic waters (maximum of 300 × 10 3 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1). Synechococcus (up to 81 × 10 3 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1), as well as autotrophic pico and nanoeukaryotes seemed {{to benefit from the}} influx of nutrient-rich waters near the continental slope. Autotrophic pico and nanoeukaryotes were also abundant in deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layers from offshore waters, and their highest abundances were 20 × 10 3 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1 and 5 × 10 3 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1, respectively. These data are consistent with previous observations in other marine areas where Synechococcus and autotrophic eukaryotes dominate mesotrophic waters, whereas Prochlorococcus dominate in more oligotrophic areas. Regardless of the microbial community structure near the surface, the carbon stock dominance by autotrophic picoeukaryotes near the DCM is possibly linked to vertical mixing of oligotrophic surface waters with the nutrient-rich SACW and their tolerance to lower light levels...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of selected groups of micro-organisms was analyzed along a South-East Pacific Ocean transect sampled during the BIOSOPE cruise in 2004. The transect could {{be divided into}} four regions of contrasted trophic status: a High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) region (mesotrophic) near the equator, the South-East Pacific Ocean gyre (hyper-oligotrophic), a transition region between the gyre and the coast of South America (moderately oligotrophic), and the Chile upwelling (eutrophic). The abundance of phycoerythrin containing picocyanobacteria (PE picocyanobacteria), autotrophic and heterotrophic eukaryotes (classified into different size ranges), dinoflagellates, and ciliates was determined by epifluorescence microscopy after DAPI staining. Despite some apparent loss of cells due to sample storage, distribution patterns were broadly similar to those obtained by flow cytometry for PE picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes. All populations reached a maximum in the Chile upwelling and a minimum near {{the centre of the}} gyre. The maximum abundance of PE picocyanobacteria was 70 10 3 <b>cell</b> <b>mL</b> - 1.

This bloom was confined to an area where water and phytoplankton flow freely between the sea and a shrimp farm. The phytoplankton density and physico-chemical characteristics of the sea water were therefore investigated weekly at bloom and non-bloom sites in order to gain insightinto the environmental factors prevailing at the bloom site and their link with the shrimp farm runoff. The bloom site showed higher nutrient concentrations than the non-bloom site, indicating the possible role of the shrimp farm in flushing nutrients into this site. The bloom appeared on 27 May, coinciding with a decrease in salinity (19 °C). The results of toxicological assays showed that both bloom samples and batch cultures of H. akashiwo were toxic to Artemia salina and exhibited haemolytic activity with respectto rabbit erythrocytes.

40|$|To date, {{very little}} {{information}} on living coccolithophores species composition and distribution, especially the vertical profile {{has been reported}} around the world. This paper tries to fill this gap by descripting on living coccolithophores (LCs) distribution in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea in summer and winter time in detail, and its relationship among enviromental factors by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We carried out the investigations on LC distribution in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea in July and December 2011. 210 samples from different depths were collected from 44 stations in summer and 217 samples were collected from 45 stations in winter. Totally 20 taxa belonging to coccolithophyceae were identified using a polarized microscope at the 1000 × magnification. The dominant species of the two seasons were Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Emiliania huxleyi, Helicosphaera carteri, and Algirosphaera robusta. In summer the abundance of cells and coccoliths ranged 0 ~ 176. 40 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1, and 0 ~ 2144. 98 coccoliths mL − 1, with the average values of 8. 45 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1, and 265. 42 coccoliths mL − 1, respectively. And in winter the abundance of cells and coccoliths ranged 0 ~ 71. 66 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1, and 0 ~ 4698. 99 coccoliths mL − 1, with the average values of 13. 91 <b>cells</b> <b>mL</b> − 1 and 872. 56 coccoliths mL − 1 respectively. In summer the LCs in surface layer were mainly observed on the coastal belt and {{southern part of the}} survey area. The highest abundance was found at the bloom station. In winter the LCs in surface layer had high value in the continental shelf area of section P. The comparison among section A, section F, section P and section E indicated lower species diversity and less abundance in the Yellow Sea than those of the East China Sea in both seasons.

40|$|Changes in {{cellular}} myosin {{were followed}} during the differentiation into macro-phages of a myeloid leukemia <b>cell</b> line (<b>Ml)</b> {{which can be}} induced by conditioned medium (CM) from a rat embryo culture. To extract the myosin, we used three different procedures, all of which gave a lower yield of myosin for the differentiated than for the undifferentiated <b>Ml</b> <b>cells.</b> This low extractability we attributed to increased binding of the myosin to the plasma membrane. Taking the different extractabihties into consideration, we calculated the myosin contents in the total cellular protein from the densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, 0. 6 % for the untreated <b>Ml</b> <b>cells</b> and 1. 0 % for the differentiated ones.

40|$|The Cyclops sp. {{responses}} of life history traits (growth, development, and reproduction) to food conditions from oligotrophic Lake Toya {{were analyzed by}} rearing animals individually under four food regimes: three densities of the alga Cryptomonas tetrapyrenoidosa and nauplii of the calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis as prey in an algal suspension. Cyclops sp. grew successfully from newborn nauplii to adults when algal density was $ 4 3 103 <b>cells</b> <b>ml</b> 21. Development time was shorter and body length larger in the high-density (H) treatment (4 3 104 <b>cells</b> <b>ml</b> 21) than in medium-density (M) treatment (4 3 103 <b>cells</b> <b>ml</b> 21) until the early copepodite stages. In late copepodite stages, females tended to grow more slowly but tended to be larger in the M treatment than in the H treatment. However, stage-specific growth rates were similar among treatments during development, suggesting a trade-off between body size and development time. Although the egg production rate was higher in the M treatment than in the H treatment, it depended on female body size regardless of the food regime. Furthermore, the weight-specific egg production rate was the same among treatments, indicating egg production was not affected by the algal concentrations tested. Addition of copepod prey influenced neither postembryonic development time nor body size, and egg production rates were comparable to those reared with an algal diet. These results reveal that even older copepodites and adults, which are generally thought to be predacious, do not necessarily require animal prey fo...|$|E
