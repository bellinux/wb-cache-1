50|$|Swiss <b>cervelats</b> are {{prepared}} and eaten cooked or raw. They are boiled, grilled or fried. They {{can also be}} served uncooked, either in a salad or with bread and mustard.|$|R
50|$|In Switzerland, <b>cervelats</b> {{are cooked}} (slightly smoked and then boiled) or served raw. They contain {{a mixture of}} beef, bacon and pork rind. The modern Swiss variety is packed into zebu intestines.|$|R
50|$|The {{taste of}} the {{sausages}} depends on the region, but generally they are {{similar to that of}} a frankfurter, but with a smokier flavour and a texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Various European semi-dry <b>cervelat</b> are similar to summer sausage in the U.S., and Thuringian sausage can be considered a type of <b>cervelat.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Switzerland, {{the popular}} <b>Cervelat</b> sausage {{is also known}} as the kotelett of the laborer.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes sold {{smoked and}} uncooked, <b>cervelat</b> can be seasoned, salted and cold smoked for one day.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cervelat,</b> a cooked sausage, {{is often}} {{referred}} to as Switzerland's national sausage. A great number of regional sausage specialties exist as well.|$|E
5000|$|Cooked {{sausages}} (Brühwurst) {{may include}} water and emulsifiers and are always cooked. They will not keep long. Examples include <b>cervelat,</b> Jagdwurst, and Weißwurst.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cervelat,</b> also cervelas, servelat or zervelat, is a sausage {{produced}} in Switzerland, France (especially Alsace and Lyon) {{and parts of}} Germany. The recipe and preparation of the sausage vary regionally.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times {{noted that}} [...] "the {{possible}} demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people." [...] The <b>cervelat</b> production crisis was covered closely by the Swiss media {{and in a}} newspaper poll, 72% of those surveyed said the [...] "cervelas, as they knew it, had to be saved." [...] The <b>cervelat</b> crisis {{was brought up in}} a parliamentary debate wherein state councillor and president of the Swiss Meat Association, Rolf Büttiker, spoke of the national sausage's social significance, calling it a [...] "cult sausage" [...] and [...] "the worker's steak". The Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU to seek an exception for zebu intestines, and Swiss scientists were sent to Brazil hoping to show that the intestines posed no risk of transmitting mad cow disease.|$|E
5000|$|... "Brioche is eaten with dessert or tea, {{but also}} has {{numerous}} uses in cuisine. Common brioche dough is suitable for coulibiac and fillet of beef en croute. Brioche mousseline surrounds foie gras, sausage, <b>cervelat</b> lyonnais; ... individual brioches serve as containers for various chopped and sauced stuffings, savoury or sweet, as warm appetizers or intermediate courses." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>cervelat</b> {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the national sausage of Switzerland. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually, which is equivalent to a consumption of 25 cervelats per person each year. Grilling cervelats over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly's wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage.Swiss cervelats are made of roughly equal parts of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice, which helps bind the ingredients, along with spices, curing salt and cutter additives. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines, smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Processed and packaged varieties sold in Swiss supermarkets also contain nitrites and antioxidants. A <b>cervelat</b> may weigh from about 100 to 200 grams.|$|E
50|$|Supper Unit: canned meat, {{consisting}} of <b>cervelat</b> sausage, (early version), either pork luncheon meat with carrot or apple (first issue), beef and pork loaf (second issue); biscuits; a 2-ounce (57 g) D ration emergency chocolate bar, (early version) Tropical bar, or (in temperate climates) commercial sweet chocolate bar (late version), {{a packet of}} toilet paper tissues; a four-pack of cigarettes; chewing gum, and a bouillon packet (cube or powder).|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, {{the most}} popular Dutch {{products}} are finely chopped salami, <b>Cervelat,</b> Snijworst (with high fat content and rind added), Boerenmetworst (which is coarsely chopped), and chorizo (which is less spicy than the Spanish product). In Russia, typical products are Moscow-type and Russian-type salamis made from pork and beef meat. A particular feature of Moscow- type salami is the large size of fat particles (7-8mm) that give the sausage a rough cover.|$|E
50|$|On , Léonard Lipp and {{his wife}} Pétronille opened the brasserie on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Their {{speciality}} was a <b>cervelat</b> rémoulade starter, then sauerkraut, served with the finest beers. The brasserie's atmosphere and its modest prices made it a great success. Anti-German sentiment during the First World War led to a change of name to Brasserie des Bords for several years. Of Alsatian origin, Lipp left Alsace when it became part of Germany.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{the term}} Thuringer refers to Thuringer <b>cervelat,</b> {{a type of}} smoked {{semi-dry}} sausage similar to summer sausage. It is made from a medium grind of beef, blended with salt, cure ingredients, spices (usually including dry mustard), and a lactic acid starter culture. After stuffing into a fibrous casing, it is smoked and dried, then cooked. Hormel Foods Corporation, {{as well as many}} regional processors and some small butcher shops, produce the sausage in this fashion.|$|E
5000|$|By 1910, Hormel {{products}} were routinely appearing in national magazines. That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried {{to produce a}} commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar <b>Cervelat,</b> Holsteiner and Noxall Salami. [...] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide. [...] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service {{and by the end}} of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sausages}} {{are called}} cervelas in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, <b>Cervelat</b> in the German-speaking part, and servelat in the Italian-speaking part. The terms ultimately derive from cerebrum, the Latin word for brain, {{which was used}} in early recipes. The term [...] "Cervelat" [...] is {{the oldest of the}} three. It was first recorded in 1552 by Rabelais, and is derived from zervelada, a Milanese dialect word meaning a [...] "large, short sausage filled with meat and pork brains." [...] Modern recipes do not include brains, and arose {{towards the end of the}} 19th century in Basel, as a reworking of the traditional recipe.|$|E
