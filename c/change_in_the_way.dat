5|$|Over {{a century}} later, there are {{records of the}} walls being {{repaired}} in the 1520s and 1530s by Henry VIII {{in preparation for a}} potential royal visit, but the ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne had heralded a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. The military importance of Conwy's defences declined and the townspeople used the walls' defensive ditches for discarding rubbish. Parts of the town walls were robbed for their stone during this period for use in the construction of local buildings.|$|E
5|$|Arctic Monkeys are a British indie {{rock band}} from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2002, Arctic Monkeys {{currently}} consists of Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar, Jamie Cook on guitar, Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals, and Nick O'Malley on bass guitar and backing vocals, a position formerly held by Andy Nicholson. The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file sharing, and were heralded {{as one of}} the first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band eventually signed to the independent record label Domino Records.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E

Katsumoto Karen (b. 1955), a scholar and a Tendai nun, notes that contemporary societal views of nuns have not changed, and many still consider nunhood to be a sad thing signifying old age, or, if the nun is younger, that she is escaping from a bad relationship or mourning {{the death of her}} husband (Katsumoto 2012, preface).|$|R
5|$|The Nevill Ground was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} host grounds for the 1983 Cricket World Cup. It hosted one group stage match between India and Zimbabwe on 18June 1983. Kapil Dev scored 175 not out after India were 9–4, which helped India win by 31 runs and qualify into the semi-finals, thus avoiding a play-off against Australia. Dev's partnership with Syed Kirmani set a world record for the largest ninth wicket stand of 126. This match led to the Nevill Ground being held in high regard by Indian cricket fans with there being a view that the game at the Nevill Ground inspired a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> cricket was played in India. This led to players such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid playing for India in later years.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Castle {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} Richard's son, Henry and Henry's daughter, Anne until 1449. When Anne died, it passed by marriage to Richard Neville, who held it until his death in 1471 during the period of civil strife known as the Wars of the Roses. As the conflict progressed and political fortunes rose and fell, the castle passed from George, the Duke of Clarence, to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to Jasper Tudor, the Duke of Bedford, back to Richard Neville's wife Anne, back to Jasper and finally to Prince Henry, the future Henry VIII. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne {{at the end of the}} wars heralded a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. As a result, defensive castles became less important. In 1495 Henry VII formally revoked the Marcher territory status of Cardiff Castle and the surrounding territories, bringing them under normal English law as the County of Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Caernarfon was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety. The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement, however; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenementsproperties paying rent to the kingmaking it far less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris, and the situation did not improve during the 14th century. In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404, the town's defences held out. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English, reducing {{the need to maintain}} Caernarfon's castle and walls and easing the restrictions on Welsh access to the townthe Welsh were finally allowed to live inside Caernarfon in 1507.|$|E

25|$|<b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> people {{perceive}} attachment tend to occur with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{people perceive}} support.

25|$|In November, {{he protested}} {{publicly}} against a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> constituency funds were allocated to MPs. He argued that, {{under the new}} rules, {{there was no longer}} any meaningful accountability, as the funds were now to be paid directly into MPs' salaries. Regenvanu argued that this amounted to an unjustified 83% salary increase for MPs. He successfully moved that a nominal vote be taken on the issue, but was one of just seven MPs to vote against what the Daily Post also described as an increase in MPs' salaries.|$|E
25|$|Protestant {{propaganda}} and church doctrine {{broke away from}} the traditional conventions of the Catholic Church. They called for a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that the church was run and insisted that the buying and selling of indulgences and religious positions be stopped as well as the papal corruption that had been allowed to occur. In addition to this, Reformers questioned the authority of the Church and in particular the Pope. Protestants believed that the main authority of their church should be the Gospel or Scripture (expounded by private interpretation) and not the Pope, who is the earthly head of the Catholic Church.|$|E

Teacher Sung Yongho, in charge of the school choir, helped Sunhwa, giving her chances to participate in competitions; then, she was admitted to Baekjae Art College. A few days before the college entrance ceremony, she got a call from an agent who watched Superstar Survival and became a trainee in TS Entertainment.|$|E

Den Hertog (2000) suggests four dimensions of novelty on service innovation: a) Service concept: a service new to its particular market (new value proposition); b) Client interface: <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> clients are involved in service design; c) Service delivery system: <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> which service worker performs his jobs delivering critical services; d) Technology: great efficiency obtained though information technology into process and delivery innovation.|$|R
25|$|To {{the extent}} that the Act affects all federal {{financial}} regulatory agencies, eliminating one (the Office of Thrift Supervision) and creating two (Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research) in addition to several consumer protection agencies, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this legislation in many ways represents a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> America's financial markets will operate in the future. Few provisions of the Act became effective when the bill was signed. Only over the next 18 months as various regulatory agencies write rules that implement various sections of the Act, will the full importance and significance of the Act be known.|$|E
25|$|The ATLB {{and some}} {{industry}} peers regarded the firm as seriously undercapitalised and {{saw this as}} {{a major cause of}} financial instability. The management's refusal to contemplate a fundamental <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the business was run, including a change in the top management itself, undermined the confidence of Hambros Bank, the airline's main creditor, in its prospects. These circumstances led to the withdrawal of Hambros's support. At the time of its bankruptcy, British Eagle operated 25 aircraft and employed a staff of 2,300, including 220 pilots. The failed company owed its creditors £5½ million; Rolls-Royce and Esso, who were owed £630,000 and £300,000 respectively, headed the list of creditors.|$|E

They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.|$|E
