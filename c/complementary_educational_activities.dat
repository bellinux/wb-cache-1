In the theoretical part there are basic facts about contributory organizations, the founder, the foundation document, the dividing into main and by work or their budget. Following by the characterization of the incomes and selected expenses which can be often found in a contributory organization accountancy. The last part brings a closer view of conducting of accountancy in the selected accounting units including accounting documentary evidence and financial analysis. The last chapter shows theoretical possibilities of income and expense amendment at a contributory organization. At {{the beginning of the}} working part there is shown the certain contributory organization Gymnázium Broumov (grammar school Broumov) following by the detailed analysis of its profits and selected costs. This part also describes the economization of the school individual funds and then the way of conducting of accountancy in this contributory organization. Other chapters of this dissertation pay attention to the financial analysis of economization and factual project of income and expense amendment at the grammar school. In the chapter 4. 7 you can find the possibilities of the incomes increase. It is conected with the taking advantage of appropriation projects given by the organizer, the Ministry of Education or the EU, the closure of new agreements for lease of school not flat space or establishing of <b>complementary</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activities.</b> The expenses can be amended by lowering the power consumption thanks to the project EPC or using central purchase of power and some services {{within the framework of the}} HK region. The saving can be reached by correct utilization of substitute quota with the purchase of products and services or by optimum drawing of wage means. The conclusion contains the evaluation of the amendment results. Thanks to the amendment the incomes are risen up to 750, 000 Czech crowns more than 80 % of it are the incomes from appropriation projects. It brings to school better study conditions for students, possibilities of further education for teachers or getting new teaching aids. The incomes from the lease of school not flat space have to be, according to the foundation document, used for repairs and maintenance of the school building at the same calendar year. The establishing of <b>complementary</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> is more both administratively and organizationaly demanding than possibilities of income amendment so it might be set up in Sept. 2017. The Grammar School Broumov can get up to 300, 000 Czech crowns a year thanks to the expense amendment. The saving made by lowering total power, service and material expenses can be used without any restrictions for example for purchase of new modern technology, interactive boards or for school environment innovation. The grammar school management can use the saving made by optimum drawing of wage means as a motivation for the teachers via bonuses or personal extra pays...|$|E
40|$|In three {{different}} studies {{upper secondary school}} head teachers’ characterization and identification of mathematical giftedness was investigated. A survey study (Paper II) explored the conceptions held by 36 randomly selected upper secondary school head teachers in mathematics. An interview study (Paper III) investigated the conceptions held by three purposively selected head teachers working at the longest running gifted programs in mathematics in Swedish upper secondary schools. A third study (Paper IV) looked for creativity, the characteristic head teachers’ most frequently associated with giftedness, in the admission tests used at the cutting-edge programs in mathematics in upper secondary school. As compared to theoretical models, {{results showed that the}} head teachers collectively expressed nuanced characterizations of mathematical giftedness and the identification thereof. This was especially demonstrated by the head teachers at the gifted mathematics programs. Still, for individual head teachers, {{there is a need to}} further their knowledge about the different abilities contributing to manifestations of mathematical giftedness. This would increase the possibility to identify and develop the mathematical abilities of an even greater number of mathematically promising students. Krutetskii’s (1976) structure of mathematical abilities manifested by capable mathematics students was used as a framework for the content analysis in the first two studies, and Lithner’s (2008) framework for creative and imitative reasoning was used in the third study. In a fourth study (Paper V) the representation of different student groups at five purposively selected gifted programs in upper secondary school was investigated. Findings from this comparative study of demographical factors – gender, geographical origin, and highest education of parents – were complemented by findings from the interview study where the cognitive, as well as personal and social, characteristics of students participating at three gifted programs were expressed. Results from the interview study indicated that students participating at the gifted programs showed signs of mathematical giftedness that are not necessarily connected to schoolhouse giftedness. Both mathematically gifted students who were individualists and reluctant to participate in traditional school mathematics, and those who were hardworking and ambitious, were recognized. Participating students had special needs, such as to approach mathematical tasks in their own way and learn how to communicate mathematics in written solutions, connected to their giftedness that call for special education. The demographical study showed that it is mostly males with highly educated parents who have found their way to gifted programs in mathematics. In sum, results indicate that the head teachers at the gifted programs acknowledge that there are gifted mathematics students with special educational needs at their gifted programs. There is also a call for the development of <b>complementary</b> <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> to reach a greater number and variety of gifted students...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the knowledge of}} public day care centers employees about breastfeeding and complementary feeding. METHODS: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 15 public day care centers randomly selected in the city of Uberlandia, Southeast Brazil. A questionnaire applied to school principals, teachers, educators and general services assistants (GSA) included demographic and socioeconomic variables and questions about knowledge on breastfeeding, complementary feeding besides employees' perceptions about these subjects. Kruskal-Wallis with multiple comparison and chi-square tests were used to compare variables by professional category. RESULTS: 304 employees participated in the study. The highest percentages of correct answers were noted for questions about exclusive breastfeeding: definition - 97 % (n= 296) and duration - 65 % (n= 199). Regarding complementary feeding, 61 % (n= 187) correctly answered about the appropriate age to introduce it, with a lower percentage for meat (56 %; n= 170) and sugar (16 %; n= 50). Concerning employees' perceptions, 9 % (n= 29) believed that there is weak breast milk, 79 % (n= 241) and 51 % (n= 157) reported the negative influence of bottle feeding and pacifier use on breastfeeding. Among the interviewed subjects, 77 % (n= 234) answered that they had a positive influence {{on the quality of the}} food given to the children. There were no differences in the answers according to professional category, except for the negative influence of pacifiers on breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Employees of public day care centers knew more about breastfeeding than about <b>complementary</b> feeding. <b>Educational</b> <b>activities</b> about breastfeeding and complementary feeding are necessary for day care centers employees...|$|R

40|$|The young {{school age}} is {{characterized}} by primary entry of the child into <b>educational</b> <b>activity,</b> mastering main types of educational actions. However, <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> is not given to {{a child in a}} finished form, it has to be formed. One of the main conclusions of the theory of <b>educational</b> <b>activities</b> by Davydov is that the informative requirement which is the cornerstone of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> is formed in this activity. This dialectic contradiction defines a common problem of this work - the problem of formation of motives of <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> In particular, the dynamic structure of educational motives, where each motive, on the one hand, lies in the basis of specific educational action, and, on the other hand, it is formed by specific educational actions. The research of such communication of educational motivation with the system of educational actions allows teachers to get closer to the understanding of driving forces, the reasons, internal mechanisms of behavior of a child in <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> This allows teachers to understand the process of designing and organization of <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> This work was supported by financial support from Medical University Moscow State Pedagogical University in the framework of scholarships named after V.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the most relevant}} environmental antimotivation determinants of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> in pedagogical university students. An original questionnaire on antimotivation in <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> designed for students and developed {{on the basis of}} the environmental approach for pedagogical higher education institutions is represented in the article. The components of educational environment are considered as environmental antimotivation determinants of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> in pedagogical university students: spatial and objective one, psychodidactic, social and subjective components, as well as microenvironment (the family environment) and macroenvironment (society as a whole). According to the results of research, the psycho-didactic component of the educational environment of a higher education institution has been found to be a statistically more pronounced antimotivation determinant of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> in pedagogical university students. It has been proved that all environmental antimotivation determinants of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> singled out in students are in direct correlation dependence. For respondents, <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> antimotives conditioned by psycho-didactic component of the educational environment of the university are of uniform significance, which has been determined on the basis of dispersion calculation...|$|R
