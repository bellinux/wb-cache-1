40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) techniques, such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) or SAR tomography (TomoSAR), deliver three-dimensional (3 -D) point clouds of the scatterers’ positions together with their motion information relative to a reference point. Due to the SAR sidelooking geometry, minimum of two point clouds from <b>crossheading</b> orbits, i. e., ascending and descending, are required to achieve a complete monitoring over an urban area. However, these two point clouds are usually not coregistered due to their different reference points with unknown 3 -D positions. In general, no exact identical points from the same physical object {{can be found in}} such two point clouds. This article describes a robust algorithm for fusing such two point clouds of urban areas. The contribution of this paper is finding the theoretically exact point correspondence, which is the end positions of façades, where the two point clouds close. We explicitly define this algorithm as “L-shape detection and matching,” in this paper, because the façades commonly appear as L-shapes in InSAR point cloud. This algorithm introduces a few important features for a reliable result, including point density estimation using adaptive directional window for better façade points detection and L-shape extraction using weighed Hough transform. The algorithm is fully automatic. Its accuracy is evaluated using simulated data. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied on two TomoSAR point clouds over Berlin with ascending and descending geometry. The result is compared with the first PSI point cloud fusion method (S. Gernhardt and R. Bamler, “Deformation monitoring of single buildings using meter-resolution SAR data in PSI,” ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens., vol. 73, pp. 68 – 79, 2012.) for urban area.

These compressors are constructed with a force-fed lubricated <b>crosshead</b> that drives a double-acting piston via a piston rod. Looseness {{in the running}} gear (piston assembly, connecting rod assembly, and <b>crosshead</b> assembly) results in knocks (impulse events) that are usually detected at the <b>crosshead</b> guide with accelerometers and, in some cases, with proximity probes measuring the piston rod vibration at the pressure packing case. <b>Crosshead</b> guide accelerometers have proven successful in detecting and preventing catastrophic failure; however, the alarm set points for the vibration levels have been derived heuristically because no model exists that relates forces and impacts within the running gear to the vibration of the <b>crosshead</b> guide. This paper presents {{a model of the}} <b>crosshead</b> system that estimates the vibration response of the <b>crosshead</b> and <b>crosshead</b> guide in reaction to the forces and impulses in the running gear. The model incorporates the oil-film behavior including non-linear, position-dependent stiffness and damping. The paper also examines the system response in the time domain and the complex plane (eigenvalue migration). The numerical model results are validated by comparison with data acquired on operating machines in known conditions of distress. The results show good agreement between the model and <b>crosshead</b> and piston rod vibration data, both in the timing and amplitude of vibration. Using the results of the model and historical data collected from operating reciprocating compressors the paper concludes with guidelines for filtering of <b>crosshead</b> accelerometer signals and alarm thresholds...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{this research}} is to investigate the effect of <b>crosshead</b> speed on the tensile behavior of the structural steel which is presented in stress-strain diagram. The experiments were carried out by performing tensile testing of specimens with various <b>crosshead</b> speeds. The <b>crosshead</b> speed was determined by a dial position of 0. 2, 0. 5, 1, and 2 on the testing machine. In load-free condition, the dial positions give true speed of the <b>crosshead</b> of 0. 042 mm/s, 0. 27 mm/s, 0. 663 mm/s, and 1. 354 mm/s respectively. The material used in {{this research is}} astructural steel which {{is comparable to the}} standard of DIN ST 37. The result shows that the various <b>crosshead</b> speeds give a different response of the strain rate during the test. The strain rate, whic is resembled by the <b>crosshead</b> speed, begins to increase at the yield point. Also, theultimate stress of the specimens is affected by the <b>crosshead</b> speed.

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) interferometry is {{the technique}} to use SAR as interferometer, {{to measure the}} phase difference caused by topography or object displacement. Multipass SAR interferometry (InSAR) is so far the only method for assessing long-term millimetre-level deformation over large areas from space on an imaging basis. Very high resolution multipass InSAR techniques have made substantial development {{in the last decade}} in monitoring individual building using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) and SAR tomography (TomoSAR), nonurban area using small baseline subset (SBAS) and SqueeSAR, and so on. To prepare for future SAR missions which will have higher resolution, larger coverage, and greater data volume, this thesis addresses the following four aspects of multipass InSAR techniques: computational efficiency, information fusion, contextual awareness, and statistical robustness. TomoSAR is the most competent InSAR method for urban area monitoring. But it is much more computationally intensive than any other multipass InSAR methods. To this end, an efficient multi-dimensional TomoSAR algorithm for urban area was developed, by integrating tomographic SAR inversion and the well-known PSI. The results of PSI were used for a pre-classification of single and double scatterers, and also used as prior in the TomoSAR reconstruction. Real data experiments show the proposed approach obtains results comparable to the one obtained by the most computationally expensive tomographic SAR algorithms (e. g. SL 1 MMER), and saves computational time by a factor of fifty. Multi-aspect InSAR point clouds fusion is required for a complete monitoring of entire city, due to the SAR side-looking geometry. In this thesis, a robust algorithm, namely ”L-shape detection & matching”, is proposed, especially for fusing two point clouds from <b>crossheading</b> orbits, i. e. ascending and descending. The main idea of this algorithm is finding and matching the theoretically exact point correspondence which is the end positions of facades where the two point clouds close. Practical experiment shows the proposed method achieves sub-meter consistency with the state-of-the-art, and is much more computationally efficient. The development of a semantic urban infrastructure monitoring algorithm by fusing InSAR and optical images was followed after the point cloud fusion. The attributes derived from optical images, e. g. colour, classification label, are transferred to the InSAR point cloud for a semantic level analysis of the deformation signal. The key lies on a strict 3 -D geometric co-registration of SAR and optical images by reconstructing and matching the 3 -D point clouds derived from the two types of images. Examples on bridges and railway monitoring are demonstrated. Robust InSAR optimization is crucial for future SAR data, because of the unprecedented high resolution brings different observation statistics and much more dynamic interferometric phase. The proposed robust InSAR optimization (RIO) framework answers two open questions in multipass InSAR: (1) How to optimally treat images with a large phase error, e. g., due to unmodeled motion phase, uncompensated atmospheric phase, etc. ? And (2) How to estimate the covariance matrix of a non-Gaussian complex InSAR multivariate, particularly those with nonstationary phase signals? For the former question, RIO employs a robust M-estimator to effectively down-weight these images, and for the latter question, a new method — the rank M-Estimator — is proposed. Simulated and real data experiments demonstrated that substantial improvement can be achieved in terms of the variance of estimates, comparing to the state-of-the-art estimators for persistent and distributed scatterers. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other multipass InSAR techniques. The abovementioned algorithms were tested using TerraSAR-X data of various test sites, especially for the efficient TomoSAR algorithm and the RIO framework...|$|E

Also, the <b>crosshead</b> enables the connecting rod to freely move outside the cylinder.
