5|$|In 2092, {{humanity}} has conquered mortality {{through the}} endless renewal of cells. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. <b>Curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall {{some of his}} memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into their many possible outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E

60|$|I {{thought with}} the captain, and {{was pleased that}} my own {{legislative}} debut {{was not to be}} characterized by the promulgation of any doctrine so much at variance with my preconceived ways of thinking. <b>Curious,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his opinion, I asked the brigadier in what light he felt disposed to view the matter himself.|$|R
60|$|Captain Hank Grady was a tall, evil-looking man {{of forty}} years of age. His title was merely one of favor, for he had neither served in the army nor the navy. But little was known of his past {{by the people of}} the section, and he never took the pains to {{enlighten}} those who were <b>curious</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{found them}} as I had left them--Sally quiet, pale, Miss Sampson nervous and distressed. I soon calmed their fears of any further trouble or {{possible}} disturbance. Miss Sampson then became <b>curious</b> and wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who the rustler was.|$|R
25|$|They took Catholicism {{for some}} sort of new sect of Buddhism and were <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of the priest's doctrine. Tolerant but shrewd, their eyes less on baptism than the Portuguese cargoes from Macao, they granted the Jesuit {{permission}} to preach. The uncompromising Xavier took to the streets of the city denouncing, among other things, infanticide, idolatry and homosexuality (the last being widely accepted at the time). Misunderstandings were inevitable.|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} his hopes for fan {{reaction to the}} second season's emphasis on the Kazon, Piller said: [...] "I'll be <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the audience's perception is, if our investing in the Kazon this season worked." [...] In response to fans' concerns that Voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous Star Trek installments, {{he believed that the}} growing focus on the Kazon would serve as the solution. Piller believed the alien species accentuated the show's futuristic storylines, explaining: [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} who don't consider a lot [...] science fiction." [...] He followed this up by saying: [...] "But certainly you can make a case that facing the Kazon in battle is futurist storytelling." [...] Taylor viewed the second season as focused on [...] "character-driven, introspective" [...] stories, with a majority of the [...] "action-adventure" [...] aspects being conducted through the appearances of the Kazon.|$|E

60|$|I {{saw that}} the Oxonian {{was at the bottom}} of all this oracular mystery, and was {{disposed}} to amuse himself with the general, whose tender approaches to the widow have attracted the notice of the wag. I was a little <b>curious,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the meaning of the dark hints which had so suddenly disconcerted Master Simon; and took occasion to fall in the rear with the Oxonian on our way home, when he laughed heartily at my questions, and gave me ample information on the subject.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2011 a {{comic book}} based on Don 2, Don: The Origin, was {{published}} in Mumbai. A prequel, it details Don's past. About the comic, Ritesh Sidhwani said: [...] "Don 2 takes off from where Don: The Chase Begins Again left off. In these five years, many have forgotten the film and must be <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how Don came into being.

[...] He was unhappy with Royer's footnotes and {{in a letter to the}} botanist Joseph Hooker he wrote: [...] "Almost everywhere in Origin, when I express great doubt, she appends a note explaining the difficulty or saying that there is none whatever!!

60|$|One afternoon, as I was {{returning}} {{in the boat}} from the point {{on the other side}} of the island where I had found the rustic seat and Emily's book, I was surprised to see Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine standing on the end of the little wharf. This was an unusual thing for them to do, as they were very industrious women and seldom had an idle moment, and it seemed to be one of their greatest pleasures to discuss the work they were going to do when they had finished that on which they were then engaged. I was <b>curious,</b> therefore, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why they should be standing thus idly on the wharf, and pulled toward them as rapidly as possible.|$|R
5000|$|The bluespotted {{triggerfish}} is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> not do {{well with}} other species within the same family when kept in an aquarium. If other specimens are in the tank with it, the aquarium should be of large size to avoid aggressive and malicious behavior. This species is not only naturally aggressive in its behavior, {{but it is also}} <b>curious</b> and <b>known</b> <b>to</b> explore. [...] Another common name for the bluespotted triggerfish is the Golden Heart Triggerfish.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no danger}} that Margaret would not lavish care enough on her brother. She waited {{on him in}} his room all the next day, {{bringing}} him everything he could want, {{and trying to make}} him come down-stairs, for she thought sitting alone there very bad for his spirits; but he said he had a letter to write, and very <b>curious</b> she was <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why he was so long doing it, and why he did not tell her to whom it was addressed. However, she saw when it was put into the post-bag, that it was for Lady Morville.|$|R

6000|$|He {{had found}} her with Elspeth on his return home. Would Grizel call and be friendly? he had asked himself many times since he saw her in church yesterday, and Elspeth was as <b>curious.</b> Each wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the other thought of her, but neither {{had the courage to}} inquire, they both wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> so much. Her name had been {{mentioned}} but casually, not a word to indicate that she had grown up since they saw her last. The longer Tommy remained silent, the more, he knew, did Elspeth suspect him. He would have liked to say, in a careless voice, [...] "Rather pretty, isn't she?" [...] but he felt that this little Elspeth would see through him at once.|$|R
5000|$|..... I was <b>curious</b> {{and wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the chords were made of. I {{would begin to}} play like the other instruments. But in those days we didn't have amplification, so the singers used to use {{megaphones}} and they didn't have grand-pianos for us to use at the time - it was an upright. So when {{they gave me a}} solo, playing single fingers like I was doing, in those great big halls they could hardly hear me. So I had to think of something so I could cut through the big-band. So I started to use what they call 'trumpet-style' - which was octaves. Then they could hear me out front and that's what changed the style of piano playing at that particular time.|$|R
60|$|After we came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her my {{judgment}} was warped, so that I am <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> recollect what my unbiassed{sic} instincts were. It is hard, however, {{to eliminate the}} feelings which reason or prejudice afterwards raised in me.|$|R

40|$|Cross Border Higher Education (CBHE) {{is one of}} {{the issues}} of the present {{knowledge}} era. As knowledge transmission is becoming increasingly borderless, we understand that the forces of globalisation, neo-liberal principles and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) are the three important driving factors for this development in cross-border education and higher education is the most affected area by this development. The huge higher education potentials of China and India have greatly attracted cross-border providers and in recent years there has been remarkable growth in the CBHE of these two countries. The accession of China and India to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the agreement on GATS allowed the free entry of for-profit cross-border educational providers both in and out. Both of these countries have encountered several problems in dealing with the CBHE. In response, they have taken some measures in recent years to regulate and manage CBHE. However, we understand that many things are not yet clear. We also became more <b>curious</b> recently <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how these two countries differ and resemble one another in dealing with CBHE. In this paper we would like to understand and compare the similarities and the differences in the ways that China and India organise and manage the CBHE. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
5000|$|Early 20th century American preacher Billy Sunday {{epitomizes the}} Evangelical focus on [...] "going to heaven" [...] in his sermon [...] "Heaven: A Wonderful Place; Where There is No More Death; Blessed Hope of the Christian."

[...] Sunday speaks of many aspects of the afterlife such as the nice weather and eternal health, although {{there is no mention of}} the resurrection of the dead. He ends with an illustration about a man who dies and goes to heaven exclaiming [...] "Home, home at last!" [...] as if he had arrived at the end of his eschatological journey.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to obtain a better {{understanding}} of what factors affect the motivation for visiting Dark Tourism sites and the way that these sites are regarded. By providing such an insight this study contributes to a greater understanding of Dark Tourism.   In order to find answers to our questions, we interviewed several representatives at different sites and also carried out observations at three Dark Tourism attractions to reach a better understanding of the visors’ motivations for visiting this kind of tourist attractions. In our study we have concluded that people have become increasingly interested in visiting such Dark Tourism sites even though these may seem scary or uncomfortable. Our research has helped us to find answers to the questions that we asked and we have concluded that people have become more <b>curious</b> and want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about terrible events and why they took place...|$|R
