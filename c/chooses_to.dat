5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she <b>chooses</b> <b>to</b> relinquish the hospice benefit.

50|$|Concerning {{third-party}} prisoner's dilemma (TP-PD), {{the game}} was modified so {{that in addition to}} two players who would <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> either cooperate or defect, a third party observer could <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> punish the players. The payoffs of the game were such that the players would be best off if they defected; however, if both players <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> defect, their payoff would be less than if they had cooperated. The observer could then <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> spend from his endowment to punish the defectors who <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> put self-interest ahead of cooperation. From previous theories, it can be concluded that subjects are willing to cooperate if the probability that others will also do so is sufficiently large. Once again, if self-interest was the decision maker for these players, neither would <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> cooperate, and the observer would also <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> keep his full endowment and not issue any punishments. However, about 45.8% of observers <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> punish the defector when he is paired with a cooperator, and 20.8% <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> punish both players if they had both defected. It's {{important to note that the}} magnitude of punishment was much larger when one defected.|$|R
