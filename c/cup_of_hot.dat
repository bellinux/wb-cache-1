5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer {{than any of his}} English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Detective J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) {{attempts}} to woo Davenport using {{less and less}} ethical means, eventually calling {{her back to the}} precinct to pick up her lost client even though he was never found. When she realizes his ruse, she pours a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee in his lap. Undercover officer Belker (Bruce Weitz) arrests a bald-headed pickpocket at the hostage situation and processes him at the precinct. Belker's proclivity for biting the ankles of perpetrators redeems itself in this episode. Desk Sergeant Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) confides in Fay about his teen-age sweetheart, Cindy. When officers Hill (Michael Warren) and Renko (Charles Haid) respond to a domestic situation, their police car is stolen, and they are shot after walking into a rundown building while trying to find a phone to call in the theft.|$|E
5|$|Tremo gained Poniatowski's trust as {{the cook}} able to satisfy both his palate and his dietary requirements. The teetotal king {{suffered}} from gastric ailments {{from an early}} age. He usually started his day with a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate or bouillon. His favourite dish was roast or stewed mutton, which he washed down with spring water. Tremo often consulted royal menus with the court physician and occasionally prepared separate dishes specifically for the king to accommodate his sensitive stomach. Tomatoes, for example, were considered detrimental to the monarch's health and were never used in Tremo's recipes.|$|E
60|$|We {{rushed into}} the kitchen, meeting Pa Hinkle coming out with two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee in his hands.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{before he}} had done {{speaking}} two large <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee and two thick slices of buttered bread lay before them.|$|R
60|$|After this Harry {{retired to}} the cabin and changed his clothing. He drank several <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, and {{half an hour later}} {{declared}} that he felt as well as ever.|$|R
5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E
25|$|In Goscinny and Uderzo's 1965 comic Asterix in Britain, Caesar has {{successfully}} conquered Britain because the Britons stop fighting every afternoon for a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> water with milk, tea not yet having {{been brought to}} Europe.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice with a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> water and honey.|$|E
60|$|Jack {{was only}} {{a minute or two}} getting into his clothes, the other midshipmen off duty also hurrying up. Tom Hammond brought in four <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, which they drank hastily, and then munching their hard {{biscuits}} as they went, the party of four hurried off.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{table in}} the middle of the room, and on it stood <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee. Chauvelin bade him drink, suggesting, not unkindly, that the warm {{beverage}} would do him good. Armand advanced further into the room, and saw that there were wooden benches all round against the wall. On one of these sat his sister Marguerite.|$|R
60|$|Following these {{quickly to}} the same place, he found that innumerable <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee and solid slices of bread and butter were being served out {{as fast as they}} could be filled and cut. A large hole or window opened in the side of the shed, the shutter of which was hinged at the bottom, and when let down formed a {{convenient}} counter.|$|R
500|$|The {{book also}} {{features}} periodic sections titled [...] "Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox", which are short collections of questions Munroe had not answered {{because he did}} not [...] "want to think about that". In an interview, Munroe stated that he [...] "never got past the initial mental image" [...] of the question [...] "How cold would your teeth have to get in order for a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee to make them shatter on contact?" ...|$|E
500|$|Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a {{controversial}} presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. Feminist groups condemned the band's performances as pornographic, accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny, claims which Perry boldly disputed, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what Eugene Weekly called [...] "the most hotly discussed {{topic in the}} local music scene" [...] and [...] "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [...] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee in {{his face as he}} was walking down the street.|$|E
500|$|Hiram B. Shaw {{had just}} {{returned}} to the beach when this casualty occurred. After supplying his small rescue boat with more rope lines, he and Edward DeCourcy removed their outer clothing and prepared to embark. The men on the Cobb, who had just witnessed Waterhouse's drowning, prompted {{the captain of the}} schooner to give an impassioned address in which he said, [...] "They have sacrificed one man in their efforts to save us; now I'll risk my life in an attempt to get ashore." [...] The captain tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the water, just as the rescue boat had set out from shore. After battling against the current and waves, he was met by Shaw's rescue boat and clung to its stern until they reached land. Making use of the captain's line, the men on shore tied a life preserver to it. One at a time, the five stranded crewmen pulled the flotation device out to the schooner, fastened it to their bodies and were pulled to safety by the people on the shore. [...] After receiving a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, a drink of whiskey and a blanket, the Cobb's crew were taken to Coquina, Ormond Beach's area hospital.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> Oaxacan-style <b>hot</b> {{chocolate}} {{served in}} a traditional clay mug (no handle) and [...] "pan de yema" [...] (egg bread) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The joke is incompletely {{resolved}} in their opinion," [...] noted Dr. Elliot Oring, [...] "because {{the situation is}} incompatible with {{the world as we}} know it. Certainly, elephants do not sit in <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate." [...] Oring defined humour as not the resolution of incongruity, but [...] "the perception of appropriate incongruity," [...] that all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, and that absurd jokes require the additional component of an [...] "absurd image," [...] with an incongruity of the mental image.|$|R
50|$|There {{are others}} who {{maintain}} that these men were helped to make themselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and that their officers, including Baldini, tried hard to bolster morale with Baldini handing <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate milk to his sodden conscripts in late May 1982. In 2009, Argentine authorities in Comodoro Rivadavia ratified a decision made by authorities in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego (which, according to Argentina, have authority over the islands), announcing their intention to charge 70 officers and NCOs with inhumane treatment of conscript soldiers during the war.|$|R
2500|$|Horse Feathers (1932), {{in which}} the {{brothers}} satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of Time magazine. It included a running gag from their stage work, in which Harpo produces a ludicrous array of props from inside his coat, including a wooden mallet, a fish, a coiled rope, a tie, a poster {{of a woman in}} her underwear, a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, a sword; and, just after Groucho warns him that he [...] "can't burn the candle at both ends," [...] a candle burning at both ends.|$|E
2500|$|Kinkade {{was also}} criticized for {{the extent to}} which he had commercialized his art, for example, by selling his prints on the QVC home {{shopping}} network. Some academics expressed concerns about the implications of Kinkade's success in relation to Western perceptions of visual art: in 2009, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "To his detractors, he represents the triumph of sub-mediocrity and the commercialization and homogenization of painting [...] perhaps no other painter has been as shameless or as successful at transforming himself into a corporation as Kinkade." [...] Among these circles, he is known more today as a [...] "mall artist" [...] or a chocolate box artist than as a merited painter. Rabin went on to collectively describe Kinkade's paintings as [...] "a maudlin, sickeningly sentimental vision of a world where everything is as soothing as a warm <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate with marshmallows on a cold December day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp nodded. Anything--anything! And {{when the}} maid was gone, she thought mechanically: 'A <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> tea! How quaint! What {{should it be}} but hot?' ...|$|E
6000|$|After a {{night of}} it I was wont to return home about dawn, as few fires occur after that. On these {{occasions}} I felt deeply grateful to the keepers of small coffee-stalls, who, wheeling their entire shop and stock-in-trade in a barrow, supplied early workmen with <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee at a halfpenny a piece, and slices of bread and butter for the same modest sum. At such times I came to know that [...] "man wants but little here below," [...] if he only gets it hot and substantial.|$|R
6000|$|The land-steward started--this {{time with}} genuine astonishment. [...] "For me!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Mademoiselle Rose has troubled herself {{to keep a}} <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee <b>hot</b> for me?" [...] The old servant stared; Trudaine stopped and looked back.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} park is the pond and fountain in its southwest corner, known as the [...] "polly." [...] In the early 20th century, it was a popular place for ice skating in the winter, but that has since been prohibited as pollution has made the water less capable of effectively freezing up in the winter. The Polly’s natural stone Shelter House, designed by local architect Gordon Marvel was added in 1934 {{and served as a}} place for visitors to change into skates and enjoy <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate during the cold winter months. It is now the headquarters of the Downing Park Planning Committee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You go {{away and}} have a nice <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> tea,' said the agent, soothingly, 'and you'll be as right as {{anything}} in the morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I move we have {{something}} to eat," [...] said Roger. [...] "A sandwich, a piece of mince-pie, and a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate wouldn't go bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{just about}} used up; and I'm {{going to give}} you a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee. That'll bring you round in a jiffy. It's time for supper. Hey, Sally?" ...|$|E
50|$|The fifth tournament {{was played}} on 9-12 April 1924. Sandy Herd and Abe Mitchell led on 139 with those scoring 144 and less also qualifying. Six players scored 145 {{and with only}} five places for them, they drew lots and Charles Johns was the unlucky player. There was a fall of snow before the {{knock-out}} stage started and although a few matches started, play was soon abandoned for the day. Conditions were little better {{on the following day}} but the two rounds were completed. Conditions were again cold and wet on the final day with the players drinking <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee at the turn. Ted Ray beat Rowland Jones in the final.|$|R
60|$|The knife {{belonged to}} {{the lady in the}} big green house. Every time Cole came by with his Fixit cart the lady had {{something}} to be sharpened. Once in awhile she gave him a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, <b>hot</b> black coffee from an old bent pot. He liked that fine; he enjoyed good coffee.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Mary, no doctoring! a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> {{your good}} <b>hot</b> tea, {{and some of}} our good home living, is what I want. It's a {{tiresome}} business, this legislating!" ...|$|R
60|$|I poured {{myself out}} a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee from the flask which Smith, my man, had filled against my return. It put life into me. The oppression lifted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor lamb!" [...] soothed Mrs. Boutell. [...] "You do look terrible sick. You {{come right}} in {{and lie down}} and I'll have my Lithuanian make you a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> beef-tea." ...|$|E
60|$|We made Mr. Ranson as {{comfortable}} as possible, and, while he was sipping a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee, he asked me about myself, saying that I didn't look much like a sailor.|$|E
60|$|It {{was when}} they turned into this trail that the first {{suspicion}} of where they were bound for flashed through Upton's mind, but he held his peace and settled {{to the task of}} doing his share of the pulling. And this proved to be no easy matter. The trail was but roughly broken out by the passage of lumber sleds, and it soon became necessary for one to steady the load to keep it from capsizing. It was slow, toilsome work, and when at the end of ten miles Pat called a halt for a rest while he made four <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> pea soup by the simple process of melting snow and crumbling into it a roll of erbswurst the others were ready to declare that they had come twenty miles.|$|R
60|$|His {{suggestion}} was carried out. Snap's swim {{had made him}} cold, and he was glad enough to drink two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> steaming <b>hot</b> coffee. The boys had brought some doughnuts along, and these, with the coffee and some fried fish, gave them a very appetizing breakfast. They took their time eating, waiting impatiently for {{the first signs of}} light in the eastern sky.|$|R
5000|$|In Toronto in January 2006, {{a driver}} tossed his lunch {{out the window}} of his car in a traffic jam. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> coffee at the courier, and then, after they {{exchanged}} insults, the driver attacked the woman and her bike.In 2009 in Los Angeles, a 59-year-old man was [...] "charged with two felony counts each of reckless driving causing injury, battery with serious bodily injury and the special allegation of causing great bodily injury". After the man had an argument with two cyclists, he [...] "allegedly stopped short and caused one bike rider to go through the rear window of Dr. Thompson's Infiniti and other rider to crash onto the pavement. The driver, who admitted slamming on his brakes, was later sentenced to 10 years in prison." ...|$|R
