We will consider the cases when T is circle or sphere centered at the origin, Cantor set in R, the boundary of a square centered at the origin, or more generally the k-skeleton (0 < k<n) of an n-dimensional cube centered at the origin or the k-skeleton of a more general polytope of R^n.

50|$|As {{shown in}} the illustration, a {{triangle}} may be covered by three smaller copies of itself, and more generally in any dimension a simplex may be covered by n + 1 <b>copies</b> of itself, <b>scaled</b> {{by a factor of}} n/(n + 1). However, covering a square by smaller squares (with parallel sides to the original) requires four smaller squares, as each one can cover only one of the larger square's four corners. In higher dimensions, covering a hypercube or more generally a parallelepiped by smaller homothetic copies of the same shape requires a separate copy for each of the vertices of the original hypercube or parallelepiped; because these shapes have 2n vertices, 2n smaller copies are necessary. This number is also sufficient: a cube or parallelepiped may be covered by 2n <b>copies,</b> <b>scaled</b> by a factor of 1/2. Hadwiger's conjecture is that parallelepipeds are the worst case for this problem, and that any other convex body may be covered by fewer than 2n smaller copies of itself.|$|R

40|$|A digital paint package {{has been}} {{developed}} which places attention {{on the design of}} personal "brush " patterns. The user generates an image by iterating these pattern modules on the raster display. During the application of a pattern, it can grow, shrink, and change in opacity level under the user's control. This method of digitally creating images was developed in light of the problem of representing visual characteristics effectively while "painting" with a computer graphics system. Allowing the user to design personal brush patterns, which can be stored in a library of patterns, and to make marks by repeating them, expands the potential visual qualities of the image as demonstrated by sample images included in this thesis. Software functions are provided for creating and editing patterns through a menu of selections. These functions treat individual shapes and colors in a pattern as separate entities that can be manipulated. Shapes can be manipulated individually, or as a selected group. The manipulation functions include the following: move, <b>copy,</b> <b>scale,</b> and delete. Software functions are also provided for the editing of color components. One method allows a color's red, green, and blue components to be adjusted. And the other allows its hue, lightness, and saturation levels to be adjusted. by Yuan-Lin Mao. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|Objectives: To study work-related {{physical}} and psychosocial {{risk factors for}} sick leave among patients who have visited their general practitioner for neck or upper extremity complaints. Methods: Three hundred and forty two patients with neck or upper extremity complaints completed self-report questionnaires at baseline and after 3 months. Cox regression models were used to investigate the association between work-related risk factors and sick leave (i. e., lost days from work due to neck or upper extremity complaints in 3 months). Effect modification by sick leave at baseline, sex, worrying and musculoskeletal co-morbidity was evaluated by adding product terms to the regression models. Results: In the subgroup of patients who scored high on the pain <b>copying</b> <b>scale</b> "worrying" the hazard ratio of sick leave was 1. 32 (95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 62) per 10 % increase in heavy physical work. The subgroup of patients who were sitting {{for long periods of}} time had a reduced risk of sick leave as compared to patients who did not spend a lot of time sitting, again only in patients who scored high on the pain coping scale "worrying" (adjusted HR = 0. 17, 95 %-CI 0. 04 - 0. 72). Other work-related risk factors were not significantly related to sick leave. Conclusions: Heavy physical work increased the risk of sick leave and prolonged sitting reduced the risk of sick leave in a subgroup of patients who worried much about their pain. Additional large longitudinal studies of sufficiently large size among employees with neck or upper extremity complaints are needed to confirm our results. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|R
