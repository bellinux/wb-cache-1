5|$|The Gemini-Centaur {{proposal}} was predicted {{to have been}} able to achieve a 72-hour <b>circumlunar</b> flight. The Centaur would have performed trans-lunar injection, before separating from the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, <b>circumlunar</b> and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a <b>circumlunar</b> trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform Lunar orbit insertion. Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a <b>circumlunar</b> trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the upper stage, whilst the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.|$|E
5|$|Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), an {{unmanned}} {{test flight}} of Orion's crew module, was launched on December 5, 2014, atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS {{that would also}} send Orion on a <b>circumlunar</b> trajectory, which is planned for 2019. The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) is to launch in 2022; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit. EM-3 is planned to deliver a crew of 4 to Lunar orbit along with the first module of Deep Space Gateway.|$|E

25|$|For these reasons, Kranz {{chose the}} {{alternative}} <b>circumlunar</b> option, using the Moon's gravity {{to return the}} ship to Earth. Apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission, as required for the lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, {{the first order of}} business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the DPS. The descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon ("PC+2 burn"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the Service Module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort,p.III-20 but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used. The 4-minute, 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed.|$|E
500|$|As the {{director}} of Flight Operations, Kraft was closely involved in planning the broad outlines of the program. He {{was one of the}} first NASA managers to become involved in the decision to send Apollo 8 on a <b>circumlunar</b> flight. Due to problems with lunar module development in 1968, NASA faced the possibility of a full Apollo test mission being delayed until 1969. As a substitute, George Low, the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, came up with the idea of assigning a new mission profile to Apollo 8, one that could be flown without the lunar module. The idea was discussed in early August at a meeting between Low, Kraft, Gilruth and Deke Slayton: ...|$|E
500|$|The Apollo {{program was}} {{conceived}} during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960, as {{a follow-up to}} Project Mercury. While the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three astronauts. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station, <b>circumlunar</b> flights, and eventual manned lunar landings. The program was named after the Greek god of light, music, and the sun by NASA manager Abe Silverstein, who later said that [...] "I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby." [...] Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt [...] "Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program." ...|$|E
500|$|Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock {{travel to}} join Professor Calculus, {{who has been}} {{commissioned}} by the Syldavian government to secretly build a spacecraft that will fly to the Moon. Arriving at the Sprodj Atomic Research Centre, they meet the Centre's managing director, Mr. Baxter, and Calculus' assistant, the engineer Frank Wolff. After witnessing Calculus test out a new multiplex helmet for the planned mission, they are informed of the plan. Haddock is against the idea, but due to his hearing problems, Calculus instead believes he agreed. An unmanned sub-scale prototype of the rocket— the [...] "X-FLR6"— is launched on a <b>circumlunar</b> mission to photograph {{the far side of}} the Moon and test Calculus's nuclear rocket engine. Before the launch, the centre's radar picks up a plane which drops three paratroopers near to the centre. One of the men dies from a malfunctioning parachute; the incident coincides with the arrival of the police detectives Thomson and Thompson, who are initially believed to be the intruders.|$|E
2500|$|George Low, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, {{proposed}} a solution in August 1968. Since the CSM {{would be ready}} {{three months before the}} Lunar Module, they could fly a CSM-only mission in December 1968. But instead of just repeating the C mission that would fly the CSM in Earth orbit, they could send the CSM {{all the way to the}} Moon and maybe even enter into orbit. This mission was dubbed [...] "C-Prime" [...] (an imaginary letter between C and D). This new mission would allow NASA to practice procedures for a lunar flight that would otherwise have to wait until Apollo 10, the F mission. There were also concerns from the Central Intelligence Agency that the Soviet Union was planning their own <b>circumlunar</b> flight for December to upstage the Americans once again (see Zond program). McDivitt's crew—who had grown accustomed to working with LM-3 and preparing for its flight—was kept on the D mission which now became Apollo 9, while Borman's crew would fly the CSM lunar orbit mission on Apollo 8, and the E mission was canceled.|$|E
2500|$|The {{damage to}} the Service Module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz ordered an abort of the mission. The {{existing}} abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the Service Module Propulsion System (SPS) engine to achieve a [...] delta-v.p.III-14 Although a successful SPS firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time (GET) would land the crew one day earlier (at 118 hours GET, or 58 hours later), the large delta-v was possible only if the LM were jettisoned first,p.II-1 and since crew survival depended on the LM's presence during the coast back to Earth, that option was [...] "out of the question."p.III-17 An alternative {{would have been to}} burn the SPS fuel to depletion, then jettison the Service Module and make a second burn with the LM Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine. It was desired to keep the Service Module attached {{for as long as possible}} because of the thermal protection it afforded the Command Module's heat shield. Apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar sphere of gravitational influence (at 61 hours GET), which was the break-even point between direct and <b>circumlunar</b> aborts, and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn.p. B-5 There also was concern about [...] "the structural integrity of the Service Module,"p.III‑23 so mission planners were instructed that the SPS engine would not be used [...] "except as a last-ditch effort."p.III-14 ...|$|E
50|$|Korolev's design bureau {{produced}} two prospectuses for <b>circumlunar</b> spaceflight (March 1962 and May 1963), the main spacecraft for which were early versions of his Soyuz design. Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Command 655-268 officially established two secret, competing crewed programs for <b>circumlunar</b> flights and lunar landings, on August 3, 1964. The <b>circumlunar</b> flights were planned {{to occur in}} 1967, and the landings to start in 1968. The <b>circumlunar</b> program (Zond), created by Vladimir Chelomey's design bureau OKB-52, was to fly two cosmonauts in a stripped-down Soyuz 7K-L1, launched by Chelomey's Proton UR-500 rocket. The Zond sacrificed habitable cabin volume for equipment, by omitting the Soyuz orbital module. Chelomey gained favor with Khruschev by employing members of his family.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} Soyuz {{spacecraft}} {{makes sense}} in many ways; the original Soyuz design of 1962 was specifically intended for <b>circumlunar</b> travel.
