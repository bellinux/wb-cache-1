40|$|Copyright c © 2005 SAE International Diesel fuel {{injection}} process calculations have been per-formed {{by means of}} in-house developed mathematical models. An Eulerian multidimensional code for in-cylinder two-phase flow computations is {{used in conjunction with}} a hydrodynamic one-dimensional model of a fuel injec-tion system. The multidimensional model comprehends all basic processes, which play a role in spray formation. The compressible gaseous flow with transport of species is solved together with the flow of dispersed liquid phase using the Eulerian reference frame for both phases. The two-way coupling between the phases in mass, momen-tum, and energy balances is considered. A detailed de-scription of liquid phase is present, taking into account drop size distribution in terms of the multi-continua ap-proach. The hydrodynamic model capable of simulating common {{fuel injection}} systems is used for the rate-of-injection computations to provide realistic boundary con-ditions to the spray model.

40|$|Common-rail {{technology}} {{is intended to}} improve the pulverization process. Conventional direct injection diesel engines must repeatedly generate fuel pressure for each injection. But in the CRDI engines the pressure is built up independently of the injection sequence and remains permanently available in the fuel line. CRDI system that uses an ion sensor to provide real-time combustion data for each cylinder. The common rail upstream of the cylinders acts as an accumulator, distributing the fuel to the injectors at a constant pressure of up to 1600 bar. Here high-speed solenoid valves, regulated by the electronic engine management, separately control the injection timing {{and the amount of}} fuel injected for each cylinder {{as a function of the}} cylinder's actual need. In other words, pressure generation and fuel injection are independent of each other. This is an important advantage of <b>common-rail</b> <b>injection</b> over conventional fuel injection systems as CRDI increases the controllability of the individual injection processes and further refines fuel atomization, saving fuel and reducing emissions. Fuel economy of 25 to 35 % is obtained over a standard diesel engine and a substantial noise reduction is achieved due to a more synchronized timing operation. The principle of CRDI is also used in petrol engines as dealt with the GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection), which removes to a great extent the draw backs of the conventional carburetors and the MPFI systems...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{high-pressure}} indication of a diesel tractor engine Z 1727, which was fitted with a modern electronically controlled <b>common-rail</b> <b>injection</b> system. The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of the adjustment of the fuel system – start of injection (SOI) timings and the rail pressure (PRAIL) – on the pressure development in the cylinder (PCYL), the heat release (HR) and the combustion noise level (CNLA). Furthermore, the article examines the influence of pilot and post fuel injections on the CNLA. The experiments were conducted at constant speed (1480 rpm) with four PRAILs and different SOI timings. As the results of measurements have shown, higher rail pressure causes higher pressure and a release of a larger amount of heat in the cylinder. These two parameters are the basic prerequisite for higher engine efficiency – higher power output of the engine at lower fuel consumption and decreased production of harmful emissions. Other advantages of the common-rail fuel system include the potential of dividing the main injection dose into the pilot injection and main injection, as well as the potential post injection. The measurements have further demonstrated that including a pilot injection phase significantly contributes to a decrease in combustion noise level as well as a more even, quieter operation of the engine...|$|E
