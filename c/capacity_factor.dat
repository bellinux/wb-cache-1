5|$|Online data is {{available}} for some locations, and the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> can be calculated from the yearly output. For example, the German nationwide average wind power <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> over all of 2012 was just under 17.5% (45,867 GW·h/yr / (29.9 GW × 24 × 366) = 0.1746), and the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> for Scottish wind farms averaged 24% between 2008 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 study {{released}} by the U.S. Department of Energy noted that the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> of new wind installations was increasing as the technology improves, and projected further improvements for future capacity factors. In 2010, the department estimated the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> of new wind turbines in 2010 to be 45%. The annual average <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> for wind generation in the US has varied between 29.8% and 34.0% during the period 2010–2015.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> {{is affected}} by several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's swept area. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E

5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor.</b> Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%.

5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor.</b> Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at {{the upper end of the}} range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.|$|E

5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly. The actual amount of electric power that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor,</b> which varies according to equipment and location.

5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a {{concrete}} gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means less power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower <b>capacity</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its <b>capacity</b> <b>factor</b> can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The wind {{generation}} {{potential in}} the United States far exceeds demand. There are only two states with no commercially significant wind power potential, Mississippi and Florida.
