40|$|A flexible, robust {{method for}} linking grids of locally refined models {{constructed}} with different numerical methods {{is needed to}} address a variety of hydrologic problems. This work outlines and tests a new ghost-node model-linking method for a refined ''child'' model that is contained within a larger and coarser ''parent'' model {{that is based on}} the iterative method of Mehl and Hill (2002, 2004). The method is applicable to steady-state solutions for ground-water flow. Tests are presented for a homogeneous two-dimensional system that has either matching grids (parent <b>cells</b> <b>border</b> an integer number of child cells; Figure 2 a) or non-matching grids (parent <b>cells</b> <b>border</b> a non-integer number of child cells; Figure 2 b). The coupled grids are simulated using the finite-difference and finite-element models MODFLOW and FEHM, respectively. The simulations require no alteration of the MODFLOW or FEHM models and are executed using a batch file on Windows operating systems. Results indicate that when the grids are matched spatially so that nodes and child cell boundaries are aligned, the new coupling technique has error nearly equal to that when coupling two MODFLOW models (Mehl and Hill, 2002). When the grids are non-matching, model accuracy is slightly increased over matching-grid cases. Overall, results indicate that the ghost-node technique is a viable means to accurately couple distinct models because the overall error is less than if only the regional model was used to simulate flow in the child model's domain...|$|E

Its major development coincides with the regression of the gonads that occurs after the natural spawning of gametes. The possible involvement of the genital bud in the initiation of the following year’s gametogenesis is considered. The complete regression of the gonad after spawning suggests an annual neoformation of the gonad preceding the initiation of the gametogenetic cycle. © 1990 Balaban.

40|$|SummaryThe medial {{entorhinal cortex}} (MEC) and the {{adjacent}} parasubiculum {{are known for}} their elaborate spatial discharges (grid <b>cells,</b> <b>border</b> cells, etc.) and the precessing of spikes relative to the local field potential. We know little, however, about how spatio-temporal firing patterns map onto cell types. We find that cell type is a major determinant of spatio-temporal discharge properties. Parasubicular neurons and MEC layer 2 (L 2) pyramids have shorter spikes, discharge spikes in bursts, and are theta-modulated (rhythmic, locking, skipping), but spikes phase-precess only weakly. MEC L 2 stellates and layer 3 (L 3) neurons have longer spikes, do not discharge in bursts, and are weakly theta-modulated (non-rhythmic, weakly locking, rarely skipping), but spikes steeply phase-precess. The similarities between MEC L 3 neurons and MEC L 2 stellates on one hand and parasubicular neurons and MEC L 2 pyramids on the other hand suggest two distinct streams of temporal coding in the parahippocampal cortex...|$|E

However, while place cells have adult-like firing fields from the outset, grid cells have irregular and variable fields until the fourth week, raising doubts about their contribution to place cell firing at young age. Recording in MEC of juvenile rats, we show that, unlike grid <b>cells,</b> <b>border</b> cells express adult-like firing fields from the first days of exposure to an open environment, at postnatal days 16 – 18. Thus, spatial signals from border cells may be sufficient to maintain spatially localized firing in juvenile hippocampal place cells...|$|E

40|$|Cells {{display a}} large variety of shapes when plated in {{classical}} culture conditions despite their {{belonging to a}} common cell type. These shapes are transitory, since cells permanently disassemble and reassemble their cytoskeleton while moving. Adhesive micropatterns are commonly used to confine cell shape within a given geometry. In addition the micropattern can be designed so as to impose cells to spread upon adhesive and nonadhesive areas. Modulation of the pattern geometry allows {{the analysis of the}} mechanisms governing the determination of cell shape in response to external adhesive conditions. In this study, we show that the acquisi-tion of cell shape follows two stages where initially the cell forms contact with the micropattern. Here, the most distal contacts made by the cell with the micropattern define the apices of the cell shape. Then secondly, the <b>cell</b> <b>borders</b> that link two apices move so as to minimise the distance between the two apices. In these <b>cell</b> <b>borders,</b> the absence of an underlying adhesive substrate is overcome by stress fibres forming between the apices, which in turn are marked by an accumulation of focal adhesions. By inhibiting myosin function, <b>cell</b> <b>borders</b> on nonadhesive zones become more concave, suggesting that the stress fibres work against the membrane tension in the <b>cell</b> <b>border.</b> Moreover, this suggested that traction forces are unevenly distributed in stationary, nonmigrating, cells.

40|$|International audiencePath {{integration}} is a navigation strategy that requires animals to integrate self-movements during exploration {{to determine their}} position in space. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) has been suggested to play {{a pivotal role in}} this process. Grid cells, head-direction <b>cells,</b> <b>border</b> cells as well as speed cells within the MEC collectively provide a dynamic representation of the animal position in space based on the integration of self-movements. All these cells are strongly modulated by theta oscillations, thus suggesting that theta rhythmicity in the MEC may be essential for integrating and coordinating selfmovement information during navigation. In this study, we first show that excitotoxic MEC lesions, but not dorsal hippocampal lesions, impair the ability of rats to estimate linear distances based on self-movement information. Next, we report similar deficits following medial septum inactivation, which strongly impairs theta oscillations in the entorhinal–hippocampal circuits. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a major role of the MEC and MS in estimating distances to be traveled, and point to theta oscillations within the MEC as a neural mechanism responsible for the integration of information generated by linear self-displacement...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} space circuit {{is known}} to contain several functionally specialized cell types, such as place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells, head-direction cells and border cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). The interaction between the entorhinal and hippocampal spatial representations is poorly understood, however. We have developed an optogenetic strategy to identify functionally defined cell types in the MEC that project directly to the hippocampus. By expressing channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) selectively in the hippocampus-projecting subset of entorhinal projection neurons, {{we were able to}} use light-evoked discharge as an instrument to determine whether specific entorhinal cell groups-such as grid <b>cells,</b> <b>border</b> cells and head-direction cells-have direct hippocampal projections. Photoinduced firing was observed at fixed minimal latencies in all functional cell categories, with grid cells as the most abundant hippocampusprojecting spatial cell type. We discuss how photoexcitation experiments can be used to distinguish the subset of hippocampus-projecting entorhinal neurons from neurons that are activated indirectly through the network.

One of them target the hippocampus while the other prosjects extrahippocampally. It has been shown that all funtional MEC cell types prosject to the hippocampus, and a large part of these cells were grid cells. Based on these observations we wanted to investigate if there is a firrerence in fruntional cell distribution of MEC cells projecting to the contralateral MEC and cells prosjecting to hippocampus. Retrogradely transportable recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing Flag-tagged channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2), was injected in left MEC of 6 rats. This introduced optogenetic control over MEC neurons with direct årosjection to the contralateral MEC. Combining optogenetic and electrophysiological in vivo recordings, allowed identification of functional cell types with direct prosjection to the contralateral MEC, as these cells showed minimal response latencies to laser stimulations in the medial entorhinal cortex. We found border cells, head direction cells, non-spatial cells and interneurons with direct projection to the MEC, but no grid cells. This distrubution is in contrasts with the one found to project to the hippocampus, where grid cells are the predominant spatial cell type.

40|$|To run a 3 D spherical {{simulation}} with {{a reasonable}} resolution {{in an appropriate}} time, the code must work {{with more than one}} CPU in parallel. Typically a domain decomposition of the grid is applied, which is responsible for an optimal breakdown of the grid into p equal volumes, where p specifies the amount of domains and processors. An efficient domain decomposition minimizes the area between those sections, leading to a minimized overhead of data exchange between the processors. The resulting speedup of this method with the newly developed GAIA mantle convection code is presented in Figure 1 (right). Halo-cells, or sometimes called ghost-cells, arise in domain decomposition as additional cells in each domain to build an overlapping zone where data is exchanged. These <b>cells</b> <b>border</b> each domain and are on the same position as their active cells on the neighboring domain. The ratio between the amount of halo-cells to grid cells is a first measure of efficiency for parallelization because it determines the amount of data transported from one domain to another. One approach to decompose a sphere laterally is to distribute p points on the surface of a sphere so that the global potential energy becomes minimal. This is known as the Thomsom problem [Thomson, 1904]. After this step the domain affiliation for every cell is derived by its closest "Thomson" point. The resulting decomposition as shown in figure 1 leads to equal volumes which is important to balance the computational efforts for each CPU.

Furthermore, hippocampal functions in connection with neural circuits in medial entorhinal cortex offer a good systems approach to understanding the basic functions of episodic memory formation. Then, we draw our attentions to the connections complexity between both medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) hemispheres to investigate the pattern of connectivity of MEC-MEC functional cell type neurons, furthermore, providing further data associated with spatial memory formation for future research. There are several functional spatial cell types in superficial layer 2 of MEC that code various spatially information in navigational system. These cells including; grid cells, head-direction <b>cells,</b> <b>border</b> cells, conjunctive grid x head-direction cells, conjunctive border x head-direction cells, unknown principal cells and interneurons. By injecting retrogradely transportable recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying channelrhodopsin- 2 transgene in the left MEC of two rats and also right MEC of three rats, optogenetic control over entorhinal neurons with direct projections to the contralateral MEC has been presented. Optogenetics application together with electrophysiological recordings in vivo, enabled us to determine functionally specialized spatial cell types in MEC projecting to the contralateral MEC, as these cells contained minimal response latencies to laser stimulations in MEC.

40|$|Animals {{are capable}} of {{navigating}} through an environment. This requires them to recognise, remember and relate positions. Spatial representation {{is one of the}} main tasks during navigation. The brain seems to have a world centric positioning system such that we remember positions of objects in relation to a reference frame. Such spatial representation is believed to have been constructed in the hippocampus and related brain areas. Place cells, head direction cells, grid cells and border cells seem to transform vestibular information to spatial information in the brain. However, when psychological studies reveal how these areas are connected together, the process of transforming vestibular information to the kind of representation seen in place cells is still in question. In this thesis, we develop a hypothetical model, consisting of head direction cells, grid cells, sensory <b>cells,</b> <b>border</b> cells, place cells and connections between each. Our aim here is to create a biologically feasible spatial representation of the environment with activity patterns of neurons in the model similar to firing patterns of place cells in the hippocampus. With this model, we simulate a subset of the components in order to develop a spatial representation. This subset consists of a single dimension head direction representation, periodic two dimension grid cells representation, and finally a monotonic two dimension place cell representation. We offer two approaches for connections between grid cells and place cells, hardwired and learnt connections. The hardwiring approach provides us an understanding of how grid cell firing can be transformed into place cell representation. The learning approach illustrates a biologically plausible method in the development of spatial representation. Our results show that it is possible to achieve spatial representation by use of Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) learning method which has a dynamic threshold. To further evaluate our model and determine its practical application we embed it in a mobile robot. A robotic implementation provides an opportunity for us to evaluate the model under the presence of noise both in the internal information and from the environment. Although our robotic experiments are limited, they demonstrate that our model provides a fundamental biologically plausible infrastructure for robotic navigation...|$|E
40|$|Cadherins are {{involved}} in a variety of morphogenetic movements during animal development. However, it has been difficult to pinpoint the precise function of cadherins in morphogenetic processes due to the multifunctional nature of cadherin requirement. The data presented here indicate that homophilic adhesion promoted by Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin) mediates two cell migration events during Drosophila oogenesis. In Drosophila follicles, two groups of follicle <b>cells,</b> the <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> and the centripetal cells migrate on the surface of germline cells. We show that the <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> migrate as an epithelial patch in which two centrally located cells retain epithelial polarity and peripheral cells are partially depolarized. Both follicle cells and germline cells express DE-cadherin, and <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> and centripetal cells strongly upregulate the expression of DE-cadherin shortly before and during their migration. Removing DE-cadherin from either the follicle cells or the germline cells blocks migration of <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> and centripetal cells on the surface of germline cells. The function of DE-cadherin in <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> appears to be specific for migration as the formation of the <b>border</b> <b>cell</b> cluster and the adhesion between <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> are not disrupted in the absence of DE-cadherin. The speed of migration depends on the level of DE-cadherin expression, as <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> migrate more slowly when DE-cadherin activity is reduced.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Cambial {{activity}} in white spruce stems in Alaska was observed from April, 1964 to September, 1965 in over 300 samples taken from 50 - to 60 -year-old natural stands. Mitotic index {{was used as}} a measure of the rate of periclinal division of fusiform cells in the cambial zone. Anticlinal divisions are relatively rare, occurring only about once per 278 periclinal divisions in most stems. Mitotic index, at any given time, is quite uniform throughout the cambial zone of an internode, among internodes of the same tree, and even among trees of a stand growing at markedly different rates. There may be some difference in rate of division across the radial extent of the cambial zone [...] During dormancy, the radial number of fusiform cells in the cambial zone (NCZ) ranges from two to about eight, the number being related to annual growth rate of xylem and phloem. Two to three overwintering immature (precocious) sieve <b>cells</b> <b>border</b> the cambial zone in each radial file of cells. They are the last phloem derivatives of the previous year's cambial activity. They undergo rapid radial enlargement just prior to vernal reactivation of mitosis in the cambial zone, and they become the first new conducting phloem elements of the current year. There are three distinct growing season periods: early period, grand period, and late period. Beginning of early period cambial activity is marked by reactivation of periclinal divisions, first near the apex, then at successively lower stem levels. Each cambial zone fusiform initial divides once before any new xylem or phloem derivatives are produced, thus approximately doubling the NCZ. Mitotic activity varies considerably during the early period, and the time required to double the NCZ varies from year to year depending upon weather conditions. Production of the first new xylem and phloem derivatives marks the beginning of the grand period. Rate of cell production in the cambial zone remains about equal to derivative production for the next 45 to 50 days, when about 80 percent of annual xylem and phloem increment is produced. Rate of division is comparatively uniform in all internodes in all trees. Rate of derivative production is, therefore, dependent on NCZ. There is a rather abrupt drop in NCZ {{at the beginning of the}} late period, apparently due to lengthening of the cell division cycle. Rate of derivative production exceeds rate of cambial zone cell production, and NCZ soon drops to about the dormant level. Subsequently, within about ten days, derivative production slows, the zone of developing tracheids begins to narrow, and radial enlargement of developing tracheids and sieve cells declines. In about two more weeks the zone of developing tracheids is almost eliminated, the most recently produced tracheids show little or no radial and there is evidence of partial inception of dormancy in the cambial zone. Complete termination of cambial activity is gradual, extending through late August and, perhaps, into September...|$|E
40|$|SummaryCollective cell {{movement}} is {{a mechanism for}} invasion identified in many developmental events. Examples include the movement of lateral-line neurons in Zebrafish, cells in the inner blastocyst, and metastasis of epithelial tumors [1]. One key model to study collective migration is the movement of <b>border</b> <b>cell</b> clusters in Drosophila. Drosophila egg chambers contain 15 nurse cells and a single oocyte surrounded by somatic follicle cells. At their anterior end, polar cells recruit several neighboring follicle cells to form the <b>border</b> <b>cell</b> cluster [2]. By stage 9, and over 6 hr, <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> migrate as a cohort between nurse cells toward the oocyte. The specification and directionality of <b>border</b> <b>cell</b> movement are regulated by hormonal and signaling mechanisms [3]. However, how <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> are held together while they migrate is not known. Here, we show that a negative-feedback loop controlling JNK activity regulates <b>border</b> <b>cell</b> cluster integrity. JNK signaling modulates contacts between <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> and between <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> and substratum to sustain collective migration by regulating several effectors including the polarity factor Bazooka and the cytoskeletal adaptor D-Paxillin.

To control the production of <b>border</b> <b>cells,</b> subsequent studies measured the impact of a transient exposure of root tips to different metabolites secreted by root caps and <b>border</b> <b>cells.</b> Exposure to specific metabolites altered the production of <b>border</b> <b>cells</b> without measurable effects on root growth and development. This is in contrast to results obtained with altered gene expression. For example, gene silencing of a <b>border</b> <b>cell</b> specific gene resulted in altered root growth...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} three-dimensional (3 -D) cytomorphology and {{its relationship}} with clinical stage in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). STUDY DESIGN: FNAB was performed in tumors from 34 patients with PTC. The aspirate was stained and observed under a light microscope (LM). The aspirate was also fixed, dehydrated, critical point dried, spattered with gold ions and observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Findings under SEM were correlated with the presentation under LM and also with clinical stage. As a control, FNAB was also performed on {{a normal part of}} the thyroid in six patients. RESULTS: Under SEM, normal thyroid cells appeared as round, scattered cells or sheets with a uniform honeycomb cellular arrangement. In PTC, cell sheets with uniform nuclear morphology under LM usually showed a uniform cell arrangement and with distinct <b>cell</b> <b>borders</b> under SEM. <b>Cell</b> sheets with nuclear pleomorphism under LM usually showed a more-disorganized arrangement and with indistinct <b>cell</b> <b>borders</b> under SEM. PTC at advanced clinical stages usually presented with a disorganized cell arrangement, indistinct <b>cell</b> <b>borders</b> and loss of microvilli. CONCLUSION: 3 -D cytomorphology in FNAB of PTC was related to clinical stage and might be a prognostic factor for PTC...|$|R
