40|$|Titanium carbide (TiC) coating were {{synthesized}} on Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> by a {{molten salt}} method using the molten salt mixture composed of LiCl, KCl and KF {{as a reaction}} medium. The surface morphology, tensile strength and oxidation resistance of the uncoated and TiC-coated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> were investigated. The wettability of these fibers by molten magnesium (Mg) and aluminum (Al) was also examined. TiC coatings obtained have a thickness of approximately 0. 05 - 0. 6. μm and {{are found to be}} uniform and adherent to the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers.</b> After being coated with a uniform and continuous TiC layer, the tensile strength of the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> decreases and their oxidation resistance is improved significantly. An increase in the TiC coating thickness leads to the reduction in the tensile strength of the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> and the improvement of their oxidation resistance. The oxidation activation energy of the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> increases from 127 to 170. kJ/mol after being coated with a 124. nm thick layer of TiC. Coating of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> with TiC also induces an increase in the total surface free energy of the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers,</b> and as a result the wettability of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> with molten Mg and Al is improved remarkably. TiC coating is found to be stable at 1000. °C in molten Mg. However it is readily decomposed by the molten Al at high temperature, which brings about <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> being attacked by the molten Al and the consequent severe damage of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mesophase}} pitch forms a thermotropic crystal, {{which allows}} the pitch to become organized and form linear chains {{without the use of}} tension. Mesophase pitch is made by polymerizing isotropic pitch to a higher molecular weight. The melting point for the mesophase pitch is roughly 300 °C. An advantage in the production of Pitch <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> over PAN <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> is that Pitch <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> do not require constant tension on the fibers at all processing stages. Pitch based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> {{have been found to be}} more sheet-like in their crystal structure, as opposed to PAN based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers,</b> which are more granular.|$|R

In this paper, a bio-inspired artificial muscle actuator with artificial tendons is developed for robotic arm applications. The actuator uses dielectric elastomer as artificial muscle and functionalized <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> as artificial tendons. A VHB 4910 tape is used as the dielectric elastomer and PDMS is used as the bonding material to mechanically connect the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> to the elastomer. <b>Carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> are highly popular for their high electrical conductivities, mechanical strengths, and bio-compatibilities. After the acid treatments for the functionalization of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> (500 nm - 10 pm), one end of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> is spread into the PDMS material, which provides enough bonding strength with other dielectric elastomers, while the other end is connected to a DC power supply. To characterize the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and electrical conductivity of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers,</b> a diaphragm actuator is fabricated, where the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> {{are connected to the}} actuator. To test the mechanical bonding between PDMS and <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers,</b> specimens of PDMS bonded with <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> are fabricated. Experiments have been conducted to verify the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and mechanical bonding of PDMS with <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers.</b> The energy efficiency of the dielectric elastomer increases as the load increases, which can reach above 50 %. The mechanical bonding is strong enough for robotic arm applications...|$|R

The <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> before and after treatment were examined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The friction and wear behaviors of PI composites sliding against GCr 15 steel rings were evaluated on an M- 2000 model ring-on-block test rig, which revealed that small incorporation of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> can decrease the friction coefficient and improve the wear resistance of PI composites, and that the reinforcement effect of treated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> was better {{than that of the}} untreated ones. It was found that the optimum content of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> is 15 wt% when a thin and continuous transfer film was formed on the counterpart surface during the friction process. With further increasing content of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers,</b> the friction coefficient increased and the wear resistance reduced owing to the drop out of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> from PI matrix. Besides, the friction coefficient of the PI composites decreased and the wear resistance improved with increasing load, while for the pure PI, its wear resistance decreased drastically owing to the micro-melting and mechanical deterioration caused by friction heat under a higher load...|$|R

5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking.

Symmetric capacitors were made of activated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> and N-doped activated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> and tested in a two-electrode cell configuration, using triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/propylene carbonate (TEMA-BF 4 /PC) as electrolyte. The effect of nitrogen species in the degradation or stabilization of the capacitor has been analyzed through floating durability tests using a high voltage charging (3. 2 V). The results show higher stabilizing effect in carbonized samples (N-ACF) than in non-carbonized samples and pristine activated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers,</b> which is attributed to the presence of aromatic nitrogen group, especially positively charged N-functional groups.

5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber.</b> Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
