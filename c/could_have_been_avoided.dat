5|$|In a June 2006 {{report on}} the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{admitted}} that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to {{the damage done to}} New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 concluded that two-thirds of the flooding in the city <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if the levees had held.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many competent Indian agents were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like Thomas Forsyth, John Marsh, and Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified men such as Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk War <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of {{the total amount of}} food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E

5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided.</b> The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated {{the impact of the}} illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E
5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E

60|$|Of {{course it}} was a disgraceful spectacle; but it <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided,</b> so far as I was concerned, and I did my best, {{fighting}} as vigorously as if I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the one to urge upon my companions the necessity of joining the fleet.|$|R
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E

25|$|Later, it {{was seen}} as a glorious last stand by the paratroopers, {{confirming}} the VDV's reputation {{in the same way that}} the Battle of Camarón did for the French Foreign Legion, and the events have been quickly enshrined in heroic myth.

50|$|In June 1863 an engineer, Charles Bartholomew, {{was asked}} {{to go over the}} line and advise on what should be done to make {{possible}} an early opening.

25|$|The loss of both Loch Vennachar and Loch Sloy {{convinced}} the Marine Board of South Australia {{to argue for}} the bringing forward of a plan that it recommended in 1902 to build a lighthouse at Cape du Couedic.

Construction commenced in 1907 and the light was officially lit on 27 June 1909.|$|E

The CAB {{concluded that}} there were no factors present that would compel the crew to land immediately despite the sloppy approach, such as rapidly deteriorating weather or a shortage of fuel.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{argue that}} prisons {{have become the}} {{facilities}} for the mentally ill, very few crimes point directly to symptoms of mental illness as their sole cause. Despite the disproportionate representation of mentally ill persons in prison, a study by American Psychological Association indicates that only 7.5 percent of crimes committed {{were found to be}} directly related to mental illness. However, some advocates argue that many incarcerations of mentally ill persons <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if they had been given proper treatment, which would be a much less costly alternative to incarceration.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} Wallentin-Hermann v Alitalia—Linee Aeree Italiane SpA (Case C-549/07) of 22 December 2008, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled on the {{interpretation}} of Article 5 of the regulation relating to cancellations, specifically paragraph 3 which states: An operating air carrier shall not be obliged to pay compensation in accordance with Article 7, if it can prove that the cancellation is caused by extraordinary circumstances which <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> even if all reasonable measures <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of {{radioactivity}} became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them (which caused some ingestion of radium salts). Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries to dial painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls <b>could</b> easily <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, a bitter split {{took place in}} the Socialist Party {{regarding}} support for the war; Thomas reluctantly supported the war, although he thought it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> honorably <b>avoided.</b> [...] His brother and many others continued their pacifist opposition to all wars. Later he wrote self-critically for having [...] "overemphasized both the sense in which it was a continuance of World War I and the capacity of nonfascist Europe to resist the Nazis".|$|R
25|$|In April 2006 {{a hundred}} and {{thirteen}} people were injured in a four-bus pile-up north of Pretoria. The accident happened at the PUTCO depot where three buses had stopped when a fourth hit a bus from behind, causing each one to ram the vehicle in front of it. The provincial minister said to the press that both accidents <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if the drivers followed {{the rules of the}} road and the buses were in a roadworthy condition. The Mpumalanga Roads and Transport Department met staff from PUTCO to discuss the condition of some of the company's buses.|$|E
25|$|An electoral survey {{published}} on 15 September 2005 {{by the national}} left newspaper La Repubblica claimed that, with the initial proposal of electoral reform become law, the House of Freedoms would win the next elections 340-290, even if they won only 45% of votes and the opposition coalition The Union won 50%, because The Union also includes several small parties with less than 4% of national votes. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> if the small opposition parties ran on a common ticket. Aim of this bill of reform was {{to reduce the number}} of parties, and particularly the moderate centre-left would have taken advantage in respect to the smaller radical left parties.|$|E
25|$|Malthus wrote two books, An {{essay on}} the {{principle}} of population (published in 1798) and Principles of political economy (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists. However, is first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production, because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided</b> through self-restraint.|$|E
50|$|Tchaikovsky <b>had</b> rarely <b>been</b> {{attracted}} to the variation form before, except for an eloquent piece for piano solo in F major, Op. 19, No. 6.

In a traditional concerto format, structural complexities and dramatic issues that would have clashed with the 18th-century detachment and finesse <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>avoided.</b> A neater and easier solution was, in each variation, to retain the melodic outlines and harmonic support outlined in his initial theme.|$|R
