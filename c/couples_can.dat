25|$|In August 1990, Power Partners: How Two-Career <b>Couples</b> <b>Can</b> Play to Win, {{written by}} Cuozzo's wife Jane, was published. As both Cuozzo {{and his wife}} had careers as writers, the book focused on how dual-career <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> enhance their {{relationships}} by promoting each other's careers. The book played on tennis analogies and suggested that couples behave as coordinated doubles teams—for instance, providing their spouses' business card at opportune times to help them acquire new clients or accounts. About two years later, in November 1992, Cuozzo's father-in-law Solomon G. Hershey died.|$|E

25|$|On 14 June 2016, activists {{opposed to}} {{same-sex}} marriage filed an injunction against the legislation approved by Congress.

25|$|De facto {{relationships}} often face an onerous {{burden of}} proof before rights that are automatically granted to married <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> be accessed. This means partners may have to provide evidence about their living and childcare arrangements, sexual relationship, finances, ownership of property, commitment to a shared life and how they present as a couple in public. This can present difficulties when de facto relationships are legally contested by other people, usually other family members. Marriages rarely encounter such difficulties as they are generally regarded as immediate and incontrovertible.|$|E

25|$|In many jurisdictions where {{same-sex}} <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> access {{civil unions}} or registered partnerships, these are often intended as parallel institutions {{to that of}} heterosexual monogamous marriage. Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, {{as in the case}} of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with more than one person. Both are banned under Sections 205–206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages. As yet, there is no case law applicable to these issues.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{recognition}} of same-sex unions in Australia takes {{a variety of}} forms depending on the jurisdiction. Under Australian federal law, same-sex <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> be recognised as de facto relationships, but have no access to marriage, civil unions or other federal relationship registration. Australian states and territories are entitled to create their own laws with respect to same-sex relationship registers and same-sex partnership schemes, with most offering civil unions or other forms of domestic partnership to same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are prevented from marrying by amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, passed in 2004 by the Howard Government and Mark Latham-led Australian Labor Party. Additionally, same-sex couples who are married in countries where same-sex marriage is legal cannot divorce within Australia when they come back due to the same-sex marriage ban.|$|E
25|$|In England, senior Church {{appointments}} are Crown appointments; the Church {{carries out}} state {{functions such as}} coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the House of Lords, where they are known as the Lords Spiritual {{as opposed to the}} lay Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and euthanasia (where their views differ from the majority of the population). A of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> have a civil wedding with no religious elements, but non-religious humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Scotland (or Kirk) is {{the largest}} {{religious}} denomination in Scotland, however, unlike the Church of England it is Presbyterian and (since 1921) not {{a branch of the}} state, with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a national church to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The blasphemy law has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> have a civil wedding with no religious elements, and humanist weddings have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017.

25|$|Same-sex couples {{may enter}} into civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory and civil {{partnerships}} in Queensland. Both unions allow couples to have state-sanctioned ceremonies and Queensland's law is {{commonly referred to}} as civil unions. In New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, same-sex <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> enter into domestic registered partnerships/relationships. These provide conclusive proof of the existence of the relationship, thereby gaining the same rights afforded to de facto couples under state and federal law without having to prove any further factual evidence of the relationship. In this way, a registered relationship is similar to a registered partnership or civil union {{in other parts of the}} world. Victoria and Tasmania's domestic partnership laws also allow any couple the option of having an official ceremony when registering their relationship. South Australia's law allowing registered relationships and recognised overseas and interstate same-sex unions went into effect on 1 August, 2017. In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, same-sex couples must often seek juridical approval to prove a de facto relationship exists. Norfolk Island from 1 July 2016, have been incorporated into NSW legislation, under both the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015 and the Territories Legislation Amendment Act 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{proponents of}} {{same-sex}} marriage argue that laws limiting civil marriage to opposite-sex couples are underinclusive {{because they do}} not prohibit marriages between sterile opposite-sex couples or to women past menopause; therefore, they take the view that the procreation argument cannot reasonably be used against same-sex marriages. Proponents also consider these laws restricting marriage to be unconstitutionally overinclusive, as gay and lesbian <b>couples</b> <b>can</b> have children either through natural or artificial means or by adoption.
