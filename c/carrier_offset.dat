40|$|Two-way amplify-and-forward {{relaying}} with <b>carrier</b> <b>offsets</b> in {{the absence}} of CSI: differential modulation-based schemes Wu Zhuo*†, Li Guangxiang* † and Wang Tao*† In this paper, differential modulation (DM) schemes, including single differential and double differential, are proposed for amplify-and-forward two-way relaying (TWR) networks with unknown channel state information (CSI) and <b>carrier</b> frequency <b>offsets</b> caused by wireless terminals in high-speed vehicles and trains. Most existing work in TWR assumes perfect channel knowledge at all nodes and no <b>carrier</b> <b>offsets.</b> However, accurate CSI can be difficult to obtain for fast varying channels, while increases computational complexity in channel estimation and commonly existing <b>carrier</b> <b>offsets</b> can greatly degrade the system performance. Therefore, we propose the two schemes to remove the effect of unknown frequency offsets for TWR networks, when neither the sources nor the relay has any knowledge of CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed differential modulation schemes are both effective in overcoming the impact of <b>carrier</b> <b>offsets</b> with linear computational complexity in the presence of high mobility...|$|R

We derive the Weighted Bayesian Cramér Rao Bound (WBCRB) for joint timing and <b>carrier</b> <b>offset</b> estimation, which takes into account the prior distribution of the estimation parameters and is an accurate lower bound for all considered Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values. Simulation results are presented to corroborate that the Mean Square Error (MSE) performance of the proposed algorithm is close to optimal at higher SNR values (above 20 dB). In addition, the bit error rate performance approaches that of the perfectly synchronized case for small unknown carrier offsets and any unknown timing offset. The advantage of our particle filter algorithm, compared to existing techniques, is that it can work for the full range acquisition of carrier offsets.
