25|$|An {{emergency}} department (ED), {{also known as}} an accident & {{emergency department}} (A), emergency room (ER), emergency ward (EW) or <b>casualty</b> <b>department,</b> is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine, the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance. The emergency department is usually found in a hospital or other primary care center.|$|E
60|$|In {{due course}} Philip {{was put on}} {{accident}} duty. The dressers took this in turn; it lasted three days, during which they lived in hospital and ate their meals in the common-room; they had a room {{on the ground floor}} near the casualty ward, with a bed that shut up during the day into a cupboard. The dresser on duty had to be at hand day and night to see to any casualty that came in. You were on the move all the time, and not more than an hour or two passed during the night without the clanging of the bell just above your head which made you leap out of bed instinctively. Saturday night was of course the busiest time and the closing of the public-houses the busiest hour. Men would be brought in by the police dead drunk and it would be necessary to administer a stomach-pump; women, rather the worse for liquor themselves, would come in with a wound on the head or a bleeding nose which their husbands had given them: some would vow to have the law on him, and others, ashamed, would declare that it had been an accident. What the dresser could manage himself he did, but if there was anything important he sent for the house-surgeon: he did this with care, since the house-surgeon was not vastly pleased to be dragged down five flights of stairs for nothing. The cases ranged from a cut finger to a cut throat. Boys came in with hands mangled by some machine, men were brought who had been knocked down by a cab, and children who had broken a limb while playing: now and then attempted suicides were carried in by the police: Philip saw a ghastly, wild-eyed man with a great gash from ear to ear, and he was in the ward for weeks afterwards in charge of a constable, silent, angry because he was alive, and sullen; he made no secret {{of the fact that he}} would try again to kill himself as soon as he was released. The wards were crowded, and the house-surgeon was faced with a dilemma when patients were brought in by the police: if they were sent on to the station and died there disagreeable things were said in the papers; and it was very difficult sometimes to tell if a man was dying or drunk. Philip did not go to bed till he was tired out, so that he should not have the bother of getting up again in an hour; and he sat in the casualty ward talking in the intervals of work with the night-nurse. She was a gray-haired woman of masculine appearance, who had been night-nurse in the <b>casualty</b> <b>department</b> for twenty years. She liked the work because she was her own mistress and had no sister to bother her. Her movements were slow, but she was immensely capable and she never failed in an emergency. The dressers, often inexperienced or nervous, found her a tower of strength. She had seen thousands of them, and they made no impression upon her: she always called them Mr. Brown; and when they expostulated and told her their real names, she merely nodded and went on calling them Mr. Brown. It interested Philip to sit with her in the bare room, with its two horse-hair couches and the flaring gas, and listen to her. She had long ceased to look upon the people who came in as human beings; they were drunks, or broken arms, or cut throats. She took the vice and misery and cruelty of the world as a matter of course; she found nothing to praise or blame in human actions: she accepted. She had a certain grim humour.|$|E

40|$|Drug {{problems}} {{dealt with}} by 62 London csualty departments: a preliminary report. A study of the whole spectrum of drug incidents dealt with in one month by 62 <b>casualty</b> <b>departments</b> in the Greater London area {{was carried out in}} the summer of 1975. Apart from demonstrating the large number of such incidents, this preliminary report presents an analysis of the drugs responsible for these episodes, basic demographic characteristics of the drug users, and an estimate of the contribution of drug dependence. Much of the research on drug problems has been focused on only one of four interrelated issues: the illegal use of drugs (Bewley, 1966; Mitcheson et al., 1970), suicide and suicide attempts in which drugs are the agent (Evans, 1967; Aitken, Buglass, and Kreitman, 1969; Smith and Davison, 1971), the symptoms and effects of physical dependence (Jaffe, 1970), or episodes and outcome of acute drug intoxication (Morgan et al., 1975). In addition, many of these studies concentrated on one particular setting or institution. This paper, by contrast, illustrates the whole range of drug problems {{dealt with by}} 62 London <b>casualty</b> <b>departments.</b> The non-medical use of drugs, particularly those with psychotropic properties, has increased rapidly during the past 25 years (Smith and Davison, 1971...|$|R

40|$|Data were {{collected}} prospectively on 2868 consecutive patients admitted for self poisoning between 1971 and 1982.

This increase, however, did not appear to affect the severity of overdoses or the outcome.
