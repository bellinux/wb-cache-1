5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} {{yellow-brown}} spore print. Spores are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8.4–10.5 by 4.2–4.9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube walls (as pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They are somewhat spindle-shaped, sometimes with a central swelling, and measure 45–70 by 7–12μm.

5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas complement each other in their different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and passages from one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm. Clamp <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> present in the hyphae.|$|E
30|$|Structural {{connectivity}} results (i.e., fiber density values) for {{the three}} groups are reported in Table  2, which shows the {{mean and standard deviation}} (SD) for the fiber density values of 16 <b>connections.</b> The values <b>were</b> computed from both hemispheres. Overall, nine <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> significantly different between PD and NC. Of these <b>connections,</b> seven <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in PD compared with NC and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in NC compared with PD (p <  0.05, corrected).

Nine connections showed significant differences between PD and SWEDD. Among these <b>connections,</b> seven <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in PD and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex-thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and pallidum–thalamus connections. SWEDD patients showed significant differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and SN–thalamus connections. PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with SWEDD in associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen, pallidum–thalamus and putamen–thalamus connections.

30|$|The pallidum–putamen and {{sensorimotor}} cortex–putamen <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> {{significantly correlated}} with clinical scores, while associative cortex–thalamus <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> not correlated with clinical scores. The pallidum–putamen <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> reported as a key pathway for motor control within the CBGT circuit (Obeso et al. 2000). The sensorimotor cortex–putamen <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> related to motor control via glutamatergic projections in the cortico-striatal pathway. Pallidum–putamen and sensorimotor cortex–putamen <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> correlated with MDS-UPDRS scores, which might corroborate the existing research. The associative cortex–thalamus <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> reported as playing a secondary role in processing motor information and thus, might be less linked to MDS-UPDRS scores {{than the other two}} connections (Purves et al. 2008). Thus, we believe that pallidum–putamen and sensorimotor cortex–putamen connections might form a structural connectivity profile unique to SWEDD that could be a potential imaging biomarker for future movement disorder research.|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} is ochre or clay coloured, the {{elongated}} elliptical spores measuring 7–10 by 3–3.5μm. Basidia (spore-producing cells) are four spored, with dimensions of 14–18 by 4–5μm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube faces (pleurocystidia) and edges (cheilocystidia), either scattered or, more rarely, as bundles. They measure 20–35 by 5–7μm and have a narrow club shape.

5|$|The spores are elliptical, {{wrinkled}} {{or slightly}} warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5μm. They are nonamyloid, meaning {{they have a}} negative color reaction with the iodine in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing structures, the basidia, are elongated or club-shaped, hyaline (glassy or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5μm.

5|$|Collected in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the spores of T.plumbeoviolaceus {{appear to be}} a light pink to flesh color. When viewed with a light microscope, they are elliptical, with smooth walls and {{dimensions}} of 9.1–12.3 by 3.4–4.5µm. The basidia (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5µm. The cuticle of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in potassium hydroxide, the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in Melzer's reagent causes the pigment to form globules. Cystidia are common in the hymenial tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow at the apex (lageniform), measuring 30–40µm long by 7–9µm thick. Clamp <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> absent in the hyphae.|$|E

Both cheliocystidia and pleurocystidia are {{absent from the}} hymenium; the gill edge is populated by basidia and their undeveloped equivalents, basidioles. The cap cuticle comprises a distinctive layer of 3–8μm-wide hyphae that form a layer usually 110–125μm thick; this layer is less distinct or thinner in old or poorly preserved specimens.
