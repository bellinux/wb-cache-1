Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the <b>coalition</b> <b>agreement</b> was still being completed and signed.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{saw each}} of Parliament's 272 geographical constituencies return one MP to the National Assembly. It {{resulted in a}} Pakistan Muslim League (N) majority, and a massive loss of seats for the Pakistan Peoples Party. Pakistan Muslim League (N) became the single largest party, though without an overall majority. The Pakistan Muslim League (N) won 188 seats in the National Assembly through a simple majority. This resulted in a hung parliament. A <b>coalition</b> <b>agreement</b> was then formed following negotiations with the independent candidates who joined the PML(N) which allowed party to form a simple-majority government by bringing on-board nineteen independent candidates, thirteen more than the minimum required to form a government. This swing ultimately resulted in Nawaz Sharif becoming the new Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third time. Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah won a PPP leadership vote to succeed Nisar Ali Khan as permanent Leader of the Opposition. Ayaz Sadiq and Murtaza Javed Abbasi of PML-N elected as the legislature’s speaker and deputy speaker, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Composition and {{duration}} of governmental coalitions are the most frequent research topics within the fi eld of coalitions, while more detailed researches of characteristics of <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> {{as well as their}} signifi cance for coalition governance are usually overlooked. The article presents development and characteristics of <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> in Slovenia. As comparative analysis have showed there are three main topics covered by <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements,</b> policies, portfolio allocation, and ways of prevention or resolution of potential confl icts. It last several decades there has been clear tendency toward greater emphasis on policies in <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements.</b> The case study of Slovenia fi rst presents characteristics of Slovenian governments. Further, it reveals that <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> are actually a norm in Slovenian politics. Analysis of all post-electoral <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> shows that all above-mentioned three main topics have been also included in Slovenian <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> in the period 1993 – 2008 with the same tendency of greater importance of policies within time perspective...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} obvious {{questions}} to be asked about coalition governments is what these governments do, but this question has received little systematic attention from coalition researchers. A key element of coalition governance that may inform our empirical knowledge {{of the actions of}} government – their origin, organization and results – is <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements.</b> Party leaders negotiating a new government invest time in writing <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements,</b> and they do this because they expect beneficial effects: more efficiency in coalition policy making, and more peace in the government. Written <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> are considered to reduce uncertainty and mistrust, and this is why they have become institutionalized in countries with coalition governments. This article presents an approach to the comparative study of coalition conflicts as they emerge during government formation, the management of this conflict through drafting <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> and the effects of this during coalition life. The article sets out a number of expectations about the effects of types of deals that parties make; and asks what types of conflict management are most effective and what are the conditions for enforcement – structural and strategic? In recent comparative work, the features of <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> and mechanisms of coalition governance in Western Europe have received attention. This article sets out, with empirical material, how further comparative research on coalition governance may be developed. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{political}} parties take {{not only the}} economic conditions into account when developing a position on entrepreneurship and self-employment but also consider the “heritage” of a socialist state, which can influence the preferences of voters regarding this issue area. We test our hypotheses {{on the basis of}} an analysis of election manifestos and <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements.</b> We focus on the German case since unification allows for comparing electorates socialized in a market economy in the West German states and in a socialist economy in East Germany by holding the institutional setting constant. The results support our hypotheses that growing economic problems increase the saliency of entrepreneurship and self-employment and that differences between parties exist: Christian democratic and liberal parties emphasize entrepreneurship and self-employment in their manifestos more than green or socialist parties. In addition, governments including Christian democratic and liberals agree on more market-liberal policies in <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> compared to left-wing governments...|$|R

40|$|This {{informative}} text {{deals with}} the emergence of <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements,</b> their contents, the problem of enforcement and with {{the question of whether or}} not the functions are performed in practice. It explores the idea that policy bargaining in government formation is not just an isolated process, but that it is a real chance for parties to deal with substantive and controversial issues at an early stage. The <b>coalition</b> <b>agreements</b> in which these issues are incorporated have become important in most multiparty systems, but they have received little attention in political science research. This book argues that more systematic attention for these institutional variables is highly useful in coalition research because it helps to explain processes and outcome in coalition politics.
