The optics needed to concentrate the light have limited efficiency themselves, in the range of 75-90%.

50|$|Research into {{concentrator}} photovoltaics {{has taken}} place since the mid 1970s, initially spurred on by the energy shock from a mideast oil embargo. Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico was the site {{for most of the}} early work, with the first modern-like photovoltaic <b>concentrating</b> <b>system</b> produced there late in the decade. Their first system was a linear-trough concentrator system that used a point focus acrylic Fresnel lens focusing on water-cooled silicon cells and two axis tracking.

The 350 kW SOLERAS project in Saudi Arabia - the largest until many years later - was constructed by Sandia/Martin Marietta in 1981.|$|E
50|$|The energy {{obtained}} is in {{the form}} of low-grade heat of 70 to 80 °C compared to an assumed 20 °C ambient temperature. According to the second law of thermodynamics (see Carnot-cycle), the maximum theoretical efficiency of a cycle that uses heat from a high temperature reservoir at 80 °C and has a lower temperature of 20 °C is 1−(273+20)/(273+80)=17%. By comparison, a power plant's heat engine delivering high-grade heat at 800 °C would have a maximum theoretical limit of 73% for converting heat into useful work (and thus would be forced to divest as little as 27% in waste heat to the cold temperature reservoir at 20 °C). The low efficiency of solar ponds is usually justified with the argument that the 'collector', being just a plastic-lined pond, might potentially result in a large-scale system that is of lower overall levelised energy cost than a solar <b>concentrating</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractA two-step {{thermochemical}} {{water splitting}} cycle using nonstoichiometric cerium oxide is a promising solar thermochemical hydrogen production process. One {{of the present}} authors has developed new solar reactors using “internally circulating fluidized beds” with cerium oxide particles for the high-temperature cycle. These solar reactors need to be combined with a beam-down solar <b>concentrating</b> <b>system.</b> Niigata University, University of Miyazaki, and Mitaka Kohki Co. Ltd. recently started an R&D joint project to demonstrate the up-scaled fluidized bed reactors with solar. A new type of 100 kWth beam-down solar <b>concentrating</b> <b>system</b> was built in August, 2012 at the campus of University of Miyazaki. This paper describes the first results of solar flux measurements on the new Miyazaki beam-down system for demonstration of thermochemical water splitting reactors. The fluxes of concentrated solar radiation at the focus point were measured by moving an array of thirteen Gardon gauges. The solar power {{in an area of}} 130 × 130 cm in the focal spot was larger than 90 kWth during three hours of daytime radiation, exceeding 110 kWth around noon on October 12, 2012. A new CPC specific to this new beam-down system was designed and fabricated to concentrate the solar fluxes into a 44 cm diameter circle of the solar reactor aperture. The solar demonstration of the reactors will start at the Miyazaki beam-down system from October 2013...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{concept and}} {{principles}} of forming the focal spot in an innovative one-stage high-heat solar <b>concentrating</b> <b>system</b> are discussed. The <b>concentrating</b> <b>system</b> employs the multi-element approach and consists of a nested set of concave ring elements with the inner reflecting surfaces having variable slope and curvature. The reflecting elements are coaxially disposed in a manner to prevent mutual screening of both incident and concentrated fluxes. Such a ring-array concentrator (RAC) shapes its focal zone on its rear side and sufficiently remote from the lower edges of reflecting elements thus providing the lens-like functioning. Employing the computer simulation and visualization of optical caustics, the irradiance focal distribution is obtained and analyzed for various reflecting surface profiles of RAC elements. In particular, it is shown that utilizing the parabolic profiles for reflecting surfaces may allow to achieve a record one-stage concentration approaching the thermodynamic-photometrical limit for the most of an incident flux. The so high concentrating ability unattainable by other one-stage concentrators becomes possible in RAC due to the cumulative contribution of individual reflective elements. Each of the RAC ring reflecting elements forms its own focal spot with the peak concentration of about several thousands. Concentric superposing the individual focal spots yields extraordinary flux densities in the common focus. Based on computer simulation results, we also discuss RAC dimensional characteristics and slope/tracking error tolerances...|$|E

40|$|A {{mendelian}} mutant of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii {{has been}} isolated that is deficient in inorganic carbon transport. This mutant strain, designated pmp- 1 - 16 - 5 K (gene locus pmp- 1), was selected {{on the basis}} of a requirement of elevated CO 2 concentration for photoautrophic growth. Inorganic carbon accumulation in the mutant was considerably reduced in comparison to wild type, and the CO 2 response of photosynthesis indicated a reduced affinity for CO 2 in the mutant. At air levels of CO 2 (0. 03 - 0. 04 %), O 2 inhibited photosynthesis and stimulated the synthesis of photorespiratory intermediates in the mutant but not in wild type. Neither strain was significantly affected by O 2 at saturating CO 2 concentration. Thus, the primary consequence of inorganic carbon transport deficiency in the mutant was a much lower internal CO 2 concentration compared to wild type.
