500|$|With {{the rise}} of media {{watchdog}} groups, such as the conservative Media Research Center (MRC), Jennings came under increasing scrutiny for what some observers deemed a liberal bias. The anchor drew fire from conservatives, such as the MRC and Cal Thomas, for his November 14, 1994, remarks on ABC Radio, in which he analyzed {{the results of the}} 1994 U.S. midterm elections. [...] "Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two-year-old and they <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> those temper tantrums: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming," [...] said Jennings. [...] "Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." [...] A July 1995 documentary, Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped, which aired a week before the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, also drew scorn from conservatives and some television critics, who called the program a revisionist look at the decision to drop the bomb. Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as a hard worker, and stated that the [...] "first thing I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Kanye West is that he's a hard worker. When you look at him, you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oral {{subjects}} proved {{unwilling to}} analyze themselves. When asked [...] "what {{sort of person}} are you?" [...] one responded: [...] "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> me. I myself can’t say anything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, that's all I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the new religion," [...] went on Flambeau carelessly. [...] "It claims, of course, that it {{can cure}} all {{physical}} diseases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Awfully. But {{the point}} is that now he's gone I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that M.C.C. match affair. I know you want to hear what really did happen that afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{complicated}} case," [...] answered Dick. [...] "My father <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it first, and then I'll {{tell you what}} I know, and show you all our papers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Todd and {{the others}} <b>can</b> readily <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that, and about Merwell's cattle, too. But come, we have wasted too much time already. You'll all be wanting supper long before we reach the ranch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} good-natured nun; [...] "surely you shall hear all I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it; but--" [...] she hesitated timidly, [...] "but I must ask the Mother Superior's leave first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Philip--"lots of them, {{besides the}} Greek stories. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Richard Coeur-de-Lion and Saladin, and about William Wallace, and Robert Bruce, and James Douglas. I know no end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that," [...] she returned, not in {{the least}} resenting my {{personal}} remarks. [...] "It is because I've had ringworms. My head is shaved and I'm not allowed to go to school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I would I could. If I knew Medea's secret, I {{would have}} myself chopped and boiled that I might come out young on her behalf; but, George, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may have}} had twenty, Henry, for what I know; {{but if you go}} to that gentleman, he <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> it. Go speak to him, Henry; it is the Master of Ravenswood." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know, but {{the natives}} call him Dario, {{and say that}} he is young, and has fair hair, and that she is in love with him. That's all I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{teamster}} laughed. [...] "It {{should come}} from me, {{but the fact is}} I was worrying about that wagon and forgot," [...] he said. [...] "Now, if there is anything I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Boardman knows; he <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] said Dan, {{from the}} hall chair he had dropped into. He rose {{and made his way}} to the stairs, with the effect of leaving the whole thing to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Gauntlet <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> Miss Waddington," [...] said Miss Todd, in {{her very}} plainest voice. [...] "They are very great friends, and {{correspond}} with each other." [...] So Miss Todd {{handed over the}} spout of the trumpet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. But I wasn't feeling extra {{well just}} then and I didn't eat very much, {{and that made}} me hungry afterwards. And, oh, say! I guess I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> those snowballs," [...] and Codfish's face lit up suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... “Leave {{that to the}} natives,” said Mr. Westgate. “Leave the Tennessee Central to me, Mr. Beaumont. I guess I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> more <b>about</b> it {{than most}} any one. But I didn’t know you Englishmen ever did any work—in the upper classes.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} his life, young as he is, {{has not been}} so creditable {{as it might have}} been. He has been the hero of one or two little affairs. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> them if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{why do you}} {{not come}} to me?" [...] she said. [...] "I can tell you very much about Theos. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the country people, and how they live. Did I not ask you to come, Mr. Brand? You are very ungallant." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again I find {{my letter}} {{so long that}} I must cut it off now and go on [...] again to-night. So this must go as it stands. I shall not cause you [...] to wait to hear all I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> our new home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who? Really, I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Hollingsworth, {{looking at}} me with some surprise.
