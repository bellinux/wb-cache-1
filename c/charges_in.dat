5|$|Using {{economic}} sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted {{a campaign to}} drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor. In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties. Although the mission was controversial, U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> April 1992.|$|E

5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to extensive publication {{on the behavior}} of space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> polymeric insulation materials subject to individual dc or ac voltages, space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the situation of composite voltages has not yet been reported. In this paper, the dynamics of space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> polyethylene subjected to combined ac and dc voltages have been experimentally investigated using the pulsed electroacoustic technique. Results show that combined voltages could significantly enhance the space charge accumulation. The dc component voltage determines the <b>charge</b> accumulation <b>in</b> the bulk of polyethylene while ac component influences the charge density on the electrodes. The amount of <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the bulk depends on the ratio between ac and dc voltage components. This result is important to understand the electrical performance of high voltage equipment where insulation may experience the combined ac and dc voltages...|$|R
