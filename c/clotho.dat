5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who became the God of War after killing the former, Ares. Other {{characters}} include Athena (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Wisdom; Zeus (Corey Burton), the King of the Gods and the main antagonist; several Titans—including Gaia (Linda Hunt), Atlas (Michael Clarke Duncan), Prometheus (Alan Oppenheimer), Typhon (Fred Tatasciore), and Cronos (Lloyd Sherr)—heroes Theseus (Paul Eiding) and Perseus (Harry Hamlin); the insane Icarus (Bob Joles); the Gorgon Euryale (Jennifer Martin); an undead version of the Barbarian King (Bob Joles); and the Sisters of Fate—Lakhesis (Leigh-Allyn Baker), Atropos (Debi Mae West), and <b>Clotho</b> (Susan Silo). Minor characters include the boat captain (Keith Ferguson) and a loyal Spartan soldier (Josh Keaton; credited as the Last Spartan). Kratos' wife Lysandra, their daughter Calliope, and the Titan Rhea appear in flashbacks. The gods Hades and Poseidon appear in flashbacks of the Great War, and in the final cutscene alongside Zeus, Helios, and Hermes on Olympus.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War the {{communities}} west of Long Prairie were settled by Southern soldiers who had fought for the Union Army that were not very welcome in their home state of Kentucky. Once located at the present intersection of County Roads 38 and 11, Whiteville was settled by the three White sisters and their families. <b>Clotho</b> was settled where it is because, it seems, settlers couldn't go any further given that the forests and swamps to the west were impenetrable.|$|E
25|$|Xenocrates {{recognized}} three {{grades of}} cognition, each appropriated to {{a region of}} its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which {{is the object of}} pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavoured, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception. All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, <b>Clotho,</b> and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent, attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories.|$|E

Before he dies, the soldier informs Kratos that Zeus has destroyed Sparta in Kratos' absence. Outraged, Kratos is further motivated and frees a phoenix, riding the creature to the Sisters' stronghold where he confronts two, Lakhesis and Atropos. After they refuse his request to alter time, Kratos battles them. During this, the Sisters try to change the outcome of Kratos' battle with Ares, but Kratos kills them both, then confronts the remaining Sister, <b>Clotho.</b> He kills her using her own traps, and acquires the [...] "Loom of Fate" [...] in order to return to the point at which Zeus betrayed him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} the album is about Atropos goddess of fate and destiny in Greek mythology, one of the Moirai. The Story goes on when Atropos decided to choose the {{mechanism}} of death instead of mortality and ended their life cutting their thread with her special scissor which they call it [...] "Abhorred Shears". She wasn't all alone in this, her other two sister; Lachesis and <b>Clotho</b> helped her. <b>Clotho</b> {{was the youngest of}} all sisters and Lachesis was the kindest one. But as Atropos was so inevitable and hard she used her power to convince them to help her to destroy mortality.|$|E
2500|$|They say Atropos {{was jealous}} of her sisters because they were {{deciding}} for humans' lives. <b>Clotho</b> was responsible for spinning the thread of human life and Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being. [...] She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In Greek mythology, {{it is said that}} she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate. In between all these Atropos {{was the only one who}} should have sat somewhere and watches her youngest sisters doing their jobs, so that's when her jealousy overcame her feelings and made her to choose the mechanism of death, then she would have been a part of this circle to end humans' lives on certain time which Lachesis decides.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Three Fates" [...] is {{a three-part}} [...] "pseudo suite," [...] written and {{predominantly}} performed by Emerson. It comprises three movements, {{one for each}} of the three sisters of Greek mythology known as the Three Fates or Moirai; <b>Clotho,</b> [...] Lachesis and Atropos. Its overall length is a little under eight minutes. The [...] "Clotho" [...] movement was recorded at the Royal Festival Hall, London, with Emerson playing the venue's massive pipe organ. [...] "Lachesis," [...] which follows, is a piano solo of about 2 minutes 45 seconds. It features baroque and jazz influences ending in grand, sweeping arpeggios. In [...] "Atropos," [...] after briefly revisiting the pipe organ from the first movement, Emerson moves to a piano vamp in 7/8 with percussion accompaniment from Palmer (according to Macan's analysis of [...] "The Three Fates" [...] in Endless Enigma, Lake does not play on the track). An improvisation is layered over the top which eventually transforms into a polymetrically played repeated sequence in 4/4 time. The resonance of the final chords is curtailed by sound of explosions.|$|E

60|$|Clarence and {{his friend}} Coles longed to sail {{together}} again, but Coles was shelved; and when Clarence's appointment came at last, {{it was to the}} brig <b>Clotho,</b> Commander Brydone, going out in the Mediterranean Fleet, under Sir Edward Codrington. My mother did not like brigs, and my father did not like what he heard of the captain; but there had been jealous murmurs about appointments being absorbed by sons of officials--he durst not pick and choose; and the Admiral pronounced that if the lad had been spoilt on board the Calypso, it was time for him to rough it--a dictum whence there was no appeal.|$|E
60|$|As {{every one}} knows, {{the battle of}} Navarino came on suddenly, almost by mistake; and though it is perhaps no excuse, the hurly-burly and horror burst upon him at unawares. Though the English loss was {{comparatively}} very small, the <b>Clotho</b> {{was a good deal}} exposed, and two men were killed--one so close to Clarence that his clothes were splashed with blood. This entirely unnerved him; he did not even know what he did, but he was not to be found when required to carry an order, and was discovered hidden away below, shuddering, in his berth, and then made some shallow excuse about misunderstanding orders. Whether this would have been brought up against him under other circumstances, or whether it would have been remembered that great men, including Charles V. and Henri IV., have had their moment de peur, I cannot tell; but there were other charges. I cannot give date or details. There is no record among the papers before me; and I can only vaguely recall what could hardly be read for the sense of agony, was never discussed, and was driven into the most oblivious recesses of the soul fifty years ago. There was a story about having let a boat's crew, of which he was in charge, get drunk and over-stay their time. One of them deserted; and apparently prevarication ran to the bounds of perjury, if it did not overpass them. (N.B.--Seeing seamen flogged was one of the sickening horrors that haunted Clarence in the <b>Clotho.)</b> Also, when on shore at Malta with the young man whose name I will not record--his evil genius--he was beguiled or bullied into a wine-shop, and while not himself was made the cat's-paw of some insolent practical joke on the lieutenant; and when called to account, was so bewildered and excited as to use unpardonable language.|$|E

60|$|I confess I cannot feel, as some do, a {{personal}} consolation for the manifest evils {{of this war}} in any remote or contingent advantages that may spring from it. I am old and weak, I can bear little, and can scarce hope to see better days; nor is it any adequate compensation to know that Nature is young and strong and can bear much. Old men philosophize over the past, but the present is only a burthen and a weariness. The one lies before them like a placid evening landscape; the other is full of vexations and anxieties of housekeeping. It may be true enough that miscet hæc illis, prohibetque <b>Clotho</b> fortunam stare, but he who said it was fain at last to call in Atropos with her shears before her time; and I cannot help selfishly mourning that the fortune of our Republick could not at least stay till my days were numbered.|$|E
60|$|In Tortuga, {{during the}} months he spent there {{refitting}} the three ships he had captured from the fleet that had gone out to destroy him, he found himself almost an object of worship {{in the eyes of}} the wild Brethren of the Coast, all of whom now clamoured for the honour of serving under him. It placed him in the rare position of being able to pick and choose the crews for his augmented fleet, and he chose fastidiously. When next he sailed away it was with a fleet of five fine ships in which went something over a thousand men. Thus you behold him not merely famous, but really formidable. The three captured Spanish vessels he had renamed with a certain scholarly humour the <b>Clotho,</b> Lachesis, and Atropos, a grimly jocular manner of conveying to the world that he made them the arbiters of the fate of any Spaniards he should henceforth encounter upon the seas.|$|E
