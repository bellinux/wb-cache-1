40|$|Abstract. Application of {{nanoparticles}} {{provides an}} effective way of improving heat transfer <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids.</b> Particles less than 100 nm in diameter exhibit different properties from those of conventional solids. Compared with micron-sized particles, nanophase powders have much larger relative surface areas and a great potential for heat transfer enhancement. Some researchers tried to suspend nanoparticles into fluids to form high effective heat transfer fluids. Some preliminary experimental results showed that increase in thermal conductivity of approximately 60 % can be obtained for some nanofluids consisting of water and 5 vol % CuO nanoparticles. So, the thermal conductivity of nanofluid {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the nanoparticle volume fraction. So far it has been an unsolved problem to develop a sophisticated theory to predict thermal conductivity of nanofluids, although there are some semi empirical correlations to calculate the apparent conductivity of two-phase mixture. In this article, several correlations for predicting the nanofluid thermal conductivity will be compared and results will be discussed for three water based nanofluids...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the interface between two fluids confined in a rectangular cavity is investigated numerically to predict its transient behavior. These computations address mixing <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids</b> under microgravity conditions, particularly g-jitter conditions resulting from aircraft vibration or crew motion, and have applications in solution crystal growth. The two-dimensional formulation employs the Boussinesq approximation and treats the mixing of two fluids as an initial value problem with a prescribed concentration field. For fluid mixing of practical applications inside a cavity, it is shown that nonlinear convective transport can dominate over both viscous and molecular diffusion. However, viscous diffusion can become important for low Reynolds number or certain cavity sizes. A stacking phenomenon is shown to occur for aspect ratios (Ar) approximately between 5 to 10. For aspect ratios {{in the neighborhood of}} 0. 1 to 0. 2, inner cells evolve at the interface with increasing time.
