40|$|An Active Vibration Attenuating Seat Suspension (AVASS) for an MH- 60 S {{helicopter}} <b>crew</b> <b>seat</b> {{is designed}} to protect the occupants from harmful whole-body vibration (WBV). Magnetorheological (MR) suspension units are designed, fabricated and installed in a helicopter <b>crew</b> <b>seat.</b> These MR isolators are built to work in series with existing Variable Load Energy Absorbers (VLEAs), have minimal increase in weight, and maintain crashworthiness for the seat system. Refinements are discussed, based on testing, to minimize friction observed in the system. These refinements include the addition of roller bearings to replace friction bearings in the existing seat. Additionally, semi-active control of the MR dampers is achieved using special purpose built custom electronics integrated into the seat system.

40|$|The {{function}} of the <b>crew</b> <b>seat</b> attenuation system for the Orion Crew Module (CM) is to provide the crew with a low injury-risk landing environment under a range of crew configurations and landing conditions. The current design for the seat attenuation system provides the crew with a low risk of injury environment based on the Brinkley criteria {{for most of the}} landing conditions considered. Furthermore, the stroking of the seat attenuation system is within limits, and the clearance between the seat support platform and vehicle is not exceeded. For the limited number of landing conditions where a low injury risk is exceeded, the risk is never beyond a moderate level. The results presented in this study are based on a CM structural model that is rigid except for the pallet struts, which attenuate landing loads and reduce the accelerations transferred to the astronauts. The CM simulations include a soft soil landing. Several different crew configurations are evaluated in this study. It is expected that situations where the risk is above low can be eliminated in future design iterations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the use of magnetorheological (MR) dampers for enhanced occupant protection during harsh vertical landings as well as isolation of the occupant from cockpit vibrations. The capabilities of the current state-of-the-art in helicopter <b>crew</b> <b>seat</b> energy absorption systems are highly limited because they cannot be optimally adapted to each individual crash scenario (i. e. variations in both occupant weight and crash load level). They also present an unnecessarily high risk of injury by not minimizing the load transmitted to the occupant during a crash. Additionally, current rotorcraft seats provide no means of isolating the occupant from harmful cockpit vibrations. The objective of this research was to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of an MR-based suspension for rotorcraft seats. As such, this research began with an in-depth investigation into design feasibility. Three MR seat suspension design cases are investigated: 1) for only vibration isolation, 2) for adaptive occupant protection, and 3) for combined adaptive occupant protection and vibration isolation. It is shown that MR-based suspensions are feasible for each of these cases and the performance benefits and tradeoffs are discussed for each case. Next, to further illustrate the occupant protection benefits gained with an MR-based suspension, three control strategies were developed and performance metrics were compared. It was shown that MR dampers can be controlled such that they will automatically adapt to the crash load level as well as occupant weight. By using feedback of sensor signals, MR dampers were adjusted to utilize the full stroke capability of the seat suspension regardless crash level and occupant weight. The peak load transmitted to the occupant and the risk of spinal injury, therefore, was always minimized. Because this control significantly reduced or eliminated injury risk during less severe landings, it is a significant advance over the current state-of-the-art rotorcraft seat suspensions which can provide no better than 20 % risk of occupant injury. Finally, an MR-based seat suspension designed solely for the purposes of vibration isolation was designed, analyzed, and experimentally demonstrated. MR dampers were integrated into the current crashworthy SH- 60 <b>crew</b> <b>seat</b> with minimal weight impact such that the original crashworthy capabilities were maintained. Then, utilizing semi-active control, experimental vibration testing demonstrated that the system reduced vertical cockpit vibrations transmitted to the occupant by 76 %. This is a significant advance over current state-of-the-art rotorcraft seats which provide no attenuation of cockpit vibrations...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} complaints of annoyance, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain during prolonged exposures to propulsion-generated vibration in military propeller aircraft. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of seat cushions on mitigating the higher frequency (> 10 Hz) multi-axis vibration associated with Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye operations. An E- 2 C <b>crew</b> <b>seat</b> was used in the laboratory during exposure to a selected operational signal. Triaxial accelerations were measured at the interface between the human and cushion (seat pan and seat back). The most pronounced effects were observed at the blade passage frequency (~ 73. 5 Hz). The highest vibration occurred at the seat pan in the fore-and-aft (X) direction of the subject (lateral direction of the aircraft). Substantial vibration was observed at the seat back in the vertical (Z) direction. Significantly lower levels of fore-and-aft (X) vibration occurred at the seat pan with all cushions as compared to the original E- 2 C cushion (P< 0. 05). The largest reduction in the X acceleration was about 40 % with a mean reduction of approximately 20 % among the cushions. The results raised questions regarding psychophysical effects and whether the vibration mitigation at the blade passage frequency is sufficient for reducing the reported symptoms...|$|E

40|$|Annoyance, fatigue, and {{musculoskeletal}} pain {{have been}} reported during prolonged exposures to propulsion-generated vibration in military propeller aircraft 1. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the vibration mitigation properties of selected seat cushions and the effects of occupant seating posture during exposure to higher frequency multi-axis vibration associated with military propeller aircraft. Methods A Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye <b>crew</b> <b>seat</b> was mounted onto the Six Degree-of-Freedom Motion Simulator (SIXMODE). Six seat pan cushion configurations were tested during exposure to an E- 2 C vibration signal collected in the field 1. Seat pan cushions 1 - 5 were used with the original E- 2 C seat back cushion. Cushion configuration 6 included seat pan cushion 5 with a prototype seat back cushion. Triaxial accelerometer pads were mounted onto the seat pan and seat back cushions to measure the vibration entering the human. Data were collected for seven subjects seated upright with their backs in contact with the seat (back-on) and not in contact with the seat (back-off). Spectral analysis techniques were used to analyze data at the two dominant frequencies associated with the propulsion system (propeller rotation frequency (PRF) ~ 18. 5 Hz, and blade passage frequency (BPF) ~ 73. 5 Hz). Overall accelerations were also calculated between 1 and 80 Hz. Vibration Total Values (VTVs) were calculated using the weighted seat pan and seat back (back-on only) accelerations and compared to the comfort reactions given in ISO 2631 - 1 : 19972. Results In general, the highest accelerations observed at the seat pan occurred in the fore-and-aft (X) direction at both the PRF and the BPF for all cushions and both postures. The most pronounced effect was at the BPF in the X direction, where all configurations showed significantly lower seat pan accelerations than configuration 1 (original E- 2 C cushion) with the back-on posture. Configuration 5 was the exception with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 A, Repeated Measures ANOVA, P< 0. 05). The most pronounced effect of posture occurred at the PRF in the X direction, where all cushion configurations showed significantly lower seat pan accelerations with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 B). All configurations except configuration 2 showed similar VTVs as compared to Configuration 1 (Fig. 2, P< 0. 05). Configuration 2 tended to show the lowest weighted acceleration levels. The overall VTVs (back-on only, Fig. 2 B) showed significantly higher accelerations as compared to both the back-on and back-off seat pan point VTVs (Figs. 2 A...|$|E
