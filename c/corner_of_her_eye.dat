25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, {{in the general direction of}} her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Riddel {{gave her}} head a toss, and {{regarded}} {{him from the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{watched him}} as {{he walked down the}} garden, and then sighed deeply, wiping away a tear from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head and looked at me. She had a trick <b>of</b> {{contracting}} the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> just a little, which was absolutely bewitching.|$|R
60|$|Dora {{watched her}} out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> as a cat watches a mouse.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Philippa {{looked at}} {{me out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and disdained any {{skirmish}} of flippant epigram.|$|E
6000|$|... "Were those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?" [...] asked Marilla, {{looking at}} Anne {{out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|I looked. Hendrika was {{tramping}} {{along with}} the child {{in her arms and}} staring at me in a most sinister fashion out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{the door}} had shut behind them Madame looked at Juliette, who with her new watch held to her ear, {{observed}} <b>her</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{poor house}} is for pilgrims and merchants, not for famous knights; yet, sirs, I {{welcome you to}} it," [...] she said presently, {{scanning}} them out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Effie {{shut her}} book over her hand. [...] "It keeps me wakeful longer," [...] she whispered, {{with a glance}} at her mother from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now Dickory's {{face was}} like the sky before a shower. His mother saw {{it out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> but the others did not look at him.|$|E
60|$|Miss Truefitt {{appeared}} to tremble, and made {{as though to}} rise. Then she sat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you've {{had your}} own way now," [...] she sighed, looking at him out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "I suppose you always get {{your own way}} in the end, don't you, Mr. Fischer?" ...|$|R
60|$|The very faintest <b>of</b> smiles parted <b>her</b> lips, a {{smile that}} {{wrinkled}} at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and suddenly altered her appearance so that Deane was forced to recognize the charm which even to himself he had denied.|$|R
60|$|And he {{laid his}} large, yet well-shapen workman's hand {{on the top of}} the stove, that was {{polished}} black and smooth as velvet. She would not look at him, yet she glanced out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir!" [...] she simpered. And then, {{bursting}} into naturalness, and glancing from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> [...] "'Tis {{the funniest thing}} under the sun! And it costs money." ...|$|E
60|$|When Miss Ophelia {{entered the}} kitchen Dinah did not rise, but smoked on in sublime tranquillity, {{regarding}} her movements obliquely {{out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> but apparently intent only on the operations around her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{pointed to}} the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, {{examining}} me {{every now and then}} with the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Know? Yes, or {{she could}} hardly make such a brother of the Colonel. In fact, I {{think it is a}} bit of treachery to us all to keep such an affair concealed, don't you?" [...] with a vivid flash out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Here {{and there}} stalwart, quiet policemen {{requested}} loiterers to move on, and the loiterers obeyed and re-formed in groups behind them; {{here and there}} a respectable woman pushed her way through the throng, gathering up her skirts as she did so and glancing covertly at this unaccustomed company out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Comtesse {{looked at}} him lazily out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sleepy <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Matthew had sheepishly {{unfolded}} {{the dress}} from its paper swathings {{and held it}} out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> with a rather interested air.|$|E
60|$|Miss Shott {{was passing}} {{on the other side}} of the street, and she was walking rapidly, but she could see more out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> than most people could see when they were looking {{straight}} before them at the same things.|$|E
6000|$|As he {{said this}} he looked across to Mary Lowther, who no doubt was {{watching}} every turn of his face from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "I've just been and knocked under, {{and told him that}} the old place shall be put to rights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come on, Liza, don't tike on; I didn't mean no offence.' And {{he put his}} arm {{round her}} waist and led her to take their places at the gallery door. Two tears escaped from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and ran down her nose, but she felt very {{relieved}} and happy, and let him lead her where he would.|$|R
60|$|She {{swore that}} she was. And indeed {{her cheeks were}} ruddy with outdoors, the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> relaxed. But she was so stiff that they had hobbled a mile, and Father had shucked several tons of corn in return for breakfast, before she ceased feeling as though her legs were made of {{extraordinarily}} brittle glass.|$|R
60|$|Miss Deringham {{understood}} him, {{and reflected}} as {{she glanced at}} him out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> that <b>her</b> father would do well if he dealt openly with this man. She fancied he could be remorseless in a reckoning, and she had now and then of late had unpleasant suspicions respecting Deringham's intentions concerning him.|$|R
60|$|I runs my {{arm around}} her neck and raises her head, gentle, and breaks the bag of {{flaxseed}} with the other hand; and as easy as I could I bends over and slips three or four of the seeds in the outer <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave me an}} odd glance out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "The queer thing is," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "what I wanted to say was {{something}} quite, quite different. To give you a friendly word of warning, entirely on your own account.... You have a rival, Midgetina." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{glanced at}} Clayton {{out of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Was not here a man trained in the same school of {{environment}} {{in which she had}} been trained--a man with social position and culture such as she had been taught to consider as the prime essentials to congenial association? ...|$|E
60|$|Billie cast {{a glance}} of {{contempt}} at him out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She hardly knew {{why she had}} spoken to him except that, as all automobilists are aware, the impulse to say rude things about their battery is almost irresistible. To an automobilist the art of conversation consists in rapping out scathing remarks either about the battery or the oiling-system.|$|R
60|$|What {{would people}} do if this {{convenient}} shelter of duty did not afford them a retreat {{in cases when}} they are disposed to change their minds? Susan suppressed the arch smile that, in spite of herself, laughed out at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and told <b>her</b> sister that she was much obliged to her for her care. So off they went together.|$|R
6000|$|While he was {{speaking}} Queen Cor had been studying the boy's face stealthily, from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and she said to herself: [...] "He is so small and innocent that I believe I can capture him alone, and with ease. He does not seem very terrible and I suspect that King Gos and his warriors were frightened at nothing." ...|$|R
