500|$|... 1959 {{brought a}} new option, the Rush-Matic {{automatic}} transmission, which featured two modes: Rush (fully automatic) and Road (manual gear selection). The same year, assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil. Also during 1959, a new top-of-the-line model joined the Vedette range, the Présidence, featuring a luxurious interior, a radiotelephone (a European first) and a <b>continental</b> <b>kit.</b> French coachbuilder Chapron built two 2-door Présidence convertibles for a governor {{of one of the}} French colonies. Chapron had another order the next year, to build two four-door convertibles for the French President Charles de Gaulle. The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960, but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year, when they received new seats, new chrome decor, and the engine was fitted with a new anti-vibration crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|The New Yorker entered 1961 {{with a new}} grille, slanted headlights, a <b>continental</b> <b>kit</b> on {{the trunk}} lid. The 413 CID [...] "RB" [...] Golden Lion V-8 continued. This {{is the last of}} the [...] "Forward Look" [...] models. Chrysler built 2,541 New Yorker two-door hardtops this year, the last until 1964 in Canada and 1965 in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|The same car {{was also}} sold in Europe. One Europe-only variant was the Anglia Sportsman, which carried its spare tyre on the back, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} <b>continental</b> <b>kit</b> often seen in the United States. Chrome bumper overriders, broad whitewall tyres, and optionally a side stripe kicking {{up at the end}} into the tail-lights/fin were also fitted. The Super only arrived in South Africa in 1966, although it did boost sales considerably.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary {{examples}} of <b>Continental</b> <b>kits</b> are sometimes found on customized automobiles. It {{has become an}} accessory that typifies [...] "the spirit" [...] of the 1950s. <b>Continental</b> <b>kits</b> were also made popular by the pimpmobile craze of the 1970s, {{not to mention the}} Pimp My Ride show. Continental tires are known as 'fifth wheels' in hip hop slang.|$|R
50|$|Later in {{the model}} year an open car named Convertible Cruiser was added to this series. From the {{beginning}} it was created only {{to be used as}} the official pace car of the 1957 Indianapolis 500. On January 7, 1957, it was announced that the Convertible Cruiser would be available as a production model as well. All Convertible cruisers had a <b>continental</b> tire <b>kit</b> and were painted yellow (Sun Glitter), similar to the original pace cars.|$|R
5000|$|The Jeepster Commando came {{in three}} types: Revival Jeepster, Commando convertible, {{and an open}} body {{roadster}} with no top at all. The Revival Jeepster, named [...] "Jeepster", as shown in hood side emblem an VIN decode or Jeepster Convertible was the showcase vehicle of the fleet, offering deluxe interior appointments, powered convertible top, and a <b>Continental</b> tire <b>kit</b> (available only for this model). The Commando convertible offered the same body with just the basic finish and equipment.|$|R

50|$|It {{entered the}} {{production}} lineup as a high-performance, fuel-injected luxury convertible {{version of the}} Star Chief in 1957, and was loaded with every available option as standard equipment {{with the exception of}} air conditioning and a <b>continental</b> <b>kit.</b> This put the Bonneville in a Cadillac-like price range of $5,782.00 - more than double the base price of the Chieftain on which it was built, with the result being a fully equipped Bonneville could cost more than a larger, entry-level Cadillac. Only 630 units were produced that first year, {{making it one of the}} most collectible Pontiacs of all time. The following year it became a separate model, and it would endure until 2005 as the division's top-of-the-line model. The name was taken from the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, the site of much early auto racing and most of the world's land speed record runs, which was named in turn after U.S. Army officer Benjamin Bonneville.|$|E
50|$|After the First World War, Hausemann & Hotte {{expanded}} their range of toys and games. This included the Meccano metal construction <b>kits,</b> <b>Continental</b> Caoutchouc rubber balls, dolls’ prams by Heinrichmaier & Wunsch, ‘Jutta’dolls by Dressel, Emata slates, Hohner mouth organs, cars and figurines by Lehmann and Spears games.|$|R
50|$|Installation {{of a more}} {{powerful}} engine. A popular conversion today is to replace the original C-85 or C-90 with a 100 hp (75 kW) <b>Continental</b> O-200. A <b>kit</b> is available to install a Lycoming O-320 but this conversion is less prevalent due to a roughly 100 lb (45 kg) weight penalty and {{a sharp increase in}} fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{released}} in the mid-1950s, the company’s earliest car kits, included in its Deluxe Series, were the 1948 Lincoln <b>Continental</b> (original <b>kit</b> #227), ’37 Cord Convertible (#229), and ’35 Auborn Speedster (#231), all nominally in 1/24 scale, though careful examination reveals them to be much smaller, probably {{in the range of}} 1/27 or 1/28 scale. The original kit-box illustrations from these models were also available as [...] "suitable for framing" [...] posters. Pyro re-boxed these kits a number of times. The originals were issued in a clamshell-style box, but later iterations featured the company’s signature two-part hard-box packaging. These kits were subsequently re-issued several times by Lindberg, as recently as 2009.|$|R
50|$|Factory {{options and}} extras - Triumph offered {{a wide range}} of {{optional}} parts and accessories for both the competition-minded enthusiast and those simply wishing to personalize their vehicle. While many of these items were factory fitments, local dealers supplied some as well. Among these were: overdrive, wire wheels (48-spoke, 60-spoke available from 1959), steel hardtop kit (part No. 900711), occasional rear seat (No. 801264), push-button radio, interior heater, leather upholstery, windscreen washer (No. 553729), cast aluminium sump (No. 502126), 2138cc engine (from 1959), aluminum ‘Al-fin’ brake drums (No. 202267 or No. 301590 (9- and 10-inch respectively)), spot and fog lamps (Nos. 501703, 501702), and a <b>continental</b> touring <b>kit</b> (No. 502022, spares for travels in remote regions).|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1966, IH also offered the Scout 800 Sportop, which had an {{upgraded}} interior and a unique fiberglass top (also {{available as a}} convertible) with a slanted rear roof and a <b>continental</b> spare tire <b>kit.</b> The [...] "Champagne Series" [...] Scout was a high-option Scout offered in the Scout 80 and later Scout 800 models. The Champagne series was another [...] "Doll Up Scout" [...] that featured a headliner, door panels and carpet.|$|R
5000|$|... 1953 was Ford's 50th anniversary. The {{big news}} for 1953 was the {{availability}} of power-assisted brakes and steering, which had previously been limited to the Mercury and Lincoln lines. The center grill bullet lost its ring and was now flanked by vertical black stripes, while the corner markers were plain rectangular lights rather than the circular [...] "intakes". All 1953 Fords featured commemorative steering wheels marking the company's 50th anniversary. Mechanical changes included two-inch wider tread, and a k-bar frame with five cross-members. [...] William Clay Ford paced the Indianapolis 500 in a Sunliner convertible with a dummy <b>Continental</b> tire <b>kit</b> (Coronado kit). [...] This was also {{the last year for}} real wood trim on the Country Squire wagon. Toward the end of the year, Ford added [...] "Master-Guide" [...] power steering as an option on cars with V8s. Full instrumentation was still used. An unusual service provided by Ford was that the radio preset buttons would already be set to local stations by the dealer. The heater was $74.|$|R
