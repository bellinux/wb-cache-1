The 7 Be neutrino deficit is a main focus of the solar neutrino problem, and Borexino {{will be able to}} detect the 7 Be neutrino line at 862 keV by real time counting. Borexino will have 300 tons of scintillator and be located in the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory. It has a series of radiation shields, consist- The BOREX Collaboration: G. Alimonti, C.

The experiment strongly suggests that the quark has a radius of a few tenth of fermi and the partons are constituents of quarks. We discuss briefly a possible internal structure of the quark. § 1. Important experiment Recently Sugimoto, Tanihata and Goring performed a very important experi-ment on 11 -decays of nuclei. 1 l The data show that the / 3 ray angular distribution in the 11 decays of polarized 12 B and 12 N(JP= 1 +) into 12 C(JP=O+) cannot be explained by so-called first class currents only. 2 l In order to explain their experi-ment, a pseudo-tensor term is required in nucleonic weak currents (a scalar term does not contribute to these decays due to the Gamov-Teller transitions). According to Morita and Tanihata, the axial-vector currents of nucleon (~ 4 [...] aN) is as follows, 3 l A. a N = p (gANrp. r 5 + glf,T(Jj/Vqvr 5 + gpNqjJ. r 5) n' and gN _ 3. 5 ± 1. 3 g N and pr- 2 NI A (1) where the metric 18 (+,-,-,-), (JfJ. v = [r,, rv] / 2, q = qn- qp and the left handed projection is (1 + r 5). glf,T is very large! It is to be noted that <b>Calaprice</b> et al. also obtained a similar result in their experiment on polarized 19 Ne decays!) Though more experimental checks are required for the establishment of the existence of a second class current of course, we shall discuss an implication of the existence of a pseudo-tensor current based on Eq. (1). The pseudo-tensor current has two unique properties. One of them 1 s that its G-parity is different from the first class axial-vector current. Another 1 s that the amplitude is proportional to the transfer momentum. If we assume that a second class current does not exist 1 n quark currents, we must consider that there exists a large G-parity non-conserving part in quark-quark interactions in order to explain a large pseudo-tensor term in nucleoni...|$|E
