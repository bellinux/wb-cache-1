5000|$|Consider a {{viscoelastic}} {{body that}} is subjected to dynamic loading. If the excitation frequency is low enough [...] the viscous behavior is paramount and all polymer chains {{have the time to}} respond to the applied load within a time period. In contrast, at higher frequencies, the chains do not have the time to fully respond and the resulting artificial viscosity results in an increase in the macroscopic modulus. Moreover, at constant frequency, an increase in temperature results in a reduction of the modulus due to an increase in free volume and <b>chain</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chain brakes prevent {{movement}} of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the driven clutch drum. Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, {{it can be used}} to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled <b>chain</b> <b>movement,</b> a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.|$|E

The measurements from differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proved {{the effectiveness of}} TPS and banana fiber in improving the blend degradation. On the other hand the LLDPE/TPS/banana fiber composites showed better thermal stability than the LLDPE/TPS blend, which is reflected to the LLDPE <b>chains</b> <b>movement</b> restriction.

It was elected {{to return to the}} site for a number of reasons. First, drilling at the nearby site 432 had hit reasonably unaltered and unchanged basalt with good remnant magnetic properties, key to finding the latitude of origin; but insufficient sampling caused a lack of data, and determining the age accurately was not possible. Hence, deeper drilling was promised to achieve that goal, providing a time-averaged (as the seamount is {{in the center of the}} <b>chain)</b> <b>movement</b> ratio. Second, a survey of the region showed a rock structure suitable for deep drilling, and nearby sites met low levels of sedimentary cover.

This helped another project goal, to recover a suitable and datable chunk of tholeiitic lava, which appeared to be rare on the seamount.|$|E
50|$|Several sub-types of the Western dialect {{exist or}} {{appear to be}} {{currently}} in formation. A noticeable California Vowel Shift has been observed in the English of some California speakers scattered throughout the state, though especially younger and coastal speakers. This shift involves two elements, including that the vowel in words like toe, rose, and go (though remaining back vowels elsewhere in the Western dialect), and the vowel in words like spoon, move, and rude are both pronounced farther forward in the mouth than most other English dialects; at the same time, a lowering <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> of the front vowels is occurring (identical to the Canadian Vowel Shift), so that, to listeners of other English dialects, sit may approach the sound of set, set may approach sat, and sat may approach sot. This front-vowel lowering is also reported around Portland, Oregon, the hub of a unique Northwestern variety of American English that demonstrates other similarities with Canadian English. A trend evident particularly in some speakers from the Salt Lake City, Utah and Flagstaff, Arizona areas, {{as well as in}} some Californian and New Mexican English, is the completion or transition towards a full-fool merger.|$|E

Also, various nanocomposites show a reduction in tan δ peak height as compared to those of respective neat elastomers.

50|$|Air {{pressure}} {{changes in}} the ear canal cause the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and middle ear ossicles. At {{the end of the}} ossicular <b>chain,</b> <b>movement</b> of the stapes footplate within the oval window of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the basilar membrane. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the organ of Corti: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each Fourier component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position. When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.|$|E
50|$|Once riders {{board the}} six-passenger raft, the moving {{platform}} the raft shortly bonds to releases its grips and sends the raft spinning off, {{slowly at first}} but reaching quick speeds at points. At first, riders are teased into thinking the ride is calm, but it soon picks up when water jets shoot water opposite {{the direction of the}} current, causing white water and rapids. After barely avoiding being drenched by a statue fountain, the raft spins by a balcony with twenty-five cent machines that activate water squirters that try to wet riders. After sliding down a short drop, the raft then races to a pool, keeping the raft on-track only by column ruins that look too far apart. At this point, the Apollo's Chariot roller coaster swoops directly above. Next, rapids carry the raft towards four large waterfalls which are almost impossible to not be drenched from. Passengers are then taken up a hill to be returned to the boarding platform. Due to the unpredictability of the rapids and the <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> patterns at the station, riders will rarely go through the same experience on the ride twice (i.e. one person catching all 3 waterfalls at the end on one ride and the same person catching none the next time they ride). 2016 saw the iconic waterfalls turned off and replaced with sprinklers. While the sprinklers do a better job at getting everyone wet, the dramatic ending to the ride now feels diminished.|$|E

40|$|Typical {{polymers}} have a time-dependent {{response to}} loading {{which results in}} stress relaxation or creep. Models using springs/dashpots or Volterra integrals are capable of predicting the material response, but place little or no emphasis on the reasoning behind the response. This research proposes a microscopic reasoning behind polymer <b>chain</b> <b>movement,</b> while developing a model to predict the creep and stress relaxation of a polymer foam.

40|$|James abacus diagram is a {{graphical}} representation for any partition µ {{of a positive}} integer t. One way of producing the diagram is by using beta number with the special number of even columns e, where e � 2. This paper constructs a new method for partition µ with a single motion of nested <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> of length 1 in James abacus diagram. First, {{the establishment of an}} arithmetic sequence among the nested chains of the diagram position is considered. Then, for the movement, we select several beta numbers as the initial points in every chain. The location {{of the rest of the}} beta numbers in the James abacus diagram would be changed anticlockwise by length 1 accordingly when the positions of initial beta numbers are changed. Using these new nested chains, a new diagram Atc 1 that displays a new partition, is constructed. Furthermore, guides, which are finite number of partitions that are obtained from the original partition after adding zeros, are developed. The number of common beta numbers among these developed guides are then determined. We have established rules to obtain new diagram using a single motion of nested <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> of length 1. The new diagram can be used in areas of number theory and design.

40|$|During cotranslational protein {{integration}} into the ER membrane, each transmembrane (TM) segment moves laterally through the translocon to reach the lipid bilayer. Photocrosslinking studies reveal that a particular surface of each nascent chain TM α helix and signal-anchor sequence always faces Sec 61 α in the translocon. This nonrandom and TM sequence-dependent positioning reveals that each TM segment makes specific contacts with Sec 61 α and is retained at a fixed location within the translocon, observations that are best explained by the binding of each TM sequence to a translocon protein(s). Since TM sequence hydrophobicity does not correlate with its rate of release from the translocon, nascent <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> through the translocon appears to be mediated primarily by protein-protein interactions rather than hydrophobic nascent chain-phospholipid interactions...|$|E

40|$|Most {{membrane}} {{proteins in}} eukaryotic cells are co-translationally {{integrated into the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane at aqueous pores termed translocons. During multi-spanning membrane protein (MSMP) integration, the nascent polypeptide is threaded into the translocon pore where each successive transmembrane segment (TMS) is moved laterally through the translocon into the bilayer. The hydrophilic polypeptide segments {{on each side of}} the TMS are alternately directed into either the aqueous cytosol or the aqueous ER lumen. How is the ER membrane permeability barrier maintained during this process? For a single-spanning signal-cleaved membrane protein, nascent <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> into the lumen occurs while an ion-tight ribosome-translocon junction prevents ion flow through the translocon pore. Prior to opening this junction to allow nascent <b>chain</b> <b>movement</b> into the cytosol, BiP (Hsp 70 binding protein) effects closure at the lumenal end of the pore to maintain the membrane permeability barrier. To determine whether the ribosome and BiP alternately mediate pore closure during the integration of a MSMP, integration intermediates with nascent chains of different lengths were prepared with a fluorescent probe positioned in the nascent chain far inside the ribosomal tunnel. Nascent chain exposure to the cytosol or lumen was then detected by the collisional quenching of the probe by iodide ions located on either the cytosolic or lumenal side of the membrane. While the first TMS through the tunnel caused the ribosome-translocon junction to open, the second TMS elicited both the closure of this junction and the opening of the lumenal end of the pore. Movement of a third TMS through the tunnel caused the ribosome-translocon junction to re-open after closure of the lumenal end. Pore opening and closing occurred after each TMS was 4 - 7 residues from the peptidyltransferase center, irrespective of TMS location in the nascent chain. The ribosome treated all TMSs in the same manner, regardless of their individual sequence or their native orientation. The ER membrane permeability barrier is maintained by ribosome-translocon interactions during cotranslational MSMP integration...|$|E
