40|$|Objective: The {{reasons that}} doctors may refuse or be {{reluctant}} to treat have not been widely explored in the medical literature. To understand the ethical implications of reluctance to treat {{there is a need}} to recognise the constraints of doctors working in complex systems and to consider how these constraints may influence reluctance. The aim of this paper is to illustrate these constraints using the case of <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> in the Australian context. Design: Between September and December 2012, a qualitative investigation involving face-to-face semistructured interviews examined the knowledge, attitudes and practices of general practitioners (GPs) facilitating return to work in people with compensable injuries. Setting: <b>Compensable</b> <b>injury</b> management in general practice in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 25 GPs who were treating, or had treated a patient with <b>compensable</b> <b>injury.</b> Results: The practice of clinicians refusing treatment was described by all participants. While most GPs reported refusal to treat among their colleagues in primary and specialist care, many participants also described their own reluctance to treat people with compensable injuries. Reasons offered included time and financial burdens, in addition to the clinical complexities involved in <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> management. Conclusions: In the case of <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> management, reluctance and refusal to treat is likely to have a domino effect by increasing the time and financial burden of clinically complex patients on the remaining clinicians. This may present a significant challenge to an effective, sustainable compensation system. Urgent research is needed to understand the extent and implications of reluctance and refusal to treat and to identify strategies to engage clinicians in treating people with compensable injuries...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the long-term injury outcomes for workers in companies {{from a range of}} industries which had been randomly allocated to receive ergonomics interventions tailored according to the stage of change (SOC) approach or standard ergonomics advice. Differences in <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> outcomes between the groups were analysed using logistic regression models. Questionnaire results from face-to-face interviews to assess musculoskeletal pain and discomfort (MSPD), job satisfaction and other factors were also analysed. Although not significant at the 0. 05 level, after adjusting for workgroup clustering, workers in receipt of tailored advice were 55 % (OR = 0. 45, 95 % CI = 0. 19 - 1. 08) less likely to report a <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> than those in receipt of standard ergonomics advice.

40|$|Objective This study {{highlights}} the serious consequences of ignoring reverse causality bias in studies on compensation-related factors and health outcomes and demonstrates a technique for resolving {{this problem of}} observational data. Study Design and Setting Data from an English longitudinal study on factors, including claims for compensation, associated with recovery from neck pain (whiplash) after rear-end collisions are used to demonstrate the potential for reverse causality bias. Although it is commonly believed that claiming compensation leads to worse recovery, {{it is also possible}} that poor recovery may lead to compensation claimsâ€”a point that is seldom considered and never addressed empirically. This pedagogical study compares the association between compensation claiming and recovery when reverse causality bias is ignored and when it is addressed, controlling for the same observable factors. Results When reverse causality is ignored, claimants appear to have a worse recovery than nonclaimants; however, when reverse causality bias is addressed, claiming compensation appears to have a beneficial effect on recovery, ceteris paribus.

In part III, I use this proposed theory of warranted direct inference to reconceptualize a number of the important legal issues involved in the lost chance cases, and I suggest guidelines for deciding motions for summary judgment or directed verdict and for framing jury instructions in such cases. In particular, I suggest that a number of the fairness concerns that courts have sought to address by modifying the legal concepts of causation or <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> are no longer pressing, once certain confusions about direct inference have been cleared away.

40|$|Background. Housekeeping is an {{important}} aspect of safety in the workplace. There have been {{only a limited number of}} studies assessing the impact on injury of housekeeping. In addition, measuring the state of housekeeping has posed continuous problems in these studies due to the lack of standardized and objective instrumentation. Objectives. The objectives of the first part of this thesis involved the development and evaluation of an instrument for measuring the state of housekeeping in industry. The second part examined the association between housekeeping and safety. Methods. This study began with the development of a checklist for evaluating housekeeping and proceeded to a fifteen-month prospective cohort study of fifty-seven companies in the transportation equipment and machinery manufacturing sector in Quebec, Canada, each employing between twenty and sixty workers. Companies were followed over 16 months to evaluate housekeeping levels. At the end of the study, information on <b>compensable</b> <b>injuries</b> that occurred during the study period was obtained. Results. Inter-observer reliability of the instrument was reasonably high (ICC 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 81 [...] 0. 94) though test-retest reliability was less stable (ICC 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 68 [...] 0. 78). In the second part of this study, housekeeping was found to be significantly associated with both injury rates (IRR 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 08 [...] 1. 70) and rate of days lost (IRR 1. 48, 95 % CI 1. 39 [...] 1. 57), and trends were seen across categorical housekeeping levels. The association between cleanliness and safety was not as strong, nor was a trend found. Conclusions. The housekeeping checklist demonstrated high inter-observer reliability. The less stable test-retest reliability is partly due to changes in housekeeping between visits.

40|$|Whiplash is a <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> in many jurisdictions, {{but there}} is {{considerable}} heterogeneity in the compensation arrangements that apply across jurisdictions, even within some countries. These compensation schemes have, however, been subject to {{a common set of}} interrelated concerns, chiefly concerning the incentives, behaviors, and outcomes that may arise when financial compensation for injuries is available to injured parties. This article provides a nontechnical overview of some of those concerns through the lens of economics: principally, insurance economics and health economics, including related subsets such as information economics and agency theory, as well as economics and the law. It notes that because it is generally infeasible to randomize the treatment (ie, compensation) via trials, analyses of observational data are necessary to discover more about the relationship between compensation and health outcomes. This poses the analytical challenge of discovering causal connections between phenomena from nonrandomized data sets. The present article calls for further research that would enable convincing causal interpretations of such relationships via the careful analysis of rich observational data sets using modern econometric methods...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Although {{occupational}} {{injuries are}} among the leading causes of death and disability around the world, the burden due to occupational injuries has historically been under-recognized, obscuring the need to address a major public health problem. Methods: We established the Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index (LMWSI) to provide a reliable annual metric of the leading causes {{of the most serious}} workplace injuries in the United States based on direct workers compensation (WC) costs. Results: More than $ 600 billion in direct WC costs were spent on the most disabling <b>compensable</b> non-fatal <b>injuries</b> and illnesses in the United States from 1998 to 2010. The burden in 2010 remained similar to the burden in 1998 in real terms. The categories of overexertion ($ 13. 6 B, 2010) and fall on same level ($ 8. 6 B, 2010) were consistently ranked 1 st and 2 nd.

Such a ranking might be used to develop research goals and interventions to reduce the burden of workplace injury in the United States...|$|R
40|$|One {{might expect}} that injury {{compensation}} would leave injured parties better off than they would otherwise have been, yet many believe that compensation does more harm than good. This study systematically reviews the evidence on this "compensation hypothesis" in relation to <b>compensable</b> whiplash <b>injuries.</b> PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, PsycInfo, CCTR, Lexis, and EconLit were searched from the date of their inception to April 2010 to locate longitudinal studies, published in English, comparing the health outcomes of adults exposed/not exposed to compensation-related factors. Studies concerning serious neck injuries, using claimants only, or using proxy measures of health outcomes were excluded. Eleven studies were included. These examined the effect of lawyer involvement, litigation, claim submission, or previous claims on pain and other health outcomes. Among the 16 results reported were 9 statistically significant negative associations between compensation-related factors and health outcomes. Irrespective of the compensation-related factor involved and the health outcome measured, the quality of these studies was similar to studies that did not find a significant negative association: most took some measures to address selection bias, confounding, and measurement bias, and none resolved the potential for reverse causality bias that arises {{in the relationship between}} compensation-related factors and health. Unless ambiguous causal pathways are addressed, one cannot draw conclusions from statistical associations, regardless of their statistical significance and the extent of measures to address other sources of bias.

40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{descriptive}} study investigating {{the effect of}} access to motor vehicle accident (MVA) compensation on recovery outcomes at 24 months after injury. Design and setting: Longitudinal cohort study conducted in two Level 1 trauma hospitals in Victoria, Australia. Participants were 391 randomly selected injury patients with moderate-to-severe <b>injuries.</b> <b>Compensable</b> and non-compensable patients were compared at 24 months after injury {{on a number of}} health outcomes. Main outcome measures: Health outcomes at 24 months, including anxiety and depression severity, quality of life and disability. Results: Medical records identified two groups of compensation patients: MVA-compensable and non-compensable patients. After controlling for baseline variables, the MVA-compensable patients, at 24 months, had higher levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, and were less likely to have returned to their pre-injury number of work hours. However, some patients in the non-compensable group had accessed other forms of compensation (eg, private health care or compensation for victims of crime). When these were removed from the non-compensable group, the differences between MVA-compensable and non-compensable groups all but disappeared. Conclusion: Our findings do not support previous research showing that access to compensation is associated with poor recovery outcomes. The relationship between access to compensation and health outcomes is complex, and more high-level research is required.

40|$|A "wrongful life" suit {{is based}} on the purported {{tortious}} liability of a genetic counsellor towards an infant with hereditary defects, with the latter asserting that he or she would not have been born at all if not for the counsellor's negligence. This negligence allegedly lies in the failure {{on the part of the}} defendant adequately to advice the parents or to conduct properly the relevant testing and thereby prevent the child's conception or birth (where unimpaired life was not possible). This paper will offer support for the thesis that it would be both feasible and desirable to endorse "wrongful life" compensation actions. The genetic counsellor owed a duty of due professional care to the impaired newborn who now claims that but for the counsellor's negligence, he or she would not have been born at all. The plaintiff's defective life (where healthy life was never an option) constitutes a <b>compensable</b> <b>injury.</b> A sufficient causal link may exist between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant's breach of duty of due professional care and an appropriate measure of damages can be allocated to the disabled newborn.

40|$|Patients {{with pain}} often {{feel that their}} {{suffering}} is taken lightly, dismissed or denied. Before the introduction of anesthesia, pain was regarded as an awful affliction. This view diminished somewhat once anesthesia became available, although it still holds true for some forms of pain, eg, pain associated with terminal cancer. Pain was then treated as less troublesome when it became a reason for disability compensation to be paid. Examples are given of the disparagement of complaints by individuals reporting pain in the past 150 years. Factors that encourage doctors to underestimate patients' pain include the requirement for doctors to control the issue of narcotics; circumstances in which patients may benefit from compensation by claiming that their pain is great; {{and the development of}} attitudes that understate the importance of the relief of pain and overstate the importance of activity, exercise and not complaining. Current attitudes in this respect are associated with the insurance industry, but it has been shown that, even patients who do not have a <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> or have pain that is not disabling fail to receive the treatment for pain that is appropriate, eg, postoperatively. The present paper reviews and discusses these problems and suggests that disparagement of pain and disability in the medicolegal field also leads to the rejection of pain in other contexts...|$|E

Previous {{research has shown that}} perceived injustice is associated with poorer physical and mental wellbeing in persons with chronic pain. This study aimed to identify the relative association between injury, compensation and pain-related characteristics and perceived injustice 12 -months after traumatic injury. 433 participants were recruited from the Victorian Orthopedic Trauma Outcomes Registry and Victorian State Trauma Registry, and completed questionnaires at 12 - 14 months after injury as part of an observational cohort study. Using hierarchical linear regression we examined the relationships between baseline demographics (sex, age, education, comorbidities), injury (injury severity, hospital length of stay), compensation (compensation status, fault, lawyer involvement), and health outcomes (SF- 12) and perceived injustice. We then examined how much additional variance in perceived injustice was related to worse pain severity, interference, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia or disability. Only a small portion of variance in perceived injustice was related to baseline demographics (especially education level), and injury severity. Attribution of fault to another, consulting a lawyer, health-related quality of life, disability and the severity of pain-related cognitions explained the majority of variance in perceived injustice. While univariate analyses showed that <b>compensable</b> <b>injury</b> led to higher perceptions of injustice, this did not remain significant when adjusting for all other factors, including fault attribution and consulting a lawyer. In addition to the "justice" aspects of traumatic injury, the health impacts of injury, emotional distress related to pain (catastrophizing), and the perceived impact of pain on activity (pain self-efficacy), had stronger associations with perceptions of injustice than either injury or pain severity. To attenuate the likelihood of poor recovery from injury, clinical interventions that support restoration of health-related quality of life, and adjustment to the impacts of trauma are needed...|$|E
