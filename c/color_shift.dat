25|$|Perception {{of color}} depends {{heavily on the}} context in which the {{perceived}} object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, 2 new {{television}} ads (Crowd, <b>Color</b> <b>Shift)</b> were produced by Lexus' agency of record, Team One, with Original music from Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, and directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The 'Crowd' ad emphasizes that things designed to draw a crowd are good, but leaving the crowd behind is more rewarding. The 'Color Shift' ad shows it's more fun and exciting to blend out than blend in. The Two additional ads (This is Your Move, Intense) were created by Lexus' multicultural agency, Walton Isaacson, {{as part of the}} campaign. 'This is Your Move' was geared to the African-American audience, features Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp as he searches for something that matches his ambitious and driven personality. 'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVery-long-term (VLT) {{chromatic}} adaptation results {{from exposure to}} an altered chromatic environment for days or weeks. <b>Color</b> <b>shifts</b> from VLT adaptation are observed hours or days after leaving the altered environment. Short-term {{chromatic adaptation}}, on the other hand, results from exposure {{for a few minutes}} or less, with <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> measured within seconds or a few minutes after the adapting light is extinguished; recovery to the pre-adapted state is complete in less than an hour. Here, both types of adaptation were combined. All adaptation was to reddish-appearing long-wavelength light. Shifts in unique yellow were measured following adaptation. Previous studies demonstrate shifts in unique yellow due to VLT chromatic adaptation, but shifts from short-term chromatic adaptation to comparable adapting light can be far greater than from VLT adaptation. The question considered here is whether the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> from VLT adaptation are cumulative with large shifts from short-term adaptation or, alternatively, does simultaneous short-term adaptation eliminate <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> caused by VLT adaptation. The results show the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> from VLT and short-term adaptation together are cumulative, which indicates that both short-term and very-long-term chromatic adaptation affect color perception during natural viewing...|$|R

AFFS was developed by Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd, Korea (formally Hyundai Electronics, LCD Task Force). AFFS-applied notebook applications minimize color distortion while maintaining a wider viewing angle for a professional display. <b>Color</b> <b>shift</b> and deviation caused by light leakage is corrected by optimizing the white gamut which also enhances white/gray reproduction. In 2004, Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd licensed AFFS to Japan's Hitachi Displays. Hitachi is using AFFS to manufacture high-end panels. In 2006, HYDIS licensed AFFS to Sanyo Epson Imaging Devices Corporation. Shortly thereafter, Hydis introduced a high-transmittance evolution of the AFFS display, called HFFS (FFS+). Hydis introduced AFFS+ with improved outdoor readability in 2007. AFFS panels are mostly utilized in the cockpits of latest commercial aircraft displays.

40|$|A {{multiple}} color-filter aperture (MCA) camera {{can provide}} depth information {{as well as}} color and intensity in the single-camera framework, where the MCA generates misalignment between color channels depending on the distance of a region-of-interest. In this paper, we present a single camera-based estimation of the full depth map using the <b>color</b> <b>shifting</b> property of the MCA. For estimating the <b>color</b> <b>shifting</b> vectors (CSVs) among red, green, and blue color channels, edges are extracted at each color channel. At the edge, we estimate CSVs using normalized cross correlation combined with <b>color</b> <b>shifting</b> mask map. A full depth map is then generated by depth interpolation using the matting Laplacian method from sparsely estimated CSVs at an edge location. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can not only estimate the full depth map but also correct the misaligned color image to generate photorealistic color images using a single camera equipped with MCA.

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of objects, illuminants, and transparencies {{are probably the}} most important perceptual functions of color. This paper examines the effects of perceptual scission, image junctions, color adaptation, and color correlations on identification. Simulations of natural illuminants, materials, and filters were used in a forced-choice procedure to simultaneously measure thresholds for identifying filters and objects across illuminants, and discrimination thresholds within illuminants. In {{the vast majority of the}} cases, if observers could discriminate within illuminants they could identify across illuminants. Since results were similar for identical color distributions, whether transparency cues like X-junctions were present or not, the primary cues for color identification were systematic <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> across illuminants. These <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> can be well described by three-parameter affine transformations, and the parameters can be derived from differences and ratios of mean chromaticities. A strategy based on post-transformation color matching predicts generally accurate identification despite perceptible <b>color</b> <b>shifts,</b> and also provides plausible reasons for those few conditions where identification thresholds are significantly higher than discrimination thresholds...|$|R
