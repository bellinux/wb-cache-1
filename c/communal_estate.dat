She and Leary had developed a close friendship in 1966 after Graboi gave him her paper Evolution in Search of a New Breed of Man. Graboi frequently spent time at Millbrook with a group gathered around Leary to study the mind-expanding effects of LSD. Her first [...] trip there was at the Meditation House.|$|E
50|$|In {{most other}} Prussian provinces the tasks and {{rights of a}} Bezirksverband were {{fulfilled}} by the Provinzialverband (provincial association), comprising as members all the counties in a province instead of a region. The Nassau Communal Diet elected a regional government (first Verwaltungsausschuss, later Landesausschuss, i.e. administrative / land committee) presided over by the Landesdirektor (i.e. land director) or Landeshauptmann (i.e. land captain). On 8 June 1885 the Kommunalständischer Verband Frankfurt (i.e. <b>Communal</b> <b>Estate</b> Association of Frankfurt), holding the same responsibilities in {{the territory of the}} former Free City of Frankfurt upon Main, was merged into the regional association of Wiesbaden. The same reform enfranchised the Nassau Communal Diet to elect representatives for the newly established provincial diet of the Province of Hesse-Nassau, first convened in 1886.|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} my paper {{is a legal}} {{arrangement}} regarding <b>communal</b> <b>estate</b> in the Czech Republic. This legal institute comes into power {{as a result of}} contracting marriage, which is done by the majority of people {{at some point in their}} lives. Marriage is a long- lasting union of a man and a woman and the <b>communal</b> <b>estate,</b> then, solves the legal and estate arrangements between the spouses and between the married couple and third persons. There have been different arrangements of such concerns throughout the historical and legal development, each of which depended on social and economical conditions of the time. Nowadays, the situation is certainly not perfect, but it can be said that it is very extensive and it is believed to become even more extensive and superior due to the new Civil Code, which is supposed to be accepted soon. At the present time, the arrangements of <b>communal</b> <b>estate</b> are to be found in the law no. 40 / 1964 of the Civil Code. In particular, it is a part of the second Head of the law, named Joint ownership and <b>Communal</b> <b>estate,</b> under the term <b>Communal</b> <b>estate.</b> My paper could be divided into three separate parts. In the first one (Chapter II), I describe the historical development of the institute with special regard to the development of the legal arrangement from the time of the Roman Law, [...] ...|$|E

The <b>communal</b> housing <b>estate</b> [...] "Freidorf" [...] in Muttenz and [...] "Wasserhaus" [...] in Münchenstein are two prime examples of this evolution. These estates were developed to enhance the social charm in the rural community.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this war}} was less deadly {{than the first}} in the region, the {{population}} of the region continued to decline. In 1950 the first tractors appeared and revolutionized the agricultural basis of life in the region. In the 1960s due to the expansion of the economy in Toulouse many parts of Lauragais experienced prosperity but Baraigne was too far away to share this experience. In 1970 a second decline was due to the departure of young people. After consolidation in 1990 there were only four farmers sharing the land in the commune. In 1980 the municipality reacted with the establishment of a <b>communal</b> housing <b>estate</b> entirely occupied by young families working in the tertiary sector in Castelnaudary and even Toulouse. In 1990 the creation of social structures (community centre, tennis club etc.) was followed in 2006 by the creation of a second subdivision to deal with the population explosion of the metropolis of Toulouse.|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} lying {{ahead of}} the urban areas, specifically cities are formidable. These include growing population, air pollution, congestion, energy efficiency and demand for high quality of living. Although they are varied and can appear as seemingly unrelated, they more often appear on international agendas of the United Nations, European Union and various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) under umbrella of sustainability or more often as green agenda. This book is {{an introduction to the}} dynamically developing and evolving area of green innovations taking place in contemporary cities, with a specific focus on the European and North American examples. It is divided into three interconnected parts, each prepared by a separate author specialising in the areas like <b>communal</b> services, real <b>estate</b> and information technologies. First, authored by doctor Dominika P. Brodowicz focuses on green urban models and challenges facing 21 st century cities. Second, developed by IT specialist and doctoral researcher Przemysław Pospieszny presents green transportation and smart technological innovations. Third, compiled by Professor Zbigniew Grzymała relates to European and American legal requirements and strategies towards eco-cities development. This publication was supported by grant funds from the European Union’s European Social Fund. The project “Eco-innovations in cities”, performed at the Warsaw School of Economics, was commissioned by the Polish National Centre for Research and Development (POKL. 04. 03. 00 - 00 - 249 / 12).
