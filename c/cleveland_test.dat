50|$|In September 2013, she {{received}} adverse publicity for failing <b>Cleveland</b> Police's fitness <b>test.</b> She {{was believed to}} be the first chief officer to fail, although a force spokesman said that as she was in a non-operational role, she was not required to take, (or by implication, pass) the test.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the importance of urban governmental activities draws attention to municipal expenditures and to the municipal operating budget. Little effort has been directed toward the question of how municipalities allocate resources. The work reported here represents an attempt to develop a positive theory of municipal resource allocation for large metropolitan communities and to subject this theory to empirical <b>tests.</b> <b>Cleveland,</b> Detroit, and Pittsburgh are used as data points. ...|$|R
25|$|P-38s {{were popular}} contenders {{in the air}} races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making {{screaming}} turns around the pylons at Reno and <b>Cleveland.</b> Lockheed <b>test</b> pilot Tony LeVier {{was among those who}} bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an air racer and stunt flyer. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the Confederate Air Force, bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it White Lightnin; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. White Lightnin was severely damaged in a crash landing during an air show demonstration and was bought, restored and repainted with a brilliant chrome finish by the company that owns Red Bull. The aircraft is now located in Austria.|$|R
40|$|Rainbow schlieren deflectometry {{combined}} with high-speed digital imaging {{was used to}} study buoyancy effects on flow structure of a helium jet discharged vertically into air. The experimental data were taken using the 2. 2 -sec drop tower facility at the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center in <b>Cleveland,</b> Ohio. The <b>test</b> conditions pertained to jet Reynolds number of 490 and jet Richardson number of 0. 11, for which buoyancy is often considered unimportant. Experimental results show global oscillations at a frequency of 27 Hz in Earth gravity. In microgravity, the jet oscillations vanished and the jet width increased. Results provide a direct physical evidence {{of the importance of}} buoyancy on the flow structure of low-density gas jets at a Richardson number considered too small to account for gravity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 This study {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of volcanic SO₂ using TIR satellite-based and UV ground-based measurements at volcanoes in the North Pacific during eruptions and low level degassing. The ASTER and MODIS sensors with spatial resolutions of 0. 09 and 1. 0 km, respectively, are used to quantify SO₂ from the 8. 6 um absorption feature of the gas species. Three volcanoes within this region were studied: Mt. <b>Cleveland</b> to <b>test</b> {{the implementation of the}} MAP ̲SO 2 software, Bezymianny to determine the sensitivity of the algorithm to input parameters during eruption conditions, and Shishaldin to evaluate {{the detection of}} SO₂ during low level degassing. Total SO₂ estimates from the January 2004 Bezymianny eruption range from 15. 5 kt to 87. 2 kt at 0210 UTC depending on the input parameters. An emission rate of 0. 295 kt·min⁻¹ and transport rate of 16. 6 m·s⁻¹ were estimated from time sequential MODIS passes. SO₂ flux estimates at Shishaldin Volcano on 26 May 2004 were 164 t·day⁻¹ from ASTER and 58 t·day⁻¹ on 31 July 2004 from MUSe. The data show that SO₂ during low level degassing and eruptive conditions can be detected in the region and the sensors from this study provide a detection continuum from low to high SO₂ concentrations...|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{obtained}} a P-61C from Air Research and Development Command {{for a series}} of drop tests of swept-wing aerodynamic drones at Moffett Field, California. Much engineering data was obtained from these tests. An RP-61C, AF Ser. No. 45-59300, thus became the last operational USAF P-61 to be retired {{at the end of the}} NACA testing in 1953. A second P-61C (AF Ser. No. 43-8330) which was still flyable was obtained from the Smithsonian Institution by NACA in October 1950 for these tests, and remained in use by NACA until 9 August 1954, being the last P-61 in government use. This aircraft is now on public display at the NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. [...] P-61B-15NO, AF Ser. No. 42-39754, was used by NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in <b>Cleveland,</b> Ohio for <b>tests</b> of airfoil-type ramjets. P-61C-1NO, AF Ser. No. 43-8357, was used at Ames as a source for spare parts for other P-61 and RP-61 aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The prior {{regional}} tests {{prior to}} the second National Test were supposed {{to solve the problems}} in the 2011 test, but some problems noticed before came to the forefront once more. Once again, some DirecTV viewers could not hear the test, though no music was playing in the background. Some viewers on other networks such as DISH did not even receive the test. One PEP system (WKYC-TV in <b>Cleveland)</b> saw the <b>test</b> crawl line, then froze and reverted to a static screen. The subsequent screen had the header and attention signal volume up loud enough to cause hearing loss, and could be heard from a block away, which then cut back to the EOM blasts on a regular screen. [...] This National Periodic was limited to Primary Entry Point outlets in some states (such as KHON-TV and KSSK radio (both in Hawaii), and WKYC-TV in Cleveland) and not as widespread as in 2011, though some viewers called in with complaints about the absent test.|$|R
40|$|A {{counterflow}} virtual impactor (CVI) {{designed for}} aircraft use was evaluated at the NASA Icing Research Tunnel in <b>Cleveland,</b> Ohio. <b>Tests</b> were conducted for tunnel speeds of 67 and 100 m s⁻¹, for liquid water contents of 0. 23 – 1. 4 g m⁻³, {{and for a}} wide range of droplet median volume diameters (MVDs). For droplet distributions with MVDs between about 30 and 240 μm, liquid water content (LWC) measured by the CVI agreed with reference values within the uncertainty of the measurements. For a range of LWCs at 30 -μm MVD, the relationship was near 1 : 1, and no systematic dependence of CVI results on LWC or airspeed was observed. For smaller MVDs, the CVI underestimated LWC. Decreased collection efficiency for small droplets can partially explain this effect, but the difference from reference values was larger than expected based on previous calibrations and comparisons with in situ data. Tunnel runs conducted with a flow-straightening shroud around the CVI inlet produced approximately 20 % enhancements in LWC at small MVDs, which are expected for these speeds based on previous modeling studies. The effect of large drop breakup on CVI droplet number concentration was evaluated both theoretically and experimentally; drop breakup was predicted to occur for drops larger than 169 μm at 67 m s⁻¹ and larger than 76 μm at 100 m s⁻¹. Enhancement in number concentration measured by the CVI was found to be strongly related to observed large drop concentrations, particularly to those in the 312 – 700 -μm-diameter range...|$|R
40|$|Unlike a {{terrestrial}} {{electric utility}} which can purchase power from a neighboring utility, the Space Station Freedom (SSF) has strictly limited energy resources; as a result, source control, system monitoring, system protection, and load management {{are essential to}} the safe and efficient operation of the SSF Electric Power System (EPS). These functions are being evaluated in the dc Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) Testbed which NASA LeRC has developed at the Power System Facility (PSF) located in <b>Cleveland,</b> Ohio. The <b>testbed</b> is an ideal platform to develop, integrate, and verify power system monitoring and control algorithms. State Estimation (SE) is a monitoring tool used extensively in terrestrial electric utilities to ensure safe power system operation. It uses redundant system information to calculate the actual state of the EPS, to isolate faulty sensors, to determine source operating points, to verify faults detected by subsidiary controllers, and to identify high impedance faults. Source control and monitoring safeguard the power generation and storage subsystems and ensure that the power system operates within safe limits while satisfying user demands with minimal interruptions. System monitoring functions, in coordination with hardware implemented schemes, provide for a complete fault protection system. The objective {{of this paper is to}} overview the development and integration of the state estimator and the source control algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; {{formerly}} National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, or NCCLS) M 38 -A {{standard for}} the susceptibility testing of filamentous fungi does not specifically address the testing of dermatophytes. In 2003, a multicenter study investigated the reproducibility of the microdilution method developed at the Center for Medical Mycology, <b>Cleveland,</b> Ohio, for <b>testing</b> the susceptibility of dermatophytes. Data from that study supported the introduction of this method for testing dermatophytes in the future version of the CLSI M 38 -A standard. In order for the method {{to be accepted by}} CLSI, appropriate quality control isolates needed to be identified. To that end, an interlaboratory study, involving the original six laboratories plus two additional sites, was conducted to evaluate potential candidates for quality control isolates. These candidate strains included five Trichophyton rubrum strains known to have elevated MICs to terbinafine and five Trichophyton mentagrophytes strains. Antifungal agents tested included ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, posaconazole, terbinafine, and voriconazole. Based on the data generated, two quality control isolates, one T. rubrum isolate and one T. mentagrophytes isolate, were identified and submitted to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for inclusion as reference strains. Ranges encompassing 95. 2 to 97. 9 % of all data points for all seven drugs were established...|$|R
