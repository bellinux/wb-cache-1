25|$|It {{is likely}} that the Lambroughton {{mentioned}} in the early records refer to the site the farm now known as Townhead of Lambroughton. Pont records a Mains of Lambrochtoun in 1604 and as the term 'mains' refers to the home farm of an estate, cultivated by or for the 'owner', then we <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the main dwelling was here or hereabouts. The 'place ' of Lambroughtoun is mentioned in 1544. It should be noted that it was the custom of a landowner or farmer to take the name of the land which he owned or cultivated.|$|E

On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in decreasing significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes {{from left to right}} in decreasing significance: 0Ah at +0, 0Bh at +1, 0Ch at +2, 0Dh at +3.|$|E
25|$|Because the Histeridae {{family can}} be found on carrion, they have proven to be {{important}} in certain forensic investigations. The predacious Hister beetles will feed on the various insects on the body, primarily Diptera.

If the Histeridae beetles are present, the investigator <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> some of the other insects have been eaten by the Hister beetles. Due to their importance in forensic entomology, research is continually being conducted on this family's life cycle and development, their prevalence in specific locations, and their geographical distribution.|$|E

25|$|Religions {{are filled}} with {{different}} fears that humans have had throughout many centuries. The fears aren't just metaphysical (including the problems of life and death) but are also moral. Death {{is seen as a}} boundary to another world. That world would always be different depending on how each individual lived their lives. The origins of this intangible fear are not found in the present world. In a sense we <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> fear was a big influence on things such as morality. This assumption, however, {{flies in the face of}} concepts such as moral absolutism and moral universalism – which would hold that our morals are rooted in either the divine or natural laws of the universe, and would not be generated by any human feeling, thought or emotion.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.|$|E

[...] Major characters, like Angelou's stepfather Daddy Clidell, disappear after their initial mention.
