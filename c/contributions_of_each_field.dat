40|$|A {{stripline}} kicker {{operates as}} two coupled transmission lines, with two TEM operating modes, known as odd and even modes. The characteristic impedance {{of these two}} modes is generally different, both only tend to the same value either when the electrodes are widely separated or when the electrodes {{are very close to}} the beam pipe wall. In all other cases, the even mode characteristic impedance is always higher than the odd mode characteristic impedance. The specifications required for a kicker operating in a low emittance ring are usually very challenging. In this situation it is desirable to match the even mode characteristic impedance of the striplines to the resistance of their termination. However a mismatched odd mode impedance can significantly influence the striplines performance. This paper presents predictions for the influence of the odd mode characteristic impedance upon the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>field</b> component, electric and magnetic, to the deflection angle. In addition, the variation of the characteristic impedance and field homogeneity with frequency are presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{looking for}} {{imprints}} of extra dimensions in brane world models one usually builts these {{so that they}} are compatible with known low energy physics and thus focuses on high energy effects. Nevertheless, just as submillimeter Newton's law tests probe the mode structure of gravity other low energy tests might apply to matter. As a model example, in this work we determine the 4 D Casimir force corresponding to a scalar field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on two parallel planes lying within the single brane of a Randall-Sundrum scenario extended by one compact extra dimension. Using the Green's function method such a force picks the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>field</b> mode as if it acted individually but with a weight given by the square of the mode wave functions on the brane. In the low energy regime one regains the standard 4 D Casimir force that is associated to a zero mode in the massless case or to a quasilocalized or resonant mode in the massive one whilst the effect of the extra dimensions gets encoded as an additional term.

40|$|AbstractProtecting water {{bodies from}} eutrophication, {{ensuring}} long-term food security and shifting to a circular economy represent compelling objectives to phosphorus management strategies. This study determines how {{and to which}} extent the management of phosphorus in Austria can be optimized. A detailed national model, obtained for the year 2013 through Material Flow Analysis, represents the reference situation. Applicability and limitations are discussed {{for a range of}} actions aimed at reducing consumption, increasing recycling, and lowering emissions. The potential <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> action is quantified and compared using three indicators: Import dependency, Consumption of fossil-P fertilizers and Emissions to water bodies. Further, the uncertainty of this assessment is characterized and priorities for the upgrade of data collection are identified. Moreover, all the potential gains discussed in the article are applied to the reference situation to generate an ideal target model. The results show that in Austria a large scope for phosphorus stewardship exists. Strategies based exclusively either on recycling or on the decline of P consumption hold a similar potential to reduce import dependency by 50 % each. An enhanced P recycling from meat and bone meal, sewage sludge and compost could replace the current use of fossil-P fertilizers by 70 %. The target model, i. e. the maximum that could be achieved taking into account trade-offs between different actions, is characterized by an extremely low import dependency of 0. 23 kgPcap− 1 y− 1 (2. 2 kgPcap− 1 y− 1 in 2013), by a 28 % decline of emissions to water bodies and by null consumption of fossil-P fertilizers. This case study shows the added value of using Material Flow Analysis as a basis to design sound management strategies. The systemic approach inherent to it allows performing a proper comparative assessment of different actions, identifying priorities, and visualizing a target model...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that citation counts for papers from different fields cannot be directly compared because different scientific fields adopt different citation practices. Citation counts are also strongly biased by paper age since older papers {{had more time}} to attract citations. Various procedures aim at suppressing these biases and give rise to new normalized indicators, such as the relative citation count. We use a large citation dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph and a new statistical framework based on the Mahalanobis distance to show that the rankings by well known indicators, including the relative citation count and Google's PageRank score, are significantly biased by paper field and age. Our statistical framework to assess ranking bias allows us to exactly quantify the <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> individual <b>field</b> to the overall bias of a given ranking. We propose a general normalization procedure motivated by the z-score which produces much less biased rankings when applied to citation count and PageRank score...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe vibroacoustic {{behavior}} of simply supported plate excited by aeroacoustic pressure field is investigated. Based on analytical {{expressions of the}} Cross Power Spectral Density (CPSD) of an acoustic diffuse field and of a turbulent flow (Corcos's model), a new method is implemented to perform a numerical synthesis of aeroacoustic wall-pressure field. It {{is based on the}} Cholesky decomposition of the analytical CPSD matrices. Then using vibroacoustic FEM calculations, the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> excitation <b>field</b> to acoustic radiation of the plate is analyzed. The inhomogeneity effect on the vibroacoustic {{behavior of}} the plate is also studied for a purely turbulent excitation. It is found that the spatial inhomogeneity effect is small on the averaged quantities such as the mean quadratic vibration velocity and the total radiated acoustic power. Finally, coherence function analysis is performed to investigate the relationship between radiated pressure field and excitation field. It is then emphasized the difficulties in well interpreting these last results especially when dealing with a turbulent component corresponding to an uncorrelated source of excitation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe spatial {{variability}} of soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes is large − {{regardless of the}} study scale − resulting in very large uncertainties in soil N 2 O emission assessments. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess the N 2 O flux at the landscape scale by coupling the results of measurements performed at different scales and to propose a method for obtaining emission maps based on these results. During a 2 -month campaign (mid-March to mid-May 2015), N 2 O fluxes were measured in a small cropland area (∼km 2) (i) continuously at the plot scale using automatic chambers in a wheat field, (ii) punctually on a group of 16 plots including different types of soils and crops using a mobile chamber (fast-box), and (iii) continuously at the landscape scale by eddy covariance using a 15 -m height mast. The soil properties were measured at all sites to provide {{a better understanding of the}} factors controlling the variability of the N 2 O flux. To map the N 2 O emissions of the entire area, two flux attribution methods were evaluated which allowed estimating the N 2 O flux <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>field</b> during the whole period. These methods used a footprint model in combination with fast-box measurements over each crop type to determine the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>field</b> to the flux measured at the eddy covariance mast. Two footprint models were compared (the FIDES, and the Kormann and Meixner models) and two hypotheses on the dependency of N 2 O emissions on crop distribution and soil nitrate contents were tested. Automatic chambers were used to evaluate the attribution methods. The N 2 O fluxes measured by the different methods showed good agreement in magnitude and temporal dynamics, especially when the automatic chambers were in the eddy covariance mast footprint. Overall, the mean measured N 2 O emission was 53 ± 6 μg NeN 2 O m − 2 h − 1 for the automatic chambers, 45 ± 7 NeN 2 O m − 2 h − 1 for the eddy covariance system and 37 ± 9 NeN 2 O m − 2 h − 1 for the fast-box, for periods when both automatic measurement systems were functioning. The N 2 O fluxes measured by the automatic chambers and the fast-box were positively correlated with soil humidity (p < 0. 01), water-filled pore space (p < 0. 01) and nitrate soil content (p < 0. 05). Catch crop-pea and catch crop-corn fields emitted more N 2 O than wheat and rapeseed fields, and much more than forests. Over the whole area during the 2 -month experimental period, the N 2 O flux varied from 0. 18 to 0. 44 kg NeN 2 O ha − 1 month − 1 depending on the attri-bution method and footprint model. The simplest flux attribution method, taking only land use into account, showed very good agreement with the field measurements provided by the automated chambers (10 %– 13 % difference on the mean flux). Our study demonstrates the potential of flux attribution methods for catching {{spatial variability}} of soil N 2 O emission at the landscape scale and reducing uncertainties in its evaluation...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{entanglement}} entropy and the modular Hamiltonian of slightly excited states {{reduced to a}} ball shaped region in generic conformal field theories. We set up a formal expansion in the one point functions {{of the state in}} which all orders are explicitly given in terms of integrals of multi-point functions along the vacuum modular flow, without a need for replica index analytic continuation. We show that the quadratic order contributions in this expansion can be calculated in a way expected from holography, namely via the bulk canonical energy for the entanglement entropy, and its variation for the modular Hamiltonian. The bulk fields contributing to the canonical energy are defined via the HKLL procedure. In terms of CFT variables, the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> such bulk <b>field</b> to the modular Hamiltonian is given by the OPE block corresponding to the dual operator integrated along the vacuum modular flow. These results do not rely on assuming large $N$ or other special properties of the CFT and therefore they are purely kinematic.

40|$|My thesis {{investigated}} {{the role of}} human resource management (HRM) in strategy implementation and its contribution to organizational financial and innovation performance. Drawing on a dataset from a large-scaled survey administered in multiple countries, my first study found that in two emerging economies – China and Hungary, HRM that took care of employees’ well-being and facilitated their task completion mediated the relationship between firms’ customer-oriented strategy and financial performance. The mechanism was that HRM supported firms in translating their customer-oriented strategy into customer-linking capability, that is, the capability {{to establish and maintain}} close relationships with customers. This capability conduced to superior financial performance. My second study reviewed and synthesized existing research on the relationship between HRM and innovation. In this study I proposed a framework to link HRM and innovation at the individual, team, and organizational level from an organizational learning perspective. I argued that HRM stimulated innovation by contributing to three sub-processes of organizational learning: knowledge creation, knowledge retention and knowledge transfer. This study also identified research gaps in this stream of literature and proposed future research directions. Recognizing an important gap in the literature that the HRM researchers have not fully integrated the role of market in the innovation research, my third study empirically examined whether HRM could promote firms’ product and process innovation by enhancing firms’ capability in sensing market trends. I found that in ten out of thirteen countries in the sample, HRM spurred firms’ innovation partially or fully through developing firms’ market-sensing capability. Moreover, I found that this effect differed across countries: in high power distance countries, HRM had a stronger positive effect on innovation. In overall, my thesis integrated literatures from HRM, strategy, marketing, and organizational learning and made <b>contributions</b> to <b>each</b> <b>of</b> these <b>fields.</b> In alignment with the human relations theory, it reveals that putting people first matters. By putting people first, HRM contributes to strategy implementation and stimulates firms’ financial and innovation performance...|$|R
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{has become a}} valuable interdisciplinary tool for understanding physiological, biochemical and pharmacological functions at a molecular level in living humans, whether in a healthy or diseased state. The utility of tracing chemical activity through the body transcends the fields of cardiology, oncology, neurology and psychiatry. In this, PET techniques span radiochemistry and radiopharmaceutical development to instrumentation, image analysis, anatomy and modeling. PET has made substantial <b>contributions</b> in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> these <b>fields</b> by providing a,venue for mapping dynamic functions of healthy and unhealthy human anatomy. As diverse as the disciplines it bridges, PET has provided insight into an equally significant variety of psychiatric disorders. Using the unique quantitative ability of PET, researchers are now better able to non-invasively characterize normally occurring neurotransmitter interactions in the brain. With the knowledge that these interactions provide the fundamental basis for brain response, many investigators have recently focused their efforts on {{an examination of the}} communication between these chemicals in both healthy volunteers and individuals suffering from diseases classically defined as neurotransmitter specific in nature. In addition, PET can measure the biochemical dynamics of acute and sustained drug abuse. Thus, PET studies of neurotransmitter interactions enable investigators to describe a multitude of specific functional interactions in the human brain. This information can then be applied to understanding side effects that occur in response to acute and chronic drug therapy, and to designing new drugs that target multiple systems as opposed to single receptor types. Knowledge derived from PET studies can be applied to drug discovery, research and development (for review, see (Fowler et al., 1999) and (Burns et al., 1999)). Here, we will cover the most substantial <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> PET to understanding biologically distinct neurochemical systems that interact to produce a variety of behaviors and disorders. Neurotransmitters are neither static nor isolated in their distribution. In fact, it is through interactions with other neurochemically distinct systems that the central nervous system (CNS) performs its vital role in sustaining life. Exclusive quantitative capabilities intrinsic to PET make this technology a suitable experimental tool to measure not only the regional distribution of specific receptors and their subtypes, but also the dynamic properties of neuroreceptors and their inherent influence on related neurotransmitter pathways. The ability to investigate dynamic properties in a non-invasive and reproducible manner provides a powerful tool that can extend our current knowledge of these interactions. Coupled with innovative paradigms including pharmacologic manipulations, physiologic models and reconstruction theories, knowledge derived from PET studies can greatly advance our understanding of normal and abnormal brain function...|$|R
