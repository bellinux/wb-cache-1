25|$|Other railway schemes were proposed, {{including}} one in 1838 to cross Thomas Telford's existing Menai Bridge. Railway pioneer George Stephenson was invited to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> proposal but stated his concern about re-using a single carriageway of the suspension bridge, as bridges of this type were unsuited to locomotive use. By 1840, a Treasury committee decided broadly in favour of Stephenson's proposals, with final consent to the route including Britannia Bridge given in 1845. Stephenson's son Robert was appointed as chief engineer.|$|E
25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E

The most notable of these occurrences took place in August 1991, when Agnew was commentating with Brian Johnston. In a review of the day, Johnston was describing how Ian Botham, while batting, had overbalanced and tried, but failed, to step over his stumps. Botham was consequently given out hit wicket. Agnew's <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> action was: [...] "He just didn't quite get his leg over."

500|$|In 1965, at age 90 {{and with}} no heirs, Calment signed a deal to sell her {{apartment}} to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a life estate. Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000 which was {{more than double the}} apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death. Calment's <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> situation was reported to be, [...] "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals."

500|$|While Hemingway {{painstakingly}} describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely {{hints at}} {{the driving force of}} the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted."

500|$|Terry's mother, Mrs. Khoo, is a [...] "thinly veiled {{stand-in}} for the [...] government", whose [...] "mother-knows-best" [...] mentality is well-meaning, but strips {{her children}} of their freedom. [...] She demands total obedience, and her repeated lines [...] "Do you know how lucky you are {{to have a good}} and responsible mother?" [...] and [...] "This is all for your own good" [...] parody the Singapore government's efforts to convince Singaporeans that government policies and actions is {{in the best interests of}} the nation. Mrs. Khoo also uses her position of power to buy off rebellion in her charges with gifts and bribes, in a pointed criticism of the government's social policies. Other characters in the film <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> relationship [...] for instance, in one scene, Mr. Liu states that [...] "it is difficult to catch fish in Singapore, because fish in Singapore are like Singaporeans; they'll never open their mouths", poking fun at the Singaporean trait of obedience and respect for authority.|$|E
500|$|Drawing on Adam of Bremen's {{assertion}} that Orkney was not conquered {{until the time}} of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043–66, Woolf (2007) speculates that Sigurd {{may have been the}} first Earl of Orkney. He also offers the hypothesis that the earldom was a created by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth, circa 980 rather than in the time of Harald Fairhair one hundred years earlier. He concludes that [...] "If there were no earls in Orkney before Sigurð's time it might help to explain the islands' low profile in the annals since these, for the most part, record only the deaths of great men." [...] However, the absence of <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject by Irish sources prior to Sigurd's death there is hardly surprising. Irish sources of the period were not well informed about and [...] "not much concerned" [...] with Orkney. Smyth (1984) is more sympathetic to the claims of the sagas and argues that Torf-Einarr [...] "may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney".|$|E

500|$|An analogy has {{frequently}} been drawn between the European Crusades of the Middle Ages {{and the modern}} day Zionist movement. This view, which has been espoused by Arab media and political leaders, has also been discussed in Israeli academia. Prawer was often asked to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> analogy, and claimed that a major difference was that the Jews settled the land and worked it, whereas the Crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by the natives. [...] Ronnie Ellenblum, a lecturer at Hebrew University, identifies a subliminal objective in Prawer's work to draw {{a distinction between the}} two: [...] "He's always writing about the Crusaders' manpower shortage and about their not settling the land...He claims that their presence here was principally urban, consisting of nobility and merchants. This is why they lost in the end. The implications are obvious: If we bring enough immigrants, and if we settle the land, we are bound to succeed." [...] (Ellenblum himself has shown that Crusader settlement in the Holy Land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of Crusader farms.)
