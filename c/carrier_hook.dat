50|$|The {{tailhook}} is {{a strong}} metal bar, with its free end flattened out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. Upon actuation by the pilot, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure lowers the hook to the down position. The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. <b>Carrier</b> aircraft <b>hooks</b> {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. Land-based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that pilots are graded based on the wire their tailhook catches on the pass. LSOs don't look at where the plane landed, they look at how it got there. It is possible for a pilot to fly a safe pass and land on a 1 wire, {{it is also possible}} that a plane catches a 3 wire and the landing is unsafe. Under normal circumstances, on Nimitz class <b>carriers</b> the targeted <b>hook</b> touchdown point is halfway between the two wire and the three wire.|$|R

40|$|Hook worm {{infection}} is prevalent among the townsmen of Goi in Chiba Prefecture - the <b>carriers</b> of <b>hook</b> worm eggs form from 35 % to 70 % {{of the whole}} population. But {{the number of those}} who carry Ascaris eggs is rather small, accounting for from 10 % to 35 % of the population. As has previously been pointed out by Prof. Tanikawa, the prevalence of hook worm infection in this area would be attributed to the characteristic method of farming {{as well as to the}} low and humid topography. However, no views have ever been advanced as to the reason why the rate of carriers of Ascaris is low. As there exist no differences between the people of this area and those of othse farming villages in the mode of living, especially the method of disposal of the night soil, the author postulated that the antagonistic effect of hook worms on Ascaris might be responsible. In order to prove this antogonistic effect experimentally, the author carried out in vitro experiments on the breeding of A. suilia in various mediums that are assumed to contain secretions and exudations by hook worms. The life spans of A. suilia bred in the solutions of the stools of men and dogs of high hook worm infection, the concentrated fluid mediums for breeding hook worm larvae and the emulsion of canine hook worms, were compared with those of the control. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The life spans of A. suilia bred in the solutions of the stools of men and dogs of high hook worm infection were slightly shorter than those of the control bred in the solutions of stools entirely free of hook worms. 1) The life spans of A. suilia bred in the solutions of the stools containing Necator were slightly shorter than those bred in the solutions of stools containing Ancylostorna. 3) The life spans of A. suilia bred in the emulsions of canine hook worms were more or less shorter than those of the control. From the results of the experiments described above, it would seem that the mediums containing hook worms have inhibitory effect, though of slight degree, on the growth of Ascaris. It would, however, be a jumping logic to assume that the high infection of hook worms in the intestines of animals might be antagonistic to the infection and survival of Ascaris. Further experiments in animals would be required in order to prove this theory...|$|R
5000|$|The major stunt {{scenes were}} {{executed}} before the camera with no miniatures, no blue screens, while mostly being shot at night. Completed during May 1990, the centerpiece stunt {{of the film}} involved a Mercedes-Benz convertible driving through the fourth floor window of an exploding warehouse. For the scene, a 1,500 pound Mercedes auto mock-up was connected by 150 feet of quarter-inch pulleyed cable to a Ford 4×4 pickup on the ground. The truck would drive straight ahead and pull the Mercedes through the windows as the cable that connected the two vehicles exhibited a tensile strength of 8,000 pounds. Once the pull on the cable started, both vehicles would move in precise proportion to one another. After the mock-up launched through the windows, the hook connecting the Mercedes would drop. As Frazier explained, [...] "The hook {{is very similar to}} the kind used to launch jets on aircraft <b>carriers,</b> ... Once the <b>hook</b> falls away, the Mercedes is propelled by its own momentum." [...] Aerodynamics {{played a key role in}} the execution, as Frazier referred to the stunt saying, [...] "When the car left the building it was very important that it exit and travel flat, ... A lot of times it doesn't matter. In this case, if the car didn't travel flat, you would know that the car could not have survived into the next sequence where it landed on the rooftop. We had to set up aerodynamics on that car, so that every time it went out the window, including the tests, it flew out without the nose dipping down." [...] The explosion filled destruction of the warehouse was produced by 9 separate 18-inch steel mortars on each of the 4 floors. When fully discharged, all 36 mortars produced the largest orchestrated explosion ever allowed in Los Angeles city limits permitted at the time.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the game, Kevin chastises Danny {{into making}} an {{impulsive}} bet. If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants are lifted when Danny asks them to individually recall a time when they had a proud accomplishment and reassures them that all it takes is [...] "one time" [...] to beat the Cowboys. With this, they begin to make a big comeback with a series of outstanding and unexpected plays. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to them, Spike, under orders from Mike, injures him by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, which even Kevin considers disgraceful, unsportsmanlike conduct. Witnessing from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns in tandem with overcoming personal problems, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or another one running towards the goal line when his little-seen dad has come to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21 all, the Giants make a goal line stand and stop Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls [...] "The Annexation of Puerto Rico," [...] inspired by one of Madden's plays at Super Bowl XI. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting [...] "Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!" [...] The play includes three different ball <b>carriers,</b> utilizing the <b>hook</b> and lateral from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.|$|R
40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the yarn layer carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the <b>hook</b> <b>carrier</b> chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The <b>hook</b> <b>carrier</b> chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the yarn guide openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the yarn guide openings at the layer, and the yarn guides (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The yarn layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the yarn guide slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The yarn layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to guide the weft yarns, to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|R
