40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of nanometric grain size on magnetic properties of single phase, nanocrystalline, granular La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 (LCMO) sample. We have considered core-shell structure of our LCMO nanoparticles, which can explain its magnetic properties. From the temperature dependence of field cooled (FC) and zero-field cooled (ZFC) dc magnetization (DCM), the magnetic properties could be distinguished into two regimes: a relatively high temperature regime T > 40 K where the broad maximum of ZFC curve (at T = Tmax) {{is associated with the}} blocking of core particle moments, whereas the sharp maximum (at T = TS) is related to the freezing of surface (shell) spins. The unusual shape of M (H) loop at T = 1. 5 K, temperature dependent feature of coercive field and remanent magnetization give a strong support of surface spin freezing that are occurring at lower temperature regime (T < 40 K) in this LCMO nanoparticles. Additionally, waiting time (tw) dependence of ZFC relaxation measurements at T = 50 K show weak dependence of relaxation rate [S(t) ] on tw and dM/dln(t) following a logarithmic variation on time. Both of these features strongly support the high temperature regime {{to be associated with the}} blocking of <b>core</b> <b>moments.</b> At T = 20 K, ZFC relaxation measurements indicates the existence of two different types of relaxation processes in the sample with S(t) attaining a maximum at the elapsed time very close to the wait time tw = 1000 sec, which is an unequivocal sign of glassy behavior.

40|$|In a thin {{magnetic}} nanostripe, an anti-vortex nucleates {{inside a}} moving domain wall when {{driven by an}} in-plane magnetic field greater than the so-called Walker field. The nucleated anti-vortex must cross {{the width of the}} nanostripe before the domain wall can propagate again, leading to low average domain wall speeds. A large out-of-plane magnetic field, applied perpendicularly to the plane of the nanostripe, inhibits the nucleation of the anti-vortex leading to fast domain wall speeds for all in-plane driving fields. We present micromagnetic simulation results relating the anti-vortex dynamics to the strength of the out-of-plane field. An asymmetry in the motion is observed which depends on the alignment of the anti-vortex core magnetic moments to the direction of the out-of-plane field.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{property and}} intraparticle {{structure of the}} γ phase of Fe 2 O 3 (maghemite) nanoparticles with a diameter (D) of 5. 1 ± 0. 5 nm were investigated through AC and DC magnetic measurements and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at pressures (P) up to 27. 7 kbar. Maghemite originally exhibits ferrimagnetic ordering below 918 K, and has an inverse-spinel structure with vacancies. Maghemitenanoparticles studied here consist of acore with structural periodicity and a disordered shell without the periodicity, and core shows superparamagnetism. The DC and AC susceptibilities reveal that the anisotropy energy barrier (ΔE/kB) and the effective value of the <b>core</b> <b>moment</b> decrease against the initial pressure (P≤ 3. 8 kbar), recovering at P≥ 3. 8 kbar. The change of ΔE/kB with P is qualitatively identical {{with that of the}} <b>core</b> <b>moment,</b> suggesting a down-and-up fluctuation of the number of Fe 3 + ions constituting the core at the pressure threshold of about 4 kbar. This phenomenon was confirmed by the analysis of the XRD measurement using Scherrer’s formula. The core volume decreased for P≤ 2. 5 kbar, whereas at higher pressure the core was restructured. For 2. 5 ≤P≤ 10. 7 kbar, the volume shrinkage of particle hardly occurs. There, ΔE/kB is approximately proportional to the volume associated to the ordered fraction of the nanoparticles as seen from XRD, Vcore. From this dependence it is possible to separate the core/shell contribution to ΔE/kB and estimate core and surface anisotropy constants. As for the structural experiments, similar experimental data have been obtained for D= 12. 8 ± 3. 2 nm as well.

40|$|The {{study of}} film adaptations, {{particularly}} those coming from literature, {{has been growing}} at a rapid rate during the last years due {{to the amount of}} adaptations coming from both mainstream and independent film industries. The focus of these studies though is generally addressed to best sellers where the literary style is clearly adaptable to the screen; however, there are cases where the adaptive process has resulted in an entirely different outcome.

40|$|The spin valve {{structure}} has important {{applications in the}} hard disk drives, magnetic sensors, magnetoresistive random-access memory, etc. and consequently is actively researched. The materials having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are in high demand for perpendicular magnetic recording and heat-assisted magnetic recording. Other than the magnetic thin films, the magnetic nanoparticles have strong contribution in the emerging technologies, such as, drug delivery, tagging or labeling of the desired biological entity and magnetic resonance imaging. The goal of this thesis is to explore different magnetic behaviours in the magnetic thin films and nanoparticles, i. e., exchange bias (EB), perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), spin glass (SG) phases, spin dynamics, magnetic interactions in the magnetic thin films and nanoparticles. Moreover, this thesis includes some new magnetic behaviours which have not been yet reported after the acreful literature survey. The PMA is studied in the thin films of CoPd alloy. Perpendicular EB is developed by using IrMn as an antiferromagnet. A transition in the EB is observed at low temperatures, where the in-plane (IP) EB field becomes larger than the out-of-plane (OP) EB field. It is found that with decreasing temperature there is a spin structure transition in the IrMn (111) layer related to a 3 Q (favors OP spins component) to 2 Q transition (favors IP spins component) in the bulk. This transition {{is responsible for the}} increase in the IP EB at low temperatures and has not been reported before. A spin reorientation transition from OP to IP (at higher temperatures) is also observed in the CoPd alloy, but is too weak to perturb the spin structure transition of IrMn, which dominates the temperature dependence of EB. The most interesting result is an increase in PMA of CoPd/IrMn with decreasing the thickness of CoPd layer, which is contrary to bare CoPd alloy. The bulk 3 Q spin structure of IrMn and the angle between the CoPd and IrMn moments at the interface are the reasons of this discrepancy. Memory effect, aging, Morin transition and EB effect are studied in the agglomerated hematite nanoparticles of different shapes from spherical to spindle. The super spin glass (SSG) and surface SG phases are found in these nanoparticles generating EB field. The interesting behaviour is the sign change in the EB field along with Morin transition, where the rotation of Fe ions in the core changes the exchange coupling at interface resulting in positive EB field. Morin transition is diminished with increasing the aspect ratio of nanoparticles due to the enhanced lattice strain and surface defects. In order to eliminate agglomeration, silica coating is used around the nanoparticles. The silica coating enhances the surface disorder, decreases magnetization and depletes Morin transition. The sign of the EB field is changed to negative as compared to uncoated ones. Co 1 -xMgxFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles are studied in quasi-free state and semi-compressed form. Spontaneous exchange bias (SEB) is observed along with conventional exchange bias (CEB) in the both states of nanoparticles. In the quasi-free state of nanoparticles, SEB is larger than CEB, while SEB becomes weak in semi-compressed form. The initial magnetic state has strong influence on SEB, where strong randomness contributes to the volume fraction of SG phase. The frustration and smooth movement of nanoparticles enhance SEB in quasi-free state of nanoparticles. The metastable domain states are developed in the system due to strain and dilution which perturbed by the rotation of the ferrimagnetic <b>core</b> <b>moments</b> with increasing temperature. The temperature driven sign reversal in Fe/Cr bilayers is studied and explained by the formation of interface alloying. The FeCr alloy at the interface transforms into SG phase during cooling. At low temperatures, the ferromagnetic interactions between frozen Fe clusters in alloy and adjacent Fe layer, results into enhanced negative EB field. The Cr rich alloy favours re-entrant SG to antiferromagnetic phase transition in alloy with increase in temperature. This phase transition changes the ferromagnetic coupling to antiferromagnetic between uncompensated Cr moments and Fe layer at interface resulting into positive EB. The novel results in the EB in different magnetic systems certainly encourage further probe into it by changing the thickness of IrMn layer for CoPd/IrMn system and the interparticle interactions...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the crisis}} in 2008 {{affected}} the global financial market, the economic climate changed drastically. A {{significant increase in the}} amount of vacant office buildings was introduced. Combining this fact with the increasing demand for living space in urban areas, transformation of vacant office buildings to residential buildings seems to be a simple solution to the problem. Redevelopment and transformation of vacant office buildings experience however many obstacles. Research into the structural opportunities of vacant office buildings could be helpful to overcome several obstacles. Due to the complexity of the projects, transformation asks involvement of many parties in an early stage of the development. The developers consult several advisors on financial, structural and architectural aspects. The aim of this research is creating a better understanding of transformation possibilities, emphasizing on the structural modifications of the transformation plan. The investigation answers the main research objective; the influence of the structural possibilities on the transition point between demolishing and transforming multi-story concrete office buildings. The building structures within this research exist of reinforced concrete and are built between 1950 and 1980. The transformation plan changes the office building function to residential function. An assessment tool is composed during the design study and consists of general- and structural selection criteria. This assessment tool is used to obtain a good and comprehensive understanding of the transformation potential. If the buildings have passed the veto criteria ((1) demand for housing and (2) the environmental regulations), they have been examined to the general selection criteria. If the results are below 50 % of the maximum achievable score, the building is not suitable for any further investigation. These buildings are omitted in the next step; the selection criteria of the structural aspects. The aim of this intermediate examination step is to gain a better view on the structural aspects of the potentiometer. Eight potential projects have passed the selection criteria and have been clustered in three groups; low-, medium- and high transformation potential. Two buildings have been chosen for further investigation during the design study; the Shell-building and Cool 75, both located in the center of Rotterdam. The architectural design and the corresponding structural modifications have been analyzed on their feasibility. The results of the investigated case study projects correspond with the outcome of the selection criteria. Important structural aspects of successful transformation projects are the availability of original information, the possibility to attach balconies to the current structure and vertical expansion. Other important influences on the transition point between demolition and transformation of the existing office building structure are the free floor height and the installation of ducts in horizontal and vertical direction. The adjustability and flexibility of the structural layout are remaining important factors, flexible floor plans enlarge the feasibility when a change of function is investigated. The strength and stability of the existing structure with the implemented change of function have to be checked on the structural key factors; (1) the horizontal deformation at the top, (2) the shear forces in the normative lintels, (3) the axial forces on the foundation piles and (4) the compressive and tensile stresses of the stabilizing elements. The structural key factors are applicable for a larger range of similar building structures. If the structural key factors fulfill the requirements according the Eurocode, the structural performances of the existing structure on vertical expansion, attachment of balconies and other possible structural modifications have to be investigated. If the structural key factors do not fulfill the requirements, there has to be looked into the integration of required structural modifications which also lead to an increase of the architectural and economic value of the building. The maximum wind load exposure according Eurocode 1 - 4 is significantly higher for tall buildings than the TGB 1955. The wind loads have a large influence on the bending moment {{at the bottom of the}} core and the horizontal displacement at the top of the tower. The Shell-building shows an increase in bottom <b>core</b> <b>moments</b> of ± 50 % in SLS and ± 25 % in ULS. The increment of the wind loads is an important factor to the structural performances of office buildings with an equivalent height. The wind load of low-rise buildings is not significantly increased. An important aspect on the transition point is the relation between the structural modifications and the economic revenues of the structural modifications. To determine the transition point between demolishing or transforming an office building, the structural modifications should be justified on economic reasoning. Due to the comprehensive field within the transformation market of office buildings, not every design and feasibility aspect is considered during this investigation. More research needs be done on the structural performances and visual assessment of the case study projects. Furthermore, not all non-structural transformation motives have been taken into consideration. These aspects are open for further investigation.

40|$|Studies on charge {{transport}} {{properties in}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have been a}} subject of great interest {{for a long time}} not only as an important topic in fundamental science, but also as a basic requirement for the application of CNTs for nanoelectronics. CNTs show a wide range of transport behavior that varies from ballistic to hopping regime, depending on the dimensionality and nature of disorder in the system. Minute variations in disorder can lead from weak to strong localization, and this yields complex and intriguing features in the analysis of transport data. It is particularly important to carry out such a study for multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), in which both dimensionality and disorder play an important role and the nature of localization is non-trivial as wave functions are extended along the tube or bundle of tubes. A proper understanding of the mechanisms of charge transport and their quantitative knowledge is an essential requirement for any possible application of CNTs in nanodevices. Such studies not only yield information on the transport parameters crucial for applications but can also provide a test for any possible microscopic theories of transport. Main focus of the current thesis is to understand the mechanism of charge transport in iron-embedded MWCNTs and to gain more knowledge on the transport behavior. Magnetically functionalized CNTs, in particular the CNTs ﬁlled with ferromagnetic materials are of profound interest for the basic scientiﬁc research as well as for technological application. Iron-embedded MWCNTs are synthesized by one step pyrolysis method. This method gives a proper route to synthesize the magnetic particles encapsulated CNTs. Beyond the geometrical advantage of a cylinder-shaped nanostructure design, the carbon shells provide an effective protection against oxidation of magnetic nanoparticles. The iron-embedded MWCNTs exhibit excellent magnetic properties like the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and the high coercivity, which is larger than the coercivity of bulk iron. Thus, they have signiﬁcant potential for data storage devices and biomedical applications. Vertical alignment of CNTs is an important issue for device applications such as field electron emitters and flat-panel displays. Vertically aligned MWCNTs are grown on various substrates in the present work and the role of catalyst particles in vertical alignment is discussed. This thesis also reports the investigations on the magnetic properties including magnetotransport studies. The thesis is organized in seven chapters and a brief summary of each chapter is given below. Chapter 1 presents an introduction of the CNTs and its structural and electronic properties. Charge transport in CNTs is then discussed in terms of the fundamental aspects of conduction regimes and transport length scales. The synthesis and characterization of iron-embedded MWCNTs is described in chapter 2. It is important to get good quality CNTs in a scalable way. The various methods available for CNT synthesis are arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition etc. A one-step thermally assisted pyrolysis method employed for synthesizing MWCNTs is a simple and cost-effective method. Benzene is used as a precursor and ferrocene as a catalyst in the present case. Good quality CNTs are obtained from this method, which are of multiwall in nature (outer diameter in the range of 10 - 25 nm). Vertically aligned mats of MWCNTs are also obtained on the quartz substrate. The thickness of the mats is several tens of microns. The prepared MWCNTs are characterized by electron microscopic studies for its structure and surface morphology. Many iron particles are seen inside the tubes. Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra taken from the small region of the sample under TEM show the presence of iron. Raman spectra of the sample suggest good quality of the tubes. Prominent G-peak in this spectrum shows that the sample is of well-graphitic nature. X-ray diffraction pattern of MWCNT material shows the presence of -Fe and Fe 3 C apart from the graphitic peak. Chapter 3 describes the growth of vertically aligned MWCNTs (v-MWCNTs) on various substrates and role of catalyst particles in the alignment. The v-MWCNTs are grown on sapphire, quartz and thermally oxidized silicon substrates without pre-deposition of any catalyst. The grown MWCNT mats had a thickness of several tens of microns. Surface elemental analysis shows the presence of catalyst particles on the substrate which is essential for vertical alignment of the tubes. It is found that the order in which the precursor and the catalyst were introduced during chemical vapor deposition determines the orientation of the nanotubes. When there were no catalyst particles on the substrate in the beginning, random alignment of CNTs took place instead of vertical alignment. Base growth mode of CNTs is proposed in the present case from the results obtained. Chapter 4 deals with the magnetic properties of the as-synthesized MWCNTs. The CNTs in pristine form are of diamagnetic in nature. The ferromagnetic-like behavior arises from the iron particles embedded in MWCNTs. These ferromagnetic particles are retained in the MWCNTs automatically, as the catalyst in this case contains iron. MWCNTs of different iron weight percentage are prepared by taking different amount of ferrocene as a precursor. These particles exhibit a magnetic moment up to 98 emu/g and coercivity in the range of 500 – 2000 Oe. Reduced magnetization is attributed to the formation of surface shell with spin disorder and to the presence of Fe 3 C phase. Large coercivity compared to the bulk vale of few orested is due to the complex state of interactions, which can create strong pinning centers for the <b>core</b> <b>moments</b> during the demagnetization. In addition the observed dependence of the magnetoresistance on the direction of applied ﬁeld, is correlated with the shape anisotropy of the Fe particles. The trend of saturation of magnetization at higher fields suggests that exchange coupling in the present case is one-dimensional. The charge transport properties of MWCNT mats are discussed in chapter 5. Many of the transport parameters are often affected by the presence of magnetic field. In order to gain a deeper insight into the conduction mechanism, the study of the electrical transport in presence of magnetic field is highly useful. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the conductivity of MWCNT mat is studied in the temperature range of 1. 4 - 150 K in the magnetic field up to 10 T. The charge transport in the system is governed by Mott’s variable-range hopping (VRH) of three-dimensional type in the higher temperature range and two-dimensional type in the lower temperature range. Mott’s various parameters like localization length, hopping length, hopping energy, and density of states at the Fermi level are deduced from the VRH fit. The hopping length decreases from 13. 2 to 12. 2 nm, as temperature increases from 110 to 150 K. The obtained value of hopping length around ~ 13 nm is within the range of nanotube diameters of 10 to 25 nm. This is the main component of the hopping length, which indicates that VRH takes place on the tube scale. The localization lengths observed in the case of 3 D VRH and 2 D VRH conduction are well within the range of outer diameter of MWCNTs, which indicates that the localization takes place at the tube scale along the boundaries of the tubes. If the charges are localized at the tube boundaries, then the localization length gives an average diameter of the tubes and the results obtained supports this argument. It is also {{important to note that the}} defects present in the nanotubes in the form of structural defects and bad matching of chirality gives rise to localization. There are not many reports on the effect of a magnetic field on the VRH process for MWCNT systems. The resistance of the sample decreases with the magnetic field in the direction of tube axis of the nanotubes. The magnetic field gives rise to delocalization of states as evident from the values of localization lengths at different fields. The application of magnetic field lowers the crossover temperature, at which three-dimensional VRH turns to two-dimensional VRH. The conductivity at the lower temperature side is governed by the weak localization (WL) give rise to positive magnetoconductance (MC). Here a phase diagram with temperature and magnetic field is proposed, showing different regions for different kind of transport mechanisms. This may be applicable for other class of disordered material as well. Chapter 6 deals with the magnetotransport studies on disordered MWCNT mat. The electrical conductivity and MC data are analyzed in the temperature range of 1. 4 - 150 K and in the magnetic fields up to 11 T. The system is in the critical regime obeying conductivity of metallic systems as suggested in weak localization-electron electron interaction model. The MC is positive for the whole temperature range except at temperature below 4. 2 K. Results are analyzed in the terms of weak localization, electron-electron interaction and VRH. The H 2 dependence at lower magnetic fields and H dependence at higher magnetic fields is found supporting weak localization. Inelastic scattering lengths are also deduced from the low temperature MC data and its temperature dependence shows that the dominant dephasing mechanism in the present case is inelastic electron-electron scattering in the dirty limit. Chapter 7 describes measurements on individual MWCNTs and subsequent charge transport studies. After many trials a suitable method was devised to isolate single tubes and to put contacts on it for the four probe measurement. For electrical measurements on isolated single tube, it is found that the joule heating due to excess current is an important issue. A current of the order of few µA burns the sample immediately. I-V characteristics of the MWCNTs show that the electrical contacts are ohmic and the resistance is few k. Initial electrical measurements show that there is slight decrease in resistance with increase of temperature and MR is approximately negative. This behavior suggests that signature of weak localization is present in the sample. Further studies are required in order to gain the insight into the transport mechanism for individual MWCNT. Finally, the thesis concludes with a general conclusion and future directions for this work...|$|E

40|$|There are {{currently}} two well-accepted models that explain how pulsars exhibit glitches, sudden {{changes in their}} regular rotational spin-down. According to the starquake model, the glitch healing parameter Q, which is measurable in some cases from pulsar timing, should be equal to {{the ratio of the}} moment of inertia of the superfluid core of a neutron star (NS) to its total moment of inertia. Measured values of the healing parameter from pulsar glitches can therefore be used in combination with realistic NS structure models as one test of the feasibility of the starquake model as a glitch mechanism. We have constructed NS models using seven representative equations of state of superdense matter to test whether starquakes can account for glitches observed in the Crab and Vela pulsars, for which the most extensive and accurate glitch data are available. We also present a compilation of all measured values of Q for Crab and Vela glitches to date that have been separately published in the literature. We have computed the fractional <b>core</b> <b>moment</b> of inertia for stellar models covering a range of NS masses and find that for stable NSs in the realistic mass range 1 : 4 0 : 2 M, the fraction is greater than 0. 55 in all cases. This range is not consistent with the observational restriction Qd 0 : 2 for Vela if starquakes are the cause of its glitches. This confirms results of previous studies of the Vela pulsar that have suggested that starquakes are not a feasible mechanism for Vela glitches. The much larger values ofQ observed for Crab glitches (Qe 0 : 7) are consistent with starquake model predictions and support previous conclusions that starquakes can be the cause of Crab glitches.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The {{world in}} which the Christian {{community}} finds themselves today, is a world that has in many ways spiritually lost its way. This has led to the ethical and moral decay that has as a result, social problems, as well as social and political corruption. The Church is also experiencing a crisis. The Church, until recently was the centre of many people‟s existence, but now increasingly people are removed from the church and churchless. Is there an antidote to counteract this assault on the Christian faith? As per the argument in this dissertation, the answer lies in the lifestyle of the faithful, according to their confession. A way of life that confirms and not renounces the Biblical truths is the only way in which the Church‟s credibility can be restored in a post modern milieu. It {{is also one of the}} most important ways in which the decay in society can be counteracted; a Church that can yet again, as a bride of Christ perform her missiological duty as the salt and light of the world. This conclusion has forced the relevance of this research to the forefront. Paul describes the Corinthians as the holy temple of God in which the Holy Spirit resides (1 Cor 3 : 16 - 17). Two questions immediately arise: what relevance does this metaphor have on a Christian lifestyle and can a metaphor, applied 2000 years ago to the Christians in Corinthians, have any hermeneutical value, today? Can it serve as an ethical <b>core</b> <b>moment</b> in the post-modern time in which we find ourselves? These are some of the questions addressed in this research. The temple motif is a central theme found throughout the Bible. This is born through God‟s desire to live amidst his people. He instructs Moses to build a tent tabernacle, so that He “can live in their midst” (Ex 25 : 8). This tabernacle moved with the Israelites, everywhere they went. This was the place where God revealed his special presence, where daily offerings were made as atonement for the people‟s sins and where, once a year on the Great Day of Reconciliation the high priest went into the Most Holy to atone for the sins of the people as well as his own. Everything in and around the tabernacle was characterized by holiness...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{the data}} on aligned primary {{sequences}} of protein families are being accumulated very rapidly. One of promising approaches to analysis of these data is to study correlations between amino acid substitutions at positions of protein sequences [1 - 3]. The information obtained could be valuable for revealing the peculiarities of the structure and function of the proteins under study. In relation to this topic, the main goal is to develop publicly available methods and software for correlation analysis of protein sequences. During analysis of co-adaptive substitutions, two important tasks appear. The first is to study correlations of amino acid substitutions at positions of a protein in order to reveal the pairs of residues that are related due to functional interactions (e. g., steric contact). The resulted information {{could be used for}} prediction of possible contacts between the residues [4, 5]. The second task is to reveal and analyse the conserved integral physico-chemical characteristics of a protein [6, 7]. As the examples of these characteristics may serve the total charge of a protein molecule, the volume of its hydrophobic <b>core,</b> hydrophobic <b>moments</b> of alpha helices, etc. The constancy of these characteristics in the course of evolution implies that they are responsible for the key features significant for protein structure and function. Co-adaptive substitutions may be one of possible mechanisms for supporting the constancy of these characteristics, together with invariance of residues at positions of a protein and conserved substitutions o...|$|R

40|$|Laser ranges between {{observatories}} on the Earth and retroreflectors on the Moon {{started in}} 1969 {{and continue to}} the present. Recent range accuracies are 2 cm while earliest ranges are an C, order of magnitude less certain. Four retroreflectors are ranged: three located at the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 sites {{and one on the}} Lunakhod 2 rover. Accurate analysis of the range data determines a number of lunar science parameters. The lunar interior variables include a fluid core parameter. The Lunar Laser Ranging effort is reviewed elsewhere. Many parameters are detected through their influence on rotation. Also detected are solid-body tides and accurate selenocentric reflector locations. Determined through the rotation are moment-of-inertia differences, gravitational harmonics, potential Love number, and dissipation effects due to tides and molten core. The rotation of the Moon is not at its minimum energy state; some recently active process has caused free librations. The moment differences contributed to the recent improvement of the Moon's moment of inertia from the Lunar Prospector gravity field. The Love numbers provide bulk elastic properties. Future possibilities for measurement include oblateness of the core-mantle boundary and <b>core</b> <b>moment.</b> A study of dissipation signatures in the rotation determines tidal Q vs. frequency and concludes that the Moon has a molten core. At 1 month the tidal Q is 37 and at 1 yr it is 60. The core radius is < or = 352 km for Fe and < or = 374 km for the Fe-FeS eutectic. The core detection exceeds 3 x its uncertainty. The spin of the core is not aligned with the spin of the mantle and torque arises from the velocity difference at the boundary. Yoder's turbulent boundary layer theory is used to compute the radii. The present heat generation from tides and core interaction is minor compared to radiogenic heating. The heating for ancient times is more interesting. Peale and Cassen investigated lunar tidal heating while the lunar orbit expanded due to tides on Earth. Their calculations predate the measurement of Q and should be multiplied by 3. 45 to match the lunar-laser-determined Love number and monthly Q. Tidal-heating computations depend on how fast the lunar orbit evolved and whether the tidal dissipation is localized. Neither is known, but plausible assumptions lead to early central region temperature increases of several hundred degrees. Most of the energy is deposited early in the Moon's history. The turbulent boundary layer theory allows a prediction of energy dissipated at the core-mantle boundary during orbit evolution. Under the assumption that the properties of the early core are the same as at present, the energy dissipated by core-mantle interaction is about the same as for tidal dissipation, but it is deposited in a smaller volume. This source of energy is capable of promoting convection in an early fluid core and driving a dynamo. This is a transient phase with a duration depending on the rate of orbit evolution. Plausible assumptions lead to a duration of a few hundred million years. Thus, the remnant magnetization of many lunar rocks is compatible with a brief global magnetic field powered by dynamical energy dissipation. Analysis of the lunar laser ranges is providing information on lunar geophysics. Future data will improve accuracies of present solution parameters, and several more interior effects should be detectable...|$|R
