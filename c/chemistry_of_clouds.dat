40|$|Within the United Nations, {{it is the}} {{responsibility}} of WMO to be the authoritative voice on the state and behaviour of the atmosphere and climate of the Earth. To this end, the Atmospheric Research and Environment Programme (AREP) co-ordinates and stimulates research on the composition of the atmosphere, the physics and <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> weather modification techniques, tropical meteorology processes and weather forecasting, focusing on extreme weather events and socio-economic impacts. In addition, AREP co-ordinates the global monitoring of greenhouse gases, the ozone layer, major atmospheric pollutants as well as the urban environment. The Commission for Atmospheric Sciences is responsible for the overall development of the Programme (WMO, 2006). The main purpose of AREP is to stimulate collaboration and participation in basic research in the physics and <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and encourage application of this research with particular emphasis on the needs of weather prediction, weather modification and atmospheric pollution. As the global population growths and standards of living increase, water resources are being placed under increasing pressure and weather-related risks continue to escalate. This is one of the reasons why there is an ongoing interest in weather modification. In recent years more than 70 countries had expressed an explicit interest in information and guidance on weather modification activities. Furthermore, there are several hundred weather modification activities in progress around the world...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of anthropogenic aerosols on the physics and <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> in the northeastern United States, aerosol and cloud-drop size distributions, elemental composition of aerosols {{as a function of}} size, and ionic content of cloud water were measured on Whiteface Mountain, NY, during the summers of 1981 and 1982. In several case studies, the data were cross-correlated with different air mass types - background continental, polluted continental, and maritime - that were advected to the sampling site. The results are the following: (1) Anthropogenic sources hundreds of kilometers upwind cause the small-particle (accumulation) mode number to increase from hundreds of thousands per cubic centimeter and the mass loading to increase from a few to several tens of micrograms per cubic meter, mostly in the form of sulfur aerosols. (2) A significant fraction of anthropogenic sulfur appears to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to affect the cloud drop concentration. (3) Clouds in Atlantic maritime air masses have cloud drop spectra that are markedly different from those measured in continental clouds. The drop concentration is significantly lower, and the drop size spectra are heavily skewed toward large drops. (4) Effects of anthropogenic pollutants on cloud water ionic composition are an increase of nitrate by a factor of 50, an increase of sulfate by more than one order of magnitude, and an increase of ammonium ion by a factor of 7. The net effect of the changes in ionic concentrations is an increase in cloud water acidity. An anion deficit even in maritime clouds suggests an unknown, possibly biogenic, source that could be responsible for a pH below neutral, which is frequently observed in nonpolluted clouds...|$|E

The centre formed an integrated attempt to understand multiple, but interlinked, biosphere-atmosphere interactions applying inter and multidisciplinary approaches in a coherent manner. The main objective was to study {{the life cycle of}} aerosol particles and their importance on climate change. The foundation in BACCI was a thorough understanding of physical, meteorological, chemical and ecophysiological processes, providing a unique possibility to study biosphere-aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. Continuous measurements of atmospheric concentrations and fluxes of aerosol particles and precursors and, CO 2 /aerosol trace gas interactions in different field stations (e. g.

The main progress was related to atmospheric new particle formation, existence of clusters, composition of nucleation mode aerosol particles, chemical precursors of fresh aerosol particles, the contribution of biogenic aerosol particles on the global aerosol load, transport, transformation and deposition of aerosol particles, thermodynamics related to aerosol particles and cloud droplets, and the microphysics and <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> droplet formation...|$|R
