5|$|Historical {{sources say}} that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and acupuncture. The first {{mentioning}} of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the Huangdi neijing. Acupuncture needles made of gold {{were found in the}} tomb of the Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE). Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of <b>calisthenics.</b> In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions. Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and qigong are derived from Han-era <b>calisthenics.</b>|$|E

With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in <b>calisthenics</b> to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calisthenics,</b> {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E

40|$|The {{product of}} heart rate (HR) and {{systolic}} blood pressure (SBP) provides a convenient estimate of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO 2). This study aimed to explore <b>calisthenic</b> exercise-induced changes in MVO 2 in healthy normotensive subjects. Eleven college-female students were recruited for this study. They performed one upper extremity and one lower-extremity one-minute <b>calisthenic</b> exercise. Each exercise was practiced with slow, moderate and fast cadences. Values of pre- and post-exercise HR and SBP were used to calculate pre- and post-exercise rate pressure product (RPP) (RPP= HR X SBP). Percentage of change between pre- and post-exercise RPP (% “ RPP) was used to estimate the <b>calisthenic</b> exercise-induced changes in MVO 2 (% “ RPP= [(Post -exercise RPP- Pre - exercise RPP) ÷ Pre-exercise RPP] X 100). One-minute <b>calisthenic</b> exercise resulted in increased post-exercise RPP estimating increase in MVO 2 demand. This increase {{was influenced by the}} three selected exercise cadences (P value is 0. 029 for upper-extremity and 0. 0001 for lower extremity). Results observed that more MVO 2 is required with lower-extremity <b>calisthenic</b> exercise than with upper extremity exercise. Progressive increase in the % “ RPP was found through the three cadences and it was of no significance in upper-extremity exercise (P = 0. 208) and significance in lower-extremity exercise (P = 0. 023). In conclusion, One-minute <b>calisthenic</b> exercise revealed minimal exercise-induced changes in MVO 2 for normotensive healthy female college-students especially with upper-extremity. If convalescing cardiac patient would show the same response, One-minute <b>calisthenic</b> exercise with its three cadences would be supported as a low intensity and safe exercise for Phase I cardiac rehabilitation...|$|R
5|$|The {{members of}} the Chinese Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and <b>calisthenics</b> they practiced. It began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist, peasant-based {{movement}} that attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui. Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city. The Qing ordered foreign diplomats and personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the legation quarter of Beijing.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{there was}} a renewal of football at Maryland. Fullback Grenville Lewis was elected as team captain and head coach. He instituted a strict physical training regimen involving <b>calisthenics</b> and long-distance running, and banned smoking, drinking, and eating pie during the football season. This was unpopular with the team, but Lewis was embraced by the students and faculty. In the game to decide the state championship, Maryland Agricultural faced Maryland-Baltimore. Late in the scoreless game, the Aggies pushed to their opponents' two-yard line. With darkness approaching and Maryland Agricultural having difficulty scoring, the referee called the game. It became clear that Maryland-Baltimore had sneaked three extra players onto the field, but the referee refused to award the Aggies the win. Two days later, the Maryland–Baltimore players voted to forfeit the game, {{and with it the}} championship, to Maryland Agricultural.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, <b>calisthenics</b> to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E

25|$|The Boxer Movement or Boxer Rebellion, which {{occurred}} in China from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, was an uprising {{by members of}} the Chinese Society of Right and Harmonious Fists against foreign influence in areas such as trade, politics, religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule (Qing Dynasty). The members of the Society of Right and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and <b>calisthenics</b> they practiced. The uprising began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist peasant-based movement in northern China. They attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui, as well as Christians, who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. Tens of thousands of Chinese Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, were killed mostly in Shandong and Shanxi Provinces as part of the uprising. The government of Empress Dowager Cixi was not helpful, and diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers and some Chinese Christians retreated to the legation quarter where they held out for fifty-five days until a multinational coalition rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The Chinese government was forced to indemnify the victims and make many additional concessions. Subsequent reforms implemented after the crisis of 1900 laid the foundation {{for the end of the}} Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the modern Chinese Republic.|$|E
