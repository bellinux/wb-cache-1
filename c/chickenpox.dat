5|$|<b>Chickenpox</b> was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. <b>Chickenpox</b> and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, <b>chickenpox</b> does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, <b>chickenpox</b> pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting <b>chickenpox</b> in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E
5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to <b>chickenpox,</b> and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Celia Solis (Daniella Baltodano), {{one of the}} Solis' daughters, {{comes down}} with <b>chickenpox.</b> Since Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) has never had the illness, she is forced to leave the house. She stays with neighbors Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm), where she enjoys partying and {{drinking}} with them so much she tries to prolong her visit. During a party, Gabrielle accidentally stumbles into a nursery, and learns Bob and Lee {{have been trying to}} adopt a baby. With a new appreciation for her children, Gabrielle returns home.|$|E
5|$|Drishyam {{commenced}} principal {{photography in}} the first week of October 2013. Mohanlal joined the sets only from 10 October as he was down with <b>chickenpox.</b> The film was shot at Thodupuzha in Kerala. The road-side house shown in the film, which was a major location, is situated at Vazhithala, near Thodupuzha. The shooting had to be halted for a while as Meena fainted on the location. Drishyam was initially planned to be filmed in 52 days, though it was completed in 44 days.|$|E
5|$|Referring to the {{character}} of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may be less severe than in the ordinary type. There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox. Modified smallpox was rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with <b>chickenpox.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} <b>chickenpox,</b> so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, <b>chickenpox,</b> and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront {{each other in the}} playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with <b>chickenpox.</b> After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played {{in the final two}} Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two centuries in the 196263 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries the following summer against South Africa and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of Richie Benaud, Booth was appointed vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of the Ashes. Booth played his final Test series in 196566 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and <b>chickenpox</b> respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. He was inducted into the Cricket NSW Hall of Fame in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes <b>chickenpox</b> and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
5|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Miller {{proceeded to}} the Second Test in Sydney, {{where he had}} a quiet match without his partner Lindwall, who was sidelined with <b>chickenpox.</b> England batted first and Miller opened the bowling with Victorian teammate and debutant Fred Freer. Miller bowled nine overs without success, conceding 24 runs as Hammond's tourists amassed 270. On a turning surface, nine of the English wickets fell to the spinners Johnson and McCool. In the hosts' reply, Miller contributed 40 with seven fours in a 63-run stand with Barnes as Australia reached 4/159. Bradman—who had dropped himself down the order—and Barnes then both scored 234 and put together a world record fifth-wicket partnership of 405 to propel Australia to 8/659 declared. Miller bowled 11 overs in the second innings, taking the wicket of Hutton who was out hit wicket after going on a short-lived attack that yielded 37 runs from 39 balls in 24 minutes. Hutton shaped to drive the last ball before lunch, and successfully made contact, but in following through, his bat slipped from his hand and clipped the stumps. Miller had a light bowling workload as Johnson and McCool took seven wickets between them for the innings and eight wickets each for the match as Australia completed another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, <b>chickenpox,</b> hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, <b>chickenpox,</b> or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chickenpox</b> {{is rarely}} fatal, {{although}} it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with <b>chickenpox</b> {{in the previous year}} accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of <b>chickenpox</b> is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, <b>chickenpox</b> infection.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} the Varicella vaccine to prevent <b>chickenpox.</b> Its effect on postherpetic neuralgia is still unknown. The vaccine—made from a weakened {{form of the}} varicella-zoster virus—may keep <b>chickenpox</b> from occurring in nonimmune children and adults, or at least lessen {{the risk of the}} <b>chickenpox</b> virus lying dormant in the body and reactivating later as shingles. If shingles could be prevented, postherpetic neuralgia could be completely avoided.|$|E
25|$|Varicella vaccine, {{also known}} as <b>chickenpox</b> vaccine, is a vaccine that protects against <b>chickenpox.</b> One dose of vaccine {{prevents}} 95% of moderate disease and 100% of severe disease. Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one. If given {{to those who are}} not immune within five days of exposure to <b>chickenpox</b> it prevents most cases of disease. Vaccinating {{a large portion of the}} population also protects those who are not vaccinated. It is given by injection just under the skin.|$|E
25|$|Hemorrhagic {{complications}} {{are more}} common in the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed populations, although healthy children and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant <b>chickenpox</b> with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant <b>chickenpox</b> with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic <b>chickenpox</b> syndromes is not known.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{was among}} the first {{countries}} to vaccinate for <b>chickenpox.</b> Routine vaccination against varicella zoster virus is also performed in the United States, and the incidence of <b>chickenpox</b> has been dramatically reduced there (from 4 million cases per year in the pre-vaccine era to approximately 400,000 cases per year as of 2005). In Europe most countries do not currently vaccinate against varicella, though the vaccine is gaining wider acceptance. Australia, Canada, and other countries have now adopted recommendations for routine immunization of children and susceptible adults against <b>chickenpox.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shingles affects {{one in five}} adults {{infected}} with <b>chickenpox</b> as children, especially those who are immune-suppressed, particularly from cancer, HIV, or other conditions. Stress can bring on shingles as well, although scientists are still researching the connection. Shingles are most commonly found in adults {{over the age of}} 60 who were diagnosed with <b>chickenpox</b> when they were under the age of 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} <b>chickenpox</b> can be {{prevented}} by isolating affected individuals. Contagion is by exposure to respiratory droplets, or direct contact with lesions, within a period lasting from {{three days before the}} onset of the rash, to four days after the onset of the rash. The <b>chickenpox</b> virus is susceptible to disinfectants, notably chlorine bleach (i.e., sodium hypochlorite). Like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to desiccation, heat and detergents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chickenpox</b> is an {{airborne}} disease which spreads easily {{through the}} coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread {{from one to}} {{two days before the}} rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread <b>chickenpox</b> to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is or is not immune. People usually only get <b>chickenpox</b> once. Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{does not}} require state health {{departments}} to report infections of <b>chickenpox,</b> and only 31 states currently volunteer this information. However, in a 2013 {{study conducted by the}} social media disease surveillance tool called Sickweather, anecdotal reports of <b>chickenpox</b> infections on Facebook and Twitter were used to measure and rank states with the most infections per capita, with Maryland, Tennessee and Illinois in the top three.|$|E
25|$|Between 1953 and 1964 Dr Robert Hope-Simpson, a GP, {{carried out}} {{painstaking}} research establishing that shingles is the reactivation of previously acquired <b>chickenpox</b> (varicella) virus.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Hilleman was {{the most}} {{prolific}} vaccine inventor, developing successful vaccines for measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, <b>chickenpox,</b> meningitis, pneumonia and 'Haemophilus influenzae'.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{the only}} known species that the disease affects naturally. However, <b>chickenpox</b> has been caused in other animals, such as primates, {{including}} chimpanzees and gorillas.|$|E
25|$|After {{recovering}} from <b>chickenpox,</b> {{it is recommended}} by doctors that adults take one injection of VZV immune globulin and one injection of varicella vaccine or herpes zoster vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In the tropics, <b>chickenpox</b> often {{occurs in}} older people and may cause more serious disease. In adults, the pock marks are darker and the scars more {{prominent}} than in children.|$|E
25|$|Viruses cause 20 {{percent of}} CAP cases. The most common viruses are influenza, parainfluenza, human {{respiratory}} syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Less-common viruses which may cause serious illness include <b>chickenpox,</b> SARS, avian flu and hantavirus.|$|E
25|$|In adults, {{the disease}} is more severe, though the {{incidence}} is much less common. Infection in adults is associated with greater morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), hepatitis, and encephalitis. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with <b>chickenpox</b> develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to <b>chickenpox</b> are in adults. Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, can occur in immunocompromised individuals, although the risk is higher with herpes zoster. Necrotizing fasciitis is also a rare complication.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, {{and the appearance of}} new blisters begins to subside after the fifth day. <b>Chickenpox</b> infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. It is recommended to keep new infants from birth up to age 6 months away from an infected person for 10 to 21 days because their immune systems are not developed enough to handle the stress it can bring on. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used to reduce fever. Aspirin, or products containing aspirin, should not be given to children with <b>chickenpox,</b> as it can cause Reye's Syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of <b>chickenpox</b> in {{children}} {{is aimed at}} symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. With children younger than 12 years, cutting nails and keeping them clean {{is an important part}} of treatment as they are more likely to scratch their blisters more deeply than adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>chickenpox</b> is primarily {{based on the}} signs and symptoms, with typical early symptoms followed by a characteristic rash. Confirmation of the diagnosis is by examination of the fluid within the vesicles of the rash, or by testing blood for evidence of an acute immunologic response.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>chickenpox</b> infection, {{the virus}} remains dormant in the body's nerve tissues. The immune system keeps the virus at bay, but later in life, usually in an adult, {{it can be}} {{reactivated}} and cause a different form of the viral infection called shingles (also known as herpes zoster).|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{aciclovir}} {{is effective}} to treat severe medical conditions caused by {{different species of}} the herpes virus family, including severe localized infections of herpes virus, severe genital herpes, <b>chickenpox</b> and herpetic encephalitis. It is also effective in systemic or traumatic herpes infections, eczema herpeticum and Herpes simplex meningitis.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices {{approved}} a new vaccine by Merck (Zostavax) against shingles. This vaccine {{is a more}} potent version of the <b>chickenpox</b> vaccine, and evidence shows that it reduces the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. The CDC recommends use of this vaccine in all persons over 60 years old.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas, {{is the most}} common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated <b>chickenpox</b> include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.|$|E
