40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the life and}} politics of Patrick Dollan a prominent Independent Labour Party (ILP) member and leader in Glasgow. It questions the perception of Dollan as an intolerant, Irish-Catholic 'machine politician' who ruled the 'corrupt' City Labour movement with an 'iron fist', dampened working-class aspirations for socialism, sowed the seeds of disillusionment and stood {{in opposition to the}} charismatic left-wing MPs such as James Maxton who were striving to introduce policies that would eradicate unemployment and poverty. Research is also conducted into Dollan's connections with the Irish community and the Catholic church and his attitude towards Communism and communists to see if these issues explain his supposed ideological opposition to left-wing movements. The thesis will test these perceptions by examining Dollan's role within Glasgow Corporation, the Glasgow and Scottish Federations of the ILP and the public and voluntary organisations that Dollan was involved in. Full use is made of contemporary and socialist newspapers, Glasgow <b>Corporation</b> <b>Minutes,</b> ILP conference reports and minute books, public records and archives. The objective {{is to look at the}} growth and development of the Labour movement in Glasgow and establish whether Dollan was indeed a fetter on the 'forward march of Labour' or deserves recognition as someone who made a positive contribution to the labour movement by enhancing the lives of the Scottish working class...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{attempts}} to elucidate and clarify {{the extent of}} the doctrine of the Arte Kastellana by Gonzalo Correas in the first edition of the GRAE (1771).

5000|$|The first {{official}} reference to Blackpool in Cork City as an urban centre was {{in relation to}} the building of a Guard House in 1734 mentioned in the Cork <b>Corporation</b> <b>minute</b> book. Its early development can be traced to it being on the main thoroughfare from Cork City to the north with roads leading to the important destinations of Mallow, Limerick and Dublin. Dublin Street and Hill in Blackpool were named after this route. Weaving became identified with Blackpool from its early beginnings and it was later recalled that the cabins of Blackpool were a hive of wool combing and weaving. The success of weaving in Blackpool can in part be attributable to British Army and Naval contracts that accrued to the area. The Revolutionary War period (1793-1815) was a buoyant time for weaving in Blackpool as a result. But after the war ended and the Act of Union of 1801 eventually allowed cheaper industrial clothing to invade the Irish market it marked the end of the cabin weaving industry of Blackpool. Many of the weavers from Blackpool emigrated to Britain. Thereafter Blackpool had a concentration of industries such as tanning, bacon curing, brewing and distilling. As well as being a suburb, Blackpool is regarded by some as a now faded commercial and social centre of working class districts on the northside of Cork City. A vibrant working class community developed, its identity reinforced by the area's association with icons such as Taoiseach (Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland) and hurler Jack Lynch, Christy Ring (commonly regarded as the greatest hurler of all time) and footballer Charlie Hurley.|$|R
