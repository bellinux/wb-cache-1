The calls were in Arabic, which he spoke. Speaking in code, the caller stated that it was [...] "time to deliver the birthday candles for the celebration". Mossad Director-General Zvi Zamir was convinced that this was a <b>coded</b> <b>order</b> connected to an upcoming attack. Zamir had been convinced that the Bangkok embassy raid was a diversion for a larger attack, due to the participants in the raid having so easily given up, something he did not expect from a group as well-trained, financed, strategically cunning, and motivated as Black September. Zamir further interpreted that [...] "birthday candles" [...] could refer to weapons, and the most likely one with a candle connotation was a rocket. Zamir linked the possible upcoming missile attack with Meir's upcoming arrival, and guessed that Black September was planning to shoot down Meir's plane. Zamir then sent a Mossad katsa, or field intelligence officer, to Rome, and travelled to the city with a team of Mossad officers. Zamir met with the head of DIGOS, the Italian anti-terrorism unit, and laid out his concerns. DIGOS officers raided the apartment blocks from where the calls had been made, and found a Russian instruction manual for launching missiles. Throughout the night, DIGOS teams, each accompanied by a Mossad katsa, raided known PLO apartments, but found no evidence of any plot to kill Meir. In the morning, a few hours before Meir's plane arrived, Mossad agents and Italian police surrounded Fiumicino Airport.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) number {{using a new}} rat model. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups. The first group received gavage with Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) 81 - 176. The second group was gavaged with placebo. Three months after clearance of Campylobacter from the stool, precise segments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were ligated in self-contained loops of bowel that were preserved in anaerobic bags. Deep muscular plexus ICC (DMP-ICC) were quantified by two blinded readers assessing the tissue in a random, <b>coded</b> <b>order.</b> The number of ICC per villus was compared among controls, Campylobacter recovered rats without small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and Campylobacter recovered rats with SIBO. RESULTS: Three months after recovery, 27 % of rats gavaged with C. jejuni had SIBO. The rats with SIBO had a lower number of DMP-ICC than controls in the jejunum and ileum. Additionally {{there appeared to be}} a density threshold of 0. 12 DMP-ICC/villus that was associated with SIBO. If ileal density of DMP-ICC was 0. 12 (P < 0. 05). If the density of ICC was < 0. 12 DMP-ICC/villus in more than one location of the bowel, 88 % of these had SIBO compared to 6 % in those who did not (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: In this post-infectious rat model, the development of SIBO appears to be associated with a reduction in DMP-ICC. Further study of this rat model might help understand the pathophysiology of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Differential spatial {{modulation}} (DSM) {{was recently}} proposed {{to overcome the}} challenge of channel estimation in spatial modulation (SM). In this letter, we propose a gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> of antenna index permutations for DSM. To facilitate the implementation, the well-known Trotter-Johnson ranking and unranking algorithms are adopted, which results in similar computational complexity to the existing DSM that uses the lexicographic <b>order.</b> The <b>coding</b> gain achieved by the proposed gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> over the existing lexicographic order is also analyzed and verified via simulations, which reveals a maximum of about 1. 2 dB for the case of four transmit antennas. Based on the gray coding framework, we further propose a diversity-enhancing scheme named intersected gray (I-gray) <b>code</b> <b>order</b> for DSM, where the permutations of active antenna indices are selected directly from the odd (even) positions of the full permutations in the gray <b>code</b> <b>order.</b> From analysis and simulations, it is shown that the I-gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> can harvests an additional diversity order {{at the expense of}} only one information bit loss for each transmission with respect to the gray <b>code</b> <b>order.</b> Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a error in equation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Let S(n) be a {{collection}} of subsets of { 1, [...] ., n}. In this paper we study numerical obstructions {{to the existence of}} orderings of S(n) forwhich the cardinalities of successive subsets satisfy congruence conditions. Gray <b>code</b> <b>orders</b> provide an example of such orderings. We say that an ordering of S(n) is a Gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> if successive subsets differ by the adjunction or deletion of a single element of { 1, [...] .,n}. The cardinalities of successive subsets in a Gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> must alternate in parity. It follows that if d(S(n)) is the difference between the number of elements of S(n) having even (resp. odd) cardinality, then |d(S(n)) | − 1 is a lower bound for the cardinality of the complement of any subset of S(n) which can be listed in Gray <b>code</b> <b>order.</b> For g ≥ 2, the collection B(n, g) of g-blockfree subsets of { 1, [...] .,n} is defined to be the set of all subsets S of { 1, [...] .,n} such that |a − b | ≥gif a, b ∈ S and a � = b. We will construct a Gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> for B(n, 2). In contrast, for g> 2 we find the precise (positive) exponential growth rate of d(B(n, g)) with n as n →∞. This implies B(n, g) is far from being listable in Gray <b>code</b> <b>order</b> if n is large. Analogous results for other kinds of orderings of subsets of B(n, g) are proved using generalizations of d(B(n, g)). However, we will show that for all g, one can order B(n, g) so that successive elements differ by the adjunction and/or deletion of an integer from { 1, [...] .,n}. We show that, over an A-letter alphabet, the words of length n which contain no block of k consecutive letters cannot, in general, be listed so that successive words differ by a single letter. However, if k> 2 andA> 2 orif k= 2 andA> 3, such a listing is always possible. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In video {{transmission}} over packet-based networks, packet losses usually occur in bursts. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel packetization method for increasing the robustness of compressed video against bursty packet losses. The proposed method is based on creating a <b>coding</b> <b>order</b> of macroblocks so that the blocks that are {{close to each other}} in the <b>coding</b> <b>order</b> end up being far from each other in the frame. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves the quality of reconstructed frames under burst loss by several dB compared to conventional FMO techniques, and about 0. 7 dB compared to the state-of-the-art method called Explicit Chessboard-Wipe (ECW).
