40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 3254 {{floating}} rate tranches from 617 ABS-CDOs (collateralized debt obligations backed by asset-backed securities), this paper tests the “rating overdependence” hypothesis – i. e., that ratings of structured products are a sufficient statistic (in terms of predicting future credit performance) for yield spreads at origination. The paper’s findings are fourfold. First, yield spreads at issuance predict future performance of ABS-CDO tranches even after controlling for {{the information contained in}} ratings. Second, the ability of yield spreads to predict future performance, however, is driven exclusively by ratings below AAA (and, to a lesser extent, also by the lowest priority AAA tranches), whereas spreads of super senior AAA tranches show no information content. Third, the predictive ability of yield spreads is lower for tranches from later vintages and for tranches from deals with more complex <b>collateral</b> <b>pools.</b> Fourth, the conditional correlation between ratings and spreads, in turn, is increasing in time and higher for tranches from complex deals.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{spectacular}} {{rise and fall}} of structured finance. The essence of structured finance activities is the pooling of economic assets like loans, bonds, and mortgages, and the subsequent issuance of a prioritized capital structure of claims, known as tranches, against these <b>collateral</b> <b>pools.</b> As a result of the prioritization scheme used in structuring claims, many of the manufactured tranches are far safer than the average asset in the underlying pool. This ability of structured finance to repackage risks and to create "safe" assets from otherwise risky collateral led to a dramatic expansion in the issuance of structured securities, most of which were viewed by investors to be virtually risk-free and certified as such by the rating agencies. At the core of the recent financial market crisis has been the discovery that these securities are actually far riskier than originally advertised. We examine how the process of securitization allowed trillions of dollars of risky assets to be transformed into securities that were widely considered to be safe. We highlight two features of structured finance products - the extreme fragility of their ratings to modest imprecision in evaluating underlying risks, and their exposure to systematic risks - that {{go a long way in}} explaining the spectacular {{rise and fall of}} structured finance. We conclude with an assessment of what went wrong and the relative importance of rating agency errors, investor credulity, and perverse incentives and suspect behavior on the part of issuers, rating agencies, and borrowers. ...|$|R

40|$|Preface. Securitisation deals {{have come}} into focus during the recent years due to the {{challenges}} in their assessments and {{their role in the}} recent credit crises. These deals are created by the pooling of assets and the tranching of liabilities. The later are backed by the <b>collateral</b> <b>pools.</b> Tranching makes it possible to create liabilities of a variety of seniorities and risk-return profiles. The assessment of a securitisation deal is based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the risks inherent in the transaction and how well the structure manages to mitigate these risks. Example of risks related to the performance of a transaction are credit risk, prepayment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, operational risk and legal risk. In the light of the recent credit crisis, model risk and parameter uncertainty have come in focus. Model risk refers {{to the fact that the}} outcome of the assessment of a securitisation transaction can be influenced by the choice of the model used to derive defaults and prepayments. The uncertainties in the parameter values used as input to these models add to the uncertainty of the output of the assessment. The aim of this report is to give an overview of recent performed research on model risk and parameter sensitivity of asset backed securities ratings. The outline of the text is as follows. 3 In Chapter 1, an introduction to asset-backed securities (ABSs) is given. We describe, for example, key securitisation parties, structural characteristics and credit enhancements. The cashflow modelling of ABS deals can be divided into two parts: (1) the modelling of the cash collections from the asset pool and the distribution of these collections to the note holders, discussed in Chapter 2, and (2) the modelling of defaults and prepayments. Deterministic models to generate default and prepayment scenarios are presented in Chapter 3; a collection of stochastic models is presented in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, two of the major rating agencies quantitative methodologies for ABS rating are discussed. Next, the model risk in rating ABSs is discussed and we elaborate on the parameter sensitivity of ABS ratings. More precisely, in Chapter 6 we look at how the choice of default model influences the ratings of an ABS structure. We illustrate this using a two tranche ABS. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of changing some of the input parameters one at a time. A more systematic parameter sensitivity analysis is presented in Chapter 7. In this chapter we introduce global sensitivity analysis techniques, which allow us to systematically analyse how the uncertainty in each input parameter’s value contributes to the uncertainty of the expected loss and the expected average life of the notes and hence the rating. The report concludes with an summary of the findings in Chapter 8...|$|R

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate <b>collateral</b> <b>pools</b> which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|R

We analyse the European market of standardized CDOs using tranches of iTraxx index in the periods before and during the global financial crisis. We investigate the evolution of the correlations using different copula models: the standard Gaussian, the NIG, the double-t, and the Gumbel copula model. After calibration of these models one obtains a time varying vector of parameters. We analyse the dynamic pattern of these coefficients. That enables us to forecast future parameters and consequently calculate Value-at-Risk measures for iTraxx Europe tranches...|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of the {{subprime}} crisis 2007, highly rated structured finance products started to appear much riskier than traditional investments carrying similar ratings. Subsequently, investors lost confidence in the ratings and the novel products themselves, leading markets for the products to seize up and thus to severe adverse consequences for the global financial system. This paper examines and compares the risk properties of one-layer (i. e., ABS) and two-layer (i. e., ABS-CDO) securitizations within a simulation analysis that generates asset values by a model with both macro-economic and idiosyncratic risk. The setup also allows for correlated default rates between different ABS asset pools. The results show that the process of (re-) securitization 1) substitutes diversifiable idiosyncratic risks by non-diversifiable systematic risk, and 2) magnifies the impact of errors/changes in estimates of the underlying <b>collateral</b> <b>pool</b> assets’ risk characteristics, making second-generation securitization tranches much more sensitive to stress scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is Canada's main {{electronic}} {{interbank funds}} transfer system that financial institutions use daily to transmit thousands of payments worth several billions of dollars. The LVTS {{is different than}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems because, while each payment is final and irrevocable, settlement occurs on a multilateral net basis {{at the end of}} the day. Furthermore, LVTS payments are secured by a <b>collateral</b> <b>pool</b> that mutualizes losses across participants in the event of a default. In this paper, we use the Bank of Finland Simulator to examine the implications of fully collateralizing LVTS payments, similar to an RTGS. An important caveat to consider, however, is that the simulations do not take into account the anticipated change in payment behaviour in response to a change in collateral requirements. In this regard, we include a queuing mechanism to at least reflect more efficient use of liquidity. The results indicate that collateral requirements vary by participant and some participants actually require less collateral in the simulation than what is required under the current LVTS design...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the nature of}} the organization, both as a whole and as a stage set up for the members to interact. Chapter One considers why and how an organization as a whole, represented by its name, holds reputation, like a natural person, even thought it, unlike the latter, has no fixed self, or “type” as called in economics. The chapter finds that having names hold reputations improves the economic efficiency; it also discovers two mechanisms that drive organizational reputation. Chapter Two considers the optimal allocation of ownership of physical capital. The effect of the allocation on control receives little attention in the literature and is the focus of the chapter. Control means here to affect the project choice of the agent, while incentive means the choice of ex ante human capital investment and ex post effort. The chapter finds that the principal ownership improves control, yet reduces incentive of the agent, compared to the agent ownership; thus the former, called “integration”, happens iff the benefit of coordination outweighs the loss in incentive. Chapter Three provides a new angle of delineating the boundary of the firm, by the allocation of the liability to investors. In a Towsend economy, it examine all modes of financing, each defined by the according allocation of the liability; particularly, Financial intermediation (FI) is defined by the fact the monitor alone takes the liability. The real race is between FI and Conglomeration, where the entrepreneurs and the monitor form a conglomerate to take the liability. FI has “Number Advantage”: when default is declared, the investors audit one bank asset under FI but many entrepreneur projects under conglomerate. Conglomeration has “Collateral Advantage”: its <b>collateral</b> is the <b>pool</b> of the projects contains as a part the bank asset, the collateral of FI. Both FI and Conglomeration implement the benefit of diversification; indeed, under the perfect diversification, Conglomeration is as good as FI. The chapter thus challenges the view that the benefit of diversification drives Financial Intermediation (FI), a view first established by Diamond (1984) and well accepted by the literature...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{regeneration}} fails to restore complete normal function after surgical repair of severed nerves, and this failure has primarily {{been attributed to}} errors in connecting with peripheral targets. However, recent evidence suggests that central deficits remain even after peripheral target reinnervation is largely successful. It has long been established that regeneration fails to restore the stretch reflex despite observation {{that many of the}} neural components are intact. Regenerated Ia afferents are largely successful in reinnervating muscle spindles, are capable of encoding stretch, and elicit EPSPs in homonymous motoneurons, while regenerated motor pools are capable of responding to uninjured sources of excitatory input. We now know this areflexia {{is due in part to}} a retraction of Ia afferent <b>collaterals</b> from motor <b>pools</b> in lamina IX (Alvarez et al., 2011). However, Ia afferents project not only to homonymous motoneurons but also to heteronymous synergist motor pools, even ones that are injury-spared. Ia afferents also project to antagonist motor pools through an interposed inhibitory interneuron. Therefore stretch of a muscle is capable of producing reflex contraction of both itself and synergist muscles while producing reflex inhibition of antagonist muscles. The function of these heteronymous projections after regeneration, however, remains unknown. The goal of this thesis is to determine the limitations of recovery of spinal circuit function after peripheral {{nerve regeneration}} by direct examination of stretch-evoked reflexes among synergists and antagonists. Direct examination of the force response to stretch in vivo is extremely valuable as changes in behavior, the muscle response to stretch, after peripheral nerve regeneration must necessarily reflect changes in the underlying circuitry. We found that heteronymous stretch reflexes initiated by reinnervated muscle were dramatically decreased in both regenerated and injury-spared synergist motoneuronal pools. Additionally, both homonymous and heteronymous stretch reflexes were reduced in an injury-spared synergist after regeneration. These results give physiological evidence for retraction of regenerated Ia afferents from all synergist motor pools, and this retraction may extend to afferents that are injury-spared. Dysfunction also extends to antagonist stretch-evoked reflexes as we found a shift from net inhibition to net excitation of the injury-spared muscle due to reinnervated antagonist stretch. This shift is readily explained by the differential preservation of synapses located in lamina where interneurons mediating these responses are presumably located (Alvarez et al., 2011). Therefore functional deficits after peripheral nerve regeneration extend to heteronymous connections of Ia afferents with synergists and antagonists, both reinnervated and injury-spared. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a profound discoordination of spinal reflexes and reorganization of spinal circuits after peripheral nerve regeneration...|$|R
