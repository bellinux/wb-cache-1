The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

25|$|Intermittency <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> {{extent to}} which a power source is unintentionally stopped or unavailable, but intermittency is {{frequently}} used as synonym of variability, which is the {{extent to which}} a power source may exhibit changes in output.|$|E
50|$|Rendition <b>can</b> also <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> act of rendering, i.e. delivering, a {{judicial}} decision, or of explaining {{a series of}} events, as a defendant or witness. It <b>can</b> also <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> execution of {{a judicial}} order by the directed parties. But extraordinary rendition is distinct from both deportation and extradition, being inherently illegal.|$|R

25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> difference between legible and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.|$|E

25|$|Awakening <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> end of sleep, {{or simply}} a moment to survey the {{environment}} and readjust body position before falling back asleep. Sleepers typically awaken soon {{after the end of}} a REM phase or sometimes in the middle of REM. Internal circadian indicators, along with successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about awakening {{and the end of the}} sleep episode. Awakening involves heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} usage of segregation; {{in some cases it}} <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> {{exclusion}} of motor vehicles and in other cases the exclusion of pedestrians as well. Thus, it includes bike lanes with solid painted lines but not lanes with dotted lines and advisory bike lanes where motor vehicles are allowed to encroach on the lane. It includes cycle tracks as physically distinct from the roadway and sidewalk (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards). And it includes bike paths in their own right of way exclusive to cycling. Paths which are shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized traffic are not considered segregated and are typically called shared use path, multi-use path in North America and shared-use footway in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> {{difference between life and}} death, and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E

25|$|When {{rules are}} broken several steps are {{commonly}} taken. First, a warning is usually given; this is commonly {{in the form}} of a private message but recent development has made it possible for it to be integrated into the software. Subsequent to this, if the act is ignored and warnings do not work, the member is – usually – first exiled from the forum for a number of days. Denying someone access to the site is called a ban. Bans <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> person can no longer log in or even view the site anymore. If the offender, after the warning sentence, repeats the offense, another ban is given, usually this time a longer one. Continuous harassment of the site eventually leads to a permanent ban. In most cases, this means simply that the account is locked. In extreme cases where the offender – after being permanently banned – creates another account and continues to harass the site, administrators will apply an IP address ban or block (this can also be applied at the server level): If the IP address is static, the machine of the offender is prevented from accessing the site. In some extreme circumstances, IP address range bans or country bans can be applied; this is usually for political, licensing, or other reasons. See also: Block (Internet), IP address blocking, and Internet censorship.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> difference between a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

500|$|N64 Magazine journalists {{described}} Wave Race 64 as [...] "one of {{the deepest}} racing games" [...] they had played, stating that the game's dynamic waves [...] "constantly tests and re-tests" [...] the player's control and that the buoys system offers [...] "tactical decisions about whether to spend time taking a wide corner or dash straight on to catch the leader before it's too late." [...] Similarly, Game Informer remarked that the waves can strike players on every turn and that [...] "one mistake <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> difference between victory and defeat." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot praised the controls, stating that Wave Race 64 [...] "makes the best use yet" [...] of the Nintendo 64 analog stick.

Alex Huhtala of CVG felt that the game was too short, but admitted that the multiplayer and stunt modes give the game longevity.|$|E
500|$|Moments {{before being}} {{propelled}} off the table, the athlete undergoes a sudden increase in g-force {{due to the}} curvature – or 'compression' – of {{the bottom of the}} inrun. They then initiate a very powerful, explosive jump that requires great leg strength. At this instant, the skis are opened up into a horizontal [...] "V" [...] angle, the legs are straightened and spread apart, and the athlete adopts their own unique aerodynamic flying position in what is called the 'transition'; all of this taking place in only a tenth of a second. Timing is crucial and there is next to no margin for error at this phase: a jump that begins too early or late off the table <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> difference between an excellent, average or poor effort. Each athlete has their own method of generating as much inrun speed as possible, depending on such intricacies as crouch depth, hip and knee angle, arm placement, or how far the torso is positioned over the knees. Body weight is also a factor (see power-to-weight ratio), which has led to some athletes' health becoming a concern over the years.|$|E

2500|$|Interpretation of the sonnet is said {{to hinge}} on the third quatrain (lines 9-12), which is {{generally}} regarded as obscure.

Also, [...] "repair" [...] can mean to make anew or newly father (re + père), which may be relevant.
