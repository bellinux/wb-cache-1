5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the <b>chain</b> <b>anchor</b> points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E

40|$|The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) added {{public key}} {{cryptography}} to the DNS, but problems remain in selecting signature lifetimes. A zone’s master server distributes signatures to secondary servers. The signatures lifetimes should be long so that a secondary server can still operate if the master fails. However, DNSSEC lacks revocation. Signed data can be replayed until the signature expires and thus zones should select a short signature lifetime. Operators must choose between reduced robustness or long replay vulnerability windows. This paper introduces a revised DNSSEC signature that allows secondary servers to operate even if the master has failed while simultaneously limiting replay windows to twice the TTL. Each secondary server constructs a hash chain and relays the hash <b>chain</b> <b>anchor</b> to the master server. The signature produced by the master server ensures {{the authenticity of the}} hash anchor and the DNS data. A secondary server includes both the signature and a hash chain value used by resolvers to limit signature replay. Our implementation shows the added costs are minimal compared to DNSSEC and ensures robustness against long-term master server failures. At the same time, we limit replay to twice the record TTL value...|$|E
40|$|We present several latency {{optimizations}} on {{two classes}} of broadcast authentication schemes for networks where the topology and {{the identities of the}} receiving nodes are known a-priori. Let n be the number of receivers in the network. The first class of protocols involves the construction and dissemination of a hash tree with message authentication codes (MACs) at the leaves. We show that this authentication method can be performed on linear network topologies with n latency and at most 2 ⌈log 2 n ⌉ communication overhead per node. On a fully-connected network, this method can be implemented with 3 ⌈log 2 n ⌉ + 1 latency and at most 5 ⌈log 2 n ⌉ communication overhead per node. The second class of protocols uses an idea related to TESLA where a single MAC for the broadcast message is released, and the key for the MAC is released (or reconstructed) later, once all receivers have received the MAC. Like TESLA, this class of protocols requires an additional minor bootstrapping assumption where an hash <b>chain</b> <b>anchor</b> value needs to be preloaded onto all receivers and all receivers are required to have a consistent view of the current hash chain status. However, unlike TESLA, in the new scheme we can remove the loose time synchronization requirement completely. We show that this allows messages to be authenticated on the any topology in two passes and low constant communications overhead per node. Hence, we can perform the protocol on the linear topology with with 2 n latency and on the fully connected topology with 4. 32 log 2 n + 2 latency. ...|$|E
