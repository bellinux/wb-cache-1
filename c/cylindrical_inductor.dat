40|$|In this work, {{with the}} purpose of {{reducing}} the surrounding disturbance field, a to-roidal inductor for a single pulse test circuit is designed and a prototype is manufac-tured. The manufactured toroidal inductor is 355 μH while the existing cylindrical in-ductor is 270 μH. In addition, the designed inductor together with the existing <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> of the single pulse test circuit are implemented in the COMSOL Multiphysics® program {{in order to make a}} comparison of the magnetic field and to investigate the disturbance of both type of the inductors on the test results of the single pulse test circuit. According to the test results and the comparison made in COMSOL Multiphysics®, it is observed that the magnetic field of the toroidal inductor is much less than the one of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> for the same current (1. 8 kA) and inductance value (270 μH). The magnetic field of the toroidal inductor shows a dramatic reduction compared to the magnetic field of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor.</b> At a horizontal distance of 10 cm from the inductors, the magnetic field is reduced from 42. 798 μT in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> case to 2. 423 μT in the toroidal inductor case; likewise at a vertical distance of 10 cm from the inductors, the magnetic field is reduced from 15. 999 μT in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> case to 0. 850 μT in the toroidal inductor case. Furthermore, 40 A is applied to the inductors in order to measure and compare the magnetic field of the existing 270 μH <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> and 355 μH manufactured to-roidal inductor. The measurement shows that at a distance of 10 cm, the magnetic flux density is reduced from 307 μT in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> case to 0. 28 μT in the toroidal vi inductor case; however the inductor value of the toroidal inductor is higher than cylin-drical inductor (355 μH compared to 270 μH). Moving the circular loop 10 cm away from the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor,</b> the magnetic field reduces by 43 %, likewise when the distance increases to 20 cm, the magnetic field reduction is 61 %. In this thesis a significant reduction of magnetic field in the toroidal inductor com-pared with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> is achieved. At the moment of writing this report, so far, the highest current level and voltage level applied to the manufactured toroidal inductor are 2000 A and 3600 V, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{calculations}} {{of the magnetic}} field induction and the magnetic field intensity were {{carried out by the}} Finite Element Method (FEM) {{with the use of the}} software FEMM. The <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductor</b> of the Magnetic-Pulse Installation (MPI) generates the magnetic field near the surface of the cylindrical steel product as of the uniform as well as variable cross section. It is shown that the regions of the products of the complex cross-section located at the minimal distance to the helix inductor are exposed to highest level of hardening. It is necessary to increase the current pulse in the inductor or to use a split inductor with the variable inner diameter repeating the product profile for hardening of the product regions located at large distances from inductor. The side surfaces of protrusions that are perpendicular to the axis of the system are not exposed to hardening due to the low gradient of the energy density of magnetic field near its surface. In the case of close proximity of the protrusions (for distance less than 1 cm), the material on the product surface in the space between protrusions is not exposedto sufficient hardening. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} studies on the detachment of conductive coatings from the metal substrate by pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF). It is known that at the boundary of a metal substrate and an electrically conductive coating having different electrical conductivities sharp changes of PEMF strength arise. This effect {{has been used to}} remove a copper layer from a steel substrate. Experimental studies were carried out in the Riga Technical University (Latvia), West Saxony University of Applied Science Zwickau, (Germany) and the Samara Aerospace University (Russia). Generators of pulsed current with power capacity from 1 to 60 kJ with discharge rates from 10 to 100 kHz were used. Treatment of coatings was performed using both flat and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>inductors.</b> The influence of a number of factors on the efficiency of the separation of conductive coating (Cu, Al), such as the thickness and material properties of the coating and substrate, the strength of adhesion of the coating to the substrate, the electrical parameters of the equipment and the inductor system, are shown. Examples demonstrating the main application potential of the method include: deleting of a thin conductive coating induced on metallic and non-metallic products by spraying; separation of layers of metal sheets after their joint rolling or punching; removal of conductive membranes used in the magnetic pulse compression of powders...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} of the MHD influence on the flow about two models {{in the shape of}} a cone mated with a cylinder. At the cone vertex and along the mating line two electrodes are located between that an electric discharge is implemented, and inside the <b>cylindrical</b> parts magnetic <b>inductors</b> are housed. One of the models is equipped with a magnetic core inside the inductor. An appreciable difference between the influences on the gas flow about these two models was detected. Dependence of the MHD influence on the flow about the models depending on the polarity of connection of the electrodes to an external voltage source is found. Measurements of the heat flux toward the surfaces of th...|$|R
