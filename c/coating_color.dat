The <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> formulations consisted of commercial raw materials, in most cases latex-CMC colors with a pigment mixture of CaCO 3 and kaolin. Coating studies were carried out at 1000 m / min with a pilot-scale MSP coater. The coating layer formation on woodfree base paper in MSP precoating depended mainly on the base paper surface openness. Lowering the base paper openness by raising the filler content, adding mechanical pulp or through more intensive refining of the chemical pulps resulted in lower coatweights, but better coating coverage. Base paper roughness, small-scale basis weight variation (beta formation) and surface chemical properties of the fibers (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) had no effect on precoating layer formation or coverage. <b>Coating</b> <b>color</b> liquid phase seemed to penetrate mainly into the voids between the fibers, because of the short contact time in the film transfer nip. SEM-BSE and LIPS coverage measuring methods were found to give similar results for the precoated surfaces. The LIPS coverage results were lower than the SEM-BSE results at low coatweights. This indicated that the SEM-BSE method found thinner coating layers to be covered. Low base paper surface openness and high filler content {{on the surface of the}} sheet reduced <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> penetration into the base paper structure and the <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> stayed on the surface better. Dense base papers with high filler contents gave better small-scale uniformity than porous base papers. The coating coverage was sensitive to base paper shadow marking, which was clearly seen as large-scale coverage non-uniformity. With base papers with less filler on the surface, coverage could still be increased by increasing <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> viscosity. Using higher levels of kaolin in the coating formula improved coverage, especially at low coatweights. The machine speed and nip load did not affect coating coverage. The color solids content had only a minor impact on coating coverage. Smaller differences in coverage two-sidedness were observed when both paper sides were coated simultaneously compared to the situation where only one side was coated. When the paper was coated using hard rolls, coating coverage depended largely on the pore size of the base paper. Coatweight was formed mainly through penetration, the result being a dense coating layer. With soft rolls coating layer formation occurred more by dewatering, in which case better coverage was obtained, albeit accompanied by a porous coating layer. The porous coating layer with good coverage was the result of filter cake formation in the film transfer nip. The main mechanism by which coating layer formation took place was pressure-induced penetration of bulk <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> or liquid phase into the voids between fibers in the transfer nip. Water sorption into the fibers was slower than capillary penetration, and the movement of <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> liquid phase by diffusion and possibly by capillary absorption took place mainly after the nip. reviewe...|$|E

As the soft-tip blade couples the benefits of contour coating with those of blade metering the increase in coverage has been achieved without substantially decreasing gloss due to higher surface roughness. A study was made to investigate how the relative change in coating quality was dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> when changing from a ceramic blade to a soft-tip blade. Eight different coating colors were used for topcoat trials where conventional ceramic blades were compared with soft-tip blades. The coating colors had different water retention and rheological characteristics. Their rheology was measured from low to high shear rates alongside with static water retention. Continuous phase viscosity was measured after phase separation in an ultracentrifuge. Oscillation measurements were made on the coating colors to study the thickener-pigment interaction. The uncalendered board samples were tested for optical properties and for surface roughness with a range of instruments. Coating coverage was quantitatively analyzed by scanning burnout samples with STFI Mottling software. Confocal white light microscopy was used to evaluate the surface roughness alongside with the PPS 10 and Bendtsen instruments.

40|$|This paper aims at {{simulating}} {{the flow}} of a pigment suspension in a short-dwell coater (SDTA), a common device used {{for the production of}} value-added paper. The process consists of depositing onto a paper web a thin coating layer, the uniformity and the quality of which depend on the short-dwell coater geometry and the <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> rheology. In order to understand the possible interactions between the hydrodynamics in the pond and the rheological behavior of the suspension, this study focuses on a phenomenon known as shear-induced particle migration, which may result in an non-homogeneous suspension. For this purpose, a numerical methodology based on a shear-induced particle migration model (Sim) and the finite element method is presented and validated against analytical results and experimental data. This numerical approach constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of the}} hydrodynamic mechanisms that govern particle migration in a short-dwell paper coater. In this work, a parametric study of the suspension flow behavior is carried out via the introduction of a new dimensionless number that characterizes the importance of the shear-induced migration with respect to particle convection. The proposed model is used to generate particle distribution templates. It is shown that the particle size and Reynolds number are preponderant factors that affect the extent at which migration occurs in the short-dwell coater. In particular, it is shown that increasing the Reynolds number amplifies the migration phenomena and the formation of high concentration zones within a ring located in a vortex just before the nip. Such a concentration overshoot may then be dragged into the nip, resulting in runnability problems such as web breaks or <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> spitting.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{is based on}} concepts of the Fabry-Perot principle to design a non-absorption inorganic thin film color filter to increase the saturation of color filters. To make red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color filters, the SiO 2 should possess three different thicknesses sandwiched by the silver (Ag) reflective layer. Through thin film optical software simulation, the transmittance and color saturation of R, G, and B color filters were analyzed by changing different thin film materials and thickness thereof. In addition, the actual R, G, and B color filter samples were made by pulse direct current magnetron sputtering and radio frequency magnetron sputtering, respectively. The simulated results show that Ag film has a better transmittance and color saturation than aluminum film. The effect {{of the magnitude of}} refractive index, n of SiO 2 on the transmittance of R, G, and B color filters is not significant, but, it will result in the red color filter sample center peak wavelength shifts at about 20 nm. The better thicknesses of Ag/SiO 2 /Ag for the color saturation as well as transmittance in R, G, and B color filters are 30 nm/ 170 nm/ 30 nm, 30 nm/ 131 nm/ 30 nm, 30 nm/ 100 nm/ 30 nm, respectively. Compared with the organic photo resistance <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> filter, this inorganic thin film color filter has better color saturation and optical transmittance than the organic photo resistance <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> filter. When the color filter deviates 15 degrees from the straight angle, the center peak wavelength of R, G, and B will shift left 15 ∼ 30 nm, and its transmittance will also decrease 1 ∼ 5 %.

Typical coating formulation contains a high number of components, some are made from minerals and others are manufactured from petroleum. The barrier properties of today's paper based packages are plastics and/or aluminum             foil. Environmentally friendly substitutie of these nonrenewable materials are needed.   Nanocellulose is a promising material                 and of a growing interest as an alternative to petroleum-based materials, since nanocellulose films/coatings have been shown to have excellent mechanical and barrier properties.   This project aimed to evaluate nanocellulose in combination with minerals in paper coatings. The project had two approaches. One was to evaluate the barrier properties of MFC coatings with mineral included. The second part was about coatings for           printing matters, and evaluation of the possibility to replace petroleum-based binders in the <b>coating</b> <b>color</b> with MFC. Barrier properties were evaluated by measuring the air permeability of the coatings. The properties of the coating affecting the         printability in offset printing examined was the surface energy, the gloss, the roughness of the coatings, the strength and the offset ink setting.   Carboxymethylated nanocellulose formed denser films and had superior barrier properties compared with enzymatically pretreated nanocellulose. Adding of minerals did not affect the barrier properties of the MFC coatings to a significant extent.         Therefore, minerals cannot be added to enhance the barrier but it can be added to reduce the cost of the coating process without losing any barrier properties.                                  The print quality depends on how the ink interacts with the coating. These coatings did have a relatively high surface energy, which is preferable for printing with waterborne ink. It was also shown that the absorption abilities increased when the amount of MFC was increased. However, offset printing demands high surface strength and addition of MFC in the <b>coating</b> <b>color</b>                     drastically decreased the strength.
