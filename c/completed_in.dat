5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 <b>completed</b> <b>in</b> September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 <b>completed</b> <b>in</b> October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 <b>completed</b> <b>in</b> November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was <b>completed</b> <b>in</b> May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were <b>completed</b> <b>in</b> June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was <b>completed</b> <b>in</b> July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
