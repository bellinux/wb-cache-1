40|$|We {{report the}} characterization, by reverse {{fluorescence}} {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH), of 59 hybrids retaining fragments of human chromosome 5. Most of these hybrids are radiation hybrids generated by gamma irradiating, at low dosage, a monochromosomal hybrid retaining chromosome 5 as its only human contribution. The partial <b>chromosome</b> <b>paints</b> generated from these hybrids will make powerful tools for cytogenetic investigations, especially on the cytogenetic evolution of primates, and examples are reported. The molecular characterization of these hybrids was refined using 74 sequence-tagged sites (STSs), which allowed the physical dissection of chromosome 5 into 71 distinct regions with an average length of 2. 7 Mb. The panel, therefore, is also suitable for high-precision subregional mapping of new genes or sequences located on chromosome 5. As an additional resource for cytogenetic studies involving chromosome 5, we report the characterization, by FISH, of 73 YACs from CEPH.

40|$|Chromosomes of {{schistosome}} parasites among digenetic flukes have {{a unique}} evolution because they exhibit the sex chromosomes ZW, which are {{not found in the}} other groups of flukes that are hermaphrodites. We conducted molecular cytogenetic analyses for investigating the sex chromosome evolution using <b>chromosome</b> <b>paint</b> analysis and BAC clones mapping. To carry this out, we developed a technique for making paint probes of genomic DNA from a single scraped chromosome segment using a chromosome microdissection system, and a FISH mapping technique for BAC clones. Paint probes clearly identified each of the 8 pairs of chromosomes by a different fluorochrome color. Combination analysis of <b>chromosome</b> <b>paint</b> analysis with Z/W probes and chromosome mapping with 93 BAC clones revealed that the W chromosome of Schistosoma mansoni has evolved by at least four inversion events and heterochromatinization. Nine of 93 BAC clones hybridized with both the Z and W chromosomes, but the locations were different between Z and W chromosomes. The homologous regions were estimated to have moved from the original Z chromosome to the differentiated W chromosome by three inversions events that occurred before W heterohcromatinization. An inversion that was observed in the heterochromatic region of the W chromosome likely occurred after W heterochromatinization. These inversions and heterochromatinization are hypothesized to be the key factors that promoted the evolution of the W chromosome of S. mansoni...|$|R

40|$|Cell lines {{derived from}} {{different}} thyroid tumor histotypes {{are useful for}} the in vitro study of both the phenotypic and genetic features of these cancers. Although karyotypic changes {{are known to be}} associated with thyroid lesions, the chromosome patterns of only a few cell lines have been published. Herein, we report an extensive conventional and molecular cytogenetic investigation of the human papillary thyroid carcinoma derived cell line B-CPAP. Morphological studies and expression of tumor markers in this cell line have been reported previously, but no detailed characterization on the origin of the chromosome markers is available. B-CPAP cells have a rather stable hypertriploid karyotype, with chromosome polysomies and structural chromosome abnormalities featuring whole chromosome arm imbalances. Chromosome banding revealed a main clone with nine chromosome markers, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole <b>chromosome</b> <b>paint</b> (wcp), partial <b>chromosome</b> <b>paint</b> (pcp), and centromeric probes clarified their origin. The use of centromeric probes provided accurate refinement of the rearrangements classified as whole-arm translocations by banding and FISH with wcp probes. Both chromosomal and array-based comparative genomic hybridization experiments confirmed the cytogenetic characterization of this cell line. Moreover, the use of fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms (FICTION) technique, which simultaneously shows nuclear ploidy and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence, detailed the oncocytic feature of the cells. Intriguingly, despite their origin, they lack most of the features expressed in papillary thyroid tumor cells and have a chromosomal pattern reminiscent of that of a subgroup of oncocytic malignant thyroid tumors...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Cytogenetic {{analysis was performed}} using G-banding and Molecular cytogenetic analysis by Fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm the breakpoint regions.
