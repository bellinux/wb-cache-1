40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{look on the}} {{suitability}} of composite leaf spring on vehicles and their advantages. Efforts {{have been made to}} reduce the cost of composite leaf spring to that of steel leaf spring. The achievement of weight reduction with adequate improvement of mechanical properties has made composite a very replacement material for <b>convectional</b> <b>steel.</b> Material and manufacturing process are selected upon on the cost and strength factor. The design method is {{selected on the basis of}} mass production. From the comparative study, it is seen that the composite leaf spring are higher and more economical than convectional leaf spring. After prolonged use of conventional metal Coil Spring, its strength reduces and vehicle starts running back side down and also hits on the bump stoppers (i. e. Chassis). This problem is entirely removed by our special purpose Composite leaf Springs...|$|E
40|$|Experimental work {{evaluated}} {{the dependence of}} {{the thickness of the}} cutting edge, its roughness and assessment of appearance with regard to the defects resulting from the diameter of the focal spot during oxidative cutting Yb:YAG laser. Other variables include the experiment: process parameters such as laser power, cutting speed, oxygen pressure and focus position. Experiment is based on the Taguchi tables. Test samples were cut off from sheet thickness 10, 15 and 20 mm. Representatives of conventional steel were S 235 JRC+N, S 235 JR, S 235 JR+N and steel type RAEX developed for laser and plasma cutting. Samples were evaluated according to the ČSN EN ISO 9013. The evaluation of samples was into classes according to standards of quality. Hardness measurements were performed on the samples thickness 20 mm of <b>convectional</b> <b>steel</b> and steel type RAEX...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aluminum has higher conductivity, {{convection}} coefficient, and oxidability, which casuse low plasticity in {{high temperature}} compared to <b>convectional</b> low carbon <b>steel.</b> These properties make its welding numerical simulation much more difficult. Thermal simulation {{is the foundation}} of aluminum’s coupled calculations of thermo-elasto-plastic for welding. In this paper, a butt-joint of aluminum AA 2024 -T 3 ’s welding is numerical modeled based on surface effect element. And bilinear kinematic hardening is used to take into the Bauschinger effect. The simulation results agree well, which shows that node temperature calculation can be improved by this method...|$|R
