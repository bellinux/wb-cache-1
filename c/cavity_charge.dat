In this work, an improved model representing PD behaviour within a spherical cavity in a homogeneous dielectric material has been developed to study the influence of <b>cavity</b> surface <b>charge</b> distribution on the electric field distribution in the cavity. Comparison of measurement and simulation results has been undertaken to validate the model. The model uses a two-dimensional axial symmetric Finite Element Analysis method, which is solved for local electric potentials. The model geometry consists of a homogenous dielectric material and a spherical cavity. The upper and lower cavity surfaces are divided into 10 boundaries each to model charge distribution along the cavity wall. Discharge is assumed to occur along the symmetry axis in the cavity. Once the discharge has passed through the cavity to the opposite surface, it is assumed that charge then propagates along the upper and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces. <b>Charge</b> distribution is assumed symmetrical on the upper and lower cavity surfaces. During discharge, charge density increases on the cavity surface boundaries where charge propagates, until the field in the cavity centre is less than the extinction field. To model the charge movement along the cavity wall through conduction at other times, the change in the charge density on each cavity surface boundary is set as dependent on the cavity surface conductivity. Thus, <b>cavity</b> surface <b>charge</b> distribution will influence the electric field distribution in the cavity, affecting the likelihood of the next PD event...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProtein {{structural}} analysis demonstrates that water molecules are {{commonly found in}} the internal cavities of proteins. Analysis of experimental data on the entropies of inorganic crystals suggests that the entropic cost of transferring such a water molecule to a protein cavity will not typically be greater than 7. 0 cal/mol/K per water molecule, corresponding to a contribution of approximately + 2. 0  kcal/mol to the free energy. In this study, we employ the statistical mechanical method of inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory to quantify the enthalpic and entropic contributions of individual water molecules in 19 protein cavities across five different proteins. We utilize information theory to develop a rigorous estimate of the total two-particle entropy, yielding a complete framework to calculate hydration free energies. We show that predictions from inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory are in excellent agreement with predictions from free energy perturbation (FEP) and that these predictions are consistent with experimental estimates. However, {{the results suggest that}} water molecules in protein <b>cavities</b> containing <b>charged</b> residues may be subject to entropy changes that contribute more than + 2. 0  kcal/mol to the free energy. In all cases, these unfavorable entropy changes are predicted to be dominated by highly favorable enthalpy changes.
