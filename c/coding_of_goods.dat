40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{rules for}} the classification of goods into a customs tariff which complies with the Harmonized System for the Description and <b>Coding</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (HS) are according to General Rule 1, the six general rules of classification, the terms of headings and the notes (and according to General Rule 6 the terms of subheadings and subheading notes). The rules of the tariff schedule are complex, and whilst the overall numbers of headings and subheadings are known, the notes of the HS-nomenclature, the combined nomenclature (CN) and the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) of the European Community (EC) have not been examined in a systematic way. This paper identifies all notes (and subheading notes) which are in force worldwide as at HS 2007 (for sections and chapters) and examines also the sections and chapters for which the EC has established further so-called ‘additional notes’, which are valid only within the EC. The HS 2007 contains 380 notes and 56 subheading notes which are valid worldwide, and the EC has added 98 additional notes within the CN and the CCT (as of May 2007). The 534 notes that accompany the 1, 221 HS-headings, 5, 052 HS-subheadings and 9, 720 CN-subheadings are proof {{of the complexity of}} the rules of the CCT which contains more than 16, 500 legal {{rules for the}} classification of goods...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{rules for}} the classification of goods into a customs tariff which is complying to the Harmonized System for the description and <b>coding</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> (HS) are according to general rule 1 solely the six general rules of classification, the terms of headings and the notes (and according to general rule 6 the terms of subheadings and subheading notes). The rules of the tariff schedule are complex and difficult to overview. The overall numbers of headings and subheadings are known, but the notes of the HS-nomenclature, the Combined Nomenclature (CN) and the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) of the European Union (EU) have only been examined for the CN 2007 in a systematic way. This paper reviews all notes (and subheading notes) which are in force worldwide as by the HS 2017 (in front of sections and chapters), examines the previous versions of the HS 2002, HS 2007, HS 2012 and it examines also the sections and chapters in front of which the EU has placed further so called 2 ̆ 01 cadditional notes 2 ̆ 01 d in its CN which are only valid throughout the EU. The HS 2017 contains 386 notes and 63 subheading notes, which are valid worldwide. The EU has added 109 additional notes within the CN and the CCT (as of December 2016), and can thereby influence {{the application of the}} CCT by help of different and more rigid definitions of goods and methods of analysis. 60 percent of the additional notes are applied for agricultural goods (chapters 01 2 ̆ 013 24). The 558 notes of the CN are legal rules that are used next to the 1, 222 HS-headings, 5, 387 HS-subheadings and 9, 528 CN-subheadings which are an impressive proof of the complexity of the rules of the CCT which contains more than 16, 500 legal {{rules for the}} classification of goods...|$|E

40|$|Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: We {{review the}} recent {{developments}} in the area <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> governance, a set of best practice recommendations regarding the behavior {{and structure of the}} board of directors. Research Findings/Results: Our review of the literature on <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> governance highlights their rapid spread around the world and how academic research has lagged behind in analyzing this topic. Despite the criticism that the codes’ voluntary nature limits their ability to improve governance practices, <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> governance appear to have generally improved the governance of countries that have adopted them, although there is need for additional reforms. Theoretical Implications: Unfortunately, research on <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> governance has developed in insolation with little cross-fertilization across the different disciplines. We propose a multi-level framework to discuss three main topics that have emerged within the codes literature: the motivations behind the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> across countries and its implications for convergence of corporate governance practices; the content <b>of</b> the <b>codes</b> and their “comply or explain ” dimension; and the relationship between code compliance and firm performance. We conclude by proposing four areas of future research. Practitical Implications: Code development, adoption, and compliance are directly related to issues surrounding the governance of the firm, and in particular to all the interactions that a director has inside and outside the firm. Codes are regulations that emerge from policy-making negotiations between multiple stakeholders, such as the state (via the stock market regulators) and the investors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a critical comparative analysis of corporate governance mechanisms in market-oriented (Anglo-Saxon) and large shareholder-oriented (Continental European) systems of corporate governance. Deficiencies in shareholder {{protection in the}} legal systems of both corporate governance systems have been addressed through the use <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> governance, a set of norms that regulate the behaviour {{and structure of the}} board of directors. However, the lower enforceability of norms in Continental Europe limits the applicability <b>of</b> such <b>codes.</b> Therefore, we argue that in Continental Europe, rather than promoting <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> governance, it is necessary to expand market control mechanisms to facilitate the maximisation of firm value.
