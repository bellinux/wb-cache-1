International flights {{generally have}} either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, {{depending on the}} airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer movies or audio/video on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of any class are provided with lavatory facilities, reading lights and gaspers. Larger airliners may have a segregated rest <b>compartment</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> crew use during breaks.|$|R
5000|$|Eve teasing is a {{euphemism}} used in India for public sexual harassment, or molestation of women by men, with Eve being {{a reference to}} the biblical Eve. Across India, all long distance train services have special <b>compartments</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> ladies only. In Mumbai, the commercial metropolis, all suburban commuter trains have compartments specially meant only for ladies, though children of school-going age are also allowed to travel. While two compartments are designated for 24 hours for ladies, one <b>compartment</b> is <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> ladies during specified hours. The ladies compartments are provided for first as well as second class travel. Besides, Ladies Special trains have been introduced during peak hours where the entire train is <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> ladies. There are three-four ladies specials during peak hours. With the number of women needing to travel doubling since 1995, there is a very strong demand for these kinds of services. Many rail services offer women-only cars, including among others the Delhi Metro. [...] It has even given rise to a women-only taxi service.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} form of butler's {{desk was}} a high desk for use by a standing person. It had many drawers of different size and had locks on both the drop front (which later developed) and individual drawers - {{the size of the}} drawers being governed {{by the size of the}} documents they contained and for personal use (some of the larger drawers being used for the butlers clothes in order to save space in the head butlers personal room). Many of these desks would have a secret <b>compartment</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> any important documents that was entrusted to the head butler by the master.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} found to be {{ineffective}} and caused inconvenience for a lot of commuters (including women) and the plan was eventually dropped by the metro authority. But a certain section of seats in each of the eight <b>compartments</b> is <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> women.|$|R

40|$|The film {{focuses on}} deaf {{people in the}} Mumbai {{metropolis}} who travel in <b>compartments</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> disabled people, chatting and exchanging news and information. These spatial practices are facilitated by the peninsular geography and train infrastructure of Mumbai; the city's train infrastructure consists of two unidirectional main train lines. Deaf Mumbaikars occupy certain areas in the <b>reserved</b> <b>compartments,</b> creating deaf spaces where sign language use and deaf sociality are the organising principles. Because these compartments provide a diverse range of deaf people a space for daily meetings {{on the way to}} and from their (mostly hearing) work places and families; they are very effective spaces to maintain and expand networks in the wider Mumbai deaf community. Not only has does this way of traveling strengthen links in the Mumbai deaf community; in addition the visibility of signing deaf groups has caused a growth in deaf awareness and sign language skills among hearing people in these compartments in particular and at the train stations in general...|$|R

50|$|A single {{compartment}} (with toilets) at the no.1 end of {{the carriage}} was <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> ladies; {{at the opposite end}} of each car three <b>compartments</b> were <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> smokers, with brass spitoons recessed into the floor. Sliding doors were fitted at every third compartment along the hallway, with an additional sliding door to separate the five non-smoking from the single ladies' compartment. The partitions fitted with sliding doors were full-height and fitted with luggage racks overhanging the seats, while partitions between back-to-back seats were lower.|$|R
50|$|The final {{batch of}} AW cars was {{constructed}} in 1926 and 1927, again fitted with curved roofs, and numbered 60AW to 68AW. Cars 69AW and 70AW were ordered but not built.

50|$|The sweat bee has {{a simple}} nesting {{architecture}} {{consisting of a}} vertical tunnel into the ground ending in a <b>compartment</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> brood-rearing. They nest underground, like Lasioglossum zephyrum, {{but they do not}} form the same complex structures. Nest entrances are frequently concealed using scattered foliage. For L. malachurum, thousands of nests can be found located within a small region in nesting aggregations, which suggests that the bees likely have some sort of identification mechanism for conspecific nests. In fact, nest entrances and brood cell linings are both impregnated with secretions from the Dufour's gland of the bees, which plays a role in nest orientation. Nests are dug into hard, compact soil and can be sealed from within by the queen using her abdomen. Because nests are dug into hard soil, construction of a nest represents a significant energy expense to a queen, which explains why gynes frequently usurp other nests rather than founding one of their own. L. malachurum is a Western Palaearctic species and nests can be found across Southern England and the Channel Islands, most of continental Europe, and North Africa.|$|R
50|$|Built from 1911, 29 AW {{cars were}} built. They were {{numbered}} 1AW to 29AW, {{and had the}} then-standard clerestory roofs. Over the years these {{were found to be}} insufficient for the traffic, and so numbers 30AW-35AW were built in 1922, the last to have the clerestory roof style. They seated six people in each of the 6 <b>compartments</b> (one <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> ladies and two <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> Smoking), plus two more people at each end for a total of 40 passengers. As patronage grew and older cars were retired, construction resumed in 1925. This batch consisted of 36AW through 40AW, but these cars were fitted with the new style of curved roofs.|$|R

The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes.|$|R
50|$|An {{extensive}} {{stock of}} passenger coaches {{is sufficient to}} operate four passenger trains simultaneously. There is also a limited stock of wagons, used for maintenance purposes. The standard passenger carriage has 16 seats, in four compartments, of four seats each, two facing the direction of travel, and two with backs to the direction of travel. Each standard coach will therefore accommodate sixteen adults, or {{a larger number of}} children. A small number of coaches have received alteration so as to be able to accommodate wheel chairs. One coach has a non-standard seating pattern, with bench type seats around the four sides of a central table in one half of the carriage, and standard compartments in the other half.

2500|$|Pressure cooker {{bombs were}} placed on trains on the western line of the {{suburban}} ("local") train network, which forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport network. Pressure cookers were used in this bombing and other recent explosions to increase the afterburn in a thermobaric reaction, more powerful than conventional high explosives. The first blast reportedly took place at 18:24 IST (12:54 UTC), and the explosions continued for approximately eleven minutes, until 18:35, during the after-work rush hour.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cis-dichlorodiammine {{platinum}} II (DDP) on the intestinal mucosa and the kidney were studied after single and multiple treatments with intervals of 7 - 45 days.

Subsequent treatments led to suboptimal recovery for all treatment intervals. In contrast, DDP induced a 6 -fold increase in [3 H]dT incorporation in the kidney by Day 7 which remained high until Day 21, and returned to near-control values by Day 45.

40|$|The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) {{is one of}} {{the four}} major ligaments of the knee. Owing to its central {{position}} and key role in load bearing and flexing of the knee, it is known {{to be one of the}} most widely injured ligaments of the body. Scientists have been trying to engineer artificial ligaments by using novel scaffolds as a replacement of injured ligaments beyond repair, but have failed in the post-operative recovery stages due to the inability of the ligament-alone graft to satisfactorily integrate with the bone and provide adequate insertional strength. This was found to be due the lack of formation of a specialized fibrocartilaginous tissue known as the ‘enthesis’ at the junction between the bone and the ligament. The current project has focused on the fabrication of a silk-based knitted scaffold which comprises of three compartments, one each for the bone, ligament and enthesis tissues. With a motive to differentiate the MSCs into fibrocartilage lineages in enthesis compartment amidst the mature cell lines, an array of methods were adopted for surface modification of the compartmentalized knitted silk scaffold by using bio-polymers such as silk solution, chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol and hydroxyapatite on the appropriate compartments. The ligament and bone <b>compartments</b> were <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> mature cell line culture. The various methods used for coatings of polymers over the knitted-silk were alternate soaking, plain coating and freeze-drying. The scaffold was characterized for various parameters such as water absorption, biodegradability, tensile strength, purity of coatings, and biocompatibility. It was concluded that the multi-compartment silk based scaffold developed in house has the novelty for tissue engineering the bridge component between bone and ligament i. e. fibrocartilaginous enthesis...|$|R
40|$|Ligaments are a dense {{connective}} tissue responsible for joint movements and stability. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) {{is one of the}} four major ligaments of the knee. Being subjected to high physiological loads, ACL is commonly injured,Surgical management with ligament grafts is often required, but these treatments are associated with complications of reduced strength, joint stiffness, repair-rupture. Interface Tissue engineering (ITE) may effectively address these complications where an artificial ligament incorporating the interfacial fibrocartilage can be engineered to provide similar mechanical and functional characteristics as the native tissue. Therefore a multi-compartmental scaffold that can induce the growth and differentiation of fibrocartilage at the interface of engineered bone and ligament tissues would mimic the native structure of bone-ligament –bone block with deposition of appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) in respective compartments and possession of adequate mechanical properties to support the healing tissue. The current project has focused on the fabrication of a silk-based knitted scaffold which comprises of three compartments, one each for the bone, ligament and enthesis tissues. an array of methods were adopted for surface modification of the compartmentalized knitted silk scaffold by using bio-polymers such as silk solution, chitosan, gelatin and hydroxyapatite on the appropriate compartments.

40|$|Liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) have a {{low rate}} of turnover, but can {{nevertheless}} mount a rapid and efficient regenerative response. However, in some cases of extreme hepatotoxicity hepatocyte proliferation is restricted or even abolished, and instead biliary epithelial cells, {{commonly referred to as}} ductular oval cells, migrate into the periportal and midzonal parenchyma. Initially these cells behave as authentic biliary epithelium with expression of the biliary cytokeratin intermediate filaments, but then show hepatocytic traits such as alpha fetoprotein and albumin synthesis. Thereafter these biliary ducts rapidly vanish to be replaced by either small hepatocytes or intestinal-type cells. The proliferation and differentiation of oval cells is probably strongly influenced by paracrine signalling from liver stellate cells. Oval cells appear to be the progeny of facultative pluripotential stem cells which have the lineage potential of uncommitted gastrointestinal stem cells; these stem cells are likely to be located in the cholangioles and small interlobular bile ducts. Oval cells thus constitute an important <b>reserve</b> <b>compartment</b> <b>for</b> hepatocytes when hepatocyte regeneration is compromised...|$|R

Some cars were built by the Victorian Railways while others imported. Between 1860 and 1880 the Victorian Railways absorbed a number of private railway operators, and their rollingstock was absorbed into the fleet, renumbered to suit.
