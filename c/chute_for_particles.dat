50|$|Cascade Mountain {{is located}} in Portage, Wisconsin. It has 44 trails, 4 terrain parks, and an 800-foot-long <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> snow tubing.|$|R
50|$|The track has a one-mile oval with <b>chutes</b> <b>for</b> 7/8 and 1 1/4 mile {{races and}} a seven-eighths mile oval with a {{diagonal}} straightaway <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> 1 1/16 and 1 1/8 mile races on the turf course. The turf {{is a mixture}} of Common Bermuda and Hybrid Bermuda (GN-1). The track runs twice a year at the Del Mar Fairgrounds and can stable more than two thousand horses. Del Mar is known for its tan stucco grandstand located directly on the Pacific Ocean.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the typical}} coal {{breaking}} plant {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, the coal entered the plant at the upper floor and slid down a gently inclined [...] "picker table" [...] where breaker boys removed obvious impurities such as rocks and large pieces of slate and threw them down chutes to the culm pile. The breakers also removed obviously clean lumps of coal and sent them down a separate [...] "clean coal" [...] <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> crushing. Lumps intermixed with impurities would go down a third <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> crushing and further cleaning.|$|R
50|$|The waste {{materials}} usually travel through a discharge <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> disposal {{depending on the}} design of the gyratory screener. There will be at least one outlet for every deck of gyratory screener.|$|R
50|$|There was a <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> 3200m races (used for the Tenno Sho Autumn races), {{but when}} the race was {{shortened}} to 2000m, the 3200m chute was useless and is not in use as of today.|$|R
50|$|During the 20th century a turbine, an oil engine, a {{vertical}} steam engine, and finally an electric engine were installed in turn; the waterwheel was abandoned. The first-floor loading door had a hinged <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> sliding sacks into lorries.|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} another huge freight train rolled in, Ladrone's car was side-tracked {{and sent to}} the <b>chute.</b> <b>For</b> the last time he felt the jolt of the car. In a few minutes I had his car opened and a plank laid.|$|R
50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of Hollywood's spring-summer meet in 2006, {{it was announced that}} a second chute would be built inside the turf course to accommodate sprint races at six furlongs. This follows a similar move by Monmouth Park to build a turf <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> sprint races.|$|R
50|$|The {{first level}} was for fifty Jersey cows. The second level {{was for the}} horses. This level had four trap doors that served as hay <b>chutes</b> <b>for</b> the cattle. The third level was for storage. It had {{platforms}} {{at each end of}} the barn for drying seeds.|$|R

5000|$|The track {{itself will}} have two courses, similar to the {{previous}} River Downs configuration: the Main Track (dirt) is a 1-mile oval; inside {{of this is the}} turf (grass) course, spanning 7 furlongs, plus a <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> [...] and [...] mile races. The barns consist of 1,350 stables.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{different}} types of specialised crushes used in rodeo arenas. Those for the [...] "rough stock" [...] events, such as bronc riding and bull riding, are known as bucking chutes or rough-riding <b>chutes.</b> <b>For</b> events such as steer roping, the crush is called a roping chute. The rough-riding chutes are notably higher in order to hold horses and adult bulls, and have platforms and rail spacing that allows riders and assistants to access the animal from above. These chutes release the animal and the rider through a side gate. A roping chute is large enough to contain a steer of the size used in steer wrestling and may have a seat above the <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> an operator. The steer or calf is released through the front of the chute.|$|R
50|$|Paratroopers' main parachutes {{are usually}} {{deployed}} by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag {{that contains the}} parachute—without relying on a pilot <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> deployment. In this configuration the deployment bag {{is known as a}} direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.|$|R
50|$|Prior to February 2017, {{the main}} {{spillway}} had been last inspected in August 2016. During that inspection, the spillway was visually inspected without inspectors entering the spillway chute. Inspectors entered the spillway <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> inspections in 2014 and 2015 without finding any concerns. Cracks {{in the concrete}} spillway chute were repaired in 2009 and 2013.|$|R

50|$|With {{the start}} of World War II, the textile company aided in the United States' war effort by {{manufacturing}} parachutes for the U.S. armed forces.

50|$|In the 1870s {{there were}} some 130 inmates. The 1881 census listed 52 residents, {{including}} 3 staff. In 1884 vagrant cells with grading grills and <b>chutes</b> <b>for</b> breaking stone were constructed. In 1901 a Ladies Visiting Committee noted {{that there was no}} infirmary and suggested fitting out a room to separate the sick and dying from those who were only infirm.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} scene, the Coyote prepares his second plan: {{the use of}} a <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> firing a {{cannonball}} into Bugs' hole. After the ball arrives in the hole via the chute from a cannon, Bugs uses a second chute to return the ball to the Coyote, where it explodes on target, causing the Coyote's plan to quite literally backfire on him.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} results of tests performed on eight one-sixth scale models of low headroom transfer <b>chutes</b> <b>for</b> underground belt conveyors. The models were evaluated using a methodology technique to select one <b>chute</b> <b>for</b> further full-scale testing in an underground mine. The study concludes that the slide chute should be tested in an underground 90 /sup 0 / transfer point. The report contains a state-of-the-art survey, a literature search, data from mine visits, test results, evaluation based on the methodology technique, {{and a set of}} guidelines for the design of low headroom transfer chutes. Also included are the preliminary designs of the slide and stone box chutes, scaled up from the designs used in the tests. Following {{the first phase of the}} program, the contract was terminated for the convenience of the government; therefore, the program did not progress to the Phase II full-scale chute fabrication or Phase III field testing...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulics {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of science for centuries. In this paper, new exciting developments are presented in terms of energy dissipation and multiphase flows.

40|$|Forced {{convection}} heat transfer was investigated for two granular materials flowing along a <b>chute.</b> <b>For</b> each material {{and for a}} given depth of flow, the heat transfer coefficient at first increases with velocity, then reaches a maximum and decreases as the velocity increases further.

5000|$|In 1927, the Stock Show {{introduced}} the first side release <b>chutes</b> <b>for</b> bucking horses and bulls, {{a development that}} is now a standard for the sport. [...] As opposed to the earlier front-gate chutes, the side release allows the animal and rider into the arena when the gate opens. The chute has been termed as the safest method yet devised for protection of both cowboy and animal.|$|R
