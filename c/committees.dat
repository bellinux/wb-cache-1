5|$|Local governments also {{generally}} have multiple <b>committees</b> {{such as school}} boards, public safety <b>committees</b> (responsible for overseeing the police), personnel <b>committees,</b> election <b>committees</b> and auditing <b>committees.</b> These may be directly elected or chosen by the assembly, executive or both.|$|E
5|$|<b>Committees</b> are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. <b>Committees</b> can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence <b>committees</b> can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. <b>Committees</b> are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by <b>committees</b> (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however <b>committees</b> have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. <b>Committees</b> hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary <b>committees).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Committees</b> {{comprise}} {{a small number}} of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament. There are different <b>committees</b> with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory <b>Committees</b> are <b>committees</b> which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings. The current Mandatory <b>Committees</b> in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.|$|E

5|$|Once {{legislation}} is introduced, it is passed {{to one of}} the standing <b>committees</b> of the Senate. There are six such <b>committees.</b> As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing <b>committees</b> than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members. Four of the standing <b>committees</b> deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. The Chairs of these legislative <b>committees</b> have the power to determine whether their <b>committees</b> will hear a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation. The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced {{by a member of the}} Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die. Along with serving on the Senate <b>committees,</b> members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint <b>committees</b> with members of the House of Delegates.|$|E
5|$|Organising <b>Committees</b> for the Commonwealth Games (OCCWGs) are {{temporary}} <b>committees</b> {{responsible for}} the organisation of each Commonwealth Games. OCCWGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the CGF.|$|E
5|$|Select <b>committees</b> are {{temporary}} <b>committees,</b> {{established by}} the Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a particular group of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select <b>committees</b> have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select <b>committees</b> usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E

5|$|Senators may {{be members}} of joint committees: <b>committees</b> jointly {{established}} by both chambers of the Australian parliament.

5|$|The Senate's <b>committees</b> {{are formed}} at the {{commencement}} of each new parliament, in accordance with rules {{set out in the}} Standing Orders.

5|$|The <b>committees</b> of the Australian Senate are <b>committees</b> of Senators, {{established}} by the Australian Senate, for purposes determined by that body.

5|$|The {{existence}} of parliamentary <b>committees</b> is mentioned in section 49 of the Constitution of Australia, which makes reference to 'The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate {{and of the}} House of Representatives, and of the members and the <b>committees</b> of each House...' However, the Senate had few <b>committees,</b> engaged in limited activities, until 1970. A number of domestic <b>committees</b> had operated since {{the establishment of the}} parliament, but prior to 1970 the only significant committee to be established was the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in 1932, one of the legislative scrutiny <b>committees</b> (see below).|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of <b>committees</b> {{depend on the}} type of committee and on the work it is undertaking. Most of the <b>committees</b> are established under the Senate's Standing Orders.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of the <b>committees</b> are the pairs of standing <b>committees.</b> These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members.

5|$|<b>Committees</b> {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing <b>committees,</b> full members are the six outlined above.

5|$|Established by Standing Order 18 of the Senate, the {{privileges}} committee {{is responsible for}} reporting on matters of parliamentary privilege referred to it by the Senate. The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its <b>committees</b> {{to be able to}} operate effectively. The bulk of the work of {{the privileges}} committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the Senate, as well as involving investigations of unauthorised disclosures of Senate committee proceedings, complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to <b>committees,</b> and allegedly misleading evidence given to <b>committees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation <b>committees</b> for inquiry.
