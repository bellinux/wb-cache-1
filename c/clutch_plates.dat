25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|E
2500|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} use wet clutches (with the spinning parts bathed in oil) Ducati previously used multiplate dry clutches {{in many of}} their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement {{may not be as}} smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> can wear more rapidly.

2500|$|Like the Model T car, a Fordson tractor {{that was}} {{relatively}} new and well maintained would start easily in warm weather. Under such conditions, often a single crank pull would start it. However, in cold weather, starting could be difficult, especially once the machines were 10, 20, or 30 {{years old and}} worn out. In cold weather, the oil congealed on the cylinder walls and on the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b> The engine had to be hand cranked repeatedly with great effort. [...] Strong men took turns cranking between intervals when individual ignition coils were adjusted. [...] Sometimes farmers would build a fire under the tractor to warm up the crankcase and gear boxes to make it crank easier. [...] The tractor, when in use, was fueled by kerosene, but gasoline was required to start it.|$|E

The Brabus version also features stronger clamping of the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> and a faster gearchange.

50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b> In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|E
50|$|With {{the clutch}} pedal {{completely}} pressed or a motorcycle's lever pulled entirely towards you, {{there is no}} direct link between the engine and the driveshaft, so no power can pass from the engine to the driveshaft and wheels. With the pedal entirely released, there is full contact between the engine and the driveshaft, via the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate,</b> which means that the engine can apply power directly to the driveshaft. However, it is possible to have the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> partially engaged, allowing the clutch to slip. As a result, {{only a fraction of the}} power from the engine reaches the driveshaft which is commonly known as Half clutch.|$|R

50|$|On {{motorcycles}} {{the clutch}} is {{operated by a}} hand lever on the left handlebar. No pressure on the lever means that the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> are engaged (driving), while pulling the lever back towards the rider disengages the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> through cable or hydraulic actuation, allowing the rider to shift gears or coast. Racing motorcycles often use slipper clutches to eliminate the effects of engine braking, which, being applied only to the rear wheel, can cause instability.|$|E

50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The clutch disk is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} starter works with gears and <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> linking the motor and the engine. The clutch {{is used to}} disengage when optimum speed is achieved.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} evolutionary algorithmfor the optimal design of friction clutch. Powerful evolutionary algorithm such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied for optimum design of friction clutch. The main objective function was to minimize the axial force between <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> and pressure plate, using diameter ratio and coefficient of friction as design variable and peripheral velocity as design constraint. The analysis in the present paper is based on understanding the relationship between diameter ratio and the design parameters like inner and outer diameters and peripheral velocity in order {{to arrive at the}} optimum design. It is shown that the dimensionless ratio of outer diameter to inner diameter is the most fundamental parameter, controlling all the major designs as well as performance parameters. The optimum design of clutch can be obtained, satisfying the constraint on design, by controlling design variable. The results of GA are compared with conventional optimization technique in order to satisfy the main objective function to minimize the axial force between pressure <b>plate</b> and <b>clutch</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{technical}} {{change in the way}} oil pressure is regulated in the clutch, i.e. FWD switching.

50|$|Slipping {{the clutch}} (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering the clutch) is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car.

Slipping the clutch {{is known to be}} hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|R

50|$|Cross-drive {{transmissions}} also {{improved the}} drivability of the manual transmissions then in use. Manual transmissions were heavy and tiring to drive, requiring skill and strength from the driver, and also frequent adjustments as the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> wore. The pre-selector gearbox {{had been used}} to simplify the driving task, but at the cost of mechanical complexity. The cross-drive transmissions offered a mechanically-actuated self-changing gearbox, where the ratio selection could be either manual, automatic, or by pre-selection.|$|E
5000|$|The clutch is {{typically}} disengaged by a thrust bearing that makes contact with pressure petals on the clutch ring plate and pushes them inward {{to release the}} clutch pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted away from the petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be [...] "burned out" [...] and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{a car is}} {{in first}} gear, small {{variations}} in engine speed translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking. However, {{with a combination of}} clutch control and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in engine revs are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine.|$|R
50|$|Clutch control {{refers to}} the act of {{controlling}} {{the speed of a}} vehicle with a manual transmission by partially engaging the <b>clutch</b> <b>plate,</b> using the <b>clutch</b> pedal instead of (or in conjunction with) the accelerator pedal. The purpose of a clutch is in part to allow such control; in particular, a clutch provides transfer of torque between shafts spinning at different speeds.
