In filming the sequence, Soderbergh balked at the digital effects solution and managed to reallocate $500,000 from the overall $58 million budget to build a real set of tracks and a train powered by two V-8 <b>car</b> <b>engines.</b> To film the scene, they had six rehearsals, and could only shoot the scene once.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{analysis}} of gearboxes designs a microprocessor-based <b>car</b> <b>engine</b> control system is developed, which allows semi-automatic or automatic gear shifting, thus facilitating driving, decreasing the fuel consumption, increasing the durability of transmission. The microprocessor-based control system of the <b>car</b> <b>engine,</b> which allows the automatic synchronization of angular speeds of entrance and output power stream, and carrying out gear shifting without switching off the clutch was described. The block diagram of microprocessor-based <b>car</b> <b>engine</b> control system, the construction of electro-pneumatic actuator and photo of the gearbox with the executive mechanism was presented...|$|R
25|$|Incomplete {{combustion}} {{of petroleum}} or gasoline results in production of toxic byproducts. Too little oxygen results in carbon monoxide. Due {{to the high}} temperatures and high pressures involved, exhaust gases from gasoline combustion in <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> usually include nitrogen oxides which are responsible for creation of photochemical smog.|$|E
25|$|Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an {{atmospheric}} pollutant. It is not emitted {{directly by}} <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> or by industrial operations, but {{formed by the}} reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at {{the source of the}} pollution or many kilometers down wind.|$|E
25|$|High-temperature {{corrosion}} is chemical {{deterioration of}} a material (typically a metal) {{as a result}} of heating. This non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen, sulfur, or other compounds capable of oxidizing (or assisting the oxidation of) the material concerned. For example, materials used in aerospace, power generation and even in <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> have to resist sustained periods at high temperature in which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing potentially highly corrosive products of combustion.|$|E
40|$|Application of Dynamic Control Systems (DCS) in {{detecting}} and diagnosing <b>car</b> <b>engine</b> Starter Cranks is continuously being implemented to serve different cases {{of real life}} problems such as Control of MEMS-based scanning-probe data-storage devices, track-follow control for tape storage, probe-based ultrahigh-density storage technology, a review of feed forward control approaches in nanopositioning for high-speed SPM and so on. <b>Car</b> <b>engine</b> Starter Cranks faults can be detected by sequence of diagnostic processes which brings about the deployment of an Expert System. An Expert System {{is one of the}} leading Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been adopted to handle such task. This paper presents the imperatives for an Expert System in developing Dynamic Control Systems for detecting and diagnosing <b>car</b> <b>engine</b> Starter Crank faults through input and output requirements of constructing successful Knowledge-Based Systems. Furthermore, diagnosis of <b>car</b> <b>engine</b> Starter Cranks faults requires high technical skills and experience. thus, DCS provides input and output equations in form of Matrix/Vector State Space Representation (MSSR) which is useful in assisting mechanics for <b>car</b> <b>engine</b> Starter Cranks fault detection and diagnosis via DCS and mathematical Differential Equations (DE’s) ...|$|R

25|$|An {{accelerated}} climate {{simulation chamber}} was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time. Materials research into heat resistant ceramics {{for use in}} truck and high-tech <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> was performed, building upon the materials research {{that began in the}} nuclear reactors of the 1950s. In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects. The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding Reagan's economic policy of less government expenditure.|$|E

John Siddeley reported that since 1919 his company had each year produced more 6-cylinder <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> than any other European producer. The two {{key members of the}} Siddeley Deasy design team stayed with the renamed company for many years. John Lloyd was chief designer until 1948 and retired as technical director in 1959. F. M.

25|$|Ricardo {{worked on}} {{spark-ignition}} engines throughout his career, including pioneering work on direct injection gasoline engines {{for aircraft engines}} in the 1930s, but his best-known work was {{in the development of}} high-speed diesel engines, in particular for cars. He was responsible for designing the combustion-chamber for the first diesel <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> produced in quantity for the Citroën Rosalie in the mid-thirties. Later, various versions of Ricardo's Comet pre-combustion chamber were deployed in almost all car diesel engines over six decades, up to the mid 1990s, and the Comet remains one of Ricardo's best-known personal achievements in automobile engineering.|$|E

25|$|Carden Aero Engines was {{established}} by Sir John Carden to produce aircraft engines from modified Ford <b>car</b> <b>engines,</b> these becoming known as Carden-Fords. He had collaborated with the aircraft designer Leslie Baynes on the Carden-Baynes Auxiliary, a motor-assisted version of the Abbott-Baynes Scud 3 designed earlier by Baynes, which flew {{in the summer of}} 1935. In December 1935, Carden was killed in an airliner crash, but in April 1936 Baynes went on to set up Carden-Baynes Aircraft Ltd. Its first product, the Bee, was to exploit a patent applied for by Baynes in December 1933, and granted in June 1935, for a pusher aircraft with a wing that rotated rather than folded for storage. It was to use a pair of supercharged Carden-Ford engines specially configured for the Bee so that they would operate on their sides, within the wing.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{technology}} for buses has seen increased attention since recent battery developments decreased battery weight significantly. Drivetrains consist of conventional diesel engines and gas turbines. Some designs concentrate on using <b>car</b> <b>engines,</b> recent designs {{have focused on}} using conventional diesel engines already used in bus designs, to save on engineering and training costs. Several manufacturers are currently working on new hybrid designs, or hybrid drivetrains that fit into existing chassis offerings without major re-design. A challenge to hybrid buses may still come from cheaper lightweight imports from the former Eastern block countries or China, where national operators are looking at fuel consumption issues surrounding {{the weight of the}} bus, which has increased with recent bus technology innovations such as glazing, air conditioning and electrical systems. A hybrid bus can also deliver fuel economy though through the hybrid drivetrain. Hybrid technology is also being promoted by environmentally concerned transit authorities.|$|E
25|$|Lex Davison, who {{for several}} years would {{experiment}} with sports <b>car</b> <b>engines</b> in smaller Formula 2 chassis, took his first of four victories in a Jaguar engined Formula 2 HWM in 1954, while the previous year Whiteford won his third and final Grand Prix as {{for the first time}} racing cars thundered around the streets surrounding the Albert Park Lake in inner Melbourne. That circuit, which for four brief years gave Australia the strongest taste of the grandeur surrounding European Grand Prix racing, was 40 years later very much modified, used to host the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as the modern Formula One world championship venue. Jack Brabham took his first of three AGP wins in 1955 at the short Port Wakefield Circuit in South Australia. The race is significant in that Brabham was driving a Bristol powered Cooper T40, the first ever rear-engine car to win the Grand Prix.|$|E
