2500|$|With {{hundreds}} of people using the well every day, community support grew to become “The Friends of Artesians,” an informal organization of advocates who {{over the course of}} 20 years mapped and researched the history of artesian wells in Olympia, raised money to test water quality and make improvements to the site and kept the vision of a free flowing <b>community</b> <b>well</b> alive. [...] In the fall of 2008, The Friends announced they would stop testing the water quality after February 2009. [...] These actions renewed interest in protecting the well and lead to the creation of H2Olympia, a non-profit organization.|$|E
2500|$|Olympia was {{historically}} {{dependent on}} artesian waters. Early settlers in Swantown and Tumwater used artesian springs for their main water supply. The artesian spring at Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now called Capitol Way) {{was the main}} <b>community</b> <b>well</b> where settlers gathered to socialize. The artesian well at Artesian Commons park, a former parking lot, is active. Another still flows {{at the corner of}} Olympia Avenue and Washington Street. A [...] was constructed around another spring in the Bigelow Neighborhood. The northeast end of Capitol Lake was the location of an artesian well until {{the construction of a new}} park that included changes to the shoreline. McAllister Springs, the main water source for Olympia, is fed by artesian wells, and the former Olympia Brewery is supplied by 26 artesian wells.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{exposure}} to As naturally occurring in shallow groundwater of the Bengal Basin, tens of thousands of tubewells tapping deeper aquifers of the Bengal Basin have been installed. We address here lingering concerns that As concentrations in deep tubewells might increase over time with monitoring data spanning a period of up to 5 years for 51 <b>community</b> <b>wells,</b> 115 – 545 ft (34 – 164 m) deep, installed in Araihazar upazila, Bangladesh. This exceptionally detailed data set shows that all but 4 of these <b>community</b> <b>wells</b> have consistently provided drinking water that meets the Bangladesh standard for As in drinking water of 50 µg L− 1; all but 10 <b>community</b> <b>wells</b> have also consistently met the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for As of 10 µg L− 1. Groundwater pumped from one third of the <b>community</b> <b>wells</b> does not meet the current WHO guideline for Mn in drinking water of 0. 4 mg L− 1, although Mn concentrations are lower than in most surrounding shallow wells. In addition to As and Mn, concentrations of 10 elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Ba, Hg, Mo, Sb, Pb, and U) out of a total 19 inorganic constituents of potential health concern were monitored and found to be below their respective guideline values established by WHO. Further study is required to evaluate the health consequences of Mn exposure, but the increase in As concentrations in 4 <b>community</b> <b>wells</b> indicates that all deeper tubewells should be periodically re-tested...|$|R
