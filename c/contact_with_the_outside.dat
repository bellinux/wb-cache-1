5|$|In 1848 the Hungarian Lazzlo Magyar {{ascended the}} Congo to the Yellala falls, before {{spending}} five years exploring {{the region to}} the south. Due to his lack of <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, the valuable information that he gathered received little circulation.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 {{profile in}} the book Madcap by biographer and {{journalist}} Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also {{said to have been}} an avid gardener and his main point of <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
50|$|The {{collections}} are ordered chronologically, and include ceramics, sculptures, jewellery, wall paintings, and ritual objects. The monumental art of wall-painting {{is represented in}} great detail. The island's complex network of <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world is also explained.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} was the Iron Age. Three burials {{were associated}} with this period. Also, based on the distinct pottery types, it {{was considered to be}} <b>the</b> time before <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world through trade with China begun.|$|R
5000|$|The Baduy {{are divided}} into two sub-groups; the Baduy Dalam (Inner Baduy), and the Baduy Luar (Outer Baduy). No foreigners were allowed to meet the Inner Baduy, though the Outer Baduy do foster some limited <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|R
5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it {{was in danger of}} being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs {{he was working on}} to Bell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon recorded the fastest lap, ahead of Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe, the Andretti Autosport car of Tony Kanaan and Briscoe's teammate Will Power. Due to the slippery {{nature of the}} circuit, drivers were caught out and ended up inflicting damage to their cars. Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the escape road before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position. Other drivers to hit the wall included Romancini and Milka Duno. Incidents continued in the second practice session, with no less than five drivers spinning or making <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> retaining walls. The session saw the same top four drivers as the first session.|$|E
50|$|For local people, taka was an {{indispensable}} {{means of transport}} employed through {{all aspects of the}} daily life. Until the recent extension of the roads network in the region, Turkey's Black Sea region as a whole largely depended on sea transport in its economy, social life and <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{xenophobia}} {{and intellectual}} introspection {{characteristic of the}} increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa <b>with</b> <b>the</b> voyages of Zheng He.|$|R
50|$|When Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said assumed {{power in}} 1970, Oman had limited <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, {{including}} neighbouring Arab states. A special treaty relationship permitted the United Kingdom close involvement in Oman's civil and military affairs. Ties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom have remained very close under Sultan Qaboos along with {{strong ties to}} the United States.|$|R
5|$|Much {{like the}} {{multicultural}} and metropolitan {{atmosphere of the}} earlier Tang capital at Chang'an, the Song capitals at Kaifeng and Hangzhou were home to an array of traveling foreigners and ethnic minorities. There was {{a great amount of}} <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Trade and tribute embassies from Egypt, Yemen, India, Korea, the Kara-Khanid Khanate of Central Asia and elsewhere came to Song China in order to bolster trade relations, while the Chinese sent embassies abroad to encourage foreign trade. Song Chinese trade ships traveled to ports in Japan, Champa in southern Vietnam, Srivijaya in Maritime Southeast Asia, Bengal and South India, and the coasts of East Africa.|$|E
5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, {{and that he}} has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E
5|$|Dixon {{moved to}} the track's outside at the third turn on lap 216. and made heavy <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> wall which he slid against. His {{right-hand}} side was heavily damaged and his right-rear wheel became detached and the final caution was prompted. Da Matta battled Papis for first place after holding it while the field was under caution. He held it for the remaining four laps to win the race. Papis finished second with Tagliani third. Junqueira took fourth and Kanaan finished in fifth. De Ferran, Andretti, Mears, Barron and Carpentier rounded out the top ten. Servi√°, Vasser, Fittipadi, Gidley, Takagi and Jourdain were {{the last of the}} classified finishers. There were a record-breaking 73 lead changes in the race; 19 drivers reached the front of the field. Papis' total of 54 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Da Matta led 16 times, for a total of 53 laps. The victory was the fourth of da Matta's CART career, his second in a row, and the final of three victories he posted in the 2001 season. The attrition race was low, with 16 of the 26 starters finishing the race.|$|E
50|$|By the 1980s, as China's <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world grew, {{party and}} {{government}} leaders {{at all levels}} increasingly were involved in foreign affairs. The president of the People's Republic fulfilled a ceremonial role as head of state and also was responsible for officially ratifying or abrogating treaties and agreements with foreign nations. In addition to meeting with foreign visitors, Chinese leaders, including the president, the premier, and officials at lower levels, traveled abroad regularly.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{essential}} structures required by every living organism is a membrane that encompasses the cytoplasm (the contents of the cell). Membranes, not only have {{a very important role}} in sustaining <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, but also in protecting the cell against it. Whilst membranes have to be quite resistant to the stressful environment surrounding the cell, they also have to enable uptake of substrates and extrusion of waste products. [...] Zie: Summary...|$|R
50|$|Some Jews, very few, {{like the}} Belmonte Jews, {{went for a}} {{different}} and radical solution, practicing their faith in a strict secret isolated community. Known as the Marranos, some have survived until today (basically only the community from Belmonte, plus some more isolated families) by the practice of inmarriage and few cultural <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Only recently have they re-established <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> international Jewish community and openly practice religion in a public synagogue with a formal Rabbi.|$|R
5|$|Saint and Dayuma, in {{conjunction}} with SIL, negotiated {{the creation of an}} official Huaorani reservation in 1969, consolidating the Huaorani and consequently opening up the area to commerce and oil exploration. By 1973, over 500 people lived in Tihueno, of which more than half had arrived in the previous six years. The settlement relied on aid from SIL, and as a Christian community, followed rules foreign to Huaorani culture like prohibitions on killing and polygamy. By the early 1970s, SIL began to question whether their impact on the Huaorani was positive, so they sent James Yost, a staff anthropologist, to assess the situation. He found extensive economic dependence and increasing cultural assimilation, and as a result, SIL ended its support of the settlement in 1976, leading to its disintegration and the dispersion of the Huaorani into the surrounding area. SIL had hoped that the Huaorani would return to the isolation in which they had lived twenty years prior, but instead they sought out <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, forming villages of which many have been recognized by the Ecuadorian government.|$|E
25|$|The Sentinelese (also {{called the}} Sentineli or North Sentinel Islanders) are the {{indigenous}} people of North Sentinel Island in the Andaman Islands of India. One of the Andamanese peoples, they resist <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, and are among the last people to remain virtually untouched and uncontacted by modern civilisation.|$|E
25|$|The Carthusians do {{not engage}} in work of a {{pastoral}} or missionary nature. Unlike most monasteries, {{they do not have}} retreatants, and those who visit for a prolonged period are people who are contemplating entering the monastery. As far as possible, the monks have no <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, Non possumus was {{the name}} given to the {{diplomatic}} policy of popes Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, Pius XI and Pius XII in their relations with foreign powers, especially after the capture of Rome, where the pontiff became the prisoner in the Vatican and deliberately chose to limit his <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. It is generally thought that the Second Vatican Council downplayed this earlier Church policy.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Weinstone {{was among}} the first American Communists to visit the Soviet Union again, {{following}} a protracted break in direct <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Weinstone traveled at that time without portfolio and was reported by high-ranking party member and FBI informant Morris Childs to have been considering seeking employment and staying in the USSR on a long-term basis. Childs persuaded Weinstone to return to the United States, however, and he returned to America on November 1, 1959.|$|R
50|$|There {{are signs}} the PRC {{internal}} media publication system is breaking down as more information becomes {{widely available in}} mainland China. A Hong Kong-based political journal circulated on the Chinese mainland has questioned {{the need for such}} a system in light of mainland China's modern telecommunications and expanding <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Internal publications are becoming less exclusive; some are now being sold illegally on the street and are increasingly available to anyone with money.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the transcontinental railway, Portland‚Äôs <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world ‚Äì California or the eastern US ‚Äì was largely by sea. These journeys took a long time: they were made for business; to replenish stocks; visits to family; education in the East; or to see the world. Even the inland routes were largely along rivers.|$|E
25|$|Ibn al-Nafis {{philosophical}} {{views are}} mostly known from his theological novel, Theologus Autodidactus. The novel touches upon {{a variety of}} philosophical subjects like cosmology, empiricism, epistemology, experimentation, futurology, eschatology,and natural philosophy. It deals with these themes and others through {{the story of a}} feral child on a desert island, and the development of his mind after <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|E
25|$|The incarcerated bosses are {{currently}} subjected to strict controls on their <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, limiting {{their ability to}} run their operations from behind bars under the article 41-bis prison regime. Antonino Giuffr√® is a close confidant of Provenzano who turned pentito shortly after his capture in 2002. He alleges that Cosa Nostra had direct contact in 1993 with representatives of Silvio Berlusconi who was then planning the birth of Forza Italia.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the Mycenaean centers {{witnessed}} increased <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> {{world and}} especially <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cyclades and the Minoan {{centers in the}} island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in Boar's tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare. In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.|$|R

25|$|Apparently, the Sicilian Mafia {{at present}} is divided between those bosses who support {{a hard line}} against the Italian state, mainly bosses {{currently}} in prison such as Salvatore 'Tot√≤' Riina and Leoluca Bagarella, and those who support the more moderate strategy of Provenzano. The incarcerated bosses are currently subjected to harsh controls on their <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, limiting their ability to run their operations from behind bars under the article 41-bis prison regime.|$|E
25|$|Riina is {{currently}} held in a maximum-security prison with limited <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world {{in order to prevent}} him from running his organization from behind bars, as many others have done. Over $US125,000,000 in assets were confiscated from Riina, probably just a fraction of his illicit fortune, and his vast mansion was also acquired by the crusading anti-Mafia mayor of Corleone in 1997. The mansion was subsequently converted into a school for local children.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{official}} reports on the activities of traffickers, the media reports that traffickers often present themselves as employment agencies or as individual recruiters. Credible sources also identify large organized crime networks, which sometimes consisted of extended families plus their business associates, including recruiters and brothel managers. Traffickers confiscated travel documents to prevent victims from appealing to authorities for protection. Victims, particularly women and girls in prostitution, at times are denied <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Victims often are threatened or beaten.|$|E

50|$|Lohijon‚ÄîThe {{citizens}} of the Tat settlement Lahij in the Ismailli district name themselves after their village Lohuj, plural Lohijon. Lahij is the largest Tat village (about 10.000). Its isolation has prevented local population from <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world which has led their own isolated self-designation. A small community of the Lohijon, descendants of the 1910-20s migrants from Lahij, live {{in the village of}} Gombori in Kakheti, in the east of Georgia. They are registered as Azerbaijanis and speak Azerbaijani as their primary language.|$|R
