40|$|Systems {{biology is}} an {{emergent}} {{field in the}} biological sciences that has enabled biologists to quantitatively study gene circuits and networks by integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and biological approaches. Here, we use mathematical modeling and single- cell fluorescence microscopy to reveal a novel gene circuitry in CMV, a global pathogen and major health concern in infants and immunocompromised individuals. This gene circuitry produces acceleration while limiting amplification of output protein levels {{in the presence of}} transactivators. IE 2 (Immediate-Early 2), CMV's essential viral transactivator, drives this accelerator circuit by autoregulating itself via cooperative binding to the cis repression sequence (crs), a 12 base-pair (bp) sequence located just upstream of the Major Immediate-Early promoter (MIEP) 's Initiator site. IE 2 acceleration produces a viral replication fitness advantage, and mutation of the <b>crs</b> <b>sequence</b> eliminates IE 2 acceleration and produces amplification of IE 2 protein in response to transactivators, severely limiting CMV's replication ability. The [Delta]crs mutant virus exhibits lowered transcriptional strength due to its inability to efficiently localize to sub-nuclear PML bodies, where CMV immediate-early transcription typically occurs. The low transcriptional strength in the [Delta]crs mutant virus results in slower IE 2 expression and a severe fitness cost. To further understand the mechanism behind the IE 2 accelerator circuit, IE 2 's interaction with the <b>crs</b> <b>sequence</b> was studied using gel filtration chromatography and electron microscopy. IE 2 self-multimerizes into a ring -like structure in the presence of crs DNA, using multiple IE 2 subunits.

40|$|To support interference-free quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QS-CDMA) {{communication}} with low spectral density profile in a cognitive radio (CR) network, {{it is desirable}} to design a set of CDMA spreading sequences with zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) property. However, traditional ZCZ sequences (which assume {{the availability of the}} entire spectral band) cannot be used because their orthogonality will be destroyed by the spectrum hole constraint in a CR channel. To date, analytical construction of ZCZ <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> remains open. Taking advantage of the Kronecker sequence property, a novel family of <b>sequences</b> (called "quasi-ZCZ" <b>CR</b> <b>sequences)</b> which displays zero cross-correlation and near-zero auto-correlation zone property under arbitrary spectrum hole constraint is presented in this paper.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} genetic affinities of Aboriginal Australian and New Guinean populations {{by using}} nucleotide {{variation in the}} two hypervariable segments of the mtDNA control region (CR). A total of 318 individuals from highland Papua New Guinea (PNG), coastal PNG, and Aboriginal Australian populations were typed with a panel of 29 sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes. The SSO-probe panel included five new probes {{that were used to}} type an additional 1, 037 individuals from several Asian populations. The SSO-type data guided the selection of 78 individuals from Australia and east Indonesia for <b>CR</b> <b>sequencing.</b> A gene tree of these <b>CR</b> <b>sequences,</b> combined with published sequences from worldwide populations, contains two previously identified highland PNG clusters that do not include any Aboriginal Australians; the highland PNG clusters have coalescent time estimates of ∼ 80, 000 and 122, 000 years ago, suggesting ancient isolation and genetic drift. SSO-type data indicate that 84 % of the sample of PNG highlander mtDNA belong to these two clusters. In contrast, the Aboriginal Australian sequences are intermingled throughout the tree and cluster with sequences from multiple populations. Phylogenetic and multidimensional-scaling analyses of <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> and SSO types split PNG highland and Aboriginal Australian populations and link Aboriginal Australian populations with populations from the subcontinent of India.

We sequenced the {{complete}} control region (CR) and adjacent tRNAs, partial 12 S rRNA, and cytochrome b (over 3100 bp) from eight individuals of Madeiran wall lizards, Lacerta dugesii, from four distinct island populations.

40|$|The rhizocephalan barnacle, Sacculina carcini, is {{a common}} {{parasite}} of the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, in which it causes significant detrimental physical and behavioral modifications. In {{the vast majority of}} cases, the external portion of the parasite is present {{in the form of a}} single sac-like externa; in rare cases, double or even triple externae may occur on the same individual host. Here, we use a highly variable DNA marker, the mitochondrial control region (CR), to investigate whether multiple externae in S. carcini represent infection by multiple parasites or asexual cloning developed by a single parasite individual. Sequences for multiple externae from C. maenas hosts from the Danish inlet, Limfjorden, and from the mud flates at Roscoff, France, were compared. In almost all cases, double or triple externae from an individual host yielded different haplotypes. In the few cases where identical haplotypes were identified from externae on a multiple-infected host, this always represented the most commonly found haplotype in the population. This indicates that in Sacculina carcini, the presence of multiple externae on a single host reflects infection by different individual parasites. A haplotype network of <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> also suggests a degree of geographical partitioning, with no shared haplotypes between the Limfjorden and Roscoff. Our data represent the first complete <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> for a rhizocephalan, and a unique gene order was also revealed.

40|$|The mtDNA {{variation}} of 74 Khoisan-speaking individuals (Kung and Khwe) from Schmidtsdrift, in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, was examined by high-resolution RFLP analysis and control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequencing.</b> The resulting data were combined with published RFLP haplotype and <b>CR</b> <b>sequence</b> data from sub-Saharan African populations {{and then were}} subjected to phylogenetic analysis to deduce the evolutionary relationships among them. More than 77 % of the Kung and Khwe mtDNA samples were found {{to belong to the}} major mtDNA lineage, macrohaplogroup L* (defined by a HpaI site at nucleotide position 3592), which is prevalent in sub-Saharan African populations. Additional sets of RFLPs subdivided macrohaplogroup L* into two extended haplogroups—L 1 and L 2 —both of which appeared in the Kung and Khwe. Besides revealing the significant substructure of macrohaplogroup L* in African populations, these data showed that the Biaka Pygmies have one of the most ancient RFLP sublineages observed in African mtDNA and, thus, that they could represent one of the oldest human populations. In addition, the Kung exhibited a set of related haplotypes that were positioned closest to the root of the human mtDNA phylogeny, suggesting that they, too, represent one of the most ancient African populations. Comparison of Kung and Khwe <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> with those from other African populations confirmed the genetic association of the Kung with other Khoisan-speaking peoples, whereas the Khwe were more closely linked to non–Khoisan-speaking (Bantu) populations. Finally, the overall sequence divergence of 214 African RFLP haplotypes defined in both this and an earlier study was 0. 364 %, giving an estimated age, for all African mtDNAs, of 125, 500 – 165, 500 years before the present, a date that is concordant with all previous estimates derived from mtDNA and other genetic data, for the time of origin of modern humans in Africa. ...|$|R
40|$|The 5 '-end {{sequence}} of the mitochondrial control region (CR) of six flatfishes (Pleuronectidae: Teleostei) from the Yellow Sea (China) and one from the North Sea (Belgium) were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The seven species are the pointhead plaice (Cleisthenes herzensteini), stone flounder (Kareius bicoloratus), variegated flounder (Verasper variegatus), slime flounder (Microstomus achne), finespotted flounder (Pleuronichthys cornutus), yellow striped flounder (Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini) and common dab (Limanda limanda). The sequences obtained were compared and analyzed with those of 10 other flatfish taxa available in databases from the families Paralichthyidae, Pleuronectidae, Scophthalmidae and Soleidae. No tandem repeats were detected {{at the beginning of}} this <b>CR</b> <b>sequence</b> of the seven species studied. The structural arrangement of the sequence appeared highly similar among these species, despite their 5 '-end portion being more variable and 3 '-end portion more conserved. The terminal associated sequence (TAS) motif and its complementary motif (cTAS) were found at the 5 '-end portion and the Extended Terminal Associated Sequence (ETAS) of flatfish and its potential secondary structure was described and analyzed. A conserved motif (CM 5 'd) was also identified in the 5 '-end portion through comparisons with previous studies. Both complete and partial conserved sequence blocks (CSB-F and CSB-D) were detected in the central conserved region (CCR) domain. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the 17 species was conducted based on the 5 '-end <b>CR</b> <b>sequence.</b> The phylogenetic relationships agreed well with those based on morphology at the family level and most of those at the genus level. Ten genera of Pleuronectidae grouped firmly in a big branch in the phylogenetic tree generated, supporting their monophyletic origin.

However, the discrepancy in relationship of Pleuronichthys cornutus to all other species at the molecular and morphological levels in Pleuronectidae, suggested the need for further phylogenetic analysis.

40|$|Six {{subspecies}} of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) {{have been}} denoted based on perceived morphological and/or breeding locality differences among them. Three subspecies are migratory, breeding {{from the high}} arctic in North America and Siberia (lesser sandhill, G. c. canadensis), south through central Canada (Canadian sandhill, G. c. rowani) and into the northern United States (greater sandhill, G. c. tabida). A review of sandhill crane taxonomy indicates that the size variation, {{on the basis of}} which these subspecies were named, may be clinal and not diagnostic. The other three subspecies, all listed as endangered or threatened, are non-migratory, resident in Florida (G. c. pratensis), Mississippi (G. c. pulla), and Cuba (G. c. nesiotes). We used analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequences</b> to determine whether haplotypes representing current subspecies show any genetic cohesion or are more consistent with a pattern of clinal variation in morphology. <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> indicate that only two highly divergent (5. 3 %) lineages of sandhill cranes occur in North America: one lineage composed only of arctic-nesting G. c. canadensis, the other of the remaining North American subspecies (we lack data on the Cuban population).

40|$|The first {{method for}} DNA {{analysis}} in forensics {{was presented in}} 1985. Since then, {{the introduction of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has rendered possible the analysis of small amounts of DNA and automated sequencing and fragment analysis techniques have facilitated the analyses. In most cases short tandemly repeated regions (STRs) of nuclear DNA are analysed in forensic investigations, but all samples cannot be successfully analysed using this method. For samples containing minute amounts of DNA or degraded DNA, such as shed hairs, analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is generally more successful due to the presence of thousands of copies of mtDNA molecules per cell. In Sweden, ~ 40 % of all households have cats or dogs. With ~ 9 million humans shedding ~ 100 scalp hairs per day, and ~ 1. 6 million cats and ~ 1 million dogs shedding hairs {{it is not surprising that}} shed hairs are one of the most common biological evidence found at crime scenes. However, the match probability for domestic dog mtDNA analysis has only been investigated in a few minor studies. Furthermore, although breed –sequence correlations of the noncoding mtDNA control region (CR) have been analysed in a few studies, showing limited correlations, no largescale studies have been performed previously. Thus, there have not been any comprehensive studies of forensic informativity of dog mtDNA. In the two papers presented in this thesis we have tried to lay a foundation for forensic use of analysis of domestic dog mtDNA. In the first paper, <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> were analysed and the exclusion capacity was investigated for a number of different populations. This is also the first comprehensive study of the correlation between mtDNA CR type and breed, type, and geographic origin of domestic dogs. Since the exclusion capacity for analysis of domestic dog <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> is relatively low, it was investigated in the second paper to what extent the discrimination power is improved by analysis of coding sequence. The exclusion capacity improved considerably when 3, 000 base pairs of coding sequences where analysed in addition to <b>CR</b> <b>sequences.</b> This study will hopefully work as a basis for future development of analysis of dog mtDNA for forensic purposes.

Upon screening a human tonsillar cDNA library with <b>CR</b> 1 cDNA <b>sequences,</b> two clones were identified that hybridized at low, but not at high, stringency. Redundant oligonucleotides specific for <b>CR</b> 2 <b>sequences</b> were synthesized and used to establish that the two cDNA clones weakly hybridizing with the CR 1 cDNA contained <b>CR</b> 2 <b>sequences.</b> One of these CR 2 cDNA clones hybridized to oligonucleotides derived from two distinct CR 2 tryptic peptides, whereas the other, smaller cDNA clone hybridized to oligonucleotides derived from only one of the CR 2 peptides. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the CR 2 cDNA confirmed that the site of oligonucleotide hybridization was identical to that predicted from the peptide sequence, including flanking sequences not included within the oligonucleotide probes. The CR 2 -specific cDNA sequences identified a poly(A) + RNA species of 5 kilobases in RNA extracted from human B cells but did not hybridize to any RNA obtained from the CR 2 -negative T-cell line HSB- 2, thus confirming the appropriate size and tissue-specific distribution for the CR 2 mRNA.

Haplotype diversity (h = 0 center dot 9333 - 1 center dot 000) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0 center dot 0046 - 0 center dot 1467) varied greatly among the sampling locations. Phylogenetic analysis of the <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> indicated that M. cephalus in the north-west Pacific belongs to two highly divergent lineages (lineages 1 and 2), with the inferred population structure being {{closely associated with the}} distribution of both lineages. Two populations were identified, one from the East China Sea and the other from the South China Sea. The former samples were obtained from Taiwan and Qingdao of north China and associated with lineage 1 haplotypes. The latter samples were collected from the Philippines, Pearl River of South China and two samples from Japan, all of which were associated with lineage 2. Japanese samples from Okinawa and Yokosuka had different degrees of mixing between lineages 1 and 2. Historical demographic variables in both populations indicated that Pleistocene glaciations had a strong impact on M. cephalus in the north-west Pacific, resulting in a recent demographic decline of the East China Sea population but in demographic equilibrium for the South China Sea population. Japan appears to be a contact zone between lineages 1 and 2, but it may also be indicative of coexistence between resident and migratory populations.

All the species from the Australasian lineage have duplicate CRs, whereas the other species have one <b>CR.</b> <b>Sequence</b> analyses indicate that the two CRs of the Australasian Ixodes ticks have evolved in concert in each species. In addition to the Australasian Ixodes ticks, species from seven other lineages of metazoa also have mt genomes with duplicate <b>CRs.</b> Accumulated mtDNA <b>sequence</b> data from these metazoans and two recent experiments on replication of mt genomes in human cell lines with duplicate CRs allowed us to re-examine four intriguing questions about the presence of duplicate CRs in the mt genomes of metazoa: (1) Why do some mt genomes, but not others, have duplicate CRs? (2) How did mt genomes with duplicate CRs evolve? (3) How could the nucleotide <b>sequences</b> of duplicate <b>CRs</b> remain identical or very similar over evolutionary time? (4) Are duplicate CRs phylogenetic markers? It appears that mt genomes with duplicate CRs have a selective advantage in replication over mt genomes with one CR. Tandem duplication followed by deletion of genes is the most plausible mechanism for the generation of mt genomes with duplicate CRs. Once duplicate CRs occur in an mt genome, they tend to evolve in concert, probably by gene conversion. However, there are lineages where gene conversion may not always occur, and, thus, the two CRs may evolve independently in these lineages. Duplicate CRs have much potential as phylogenetic markers at low taxonomic levels, such as within genera, within families, or among families, but not at high taxonomic levels, such as among orders...|$|R

Here we introduce Garra barreimiae Fowler & Steinitz, 1956, as an interesting system to study the evolution of troglomorphic characters. The only hitherto known troglomorphic population of this species lives in Al Hoota Cave (Sultanate of Oman) close to a surface population. As a first approach, we assessed the genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes of G. barreimiae to determine whether gene flow still occurs.

In Svalbard, centuries of over-exploitation brought the walrus herds to {{the verge of}} extinction, and such bottlenecks may have caused loss of genetic variation. To address this for Svalbard walruses, mitochondrial haplotypes of historical walruses from two major haul-out sites, Bjørnøya and Håøya, within the Archipelago were explored using bone samples from animals killed during the peak period of harvesting. Results Using ancient DNA methodologies, the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND 1) gene, the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene, and the control region (CR) were targeted for 15 specimens from Bjørnøya (of which five were entirely negative) and 9 specimens from Håøya (of which one was entirely negative). While ND 1 and COI sequences were obtained {{for only a few}} samples, the CR delivered the most comprehensive data set, and the average genetic distance among historic Svalbard samples was 0. 0028 (SD =  0. 0023). Conclusions The <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> from the historical samples appear to be nested among contemporary Atlantic walruses, and no distinct mitochondrial haplogroups were identified in the historical samples that may have been lost during the periods of extensive hunting. However, given the low sample size and poor phylogenetic resolution it cannot be excluded that such haplogroups existed...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{fish stocks}} {{worldwide}} are under increasing threat of overfishing, disease, pollution and competition from introduced species. In the Murray—Darling Basin (MDB), the largest river system of Australia, {{more than half}} the native species are listed as rare or endangered. Active management is required to counteract reduction in population sizes, prevent local extinctions and to maintain genetic diversity. We describe the first comprehensive set of DNA barcodes able to discriminate between all 58 native and introduced species of freshwater fish recorded in the MDB. These barcodes also distinguish populations from those in adjacent basins, with estimated separation times as short as 0. 1 million years ago. We demonstrate the feasibility of using DNA fingerprinting of ribosomal RNA (12 S and 18 S rRNA) genes and mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA <b>CR)</b> <b>sequences</b> to identify species from eggs, larvae, tissues and predator gut contents as well as differentiate populations, morphologically cryptic species and hybrids. The DNA barcode resource will enhance capacity in many areas of fish conservation biology that can benefit from improved knowledge of genetic provenance. These include captive breeding and restocking programs, life history studies and ecological research into the interactions between populations of native and exotic species. Christopher M.

40|$|Restricted Access. The phase {{behaviour}} of the discotic mesogen 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11 -hexahexylthiotriphenylene (HHTT) {{was investigated}} under hydrostatic pressures up to 500 MPa using high pressure optical and DTA measurements. The known enantiotropic phase transitions of HHTT, i. e. crystal (Cr) –helical phase (H), H–hexagonal columnar phase (Colh) and Colh–isotropic liquid (I) were observed up to 32 MPa. Application of hydrostatic pressures above 32 MPa {{results in the}} H and Colh phases becoming monotropic, depending upon the applied pressure. The H phase was observed as a monotropic phase in the pressure region between 32 and about 180 MPa. Thus, the I Colh H <b>Cr</b> transition <b>sequence</b> appeared only on cooling under these pressures, while the Cr Colh I transition occurred on heating. Further increases in pressure above a second limiting value leads to the Colh phase becoming monotropic. Thus the I Colh <b>Cr</b> transition <b>sequence</b> appeared on cooling, while the Cr I transition was observed on heating. The T vs. P phase diagram based on the data obtained in the heating mode contains two triple points; one is estimated as 40 MPa, 77. 2 ß C for the Cr–H–Colh triple point {{and the other is}} extrapolated as 285 MPa, 118. 3 ß C for the Cr–Colh–I triple point. These triple points de ne the upper limits for the appearance of the stable H and Colh phases, respectively...|$|R
40|$|With {{this work}} we {{addressed}} some molecular systematic issues within the Mugil cephalus species complex. Particular attention {{was paid to}} the debated situations of: (i) Mugil liza, occurring in partial sympatry with Mugil cephalus in the northwestern Atlantic, and (ii) Mugil platanus, considered by some authors a synonymy of the former species and distributed in the southwestern Atlantic. We sequenced 79 individuals of a 465 -bp portion of the mitochondrial control region (CR) from 8 western Atlantic and 2 Mediterranean localities. In addition, all <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> available from GenBank for the studied taxa were added to our dataset, for a total of 323 individuals. Overall, 229 haplotypes corresponding to 8 divergent monophyletic lineages were detected. Results of phylogenetic analyses were consistent with the occurrence of past speciation events producing the observed lineages. Of these lineages, 7 correspond to cryptic species and one is constituted by M. liza and M. platanus. As a matter of fact, these 2 taxa constitute a single lineage within the M. cephalus species complex. However, individuals of M. liza/M. platanus lineage analyzed by means of the 18 mitochondrial markers available in GenBank exhibited a degree of genetic diversity consistent with highly divergent populations. Of the 8 lineages detected, the Mediterraean one (type locality) corresponds to M. cephalus; the lineage M. liza/M. platanus should be named M. liza, under the priority principle, and the left 6 lineages need formal description...|$|R
40|$|SummaryOn {{the basis}} of {{comprehensive}} RFLP analysis, it has been inferred that ∼ 97 % of Native American mtDNAs belong to one of four major founding mtDNA lineages, designated haplogroups “A”–“D. ” It has been proposed that a fifth mtDNA haplogroup (haplogroup X) represents a minor founding lineage in Native Americans. Unlike haplogroups A–D, haplogroup X is also found at low frequencies in modern European populations. To investigate the origins, diversity, and continental relationships of this haplogroup, we performed mtDNA high-resolution RFLP and complete control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequence</b> analysis on 22 putative Native American haplogroup X and 14 putative European haplogroup X mtDNAs. The results identified a consensus haplogroup X motif that characterizes our European and Native American samples. Among Native Americans, haplogroup X appears to be essentially restricted to northern Amerindian groups, including the Ojibwa, the Nuu-Chah-Nulth, the Sioux, and the Yakima, although we also observed this haplogroup in the Na-Dene–speaking Navajo. Median network analysis indicated that European and Native American haplogroup X mtDNAs, although distinct, nevertheless are distantly related to each other. Time estimates {{for the arrival of}} X in North America are 12, 000 – 36, 000 years ago, depending on the number of assumed founders, thus supporting the conclusion that the peoples harboring haplogroup X were among the original founders of Native American populations. To date, haplogroup X has not been unambiguously identified in Asia, raising the possibility that some Native American founders were of Caucasian ancestry...|$|R
40|$|Pseudoplatystoma {{species are}} highly prized South American Pimelodid migratory catfishes. Until recently, their {{taxonomy}} was not clearly established, with discrepancies between morphological and molecular analyses. Here, Pseudoplatystoma species from the Peruvian Amazon were characterized {{at the molecular}} level from a sample representing the observed range of their color pattern variations in the study area. Analyses were performed using seven microsatellite loci for 103 specimens and, for part of them (52), using sequences of two regions of their mitochondrial genome [Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Control Region (CR) ]. Factorial correspondence analysis and assignment tests based on microsatellite polymorphism showed that the specimens originally identified as P. punctifer belonged to two different gene pools highly differentiated from P. tigrinum. Morphological examination identified two different morphotypes (with and without black stripes), suggesting the existence of two distinct taxa within P. punctifer. This result was corroborated by the ML tree based on <b>CR</b> <b>sequences,</b> where all individuals but four clustered in a similar way as in the FCA and Bayesian assignment tests. For these four individuals, mitochondrial introgression or retention of ancestral polymorphism was likely. In contrast, the ML tree based on COI sequences showed that reciprocal monophyly was not yet achieved for this marker for the two P. punctifer taxa. The existence of three sympatric species of Pseudoplatystoma in the Peruvian Amazon is discussed in relation to their molecular characteristics, color patterns and ecology. Evolutionary scenarios regarding their divergence are hypothesized...|$|R
40|$|Extensive use of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} {{has led to}} {{the selection}} of pathogenic streptococci resistant to β-lactams due to modifications of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBP 2 b from Streptococcus pneumoniae is a monofunctional (class B) high-molecular-weight PBP catalyzing the transpeptidation between adjacent stem peptides of peptidoglycan. The transpeptidase domain of PBP 2 b isolated from seven clinical resistant (CR) strains contains 7 to 44 amino acid changes over the sequence of PBP 2 b from the R 6 β-lactam-sensitive strain. We show that the extracellular soluble domains of recombinant PBP 2 b proteins (PBP 2 b*) originating from these CR strains have an in vitro affinity for penicillin G that is reduced by up to 99 % from that of the R 6 strain. The Thr 446 Ala mutation is always observed in CR strains and is close to the key conserved motif (S 443 SN). The Thr 446 Ala mutation in R 6 PBP 2 b* displays a 60 % reduction in penicillin G affinity in vitro compared to that for the wild-type protein. A recombinant R 6 strain expressing the R 6 PBP 2 b Thr 446 Ala mutation is twofold less sensitive to piperacillin than the parental S. pneumoniae strain. Analysis of the Thr 446 Ala mutation {{in the context of the}} PBP 2 b <b>CR</b> <b>sequences</b> revealed that its influence depends upon the presence of other unidentified mutations...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study of Southeast Asian genetic variation, we characterized mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) from six populations through high-resolution {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. Our analysis revealed that these Southeast Asian populations were genetically similar to each other, suggesting they had a common origin. However, other patterns of population associations also emerged. Haplotypes from a major founding haplogroup in Papua New Guinea were present in Malaysia; the Vietnamese and Malaysian aborigines (Orang Asli) had high frequencies of haplogroup F, which was also seen in most other Southeast Asian populations; and haplogroup B, defined by the Region V 9 -base-pair deletion, was present throughout the region. In addition, the Malaysian and Sabah (Borneo) aborigine populations exhibited a number of unique mtDNA clusters that were not observed in other populations. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to compare these patterns of genetic diversity with those shown in subsequent studies of mtDNA variation in Southeast Asian populations because the latter have typically sequenced the first hypervariable segment (HVS-I) of the control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequencing</b> rather than used RFLP haplotyping to characterize the mtDNAs present in them. For this reason, we sequenced the HVS-I of Southeast Asian mtDNAs that had previously been subjected to RFLP analysis, and compared the resulting data with published information from other Southeast Asian and Oceanic groups. Our findings reveal broad patterns of mtDNA haplogroup distribution in Southeast Asia that may reflect different population expansion events in this region over the past 50, 000 – 5000 years...|$|R

The genome PCR amplification was performed using the complementary primers to the flanking regions of Bombyx mori CR mitochondrial segment. The sequencing revealed that the amplified product was 568 bp long, which was smaller than that observed for B. mori (725 bp). Within the amplified segment, a sequence with 338 nucleotides was identified as the control region, which displayed a high AT content (93. 5 %).

40|$|Published online 23 November 2011 The {{assumption}} {{that almost all}} mammal species are known to science {{has led to a}} recent trend away from collecting voucher specimens/tissues during field studies. Here we present a case study of a recently discovered cryptic marsupial (Sminthopsis griseoventer) in South Australia (SA) and show how such collections can contribute to rigorous biodiversity and biogeographic assessments. Morphological and genetic (allozyme and mitochondrial control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequence</b> data) analyses, including ancient DNA analyses of type material, were applied to 188 voucher specimens and 94 non-vouchered tissues of Sminthopsis held at the SA Museum. These data were used to confirm the presence of S. griseoventer in SA, validate means of identifying it morphologically and describe recent and pre-European distributions. Pelage differences between S. griseoventer and S. dolichura enabled their identification, but external measurements overlapped considerably. Subfossil S. griseoventer were identified from seven deposits and confirmed that in the past the species was more widespread in SA. CR divergences (> 1. 8 %) among Western Australian and SA S. griseoventer suggested its long-term presence in SA. Discrepancies between the mitochondrial and allozyme affinities of S. aitkeni and S. griseoventer, coupled with the lack of obvious morphological differences, indicate that a taxonomic reappraisal of these species is warranted. The study strongly demonstrates an ongoing need for the routine collection of mammal voucher material in biological and environmental impact surveys. Catherine M. Kemper, Steven J. B.

40|$|Great rivers were {{generally}} {{looked at as}} the geographical barrier to gene flow for many taxonomic groups. The Yangtze River is the third largest river in the world, and flows across South China and into the East China Sea. Up until now, {{few studies have been}} carried out to evaluate its effect as a geographical barrier. In this study, we attempted to determine the barrier effect of the Yangtze River on the tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus) using the molecular ecology approach. Using mitochondrial DNA control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequences</b> and 13 nuclear microsatellite loci, we explored the genetic structure and gene flow in two adjacent tufted deer populations (Dabashan and Wulingshan populations), which are separated by the Yangtze River. Results indicated that there are high genetic diversity levels in the two populations, but no distinguishable haplotype group or potential genetic cluster was detected which corresponded to specific geographical population. At the same time, high gene flow was observed between Wulingshan and Dabashan populations. The tufted deer populations experienced population decrease from 0. 3 to 0. 09 Ma BP, then followed by a distinct population increase. A strong signal of recent population decline (T = 4, 396 years) was detected in the Wulingshan population by a Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressions(MSVAR) process population demography analysis. The results indicated that the Yangtze River may not act as an effective barrier to gene flow in the tufted deer. Finally, we surmised that the population demography of the tufted deer was likely affected by Pleistocene climate fluctuations and ancient human activities...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, to {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} evolutionary history of sheep, the mitochondrial (mt) DNA polymorphisms occurring in modern Turkish native domestic (n = 628), modern wild (Ovis gmelinii anatolica) (n = 30) and ancient domestic sheep from Oylum Höyük in Kilis (n = 33) were examined comparatively with the accumulated data in the literature. The lengths (75 bp/ 76 bp) of the second and subsequent repeat units of the mtDNA control region (<b>CR)</b> <b>sequences</b> differentiated the five haplogroups (HPGs) observed in the domestic sheep into two genetic clusters as was already implied by other mtDNA markers: the first cluster being composed of HPGs A, B, D and the second cluster harboring HPGs C, E. To manifest genetic relatedness between wild Ovis gmelinii and domestic sheep haplogroups, their partial cytochrome B sequences were examined together on a median-joining network. The two parallel but wider aforementioned clusters were observed also on the network of Ovis gmelenii individuals, within which domestic haplogroups were embedded. The Ovis gmelinii wilds of the present day appeared to be distributed on two partially overlapping geographic areas parallel to the genetic clusters that they belong to (the first cluster being in the western part of the overall distribution). Thus, the analyses suggested that the domestic sheep may be the products of two maternally distinct ancestral Ovis gmelinii populations. Furthermore, Ovis gmelinii anatolica individuals exhibited a haplotype of HPG A (n = 22) and another haplotype (n = 8) from the second cluster which was not observed among the modern domestic sheep...|$|R
