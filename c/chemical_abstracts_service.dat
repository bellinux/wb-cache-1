30|$|Ideally, a {{chemical}} {{is properly identified}} {{through the use of}} a <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> number (CAS-number or Registry number) which is far more convenient than dealing with the full chemical IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) -name or CA-index name). The CAS number designates a unique chemical substance and is extremely useful for scientific and technical communication. For example, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) relies on CAS numbers for the definite identification of chemical substances (EPA-United States Environmental Protection Agency 1998). Also in the European Union (EU), the REACH (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) candidate list relies on a proper identification of these problematic substances (REACH 2007). Here we meet the first obstacle because WoS do not register CAS numbers in a proper index. Registration only takes place when the numbers are present in the title or abstract of the publications. We assume that chemical substance identification is more carefully treated by CAS. Obviously, this is the case through the unique identification by CAS numbers. However, in performing a practical analysis a number of problems showed up which may distort the results obtained.|$|R

40|$|WAC 296 - 848 - 100 Scope. This chapter {{applies to}} all {{occupational}} exposure to inorganic arsenic. Definitions: Inorganic arsenic means elemental arsenic (As), copper aceto-arsenite, and inorganic compounds containing arsenic (measured as As), except arsine. Inorganic compounds do not contain the element carbon. Exposure is the contact an employee has with inorganic arsenic, whether or not protection is provided by respirators or other personal protective equipment (PPE). Exposure can occur through various routes of entry such as inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, or skin absorption. Helpful tool: Arsenic contamination in soil; information and guidance for employers. Use this tool if you have employees who work with soil. It will help you find out if this rule is applicable to your employee's exposure to soil.

40|$|AbstractThe process streams refined from {{petroleum}} {{crude oil}} {{for use in}} petroleum products are among those designated by USEPA as UVCB substances (unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products and biological materials). They are identified on global chemical inventories with unique <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Services</b> (CAS) numbers and names. The chemical complexity of most petroleum substances presents challenges when evaluating their hazards and can result in differing evaluations due to the varying level of hazardous constituents and differences in national chemical control regulations. Global efforts to harmonize the identification of chemical hazards are aimed at promoting the use of consistent hazard evaluation criteria. This paper discusses a systematic approach for the health hazard evaluation of petroleum substances using chemical categories and the United Nations (UN) Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of classification and labeling. Also described are historical efforts to characterize the hazard of these substances and how they {{led to the development}} of categories, the identification of potentially hazardous constituents which should be considered, and a summary of the toxicology of the major petroleum product groups. The use of these categories can increase the utility of existing data, provide better informed hazard evaluations, and reduce the amount of animal testing required...|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} to recover natural gas depends on undisclosed types and amounts of toxic chemicals. A list of 944 products containing 632 chemicals used during natural gas operations was compiled. Literature searches {{were conducted to}} determine potential health effects of the 353 chemicals identified by <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> (CAS) numbers. More than 75 % of the chemicals could affect the skin, eyes, and other sensory organs, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Approximately 40 - 50 % could affect the brain/nervous system, immune and cardiovascular systems, and the kidneys; 37 % could affect the endocrine system; and 25 % could cause cancer and mutations. These results indicate that many chemicals used during the fracturing and drilling stages of gas operations may have long-term health effects that are not immediately expressed. In addition, an example was provided of waste evaporation pit residuals that contained numerous chemicals on the CERCLA and EPCRA lists of hazardous substances. The discussion highlights the difficulty of developing effective water quality monitoring programs.

40|$|AbstractEver {{since the}} {{interest}} in organic environmental contaminants first emerged 50 years ago, {{there has been a}} need to present discussion of such chemicals and their transformation products using simple abbreviations so as to avoid the repetitive use of long chemical names. As the number of chemicals of concern has increased, the number of abbreviations has also increased dramatically, sometimes resulting in the use of different abbreviations for the same chemical. In this article, we propose abbreviations for flame retardants (FRs) substituted with bromine or chlorine atoms or including a functional group containing phosphorus, i. e. BFRs, CFRs and PFRs, respectively. Due to the large number of halogenated and organophosphorus FRs, it has become increasingly important to develop a strategy for abbreviating the chemical names of FRs. In this paper, a two step procedure is proposed for deriving practical abbreviations (PRABs) for the chemicals discussed. In the first step, structural abbreviations (STABs) are developed using specific STAB criteria based on the FR structure. However, since several of the derived STABs are complicated and long, we propose instead the use of PRABs. These are, commonly, an extract of the most essential part of the STAB, while also considering abbreviations previously used in the literature. We indicate how these can be used to develop an abbreviation that can be generally accepted by scientists and other professionals involved in FR related work. Tables with PRABs and STABs for BFRs, CFRs and PFRs are presented, including CAS (<b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service)</b> numbers, notes of abbreviations that have been used previously, CA (<b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract)</b> name, common names and trade names, as well as some fundamental physico-chemical constants...|$|R
40|$|A 2001 {{study of}} Cleveland, Ohio {{brownfield}} surface soil contamination {{led to the}} examination of state regulatory guidance values for soils. Surface soils were of particular interest since these generally pose the greatest risk to human health at brownfield sites. This investigation initially focused on heavy metals, common contaminants at Cleveland brownfields. However, the observation of significant variability in guidance values applied to Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn led to questions about other state-regulated components and ultimately to research examining the origins, magnitudes, and explanations for regulatory guidance value variability. The results presented here {{are based on the}} compilation of an 18, 776 state surface soil database assembled from regulatory guidance for organic, inorganic, and element contaminants. All values were captured electronically from internet sources. The structure of each guidance value dataset was then standardized in a database-compatible format. <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> (CAS) registry numbers were added to each record if they were not already provided. Identification of all records by CAS number resolves the problem of chemical synonyms.
