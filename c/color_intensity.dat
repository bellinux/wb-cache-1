Murray left when changes in editorial policies took place. Don Daley took over and wanted to include superheroes and not continue the series in real-time.

25|$|Musical {{expression}} {{is the art}} of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, <b>color,</b> <b>intensity,</b> energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical {{expression is}} sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is {{more than the sum of}} measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E

40|$|Image {{sequences}} with dynamic backgrounds often cause false {{classification of}} pixels. In particular, varying illuminations cause {{significant changes in}} the representation of a scene in different color spaces, which in turn results in the high levels of failure in such conditions. Because mapping to alternate color spaces has largely failed to solve this problem, a solution of using alternate image features is proposed in this paper. In particular, the use of gradient and texture features along with the original <b>color</b> <b>intensities</b> are used in an ensemble of Mixture of Gaussians background classifiers. A clear improvement is shown when using this method compared to the Mixture of Gaussians algorithm using only <b>color</b> <b>intensities.</b> In addition, this work shows that performing background subtraction using only gradient magnitude as an image feature performs at a much higher rate in varying illuminations then using <b>color</b> <b>intensities.</b> Results are generated on three separate datasets, each with unique, dynamic, illumination conditions. 1...|$|R

25|$|Seurat took {{to heart}} the color theorists' {{notion of a}} {{scientific}} approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art {{in the same way}} that a musician uses counterpoint and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of heuristics and he set out to show this language using lines, <b>color</b> <b>intensity</b> and color schema. Seurat called this language Chromoluminarism.|$|E
25|$|His drawing {{style was}} simple yet bold. It {{captured}} aspects of youth that were innocent and carefree. They reflected the wishful or nostalgic sentiment of the time. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers {{to make an}} instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was {{through the use of}} various techniques, such as overlapping, <b>color</b> <b>intensity</b> or variation and linear perspective. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then). Martin mostly hired local boys for the photo sessions. His drawings were made directly from those photos, and not real life (which required long sittings). This gave him more options and flexibly, as the final version was based on multiple photos taken during the shoot (along with some improvising). It was also a more practical process, due to active children being involved. He would interact with them, until getting the desired natural or candid expression. His wife assisted in preparing the models for their scenes. Collier's couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following WWII, and ceased publication in December 1956. The main culprit was television, which dramatically took away from its advertising and circulation revenue. Collier's top competitors (Life, Look and Post) adapted somewhat better to the changing times, which helped them hold out longer.|$|E

The proposed method firstly generates multi-scale supervoxels from 3 D point clouds using <b>colors,</b> <b>intensities</b> and spatial distances.

Then, the saliency of each segment is calculated and the most salient segment is selected as a seed to cluster for objects clustering. Hence, the objects are classified and the constraint conditions of object's category are included to re-clustering for more accurate extraction of objects. Experiments show that the proposed method has a promising solution for extracting buildings, ground, street lamps, trees, telegraph poles, traffic signs, cars, enclosures and the objects extraction overall accuracy is 92. 3 %...|$|R

30|$|In {{regards to}} the fact that the product of iLAMP is DNA, {{molecular}} nanoprobes can be utilized to detect it. The application of nanoprobes adds further sensitivity and specificity to iLAMP. Considering the fact that the sequence of iLAMP products can be inferred from the sequence of signal DNA, nanoprobes can be easily designed for specific detection of iLAMP products. Application of these nanoprobes can have potential advantages. Firstly, application of probes makes this method more specific than other current methods. Secondly, color change can be easily quantified by simple spectrophotometry or colorimetry based on <b>color</b> <b>intensities,</b> so that <b>color</b> <b>intensities</b> indirectly can be correlated with concentration of target protein [37]. This format is called ‘iLAMP-nanoprobe’ method and can be an appropriate alternative for real-time iPCR, which is used for quantification or determination of the primary concentration of target protein. Real-time iPCR has significant pitfalls which iLAMP-nanoprobe method does not have. These pitfalls include high cost, requirement of expert personnel, advanced instruments, and much time [20]. Thus, in addition to qualitative iPCR and other similar methods, iLAMP-Au-nanoprobe method can be used instead of real-time iPCR.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{proposed}} a new technique; weight co-occurrence based integrated <b>color</b> and <b>intensity</b> matrix (WCICIM) for content based image retrieval. The proposed image indexing technique introduced {{a feature that}} utilizes color and texture properties of the image. Hue, saturation and <b>intensity</b> (HSV) <b>color</b> space is the good representation to extract color and texture information. In this paper advantages of HSV space are utilized in calculating <b>color</b> and <b>intensity</b> weights for each pixel. We construct the weight matrixes by applying suitable weights function to decide the contribution of <b>color</b> and <b>intensity</b> for each pixel. WCICI matrix is constructed as the combination of 4 correlation matrixes (color- color, color-intensity, intensity-color and intensity-intensity) based on neighboring pixel variations in weight matrixes {{with the help of}} quantized HSV space. Integrated <b>color</b> and <b>intensity</b> co-occurrence matrix (ICICM) based image retrieval technique does not consider the weight correlation. Proposed image retrieval feature with the combination of ICICM feature improves the retrieval performance significantly. The proposed technique results are compared with combination of wavelet decomposition and gradient vector features [9], motif co-occurrence matrix [12], ICICM [13], color-texture and color-histogram based image retrieval system (CTCHIS) [16], color correlogram [17] based CBIR techniques.

30|$|In recent times, {{combination}} of texture and color features {{has been proved}} effective in image retrieval. Jhanwar et al.

(2007) combined <b>color</b> and <b>intensity</b> co-occurrence matrix. After analyzing the features of HSV space, an appropriate weight values have been suggested to extract relative share of <b>color</b> and <b>intensity</b> levels of a pixel.|$|R

30|$|For image segmentation, {{split and}} merge {{approach}} is an efficient approach to employ {{local and global}} characteristics of <b>color</b> <b>intensities</b> of an image. The method subdivides an image initially into a set of arbitrary and disjoint regions by a fast over-segmentation algorithm which produces regions as parts of objects of interest. Then, those regions are iteratively merged until satisfying the homogeneous condition or when no further merging is possible. An important characteristic of graph-based method as stated in [17] {{is its ability to}} preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions.|$|R
