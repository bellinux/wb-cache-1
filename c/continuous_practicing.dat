40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{learning}} a new skill leads to structural changes in the brain. However, it is unclear whether it is the acquisition or <b>continuous</b> <b>practicing</b> of the skill that causes this effect and whether brain connectivity of patients with schizophrenia can benefit from such practice. We examined the effect of 6 months exercise on a stationary bicycle on the brain in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Biking is an endemic skill in the Netherlands and thus offers an ideal situation to disentangle the effects of learning vs practice. The 33 participating patients with schizophrenia and 48 healthy individuals were assigned to either one of two conditions, ie, physical exercise or life-as-usual, balanced for diagnosis. Diffusion tensor imaging brain scans were made prior to and after intervention. We demonstrate that irrespective of diagnosis regular physical exercise of an overlearned skill, such as bicycling, significantly increases the integrity, especially of motor functioning related, white matter fiber tracts whereas life-as-usual leads to a decrease in fiber integrity. Our findings imply that exercise of an overlearned physical skill improves brain connectivity in patients and healthy individuals. This has important implications for understanding the effect of fitness programs on the brain in both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, the outcome may even apply to the nonphysical realm...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{programming}} {{is known to}} be one of the most difficult courses for students in the first year of engineering. They are faced with the challenge of abstract thinking and gaining programming skills for the first time. These skills are acquired by <b>continuous</b> <b>practicing</b> from the start of the course. In order to enhance the motivation and dynamism of the learning and assessment processes, we have proposed the use of three educational resources namely screencasts, self-assessment questionnaires and automated grading of assignments. These resources have been made available in Moodle which is a Learning Management System widely used in education environments and adopted by the Telecommunications Engineering School at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). Both teachers and students can enhance the learning and assessment processes through the use of new educational activities such as self-assessment questionnaires and automated grading of assignments. On the other hand, multimedia resources such as screencasts can guide students in complex topics. The resources proposed allow teachers to improve their tutorial actions since they provide immediate feedback and comments to students without the enormous effort of manual correction and evaluation by teachers specially taking into account the large number of students enrolled in the course. In this paper we present the case study where three proposed educational resources were applied. We describe the special features of the course and explain why the use of these resources can both enhance the students? motivation and improve the teaching and learning processes. Our research work was carried out on students attending the "Computer programming" course offered in the first year of a Telecommunications Engineering degree at UPM. This course is mandatory and has more than 450 enrolled students. Our purpose is to encourage the motivation and dynamism of the learning and assessment processes...|$|E
40|$|During the 1970 s– 80 s, besides virus culture {{diagnostic}} {{electron microscopy}} (DEM) 1 became a prime technique in clinical virology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases. Today DEM {{appears on the}} retreat for several reasons, e. g., routine DEM is often replaced by molecular, highly sensitive and high throughput methods. Nevertheless, DEM needs {{to be kept in}} the diagnostic repertoire to cope with emerging infections, clinical emergencies, quality control (QC), and potential bioterrorism (Biel and Gelderblom, 1999 a; Curry et al., 2006; Gelderblom, 2003 a, b; Gelderblom, 2012; Gentile and Gelderblom, 2005; Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003; Miller, 2003). As the consequences of an infection or an attack with biological weapons are amenable to intervention only for some hours, the speed of DEM is an essential advantage (Gentile and Gelderblom, 2014; Biel and Madeley, 2001; Madeley, 2003). Speed and “open view” of DEM allow an early and/or a differential diagnosis and also the diagnosis of multiple and/or unexpected infections down to the family level (Almeida, 1963, 1980; Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003; Goldsmith and Miller, 2009), occasionally also beyond the family level (Goldsmith, 2014). As the quality of DEM depends to a great extent on expertise and personal skills, it is essential to run DEM in a quality controlled way and supported by <b>continuous</b> <b>practicing</b> and education (Gelderblom, 2001, PDF). After a brief description of historic aspects of QC in DEM of infectious diseases, of its principles and aims, this review focuses on the external quality assurance scheme in DEM (EQA-EMV) and the system of meetings and DEM lab courses run by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin since 1993.

40|$|Context: <b>Continuous</b> <b>practices,</b> i. e., <b>continuous</b> integration, delivery, and deployment, are the {{software}} development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing {{interest in and}} literature on <b>continuous</b> <b>practices,</b> {{it is important to}} systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing <b>continuous</b> <b>practices.</b> Objective: This research aimed at systematically reviewing {{the state of the art}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>practices</b> to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. Method: We used systematic literature review (SLR) method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on <b>continuous</b> <b>practices</b> published between 2004 and 1 st June 2016. We applied thematic analysis method for analysing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria.

40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD) {{is defined as}} a natural death caused by heart origins, which is {{characterized}} by sudden lost of conscience during the first hour after the onset of acute symptoms. Concomitant heart disease of varying intensity may exist but it is not necessarily the cause of death. Intensive physical activity in trained athletes with clinically significant structural changes on the myocardium accelerates progression of the disease and increases risk of SCD. Deaths on the field most often happen in intensive team sports like football and basketball in which large part of population participate. Different cardiovascular disease may cause SCD and they are related to age, sex, and race. Of those hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy is causing SCD in 36 % of cases, aberrant coronary artery in 10 %, “possible hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy” in 10 %, while rupture of aortic aneurism, aortic valve stenosis, other coronary anomalies, lesions caused by myocarditis, idiopathic scars, etc., are all involved in less than 10 % of each. In most cases, death is caused by electrical heart instability. Several epidemiological studies showed that ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a mechanism that leads to SCD in 65 - 80 % of cases. Survival in ambulance VF is related to severity of the disease and the time to resuscitation. The most adequate approach to the problem of SCD is prevention. It comprises precompetition testing of the athletes and early cardiovascular disease detection. After reviewing the history and physical examination result, the physician can allow participation in sport. In the case of SCD prompt reaction is needed. Immediate resuscitation measures with the use of AED are most effective measures that can prevent fatal outcome. Because of that planning and <b>continuous</b> <b>practicing</b> of resuscitation is important part of the prevention...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that web {{technologies}} have, nowadays, a great influence on society behaviour, in particular on youth and university students. Therefore, universities are progressively adapting their courses in order {{to take advantage of the}} new existing technologies. This can be particularly useful and helpful when teaching mathematics to engineering students. We should not be aware of the fact that these students can be particularly enthusiastic about technologies. The Department of Mathematics for the Science and Technology, at the University of Minho (Portugal) is using the Maple TA system for several mathematics courses taken by engineering students of the first year of college, for instance in Calculus and Linear Algebra. We have big groups of students attending classes. On the other hand, they are not obliged to be present. The big number of students we are dealing with, and the fact that a significant percentage of which do not attend the classes regularly, for different reasons, creates conditions for implementing distance learning methods. Additionally, the Bologna education reform decreases the number of contact hours of the courses. To overcome this situation, we are creating new learning facilities that contribute to help the students on their individual work. The authors believe that it is quite challenging to redesign courses using web technologies (here Maple TA) under the environment described above. When using Maple TA to create learning objects one can have different goals: introduce a new topic, create tools for <b>continuous</b> <b>practicing,</b> edit complete question banks for a topic, assess the students or even obtain information about difficulties of the students on previous topics. Here we present our experience on constructing learning objects for courses on Calculus and on Linear Algebra. We wish to illustrate different perspectives used to create questions adapted to distinct pre-established goals. In particular, we explore randomization of variables, allowed by MapleTA, when creating questions which, under the traditional system (i. e., pen and paper) are equivalent to groups of questions...|$|E
