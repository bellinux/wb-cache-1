40|$|Studies of {{physiology}} {{can provide}} important {{insight into how}} animals are coping with challenges in their environment and can signal the potential effects of exposure to human activity in both the short and long term. In this study, we measured the physiological and behavioural response of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) that were naïve to human activity over 30  min of capture and handling. We assessed relationships between corticosterone secretion, behaviour, sex and time of day in order to characterize the determinants of the natural stress response. We then compared the response of these naïve penguins with the responses of female little penguins that {{had been exposed to}} research activity (bimonthly nest <b>check</b> and <b>weighing)</b> and to both research activity (monthly nest <b>check</b> and <b>weighing)</b> and evening viewing by tourists. We found that corticosterone concentrations increased significantly over 30  min of capture, with naïve penguins demonstrating a more acute stress response during the day than at night. Penguins that had previously been exposed to handling at the research and research/visitor sites showed elevated corticosterone concentrations and consistently more aggressive behaviour after 30  min compared with naïve birds, although {{there were no significant differences}} in baseline corticosterone concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that these little penguins have not habituated to routine capture, but rather mount a heightened physiological and behavioural response to handling by humans. Less invasive research monitoring techniques, such as individual identification with PIT tags and automatic recording and weighing, and a reduction in handling during the day should be considered to mitigate some of the potentially negative effects of disturbance. Given the paucity of data on the long-term consequences of heightened stress on animal physiology, our study highlights the need for further investigation of the relationship between the corticosterone stress response and fitness outcomes, such as breeding success and survival. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLaboratory-scale trickle bed {{reactors}} {{are often}} used in testing of catalyst life time and activity. One of the important processes is represented by hydrodesulphurization (HDS) of motor fuels and petrochemical fractions. The study of stability of catalysts activity can be influenced both reactions kinetics, hydrodynamics and mass transfer phenomena. In case of ideal behaviour, the liquid could report piston flow. Non-ideal liquid flow can lead to incomplete catalyst particle wetting, which results in poor utilization of the catalytic surface of the particles. It may also expected to occur stagnant zones and imperfect heat transfer and overheating of the catalytic particles. For limitation of this negative phenomena should be diluted catalytic bed by small inert particle provide more contact area. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine degree of the effect of hydrodynamic conditions in model trickle bed reactors by residence time distribution method. Objective was to evaluate liquid holdup, axial dispersion and pressure drop of reactor bed consisting of catalyst particles diluted by inert fines to obtain data for process description by PD mathematical model. Hydrodynamic experiments were carried out in model glasses reactor with I. D 30. 4 mm. Catalyst –trilobe extrudes of 1. 3 mm O. D. was diluted by fine grain SiC 0. 1 - 0. 15 mm to obtained complete catalyst wetting and uniform liquid distribution.

Avian nestling personality traits can be determined through simple stress handling tests that measure breath rate and docility. Individuals with lower measures {{tend to be more}} bold and aggressive adults, traits that are correlated with increased fitness. Other developmental factors that correlate with increased fitness include egg size, parental provisioning rates, and body condition. The objective of this project was to determine if there is a relationship between handling stress and: egg size and parental provisioning in the migratory songbird, Prothonotary warbler (PROW). This research focused on a long-term study of a prothonotary warbler population nesting in boxes along the Lower James River. Detailed morphometric data were collected for the eggs and nestlings throughout the breeding season with regular nest <b>checks.</b> Nestlings were <b>weighed</b> and banded when they were 5 - 6 days old. Just prior to banding, simple docility and breathing rate stress tests were conducted. Video recordings of parental provisioning were completed and used to determine the feeding rate of each nest. No relationship was found between egg mass and the breath rate or docility stress measures. There was also no relationship between rate of provisioning and stress measures. However, there was a relationship between nestling body condition (nestling mass adjusted for age) and breath rate. It is known that larger nestlings have higher survival probabilities, and our results suggest that this relationship may not only be the result of higher body condition, but also of underlying personality differences.

A logarithmic velocity distribution is also required and is used to ascribe velocity values to volume elements in a concentric computational grid. Calculated values of mean mixture flow rate and delivered concentration are compared to the input values and an iterative procedure is employed to ensure equality with a result being the computation of in situ concentration. The model is applicable over the complete range of flow regimes including stationary bed, sliding bed and suspended flow. The particular regime prevalent for the input values will be ascertained by the model aid the energy gradient calculated. The model is compared to 3 existing correlations in the literature, for mixed regime flow, using 1345 data points collected at the University of Cape Town test facility and 1630 data points from other institutions.

Currently, there is no {{literature}} available on the quality of care for the HIV/AIDS clinic at primary level in Namibia. Opuwo District has one of the lowest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS in Namibia with 8. 8 % among ANC patients. A total of 1714 HIV positive patients are enrolled at Opuwo District Hospital HIV/AIDS clinic and 109 (6. 36 %) of them are defaulting treatment. Based on these statistics, I decided to do a quality improvement cycle of the HIV clinic system to see if it would improve adherence. Adherence will improve if the quality of care rendered to patients is standard (18). Aim and Objectives The aim of the research is {{to improve the quality of}} care for patients on ARVs, with concern for factors influencing adherence in Opuwo district Hospital. The objectives are as follow: 1) 	To evaluate the quality of care that was given to patient registered at Opuwo HIV/AIDS clinic since 2007 2) 	To correct inadequacies discovered during initial evaluation of the clinic to improve the quality of care 3) 	To evaluate if corrected inadequacies have led to improved quality Method The study design is a quality improvement cycle The quality improvement cycle done was a teamwork that involved trained nurses in HIV, data clerk, counsellors, trained pharmacist in ARV therapy and a doctor. This team audited care rendered by looking at the structure, process and outcome of the care given at the clinic; then inadequacies discovered were corrected and the whole system was re-audited to see if there is improvement. The study population was patients attending HIV/AIDS clinic since 2007 until date and the sample size was fifty with selection made by random sample using simple proportion (HIVQUAL system that was automatically programmed to calculate sample size based on the population of patients entered into the system). Data on structure was carried out prospectively by observing what is on the ground in term of equipment, staff, tools etc. Data for proper documentation, weight checked at every visit, clinical staging at every visit, counselling at every visit, TB screening etc and outcome (regular in clinic attendance, viral load below 1000 after 6 months on HAART, etc) were audited retrospectively using patient’s file. Results Using chi-square test to analyse the data, the intervention was successful because the P-values were less than 0. 05 in most of the indicators audited for process and outcome. It was found that after the intervention (in-service training, re-enforce proper documentation, re-enforce health education by all staff not limit it to counsellors alone, wall poster to remind staff on ordering investigation for CD 4, viral load when due and follow up results by doctor or nurses, <b>weigh</b> <b>check</b> for all patients before starting consultation, doctor and nurses should prescribe IPT, Co-trimoxazole and multivitamins) was made, adherence improved from 46 % to 82 % and opportunistic infection declined below 15 %.

40|$|ObjectivesDense angiogenic {{sprouting}} occurs from arteriovenous loops (AVLs) incorporating autologous vein grafts {{inserted into}} empty plastic chambers in vivo. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine if angiogenesis from the AVL was limited by substituting an “off the shelf” cold-stored allograft vein instead of an autologous vein. MethodsFour Sprague Dawley rat groups (two AVL configurations × two chamber types) were established for both 2 -week and 6 -week harvest. Control AVLs were autologous femoral vein grafts harvested from the left femoral vein that were surgically inserted between the cut femoral artery and vein on the right side. Experimental “allograft” AVLs were rat femoral veins cold-stored (4 °C, sterile) for 4 to 7 weeks and then microsurgically interposed between the right femoral artery and vein of an unrelated rat. The two AVL types were inserted in one of two plastic chamber types – smooth or perforated. At harvest, the AVL constructs were <b>checked</b> for patency, <b>weighed,</b> their volume determined, and histology undertaken. Morphometric assessment of percent and absolute volume of major tissue components (including blood vessels) at 6 weeks was completed. ResultsThere were no significant differences between autograft and allograft groups in construct weight, volume, or morphology at 2 or 6 weeks. No statistical differences occurred in the percent or absolute vascular volume of AVLs incorporating a cold-stored allograft vs autologous vein grafts at 6 weeks regardless of the chamber type. However, perforated chambers caused significant increases in construct weight (P =. 015), volume (P =. 006), and percent and absolute connective tissue volume at 6 weeks (P =. 001) compared to smooth chamber constructs, regardless of the graft type. ConclusionCold-stored small-caliber allografts interposed in AVLs do not inhibit microcirculatory development and can be used in composite tissue engineering. Clinical RelevanceThe issue of providing a growing vascular network within three-dimensional tissue-engineered constructs presents a major challenge to scientists and surgeons working in this field. Previously, many cell/scaffold constructs have been implanted in vascular areas of the body and rely on neighboring capillaries at the implantation site to grow into the construct and provide vascularization – this relatively slow process has been termed extrinsic vascularization. As an alternative, our group has established an intrinsic vascularization model where larger three-dimensional constructs can be grown. A macrovascular arteriovenous loop (AVL) is created by anastomosing a fresh autologous vein between the cut ends of the femoral artery and vein. The AVL is placed in a plastic chamber and this construct spontaneously sprouts an extensive capillary network suitable for the implantation of progenitor cells. Clinically, a more attractive option is to use an “off the shelf” synthetic or biologically created vascular graft within the AVL. In this study, we have used cold-stored allograft veins as vascular grafts within the loop and demonstrated that the angiogenic network generated is not significantly different to that formed when a fresh autograft vein is anastomosed into the AVL. This result indicates that use of this vascular graft material will improve the options available to vascular surgeons who may be involved in creating large tissue constructs. The use of this “off the shelf” biological graft will shorten surgery times, operating costs, provide flexibility to the surgeon, and is a further significant advancement in composite tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{validity}} and the reproduciblity of methods assessing food consumption in groups of free-living Dutch adults consuming self-selected diets. The validity of a method, that is the demonstration that a method measures what {{it is intended to}} measure, can only be assessed by comparing it with an independent method of indisputable accuracy. There Is no such absolute method {{because of the nature of}} the data to be collected. Instead, it may be possible to establish either the relative validity or the concurrent validity. The relative validity evaluates the method in terms of another generally accepted method, designed to measure the same concept. The concurrent validity compares the results of a method with a biological marker. Validity studies refer to information bias and systematic response errors. A method is commonly called reliable or reproducible if it gives the same results when used repeatedly in the same situation. The problem in food consumption surveys is that the situation is never absolutely identical. Reproducibility refer to the biological within- person variation (a true day-to-day variation) as well as to random response errors, because these two sources of variation can hardly be separated. Many objectives can be served in conducting food consumption studies. It is essential to distinguish between food consumption surveys mainly used for national food planning and administration and surveys in which the emphasis is primarily on the relation between nutrition and health. Distinction is necessary because each objective demands a different type of information. In this thesis only methods assessing food consumption used in studies on the relationship between diet and health have been examined. Chapter 2 describes the state of the art of methods assessing food consumption. There are many sources of error in these types of studies as Table 4 in Chapter 2 clearly shows. For epidemiological studies, however, it is not always necessary to produce accurate results for each individual, but methods yielding valid data on groups of individuals would be of great value. To be able to obtain such valid data on a group level it is of the utmost importance to specify beforehand which data the study should supply. In Chapter 2, Table 6, the data required for three purposes have been formulated, viz. :A. Average energy and nutrient intake data of a group, to make group-to- group comparisons. In such a survey a representative sample of the population under study as well as a representative period of observation are required. B. The distribution of usual energy and nutrient intake data within a population, to detect groups of individuals at risk, if the risk is marked by a high or a low intake of a certain nutrient. C. The usual energy and nutrient intake of groups of individuals throughout time to make a correlation and regression analysis relating independent and dependent variables in order to make inferences on an aggregate level. For all three purposes data have to be collected on an individual level, but they are analysed and interpreted on an aggregated level. Chapters 3 to 8 describe the evaluation of methods used for the above-mentioned purposes in groups of Dutch adults. In all methods sizes of portions of the foods most frequently consumed have been <b>checked</b> by <b>weighing</b> by the interviewer. Other portions have been estimated in standard household measurements. The amounts of foods consumed have been converted into energy and nutrients using the national nutrient data base "UCV". In Chapter 3 the seven-day record method has been described assessing the energy and dietary fiber intake of 100 adults (44 men and 56 women). In the analysis the emphasis was on the within-person and the between-person variation in the intake of energy and dietary fiber. Information on these components of variance is desired to determine in study designs the number of persons and the number of records per person required to assess with a certain precision the group mean in the intakes of nutrients. The findings in this study show that the precision for the measurement of dietary fiber intake obtained by using one-day food records from twice the number of individuals is comparable to that obtained from a seven-day food record. For the measurement of energy intake, only 1. 5 times the number of individuals is required for the one-day record method to obtain the same precision as with the seven-day record method. However, a one-day record method does not yield information on the usual food consumption of an individual. To be able to distinguish within the study population groups of individuals with a very high or a very low intake of a certain nutrient more food records per person are needed. The number of records required depends on the ratio of the within-person variation to the between-person variation. Chapter 4 describes the validity and the reproducibility of a dietary history method assessing the usual food consumption during one month. Forty-four young adults (aged 19 - 32 years) participated in this study. The concurrent validity of the method was assessed by means of the 24 -hour urine nitrogen excretion. The mean difference between nitrogen intake and nitrogen excretion was 0. 0 g with a 95 per cent confidence limit of ± 1. 1 g. These limits for the mean difference between excretion and intake indicate a valid assessment of the protein intake of this group. The reproducibility was evaluated in the same group through a test- retest design. The intra-class correlation coefficients were high over a weighted average of week-days and for an average workday as regards the intakes of energy and selected nutrients. As to the Saturday and Sunday intakes, the correlation coefficients were lower for the energy intakes and most of the nutrients (except alcohol) indicating a poorer reproducibility for week-end assessments. Chapter 5 describes a dietary history method assessing the food consumption In retrospect. In 1983 the relative validity of the retrospective dietary history method (DH'R) was assessed against a current dietary history taken seven years earlier, in 1976 (DH' 76), and a second current dietary history taken in 1983 (DH' 83). In total 44 men and 58 women, aged 38 - 62 years, participated in the study. For the intake of energy and most of the nutrients the relative difference between DH'R and DH' 76 was below 15 per cent. The difference between energy and nutrient intake reported contemporaneously and retrospectively appears to be comparable with or slightly more than the reported change in food consumption between 1976 and 1983. Similar results were found for food groups. The results indicate that for group- to-group comparisons past dietary patterns can be ascertained retrospectively with some degree of success. Such data can be useful in case-control studies examining the relationship between diet and cancer. Seasonal variation in the intakes of energy and nutrients may affect the validity as well as the reproducibility of results in studies examining food consumption. In Chapter 6 the effects of the season on the energy balance of 114 young adult women are described. Energy intake and pattern of physical activity were assessed monthly fourteen times with the 24 -hour recall method. The day following each interview before breakfast body weight without clothes was measured by the participants themselves. After these 14 months, in the second year the same estimates were made with intervals of 2 - 3 months to check if the observed seasonal variations were not a casual effect. The study did not demonstrate seasonal variation in the mean energy intake of the group under study. A statistically significant effect of the season was observed in the intake of fat, dietary fiber and mono- and disaccharides. For mono- and disaccharides this seasonal effect could not be confirmed the second year. Small seasonal fluctuations were observed in body weight and time spent in the various physical activity categories. On the one hand these fluctuations are too small to indicate physiological significance, on the other hand the fluctuations are wide enough to be taken into account in many longitudinal studies assessing changes in intakes of nutrients and body weight. Chapter 7 describes the same study as Chapter 6, but {{reports on the}} validity of the monthly, fourteen times repeated, 24 -hour food recall method. Validity was examined by comparing the mean daily energy intake with fluctuations in body weight over a period of 14 months and by comparing the mean daily protein intake with the protein intake as assessed from the nitrogen excretion in at least 11 collections of 24 - hour urine. A hundred and twenty-three women participated in this study. The data confirm earlier findings that the 24 -hour recall gives a valid estimate of energy and protein intake on a group level. Categorizing the group in approximately quintiles of the energy intake revealed that subjects reporting a very low energy intake tend to underestimate their energy intake and that subjects reporting a very high energy intake tend to overreport their energy intake. In 20 subjects (16 per cent) the mean difference in daily protein intake as assessed with the fourteen 24 -hour recalls and as assessed from the nitrogen excretion in 24 -hour urine exceeded 20 grams. Sixteen of these subjects reported either a very high (n = 7) or a very low energy intake (n = 9). The results indicate that it is very difficult to determine within a group under study - solely on the basis of food consumption data - the percentage of subjects with a very high or a very low intake of certain nutrients. This implicates that it is also difficult to determine within such a group the percentage of subjects with a high or a low health risk, if the risk is marked by a high or a low intake of a certain nutrient. Chapter 8 reports on the validity of the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat tissue microbiopsies as an estimate of the long-term average fatty acid composition of the diet of separate individuals. Fifty-nine women taking part in the study on seasonal variation (Chapter 6) and whose food consumption data were considered valid (Chapter 7) participated in this study. Three months after the food consumption study had been finished subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected during a home visit. Highly significant correlations were found between the linoleic acid content of diet and fat tissue (r = 0. 70) and also between the linoleic acid-to-saturated fatty acid ratio (linoleic/S) of fat tissue and diet (r = 0. 62). This confirms the hypothesis that on an individual level the fatty acid composition of the adipose tissue is a valid index for the habitual dietary fatty acid composition of free-living individuals. When using one 24 -hour recall instead of the average of 19 recalls, the correlation coefficient between the linoleic/S ratio of the diet and that of the adipose tissue was substantially lower. This demonstrates the weakening effect of the wide day-to-day variation in within-person intakes on the correlation between a short-term assessment of the nutrient intake of an individual and a biochemical indicator of a long-term nutritional status. In the final discussion of this thesis (Chapter 9) it is concluded that the methods assessing food consumption described appear to be relatively valid for estimating the mean intakes of energy and of the described nutrients In groups. If only data on food consumption are available, however, it is difficult to categorize unbiased within the study population groups with a low or a high intake of a certain nutrient. This is so even if, based on the precision required, the ratio of the witrhin-person to the between-person variation, enough food records or recalls are obtained per participants in a sample of sufficient size. If energy and nutrient intake data are to be related to health indicators, it is advocated to oversample and to check the intake data with an independent biochemical or physiological indicator of the intake of a nutrient. This makes it possible to discard data that are considered not to be trustworthy. The remaining data, considered valid, and collected within an adequately formulated research design, will be very useful in finding out the relation between nutrition, health and disease...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{automation}} and robotization {{of material}} handling systems (MHS) in the transportation industry, maintaining equipment and systems becomes more important, {{and needs to}} be integrated in the company’s business strategy (Tsang, 2002). Implementing and investing in the right maintenance approach to keep these systems in optimum state is therefore essential for the performance of a company and more important, for the customer’s satisfaction. When a company has to deal with an increase in failures and decreasing performance, it needs to anticipate to change this negative trend. In literature, most of these problems are analysed by using electronic data and condition-based monitoring (Bouvard, Artus, Bérenguer, & Cocquempot, 2011). Analysing the condition of equipment requires data monitoring which is not always possible. Besides, these analyses are often based on a single system which conditions do not apply on systems with different specifications. TNT Express (initiator of this research) is dealing with this problem within the Benelux. They are dealing with decreasing on-time delivery (OTD) performance and increasing costs of smaller sorting-sites without technicians. Having high OTD performance is an essential element of TNT’s business strategy, and is a competitive advantage in their industry. Their time-critical processes combined with the interrelated network structure of their sites makes it hard to develop a single strategy or solution that positively affects the performance of all sites. The differences in size, work methods, level of technology, different size of freight and fluctuating demands makes it a dynamic and complex environment with a lot of variables that influence the performance of on-time delivery. That makes it hard to identify the causes and effects of these failures over time. Besides, TNT doesn’t have the useful data to base their maintenance on. Therefore, finding the bottlenecks and the right variables that influence this performance most is essential for decreasing the costs of TNT. Therefore, the objective of this research is: “Identify the constraints of TNT’s Material Handling Systems in a dynamic environment, to be able to apply the right maintenance strategy that preserves TNT’s delivery performance at lower cost. ” Before a start could be made on finding the bottlenecks of the sorting sites, TNT’s maintenance structure, operational structure, financial structure and operational structure needed to be defined. TNT’s sorting operation, where freight is unloaded, sorted, measures and loaded, runs around 19 hours a day, 6 days a week all year long. That limits the time for maintenance and check-ups to 6 hours a day. Still, a fast response is needed when the sorter does fail during operation, to prevent the process getting delayed which generates extra costs. TNT’s maintenance of those sites turned out to be depending on mostly corrective maintenance, and less on preventive and predictive maintenance. Mechanics are traveling from site to site to solve current incidents that cause delays, and less for preventive maintenance and check-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also responsible for some maintenance activities, although these are mostly time-based and less used for trouble shooting. When specifying TNT’s on-time delivery performance, the performance of the sorting sites {{turned out to be the}} most important factor of the OTD. This sorting site performance is measured by the capacity of freight it theoretically can handle, and the amount of freight it is transporting in reality. This site performance is also influenced by several variables, where the Material Handling Systems availability turned out to be the largest influential variable. The failing devices and equipment are the cause that IV operators on the floor have to sort manually, which takes a lot more time. Besides, these delays are generating extra costs, only how much and which costs is not quite clear. TNT’s limited registration of essential elements like downtime, maintenance costs and OEM activities made it difficult to link these elements, and to find possible bottlenecks. So, to be able to link the MHS- downtime with the related costs on a daily basis, three Critical-to-Quality factors (CTQs) are analysed:  Breakdown costs  Maintenance costs  MHS availability Because the financial impact of a breakdown was not yet specified, the most important factors are determined by interviewing business improvement experts. Some costs turned out to be different for the import or export process during a working day. For TNT, the next financial factors turned out to be important: 1. Missed Check-Weight-Cube (CWC) revenue 2. Hiring extra vans and trucks 3. Personnel costs (overtime) 4. Financial consequences of lower service level (loss of customers) From these factors, the missed CWC revenue turned out to be largest costs factor in the import process, where hiring extra trucks and vans turned out to be the largest costs factor of the export process. These two factors are further specified and calculated, to link them to specific breakdowns. Depending on the volume in different locations, the missed CWC revenue is variating between € 000,- and € 000,- for a single shift per day. These costs are calculated by determining the number of packages that are affected by a breakdown and do not get a second <b>weighing</b> <b>check</b> on a next location, multiplied by the average revenue missed per parcel. These calculations showed that without a working sorter or CWC on a single location comes with large financial consequences. These specific insights in CWC revenue loss show the need for fewer failures to improve the financial performance of TNT by changing the maintenance activities. The extra costs of hiring extra vans to transport all freight towards the customers in the export process turned out to be € 000,- for a single shift (1 day). These costs are in the same order as the CWC revenue losses, and from financial perspective just as bad. The cost analysis regarding this data showed how disperse the information is within TNT, and that it is hard to develop a strategy without this kind of crucial information. Maintenance costs are referred as costs that are made to solve the incidents and include, service contracts, mechanics salaries etc. However, costs that are made for decreasing the number of incidents are more important. Think of hiring extra employees, changing service contracts, training current employees. Quantifying these costs is only possible when the bottlenecks of the breakdowns have been derived. V The lacking quality of the data regarding downtime and availability of the MHS made it impossible to use mathematical solutions to find the bottlenecks, so “Soft Operations Research” methods have been used to find the causes of the failures (Heyer, 2004; Masys, 2015). Using Pareto charts and Ishikawa diagrams on the incident file controlled by TNT’s mechanics, the data in this file is structured and enriched to find failures with recurring root causes that are a structural problem. First, three devices that have the most impact on the MHS availability are determined. These are the Sorter, Roller track/belts and Check- Weigh-Cube (CWC) and are responsible for 130 of the 210 incidents for the first 5 months in 2017, which represents more than 60 % of all incidents of the MHS. The registered incident data of these three devices is enriched by going a step further in the cause, structuring all data, and visualising them in an Ishikawa diagram. By doing so, it became clear that a high number of incidents (35 %) have an operation cause, which means that they are caused by human error. These incidents are not specifically location bounded, and solving the most frequent occurring incidents will prevent a lot of future incidents. The three selected root causes that are responsible for most incidents are: 1. Lack of system knowledge Operators, especially Team Leaders (TL) and Leading Hands (LH), have too little knowledge of the process, the effects of failures and simple technical solutions. There skills haven’t been developed with the increasing mechanisation. Not knowing the impact of failures, and how simple incidents can be prevented leads to unnecessary failures. 2. Sensor related incidents A large part of those operational incidents are sensor related. Because these incidents are still frequently occurring, they need to be handled separately. These incidents can be solved quite easy most of the times, and a support system to help operators to solve them is very helpful. 3. Lack of working according instructions A large part of the incidents are caused by wrong choices of operators, by putting wrong parcels on the sorter, putting them on the sorter at the wrong place or working not according the given instructions. The lack of knowing the consequences results in an uninterested work attitude which results in a performance decrease of the sorting site. For these three root causes, several improvements have been developed. For the first root cause, a training program is recommended which start with a well-communicated plan to create the urge for change. The current attitude of personnel is asking for a plan that provides support from the whole organisation. TNT needs to know the value of knowledge amongst their employees, and this needs support from top management. Combining this with low-technical training sessions and useful supporting tools will increase the employees’ knowledge, and also creates ownership with the employees. To do so, TNT needs to review its distribution between part-time employees from employment agencies, and employees contracted by TNT. Increasing system knowledge amongst employees is only effective if that knowledge stays within the company. Rewarding well performing VI employees with a contract by TNT will have positive effect on the knowledge on the work floor and not only prevents, but also decreases the amount of downtime. For sensor related incidents, a supporting manual has been developed that functions as a simple flow chart that guides TL through the process of solving these failures. Following these steps in the included manual gives simple but clear instructions how to act and what to do. Before using this supporting manual, the TL need sufficient training before they can execute the process. Although this solution is more focussed on corrective maintenance, this manual helps to solve simple incidents that mechanics do not have to solve by themselves. Not only are these incidents solved much quicker, due to direct handling of the TL, but the mechanics do not have to drive towards the location of the incident. That also gives the mechanics more time to do preventive maintenance tasks, and therefore further decrease the number of incidents of the MHS. This manual strengthens the need for more direct or autonomous maintenance within the sorting sites of TNT (Chen, 2013). Currently, these sites are too depended on the knowledge of external maintenance providers to repair the failures which is not desirable. To improve that employees work more according instructions, better supervision is advised and recommendations are made to reward well-performing operators. Rewarding operators also means that they will be more responsible for their colleagues and have to make sure that they understand the instructions. They become responsible for preventing wrong parcels being put on the sorter, and have to correct their employees if they ignore the instructions because a lot of incidents are caused by wrong packages being put on the sorter. However, TNT should also improve the visibility and clarity of these instructions by using dummy parcels to indicate the allowed parcels sizes. Improving this product flow on the sorter will improve the sorters performance and lowers the number of incidents. The effect of these improvement could only be expressed by a decrease on the number of incidents, and not on downtime due to lacking data registration. If, as a starting point, already half of these structural incidents is solved by these improvements, the total amount of these 210 incidents over 2017 would already decrease with 13 %. Due to the unknown length of the breakdowns, they cannot be compared to financial results although these results definitely improve. All these improvements are based on autonomous maintenance which is focussed on letting operators do more maintenance and technical tasks. Finally, all these improvements will help retaining TNT’s on-time delivery and decrease their breakdown costs. This process of finding these bottlenecks led to an even more valuable advice for gathering data. This research showed that TNT needs to improve their data collection system, and document important factors with a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) like time registration, downtime during operations, and weight of breakdown. This data also needs to be accessible for OEM’s, so they also have insight in the failures, and can help improve the MHS performance. With this data, TNT can measure the downtime and better monitor its MHS availability to see which devices or incidents need further improvement. The importance of such data collection system is once emphasized by the fact that it was hard to determine the bottlenecks, especially with multiple locations at the sorting locations of TNT. VII The goal was to identify the constraints in a dynamic environment that has a lot of influential factors that make it hard to determine the effects of these variables. Using multiple techniques based on the number of incidents and the failure history, the first bottlenecks could be derived that needed improvement. Together with a costs analysis on the most important financial factors, solutions and recommendations are developed that will retain TNT’s on-time delivery at lower costs. However, the recommendations for a more centralized data-based maintenance system could even be more valuable in the future. Management of Technolog...|$|R
