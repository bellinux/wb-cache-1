40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} {{techniques in}} aero engines require highly effective cooling schemes of combustor liners. One Parameter affecting the cooling performance is {{the geometry of}} the cooling holes themselves. So far, the freedom {{in the design of}} cooling holes was limited due to the manufacturing techniques. With emerging additive manufacturing methods, e. g. Direct Metal Laser Sintering, however, the geometry of the cooling holes is virtually unlimited. Especially the entrance and the curvature of the cooling holes determines the through-flow of the hole and consequently the cooling performance of the ejected cooling film. In this study a set of <b>combustor</b> <b>liner</b> tiles with two innovative and four traditional cooling hole geometries will be analyzed and compared to each other in terms of cooling performance. The innovative geometries have bent cooling holes with a nearly horizontal outlet. All specimens have the same cooling hole pattern. The cooling performance is determined by comparing the total cooling effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the <b>combustor</b> <b>liner</b> tiles. The coolant mass flow rate is gained from experimentally determined discharge coefficients for the respective pressure difference. The first set of measurements is conducted in an atmospheric open-loop test rig at reduced temperatures but realistic density ratios between hot gas and coolant. The specimen with the best cooling performance has been selected for an investigation in a high pressure test rig at realistic combustor conditions (pressure, temperature) including fluctuations of the cooling air to simulate combustion instabilities. The cooling performance again is determined by the total cooling effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the <b>combustor</b> <b>liner</b> tiles...|$|E
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{composites}} {{are considered}} to be potential materials for future aircraft engine parts such as combustor liners. It is envisioned that on the hot side (inner surface) of the <b>combustor</b> <b>liner,</b> composites will have to withstand temperatures in excess of 1200 C for thousands of hours in oxidizing environments. This is a severe condition; however, an equally severe, if not more detrimental, condition exists on the cold side (outer surface) of the <b>combustor</b> <b>liner.</b> Here, the temperatures are expected to be on the order of 800 to 1000 C under high tensile stress because of thermal gradients and attachment of the <b>combustor</b> <b>liner</b> to the engine frame (the hot side will be under compressive stress, a less severe stress-state for ceramics). Since these composites are not oxides, they oxidize. The worst form of oxidation for strength reduction occurs at these intermediate temperatures, where the boron nitride (BN) interphase oxidizes first, which causes the formation of a glass layer that strongly bonds the fibers to the matrix. When the fibers strongly bond to the matrix or to one another, the composite loses toughness and strength and becomes brittle. To increase the intermediate temperature stress-rupture properties, researchers must modify the BN interphase. With the support of the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program, significant improvements were made as state-of-the-art SiC/SiC composites were developed during the Enabling Propulsion Materials (EPM) program. Three approaches were found to improve the intermediate-temperature stress-rupture properties: fiber-spreading, high-temperature silicon- (Si) doped boron nitride (BN), and outside-debonding BN...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{commercial}} and military gas turbine engines may operate at combustor outlet temperatures {{in excess of}} 1920 K (3000 F). At these temperatures <b>combustors</b> <b>liners</b> experience extreme convective and radiative heat fluxes. The ability of a plasma sprayed ceramic coating to reduce liner metal temperature has been recognized. However, the brittleness of the ceramic layer and the difference in thermal expansion with the metal substrate has caused cracking, spalling and some separation of the ceramic coating. Research directed at turbine tip seals (or shrouds) has shown the advantage of applying the ceramic to a compliant metal pad. This paper discusses recent studies of applying ceramics to <b>combustor</b> <b>liners</b> in which yttria stabilized zirconia plasma sprayed on compliant metal substrates which were exposed to near stoichiometric combustion, presents performance and durability results, and describes a conceptual design for an advanced, small gas turbine combustor.

40|$|The use {{of ceramic}} matrix {{composites}} (CMCs) as <b>combustor</b> <b>liners</b> and turbine vanes provides {{the potential of}} improving next-generation turbine engine performance, through lower emissions and higher cycle efficiency, relative to today s use of superalloy hot-section components. For example, the introduction of film-cooling air in metal <b>combustor</b> <b>liners</b> has led {{to higher levels of}} nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the combustion process. An environmental barrier coated (EBC) siliconcarbide- fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composite is a new material system that can operate at higher temperatures, significantly reducing the film-cooling requirements and enabling lower NOx production. Evaluating components and subcomponents fabricated from these advanced CMCs under gas turbine conditions is paramount to demonstrating that the material system can perform as required in the complex thermal stress and environmentally aggressive engine environment. To date, only limited testing has been conducted on CMC combustor and turbine concepts and subelements of this type throughout the industry. As part of the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program, the High Pressure Burner Rig (HPBR) at the NASA Glenn Research Center was selected to demonstrate coupon, subcomponent feature, and component testing because it can economically provide the temperatures, pressures, velocities, and combustion gas compositions that closely simulate the engine environments.
