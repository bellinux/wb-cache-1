40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the role and support afforded Computing <b>Coordinators</b> at Western Australian government senior high schools by undertaking a census survey. Previous studies performed by Weber and Kershaw (1990) and Kershaw and Weber { 1991), portrayed the role of Computing <b>Coordinators</b> at Australian high schools as demanding a diversity of knowledge and skills in computer technology together with excellent management qualities. The literature also suggested that time management skills were a major factor in how effectively <b>coordinators</b> carried out the myriad of tasks expected of them. This study found that most Computing <b>Coordinators</b> considered their roles too onerous with the majority not awarded time to specifically perform their coordinating duties. This study also determined that most <b>coordinators</b> were using a proportion of their teaching time and a considerable amount of their class preparation time, managing computers. Considering the possible impact this could have on student learning, it was not surprising that most Computing <b>Coordinators</b> felt that their coordinating role seriously impinged on their role as a teacher. Computing <b>Coordinators</b> offered a range of solutions to the pressures they were experiencing in their coordinating role. The majority of these solutions involved increased financial assistance. It was considered by many <b>coordinators</b> that the purchase or lease of up-to-date equipment, hardware and software, may require less maintenance than older equipment and therefore reduce the time they spend on managing computer systems. <b>Coordinators</b> felt that greater support for professional development was essential to enable them to keep their computing skills up-to-date and for teachers using computers in the curriculum to further their skills in computer technologies. Also, adequate time for Computing <b>Coordinators</b> to perform their duties, along with the provision of a computer technician, currently lacking in most government senior high schools, were seen as necessary steps to reducing the pressure on <b>coordinators...</b>|$|R
5|$|After Maryland's last regular-season game, {{defensive}} <b>coordinator</b> Chris Cosh {{and tight}} ends coach and special teams assistant Danny Pearman announced their resignations. Cosh returned to Kansas State, {{where he had}} coached before Maryland, to assume defensive play-calling duties under recently re-hired head coach Bill Snyder. Danny Pearman returned to his alma mater, Clemson, to work for Dabo Swinney, who had been promoted from offensive <b>coordinator</b> to interim head coach and, finally, head coach for the Tigers. For the bowl game, Maryland's defensive line coach, Al Seamonson, was named as the interim defensive <b>coordinator.</b> Third-year intern Brian White filled in for Pearman as the interim tight ends coach and would assist head coach Friedgen in running the special teams.|$|E
5|$|After {{working for}} his father for two years with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, Ryan {{returned}} to college coaching as the defensive <b>coordinator</b> for the Cincinnati Bearcats. The Bearcats won the first Humanitarian Bowl over Utah State in Ryan's final year, marking the team's first bowl appearance in fifty years. Ryan was the Oklahoma Sooners' defensive <b>coordinator</b> for {{a year in which}} the defense was ranked sixth in the nation. However, head coach John Blake failed to achieve a winning record for a third straight year and subsequently, the entire staff was fired. Ryan served as defensive <b>coordinator</b> at Kansas State for a month in 1999 under head coach Bill Snyder.|$|E
5|$|Bob Stoops {{returned}} for his eighth season as Oklahoma's head coach. During the off-season, {{he was once}} again mentioned {{as a candidate for}} positions outside of Oklahoma. While Stoops decided to stay in Norman, the rest of the Oklahoma coaching staff did see some changes. The biggest change came at the offensive <b>coordinator</b> position. Former offensive <b>coordinator</b> Chuck Long left Oklahoma to take the head coaching job at San Diego State University. Stoops chose somebody already on the staff to fill Long's spot. Kevin Wilson was named the new offensive <b>coordinator</b> after previously serving as the co-offensive <b>coordinator</b> along with Long as well as the offensive line coach. Rejoining the staff was former Sooner quarterback Josh Heupel, who led Oklahoma to the 2000 National Championship. Heupel had served two years as a graduate assistant before taking a position with Mike Stoops, Bob Stoops's brother, at the University of Arizona in 2005. Heupel took over Long's old position of quarterback coach. Leaving the staff was Darrell Wyatt, who spent four years as the wide receivers coach. He took a position with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This move launched another reshuffle of duties on Stoops's staff. Coach Kevin Sumlin took over Wyatt's duties with the wide receivers and was also named co-offensive <b>coordinator</b> with Wilson. Coach James Patton was hired on from Northwestern to take over Wilson's duties with the offensive line.|$|E

40|$|Export {{manufacturers}} face challenges {{associated with}} intrafirm coordination among functional units and interfirm coordination with foreign distributors. The majority {{of research on}} export coordination examines intra- and interfirm coordination strategies separately. Consequently, limited insights have been gained into how export manufacturers combine the various intra- and interfirm coordination strategies to achieve export success. Using a cluster analysis, the authors incorporate both intra- and interfirm coordination strategies as inputs to identify profiles of export manufacturers. They identify? four distinct profiles: balanced <b>coordinators,</b> interactive <b>coordinators,</b> flexibilityonly <b>coordinators,</b> and unfocused <b>coordinators.</b> The authors find that the best performers are balanced <b>coordinators,</b> or the export manufacturers that concurrently deploy multiple intra- and interfirm coordination strategies.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examined}} the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test <b>coordinators</b> on implementing a high-stakes computer-based testing. Test <b>coordinators</b> from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adatpive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test <b>coordinators.</b> The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test <b>coordinators</b> 2 ̆ 7 responses. Test <b>coordinators</b> responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results. Some test <b>coordinators</b> preferred the use of computer-adaptive tests for diagnostic purposes only. Test <b>coordinators</b> experiences focused on the security, the emotions, and the management of testing. The {{findings of this study}} will benefit those interested in implementing a high-stakes, computer-based testing program by recommending a simulation study be conducted and feedback by solicited from test <b>coordinators</b> prior to an operational test administration...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{new project}} on {{education}} in family medicine training was implemented {{last year in}} Slovenia by establishing regional <b>coordinators</b> in the specialist training programme. They are responsible for conducting regular small-group meetings with family medicine trainees. This study wanted to explore the attitudes and opinions of regional <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine trainees concerning this new method. Methods: This was a qualitative study based on focus groups. The participants were regional <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine specialist trainees. The data were analysed based {{on the principles of}} thematic content analysis with inductive technique. Results: The study revealed five themes which were the same for the analysis of transcripts of both regional <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine trainees: 1) Meetings with trainees 2) Coordination 3) Characteristics of regional <b>coordinators</b> 4) Position of regional <b>coordinators,</b> and 5) Evaluation of regional <b>coordinators.</b> Conclusion: Participants of the study have many expectations for this new programme. They expect progress in trainees 2 ̆ 7 clinical knowledge through experience-based group learning {{and with the help of}} the tutorship role of regional <b>coordinators.</b> The role of regional <b>coordinators</b> represents a new possibility for solving problems in the training programme in their coordinating role. In future, they have the potential to develop into an expert body that supervises the quality of training. A close follow-up is necessary to see if the position of regional <b>coordinators</b> is adequate and if they meet the expectations of the trainees as well as their own goals. Administrative and financial support for the programme is necessary.
