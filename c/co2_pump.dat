40|$|The laser {{has long}} been {{established}} as the best possible optical source for fundamental studies and applications requiring high field intensity, single mode operation, {{a high degree of}} coherence, a narrow linewidth and short pulses. There are many applications that require lasers of varying frequencies, powers, and far-field properties. In science, the laser is a useful source in spectroscopy and microscopy, for investigating nonlinear optics phenomena and nuclear fusion. More commonly, we find them in barcode readers, laser pointers, and printers. They are also widely used for military, medical, and industrial applications. This thesis is focused on achieving new understanding of the principles and phenomena involved in the interaction of light with a variety of material systems, which will in turn guide the designs of compact lasers with feedback structures having features at the subwavelength-scale. The thesis begins by describing the interaction of light with an arbitrary complex material system, and implementing them into the electromagnetic model using two different theoretical techniques suitable for analyzing microstructured lasers: exact finite-difference time-domain calculations and a semi-analytic coupled-mode formalism. These methods are first applied to analyze lasing action in the photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. This class of lasers, commonly referred to as the photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), can be integrated on-chip and is essentially the two-dimensional (2 D) versions of the second-order distributed feedback lasers, where the higher quality factor lasing mode (dark Fano resonance) is selected through the symmetry mismatch to the free-space modes. The PCSELs have not only achieved the highest surface-emitting single-mode power but also the ability to control the shapes, polarizations and directions of their far-fields. However, as in all laser cavities, the lasing areas of PCSELs are limited by two fundamental constraints; a large area tends to promote both multi-mode and multi-area lasing. We propose to overcome both constraints to achieve single-mode PCSELs of larger areas, and thus higher output powers, by tuning the regular lasing bandedges of quadratic dispersions in typical PCSELs to form a single accidental Dirac cone of linear dispersion at the Brillouin zone center. Moreover, an additional frequency-locking phenomenon at the accidental point, with potentially high density of states, is analyzed. We demonstrate and distinguish experimentally the existence of the dark Fano resonances in a macroscopic 2 D silicon nitride PhC slab consisting of a square array of holes. We characterize the passive PhC slab in terms of its resonant frequencies and radiation behaviors using temporal coupled-mode theory and symmetry considerations. We also realize lasing at a dark Fano resonance with diluted solutions of R 6 G molecules as the gain medium. Next, we turn our attention to the organic dye lasers whose high tunability in the visible wavelengths has attracted interests for many years due to their low-cost processing, flexible choice of substrates, and large emission cross sections that can cover the spectral region from ultraviolet to the near infrared. We investigate the laser dynamics in systems of sub-wavelength photonic structures consisting of organic dye molecules, including their photobleaching effects. Our analysis considers both the chemical properties of the dyes and optical properties of the cavities. We also systematically studied the feasibility of lasing under continuous-wave excitations in optically pumped monolithic organic dye lasers. This study suggests routes to realize an organic laser that can potentially lase with a threshold of only a few W/cm² Lastly, we investigate far-infrared (FIR) (~ 0. 2 - 2 THz) laser emission from optically-pumped rotationally excited molecular gases confined in a metallic cavity. Terahertz radiation has already been used in packaging inspection for quality control, chemical composition analysis, and security screening. Submillimeter spatial resolution imaging and incredibly specific molecular recognition are other compelling uses for terahertz radiation. To apply terahertz radiation beyond laboratory or close range (100 mW) and efficient sources are required to see through highly attenuating obscurants (including the atmosphere). The fundamental limitations in the performances of FIR molecular gas lasers reside in the molecular gas physics due to the so-called vibrational bottleneck. We seek to overcome the resulting challenges through novel optical designs of the feedback structures. To undertake this task, we generalize previous works to allow for a realistic description of the spatio-temporal dynamics characterizing the molecular collisional and diffusion processes. This work expands the current understanding of lasing action in FIR gas lasers and, thus, could {{contribute to the development of}} a new class of terahertz sources able to operate efficiently at room temperature. The advent of quantum cascade lasers to replace <b>CO₂</b> <b>pump</b> lasers may combine to produce truly compact submillimeter-wave laser sources in the near future. by Song-Liang Chua. Thesis (Ph.

50|$|The design {{followed}} the principles {{established by the}} Calder Hall nuclear power station, in that it used a reactor core of natural uranium fuel in Magnox alloy cans within a graphite moderator, all contained in a welded steel pressure vessel. The core was cooled by <b>CO2</b> <b>pumped</b> by six nominal 7,000 hp (5.2 MW) gas circulators, which transported the hot gas from the core to the six Steam Raising Units (boilers) via steel ducts.

The design pressure of the gas circuit was 185 psig, and {{the temperature of the}} gas leaving the reactor was 378 °C, although this was later reduced when the hot CO2 was found to be corroding the mild steel components of the gas circuit more quickly than had been anticipated. Like all Magnox reactors, Hinkley Point A was designed for on-load refuelling so that exhausted fuel elements could be replaced with fresh without shutting down the reactor.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Master's thesis has been to {{investigate}} the performance of different methods of heat recovery from ventilation air. Comparisons have been made with regard to delivered energy for heating of domestic hot water, space heating and ventilation heating. A single-unit dwelling {{was used as a}} basis for the simulations. The house, built in accordance with the Norwegian passive house standard, had a gross internal area of 172. 6 m². Seven different combinations of a heat wheel, an exhaust air <b>CO₂</b> heat <b>pump</b> and an outdoor air <b>CO₂</b> heat <b>pump</b> was assessed. Direct [...] acting electricity was used to cover the remaining heat demand in all seven heat recovery models. Three different occupant behaviour models and three different climates (Oslo, Stavanger and Kautokeino) were investigated in order to increase the area of application for the results. The building was simulated in IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, while the heat pump performance was post-processed in Matlab. Several aspects concerning heat recovery, dimensioning, ventilation and heating schedules, heat distribution, etc., have been assessed. Simulations performed for a family of five with a high consumption of domestic hot water in Oslo showed that the required amount of delivered energy for heating was equal to 115 kWh/m²yr, without any heat recovery. The most used heat recovery method in Norway today, a heat wheel, reduces the energy demand by 34 %, down to 76 kWh/m²yr. The most efficient heat recovery model that was found in this report showed a reduction of delivered energy for heating of 68 %, down to 36 kWh/m²yr. This heat recovery model consists of a heat wheel and a heat pump utilizing both ventilation exhaust air and outdoor air. The recommended solution for occupants with a high domestic hot water consumption, when economy is taken into account, is based on a heat wheel and an exhaust air <b>CO₂</b> heat <b>pump.</b> The amount of delivered energy is reduced by 66 %, down to 40 kWh/m²yr. Any further work within this field should look into the choice of refrigerant, improvements on the heat pump model and the impact of different building sizes. A more in-depth investment analysis of the different heat recovery models, including the heat distribution system in the building, should also be assessed...|$|R

50|$|The {{supercritical}} CO2 acts selectively on the caffeine, {{releasing the}} alkaloid and nothing else. Water-soaked coffee beans {{are placed in}} an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and supercritical CO2 is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 {{pounds per square inch}} (about 69 bar) to extract the caffeine. The CO2 acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine-laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO2 returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO2 using charcoal filters, and the caffeine free <b>CO2</b> is <b>pumped</b> back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{of carbon dioxide}} assimilation in plants is through the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (also known as RuBisCO), that adds CO2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (a 5 carbon sugar), to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (2x3 carbon sugars). However, at higher temperatures and lower CO2 concentrations, RuBisCO adds oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, to form the unusable product glycolate in a process called photorespiration. To prevent this wasteful process, plants increase the local CO2 concentration in a process called the [...] cycle. PEP carboxylase plays the key role of binding CO2 {{in the form of}} bicarbonate with PEP to create oxaloacetate in the mesophyll tissue. This is then converted back to pyruvate (through a malate intermediate), to release the CO2 in the deeper layer of bundle sheath cells for carbon fixation by RuBisCO and the Calvin cycle. Pyruvate is converted back to PEP in the mesophyll cells, and the cycle begins again, thus actively <b>pumping</b> <b>CO2.</b>|$|R
50|$|SFC with CO2 {{utilizes}} {{carbon dioxide}} pumps that {{require that the}} incoming <b>CO2</b> and <b>pump</b> heads be kept cold {{in order to maintain}} the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate. The CO2 subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved. SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix, with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas. The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection, and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency. Typically, gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar co-solvent such as methanol, possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations ~1%. The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5 um material. The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate, co-solvent composition, system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed 40 °C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO2. In addition, SFC provides an additional control parameter - pressure - by using an automated back pressure regulator. From an operational standpoint, SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar co-solvent. If the outlet CO2 is captured, it can be recompressed and recycled, allowing for >90% reuse of CO2.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the role that}} the solubility and biological <b>pumps</b> have on <b>CO₂</b> variability across the Agulhas Current system (Agulhas Current and the Agulhas Return Current). The Agulhas Current system transports heat and salt from the Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic Ocean via the Agulhas leakage, which influences the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This study presents {{for the first time a}} characterization of the role the Agulhas Current system (Agulhas and Agulhas Return Currents) has on the uptake of anthropogenic CO₂. Fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO₂) values were obtained from a ship-based underway pCO₂ (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) system and the air-sea CO₂ fluxes were computed using 6 -hourly wind speeds from the NOAA Blended Sea Winds. An experiment was conducted during the Crossroads scientific monitoring line in May 2013, where surface dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and CO₂ flux were compared between the Agulhas and Agulhas Return Currents and the region directly south over the Agulhas Plateau. Our findings highlighted that the solubility and biological pumps played minimal to no role in the drawdown of carbon across the sub-Tropical zone and the Agulhas Current system (Agulhas and Agulhas Return Currents), due to opposing effect between chlorophyll and temperature on pCO₂ that explained why although there was carbon drawdown by primary production in the Agulhas and Agulhas Return Current regions, this does not play a role in enhancing the air-sea exchange of <b>CO₂.</b> The solubility <b>pump</b> was responsible for CO₂ in the sub-Antarctic zone.

40|$|In {{integrated}} circuit (IC) manufacturing, particulate contamination {{from hundreds of}} processe steps is {{a major cause of}} yield loss. The removal of particles is typically achieved through liquid chemical formulations aided by a sound field in the MHz frequency range. When liquid is irradiated with megasonic waves, dissolved gases {{play an important role in}} particle removal and feature damage. To take the advantage of the beneficial effect of CO₂ (aq.), this thesis describes the development and optimization of a megasonic cleaning process using a chemical system containing NH₄OH and NH₄HCO₃ at an alkaline pH in which a specific amount of aqueous CO₂ can be maintained to minimize feature damage. In addition, certain etching effects at a slightly alkaline pH were supported for achieving high particle removal. Sonoluminescence (SL) data were collected from these cleaning solutions and correlated with the cleaning performance. The intensity of SL is believed to be a sensitive indicator of transient cavitation during megasonic irradiation, which is thought to be responsible for fragile feature damage. To further analyze the SL signal with respect to the emission from hydroxyl radicals, single-band filters were used to collect the SL signal in different wavelength ranges. The study of particle removal and feature damage was performed using a single-wafer cleaning tool, MegPie® (ProSys, Inc.), which provided acoustic irradiation at a frequency of 0. 925 MHz. Commercially available SiO₂ slurry with 200 ± 20 nm particles was used for particle contamination. Particle removal was investigated on both blanket SiO₂ samples and patterned samples. Feature damage studies were conducted on patterned samples by examining the number of line breakages per unit area. By adjusting the pH in NH₄OH/NH₄HCO₃ solutions from 7. 8 to 8. 5, the amount of CO₂ (aq.) was varied. At a pH of 8. 2 with ~ 320 ppm CO₂ (aq.) in the cleaning solution, a high particle removal efficiency was achieved (> 90 %) at an acoustic power intensity of 1 W/cm² for an exposure time of 60 s, and the feature damage was reduced by > 50 %. For SL signal analysis, band filters in the wavelength range of (i) 280 – 305. 5 nm, (ii) 300 – 340 nm, (iii) 335 – 375 nm, and (iv) 374. 5 – 397. 5 nm were used to resolve the SL spectrum in these wavelength ranges. The filters were sandwiched, one at a time, between the optical window and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) in the Cavitation Threshold (CT) cell. Air-, Ar-, and CO₂-containing DI water (at pH 4. 53 with ~ 90 ppm aqueous <b>CO₂)</b> was <b>pumped</b> through the cell at a flow rate of 130 ml/min. The acoustic power was ramped from 0. 1 to 4 W/cm² at an acoustic frequency of 0. 925 MHz. The SL signal intensity showed the highest value in the ranges of 300 – 340 and 335 – 375 nm in air- and Ar-saturated DI water, which is due to the emission from excited hydroxyl radicals. These results are consistent with an SL spectrum analysis performed using expensive optical set-ups. In CO₂-containing DI water, the SL signal intensity was suppressed by a factor of 100. The methodology reported in this work is simple, inexpensive, and capable of capturing SL spectral features due to hydroxyl radicals...|$|R
