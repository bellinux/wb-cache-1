5|$|The 1810s were a {{critical}} decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat {{was built in}} Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. Also, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products. When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.|$|E

25|$|Unger looks {{closely at}} existential {{projects}} that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic (Buddhism, which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both {{respond to the}} fact of the individual not being the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others.

As the celestial pole and geographic pole, it expresses a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms. Communication from lower realms may ascend to higher ones and blessings from higher realms may descend to lower ones and be disseminated to all. The spot functions as the omphalos (navel), the world's point of beginning.|$|E
25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to {{the defeat of the}} imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E
25|$|In his Divina commedia ("Divine comedy"; set in {{the year}} 1300), Dante Alighieri {{employed}} the concept of taking Virgil as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of Purgatorio). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to Limbo just {{at the edge of}} Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of Cocytus. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out {{to the other side of}} the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.|$|E

Although Copernicus does not treat the physical nature of the spheres in detail, his few allusions make it clear that, like many of his predecessors, he accepted non-solid celestial spheres. Copernicus rejected the ninth and tenth spheres, placed the orb of the Moon around the Earth and moved the Sun from its orb to the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> [...] The planetary orbs circled the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in the order Mercury, Venus, the great orb containing the Earth and the orb of the Moon, then the orbs of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
