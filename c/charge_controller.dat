Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density.

These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled <b>charge</b> <b>controller</b> and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a <b>charge</b> <b>controller</b> and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E

30|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the most {{important}} renewable energy resources because it is inexhaustible and eco-friendly, and has been used to provide light, heat and electricity [1, 2]. Solar PV modules have two major problems of low efficiency and intermittency, i.e. their efficiency of converting sun light into electric power is generally less than 17 %, and the generated electric power changes with weather conditions [3 – 5]. Moreover, PV cell characteristics (I-V or V-P) are nonlinear and changes with insolation and temperature. In stand-alone solar PV systems, the PV modules and batteries are the most expensive components. When the batteries are directly connected to the PV modules, there is no protection against overcharging and consequently, battery life-span decreases. To protect batteries from overcharging <b>charge</b> <b>controllers</b> can be used, though conventional <b>charge</b> <b>controllers</b> do not operate PV modules at MPP, resulting in lower efficiency. To improve the efficiency, it is desirable to operate the PV module at peak power point to deliver maximum power to the batteries.|$|R
