5000|$|The Soviet {{policy of}} favoring one Arab group often drove the others towards the west, {{as seen by}} the {{increased}} favoritism towards Iraq and Syria which served to push Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia back into Western graces as a former Soviet exploited state. The Soviets use their stick and <b>carrot</b> <b>approach</b> to bully the Arabs into joining their sphere, however the Arab League keeps closer ties using religion {{than that of the}} atheist Soviets. The Soviets also become their own worst enemies when they invade Afghanistan and initially support both Iran and Iraq during their war in the early 1980s, before switching sides and only supporting the Iranians. Moscow has initial great gains in Arabia, but through their own missteps, and lackluster polices, they lose diplomatic trust with their invasion of Afghanistan, and later their support of Iran being the deal breakers causing them to loose diplomatic respect of the Arabs and push them further into alliances with the West.|$|E
40|$|Public policy {{conflicts}} emerge when {{feelings of}} scarcity and different interests dominate interactive process among {{the government and}} the public. The stakeholders struggle in a lower violence capacity but broad range of conflicting issues. Thus, some parties may use cooperative or/and competitive conflict management approaches to achieve their goals. This thesis argues that different political structures influence the use of different conflict management mechanisms in managing public policy conflicts. The constitutions, social cultures and national political competitions are a few among the many factors that may manoeuvre a stakeholder’s movement and strategies in the conflict management process. Thailand (liberal democracy) and Malaysia (semi-authoritarian) are the comparative cases, which will be examined in this article. The economic achievements and fast industrialization process have increased the development in these two countries. Large-scale water development projects, particularly hydroelectric power plants have been constructed to fill in the energy gap. However, the hydroelectric projects have caused conflicts between the policy maker and the public. Opposition from affected villagers, NGOs and society members is manifested through demonstrations and lobbying activities. Nevertheless, although both countries face similar conflict situations, the regime’s conflict management responses are differ very much from each other. Here, it is suggested that the political structure design of the liberal democratic country tended to allow better public participation in the conflict management process, where the public was able to consolidate and organise open demonstrations to pressure the regime. On the other hand, the authoritarian regime reacted with a more suppressive approach by using the stick and <b>carrot</b> <b>approach</b> to prevent the escalation of the conflicts. Laws, regulations and force were used to restrict the public from any open opposition. As conclusion, political structure does influence stakeholders’ conflict management approaches particularly in public policy conflicts...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) mainly implements river bank protection, flood control, drainage and irrigation projects. BWDB has completed many water management related projects and it has around 54 ongoing ADP included projects in this year 2014 - 15 where there are many suppliers/contractors performing in those projects. Supplier performance management will {{play a vital role}} to complete those projects successfully within time frame and budget allocation. This dissertation focuses on the supplier performance management in BWDB. The objective of this dissertation is to identify the current practices of supplier performance management and performance shortfalls as well as to suggest ways of improvement in supplier performance. This is an exploratory research that uses case study method. Primary data (qualitative) has been collected from respondents both engineers and suppliers of BWDB working in selected projects through questionnaire survey and interviews. Secondary data (quantitative) has been collected from BWDB website. From the analysis of the both qualitative and quantitative data the major reasons behind the shortfalls in supplier’s performance have been identified and suggestions about improving supplier performance have been congregated. It has been found that only 13 % projects are completed in due time and 67 % projects need two to three years extension to be accomplished. This is happening due to mainly insufficient budget allocation in the projects by the government. Two to three years delay occurs in 66 % projects to get budget allocated in the original DPP. Due to financial insolvency of suppliers they can’t start project in due time or even can’t accomplish project within given time period. Again suppliers have technical shortfalls like lack of machinery, equipment and manpower. Sometimes it is found that there are no weight measuring scale, sieve, sufficient sewing machine, generator, cc block formwork and labor. Although suppliers show graduate engineers in their manpower list while contracting but practically even no diploma engineers are found in the work site. Moreover, due to lack of supervision by concerned official, contractors often take the chance to deteriorate quality of work. They change the concrete mixture ratio in cc block manufacturing and change thickness of filter material above which cc blocks are laid down in the slope of the river bank. To improve suppliers’ performance sufficient yearly budget allocation as well as quarterly fund release according to original DPP should be done by BWDB. If it is impossible to allocate sufficient yearly budget, suppliers should be allowed to take loan from state owned bank against their work/supply order at low interest rate in compared with private bank. Moreover, the existence of equipment, machinery and manpower according to suppliers’ submitted list should be specially checked and verified through visiting suppliers’ premises to ensure the technical capability of suppliers while selecting them. Finally, the concerned engineer may motivate supplier through the both approach of motivation i. e. the <b>carrot</b> <b>approach</b> (e. g giving recognition and rewards: inclusion on the preferred supplier list, certificate of excellence which will increase the goodwill of the supplier in the market) and the stick approach (e. g publicizing debarred/black list for unsuccessful supplier, giving exemplary punishment, including penalty clauses in contract) ...|$|E

40|$|Multinational {{companies}} in the life science sector are heavily influenced by government policies and regulations and in turn attempt to influence these actors nationally and internationally. This paper focuses on recent and on-going research, principally on the agro-biotechnology and, to a lesser extent, on the pharmaceutical industries, covering the evolution of policy and regulation in Europe, how policies are influenced by stakeholder pressures and how policy in turn influences company strategies for product development. We focus particularly on new ‘governance’ agendas in Europe and consider the relative impacts of enabling, constraining, discriminating and indiscriminate policies on company strategies {{as part of our}} development of an integrated approach to policy and governance. We also consider changes in external operating environments for multinational companies and compare past histories and present pressures on agro-biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The paper argues, with evidence, that a more enabling and discriminating policy and regulatory environment can achieve public goals more efficiently and effectively, taking account of impacts on innovation, than more blunt policy instruments. This type of environment takes into account the resources and capabilities available to firms and research laboratories rather than relying on broad brush <b>carrot</b> and stick <b>approaches.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Accounting scandals have shaken the {{confidence}} of the investor in the companies. Large number of people lost their money in these scandals. All these scandals were attributed to false, misleading, or untruthful accounting. This undermines the role of accounting professionals who did not report material manipulations in the financial results of the company. The study attempted to find an association between ethical values of accounting professionals and their choices in ethical dilemmas in their profession. Correlation scores in this study revealed that there is a statistically significant low degree of positive correlation between value assessment ratings and ethical dilemmas in scenarios. Similarly, the correlation coefficients computed between scenario ratings and formal ethics education indicates that the latter would be important in preventing the instances of unethical reporting. Ethical value score of professionals were found to be more explanatory than formal ethical education. The study strongly recommends building up of rigorous ethical and fiduciary responsibility in the financial sector through various means. The auditors must be trained to become responsible, independent, and judicious while conducting audits. Professional bodies should encourage compliance with ethical reporting practices in accounting by both <b>carrot</b> and stick <b>approach.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The carrot {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} root vegetables, both in raw and processed forms and offers various nutritional benefits with the firesh product being low in energy and a good source of fibre, potassium and other minerals. Of all the vegetables, it {{is one of the}} richest sources of carotenes especially B-carotene which has a crucial role in vision and is also thought to have benefits due to its anti carcinogenic properties and in protection against heart disease. [...] . For this strategic investigation on processing suitability, four commercially available Australian carrot varieties (two traditional and two more recently developed) were selected. Nutrient contents have been measured including moisture, protein, crude fibre, pectin, vitamins (Bi, B 2,, C and Carotenes) and minerals (Ca, Fe, K, Mg and Na). Small variations in macronutrients and mineral composition were observed between the varieties. Parameters used industrially to indicate juicing potential were also assessed. Considerable variation in yield and colour characteristics of juices prepared from the different varieties was observed. As a result of this strategic study, suitable processing carrot varieties, blanching indicator enzyme, blanching regime, concentration technique and storage conditions have been established. A recommended processing protocol has also been developed for the commercial processing of <b>carrot</b> juice. This <b>approach</b> is suitable for the production of carrot juice concentrate having optimal quality characteristics...|$|R
40|$|For law {{enforcement}} purposes corruption and fraud are hard battles. Because {{of the highly}} secretive and premeditated nature of these crimes, prime witnesses are themselves often implicated in the fraudulent transaction. Promises of immunity and whistle blowing rewards are often required to resolve these information asymmetries. These insights have set a trend, both in scholarship and {{law enforcement}} practice, towards reward-based <b>approaches</b> (<b>carrots),</b> as an alternative or complement to punishment based deterrence (sticks). Applying the U. S. False Claims Act (FCA) as an analytical framework, we provide a critical review of the efficiency limitations of whistle blowing. More specifically, the formal model developed in this contribution, reveals a gap between social and private incentives in whistle blowing, both {{with regard to the}} decision to pursue litigation and the timing of whistle blowing. First, while an insider will blow the whistle whenever his expected recovery exceeds the expected costs of litigation, enforcement agencies seek to optimise enforcement in the long run. The autonomy of whistle blowers to pursue claims without government involvement, weakens the government’s bargaining position and obstructs the government’s ability to weigh in wider factors of enforcement (the effect of an individual case on a multiple claim suit, etc.). Second, whenever rewards are tied to recovery, bounty awards create a perverse incentive whereby fraudulent practices are not terminated at a socially optimal point in time. The potential race among whistle blowers cannot mitigate this effect fully because the stigma and loss of opportunities on the job market act as internal constraints on whistle blowing...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{adequacy}} is {{the ability}} of a system to meet the load at all times. A critical issue in the restructured electric utility industry is the capacity deficiency problems, with the events in the California electricity crisis in 2000 – 2001 being particularly notable. The capacity situation in California was further aggravated by the physical withholding of capacity. Several short-term resource adequacy programs have been established to address the issue. To date, the effectiveness of these programs is limited. In this thesis, we focus on the short-term resource adequacy problem in a competitive environment. The emphasis is on the understanding of the modeling needs and analytical aspects of the problem, and the development of requirements for an effective program. We propose a design of a short-term resource adequacy program based on the specified capacity requirements formulated in terms of available capacity. This is the first proposed design with an explicit linkage between the associated economics and the reliability outcome. The design uses a <b>carrots</b> and sticks <b>approach</b> that gives incentives for providing capacity to markets and metes out penalties for nonperformance situations. The design allows the tuning of key design parameters including requirements formulation and penalty coefficient. The analysis of the proposed program shows that it results in improved reliability. We illustrate the impacts of the program using three different test systems. We test each system under a wide variety of conditions to study a large number of cases. In each case of each test system, the implementation of the design results in reliability improvements. Extensive sensitivity studies show that reduced total system costs can be attained with the proposed program when the tunable parameters are iii judiciously selected. The design and analysis work of this thesis serves as a useful aid in the assessment and enhancement of short-term resource adequacy programs. i...|$|R

In the beginning of the episode, when they are in Joe's home theater, Joe appears rolling across the ground in a parody of the 1984-1993 TriStar Pictures logo. The television show that Peter and Lois watch entitled Fast Talking High Trousers, which parodied 1940s films, was conceived by Wellesley Wild. The episode's title and plot references the horror film Poltergeist. The episode references the finale of the NBC sitcom Friends and its sequel Joey, also referencing the cancellation of Joey. To cheer himself up, Stewie at one point imagines himself on the show Jackass. In one scene, Chris is frightened by Ronald McDonald, and is saved from an evil tree by Herbert, who fights the tree in a The Lord of the Rings-style battle. When Peter is clawing at his face, he transforms into Hank Hill from King of the Hill. While trapped inside the spirit world, Stewie learns he can communicate through the TV, and he sings the second verse of the Phil Collins song [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] with the same fuzzy reverb vocal effect used in the recorded song. While shooting golf balls through the portal, Peter remarks [...] "we are going to get those terrorists, now watch this drive." [...] A reference to a televised interview on a golf course in which President George W. Bush said the same thing before hitting a ball. Peter also references Bugs Bunny by sticking his head out of Meg's butt and claiming he took a wrong turn at Albuquerque. The scene of Peter taking the TV back in and putting Meg out referenced the end of the original film Poltergeist, where the family's father removes the television set after the family flees to a motel room. JAG is also shown, commenting how the show has run its course, the last episode of the series having aired on April 29, 2005. When the Griffin family <b>approaches</b> <b>Carrot</b> Top's mansion, the theme from Back to the Future is used.|$|R
40|$|This study {{documents}} {{a crucial}} {{dimension of the}} resistance of Nigerian civil society to a repressive and monumentally corrupt military state in the late 1980 s and 1990 s in Nigeria. Employing a neo-Gramscian theoretical framework, the study relates how {{a section of the}} media defied censorship laws, outright bans, incarceration and the assassination of opposition figures, to prosecute the struggle for democracy. It captures the tensions and contradictions between a pliant section of the media, which sought to legitimise the state and a critical section of the same media, which in alliance with radical civil society, invented rebellious outlets to carry on the struggle against dictatorship. The study seeks to make fresh departures by documenting not only the role of the national media in the throes of democratic struggle, but that of the international media whose role was influential in the years studied. Finally the report offers empirical proof of the mechanisms by which a vibrant civil society can curb the ravages of a predatory state in an African country.
