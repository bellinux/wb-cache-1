50|$|It {{was widely}} {{known as the}} 'Lean Burn' engine as it was {{designed}} primarily for fuel economy and featured a different cylinder head which was aimed less at power output than other CVH engines. The <b>carburetted</b> <b>versions</b> feature an unusual Weber 28/30 carb (replacing the unreliable Ford VV unit) with a manifold vacuum-actuated secondary choke, instead of the more usual sequential linkage which opens the secondary butterfly at 3/4 to full throttle. The idea was to save more fuel, especially with lead-footed drivers, but the result was mainly a car which ran horribly lean under any kind of load, particularly after the famous CVH top-end wear began to reduce engine vacuum with some mileage on the clock. The 1.4 L version is less tuneable than other CVH's, and some top-end parts are not interchangeable with the most common tuning parts; however replacing the carb with the common Weber 32/34 DMTL and the appropriate inlet manifold makes them more driveable, albeit with a small increase in fuel consumption.|$|R

50|$|The 200 {{series was}} offered with three {{families}} of engines. Most 240s were equipped with Volvo's own red block, 2.0-2.3 litre four-cylinder engines. Both overhead valve and overhead cam {{versions of the}} red block engines were installed in 240s. The B20 was used only {{in the early years}} and subsequently replaced by the B19, a smaller version of the B21. Power of the <b>carburetted</b> <b>versions</b> increased for the 1979 model year. V6 engines were also available, first in the 260-models, but also later in the GLE- and GLT-versions of 240. Known as the PRV family, they were developed in a three-way partnership among Volvo, Peugeot and Renault, 240 diesel models are powered by diesel engines purchased from Volkswagen. In Greece and Israel the 1.8 liter B17 engine was available beginning with the 1980 model year (also as a luxuriously equipped 260). This hard working little twin-carb engine developed , and had considerably higher fuel consumption than even the turbocharged top version.|$|R

The four-wheel drive chassis was based on that of the contemporary Mitsubishi Pajero, although parts are seldom interchangeable.
