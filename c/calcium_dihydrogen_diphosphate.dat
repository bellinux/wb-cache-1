When combined in a ready-made baking powder, the acid and alkali ingredients are included in the right proportions such that they will exactly neutralize each other and not significantly affect the overall pH of the product.

Although MCPM {{has been}} known since 1807 (Dorozhkin 2012 a, 2013 a), MCPA was differentiated as “tetra-hydrogen calcium phosphate, H 4 Ca(PO 4) 2 ” by 1879 (Roscoe and Schorlemmer 1879). It crystallizes under the same conditions as MCPM but at temperatures above ~ 100  °C (e.g., from concentrated hot mother liquors during fertilizer production). In addition, MCPA might be prepared from MCPM by dehydration. Furthermore, it might be also prepared at ambient temperatures by crystallization in water-restricted or non-aqueous systems. Like MCPM, MCPA never appears in calcified tissues and is not biocompatible due to its acidity. There is no current application of MCPA in medicine. Due to the similarity with MCPM, in many cases, MCPA might be used instead of MCPM; however, highly hydroscopic properties of MCPA reduce its commercial applications (Becker 1989; Budavari et al. 1996).|$|R

The addition of zinc is already known to alter the configura-tion of proteins and to alter their biologic activity; for exam-ple, the addition of zinc to denatured alcohol dehydrogen-ase leads to a reconstitution of the dimeric form from its monomers and to the restoration of its activity which would otherwise not occur. 2 We have therefore investigated the possibility that zinc may modify the biologic activity/potency of insulin in vitro.
