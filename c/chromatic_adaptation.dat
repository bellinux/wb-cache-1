Secondary eyes have maximum relative sensitivities at 505 – 510 nm which are unchanged by <b>chromatic</b> <b>adaptations.</b> Principal eyes have ultraviolet sensitivities which are 10 to 100 times greater at 380 nm than at 505 nm. However, two animals' eyes initially had greater blue-green sensitivities, then in 7 to 10 wk dropped 4 to 6 log units in absolute sensitivity in the visible, {{less in the}} ultraviolet. <b>Chromatic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of both types of principal eyes hardly changed relative spectral sensitivities. Small decreases in relative sensitivity in the visible with orange adaptations were possibly retinomotor in origin.

The second peaks in waveforms were most likely responses of unilluminated eyes to scattered light. It is concluded that both principal and secondary eyes contain cells with a visual pigment absorbing maximally at 505 – 510 nm.

40|$|Spectral sensitivities were {{recorded}} intracellulary in median ocelli of Anax junius, Aeschnatuberculifera, and Libellulapulcella. All cells had peak sensitivities at 360 and 500 nm while UV-blue+green cells {{found only in}} Anax had a third peak sensitivity at 440 nm. Ratios of UV-to- green sensitivities varied from cell to cell in each ocellus, but no UV- only or green-only cells {{were recorded}}. Half of the cells tested had a reverse Purkinje shift: They were more sensitive in the green at low illuminations but more sensitive in the UV at high illuminations; their intensity-response curves at 370 and 520 nm crossed but became parallel for large responses. Wave-lengths 420 nm and shorter elicited a family of low intensity-response curves with one slope; wavelengths 440 nm and longer elicities a family of curves with another slope. Orange-adapting lights selectively adapted sensitivity in the green, but UV-adapting lights had little selective effect. Amounts of log-selective adaptation were proportional to log orange-adapting intensity. It is concluded that two spectral mechanisms can be recorded from each cell, possibly by coupling of UV and green cells or possibly because each cell contains two visual pigments.

We present here the chromatic Vasarely effect, where the concentric angles have a chromatic gradient, under iso-brightness conditions. The strength of the effect was tested psychophysically by two measures, the length {{and the color of}} the illusory folds. The color of the illusory fold is perceived as the complementary color of the color of the nested-squares (or angles). The experimental results show that a large repertoire of stimuli with different colors and angles yielded significantly perceived colors.

The further a display device deviates from these standards, the less accurate these swatches will be. Swatches {{are based on}} the average measurements of several lots of single-pigment watercolor paints, converted from Lab color space to sRGB color space for viewing on a computer display.

Furthermore, pigments have inherently complex reflectance spectra that will render their [...] greatly different depending on the spectrum of the source illumination; a property called metamerism. Averaged measurements of pigment samples will only yield approximations of their true appearance under a specific source of illumination. Computer display systems use a technique called <b>chromatic</b> <b>adaptation</b> transforms to emulate the correlated color temperature of illumination sources, and cannot perfectly reproduce the intricate spectral combinations originally seen. In many cases, the perceived color of a pigment falls outside of the gamut of computer displays and a method called gamut mapping is used to approximate the true appearance.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we have {{investigated}} whether the colour perception {{is affected by}} the distribution and the spatial organization of colours in a complex image. In the first part of our study, we analysed the influence of scene content and of background types on the colour appearance judgement. To reach this aim we ran visual assessment experiments based on the magnitude estimation technique and we investigated various visual phenomena, such as brightness <b>adaptation,</b> <b>chromatic</b> spatial <b>adaptation,</b> contrast effects due to sizes and colored backgrounds, display field sizes and dynamic range in the scene. The examination of numerous visual assessment results done showed that the influence of the background on colour appearance is more noticeable for complex images with high frequencies than for color images with low frequencies or simple images. Likewise, the influence of the background on colour appearance is more noticeable for chromatic images with a large gamut than for less colored images with a low gamut. In the second part of our study, we analysed the influence of the local colour saliency on the colour appearance. To reach this aim we developed a computational model to measure colour contrast. Our motivation was to define an objective metric consistent with observer valuation. The proposed model integrates in a single model the influence of average colour perception and the interactions between local and global spatial structures according to the visual eccentricity. The measure of colour contrast relies on a set of parameters organized in a hierarchical structure. The computation is based on spatial criteria and integrates low-level factors calculated on defined regions relatively to their local and global neighbourhoods...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} how contrast adaptation influences three {{alternative measures}} of luminous efficiency. Subjects judged the lightness, the flicker, or {{the motion of}} <b>chromatic</b> sine-wave gratings. <b>Adaptation</b> to gratings with correlated luminance and chromatic contrast strongly biases lightness matches and moderately biases minimum-motion settings for gratings that are counterphased at 1 Hz, but it has little effect on motion or flicker settings for gratings that are counterphased at 15 Hz. These results suggest that different measures of equiluminance tap neural pathways that can have different spectral sensitivities. At low temporal frequencies both perceived lightness and minimum-motion settings appear to depend on channels that do not represent lu-minance and color independently...|$|R
40|$|Living {{elasmobranchs}} occupy {{every major}} aquatic ecosystem {{throughout the world}} (Compagno 2003; Compagno et al. 2005). Sensory ecology {{can be a good}} determinant in comprehending the processes occurring between an organism and its natural environment (Weissburg and Browman 2005). By utilizing ecophysiological tools, insight into the adaptive responses of the sensory systems to their ever-changing ecological niche can help explain behavioral and life history characteristics (Hueter 1991; Litherland 2009). Aquatic animals show structural and physiological adaptations in their visual sense specific to the ecological requirements of their habitat (Hart et al. 2004), implying that vision is an important modality. The visual system of the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis, family Triakidae) was examined using corneal electrophysiological methods to determine the visual spectral range, irradiance sensitivity, and speed of vision (flicker fusion frequency, FFF). The smooth dogfish, a shallow water bottom feeder inhabiting inshore waters along the eastern United States, was found to be extremely sensitive to dim light (- 3. 1 - 0. 1 log light intensity), and have a slow FFF (13 Hz), thus being well adapted to the scotopic conditions of the turbid coastal inshore waters. This prompted a second set of experiments focusing on the <b>chromatic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of the photoreceptor cells and retina function following light adaptation. Light adaptation increased the photopic threshold by 2. 0 log light units of intensity (LLI). However, the temporal resolution was not dramatically increased (to 17 Hz), indicating that the retinal integration time is very slow for this species under all circumstances. The spectral sensitivity peak for M. canis (470 nm) was found to be significantly blue-shifted in comparison to other members of the Triakidae family (Crescitelli et al. 1995; Sillman et al. 1996). Smooth dogfish appear to forgo high spatial and temporal resolution for the enhancement of photon capture. The sandbar shark inhabits the same inshore estuaries during the summer months but has a visual system with a higher temporal resolution (FFF, 54 Hz) and a brighter photopic threshold (1. 2 LLI- 50 % max) (Litherland 2009). Furthermore, other elasmobranch or telelost species inhabiting similar photic environments also exhibit faster temporal resolution; little skate (FFF, 30 Hz), weakfish (FFF, 40 Hz), red drum (FFF, 50 Hz), spotted sea trout (FFF, 60 Hz), and Atlantic croaker (FFF, 58 Hz) (Horodysky et al. 2008; McComb et al. 2010). Coastal seas tend to contain more dissolved organics and particulates than the clear oceanic waters of the epipelagic and pelagic zones (McFarland 1986), therefore the retina of smooth dogfish has adapted to be extremely sensitive to dim light, has a long integration time, a low flicker fusion frequency and temporal resolution, and retinal cells that are able to adjust to changing light conditions. All of these factors contribute to the visual system to provide optimal visual ability to enable smooth dogfish to accurately exploit its surroundings...|$|R

Colour perception and processing is commonly thought to occur mainly in high visual areas, and indeed most evidence for <b>chromatic</b> colour contrast <b>adaptation</b> comes from cortical studies. We show that colour contrast adaptation starts in the retina where ganglion cells adjust their responses to the spectral properties of the environment. We demonstrate that the ganglion cells match their responses to red-blue stimulus combinations according to the relative contrast {{of each of the}} input channels by rotating their functional response properties in colour space. Using measurements of the chromatic statistics of natural environments, we show that the retina balances inputs from the two (red and blue) stimulated colour channels, as would be expected from theoretical optimal behaviour.

40|$|The cone {{contrasts}} carrying different {{dimensions of}} color vision vary greatly in magnitude, yet the perceived con-trast {{of color and}} luminance in the world appears similar. We examined how this perceptual balance is adjusted by adaptation to the contrast in images. Observers set the level of L vs. M and S vs. LM contrast in 1 ∕f noise images to match the perceived strength of a fixed level of luminance contrast. The perceptual balance {{of color in the}} images was roughly consistent with the range of contrast characteristic of natural images. Relative perceived contrast could be strongly biased by brief prior exposure to images with lower or higher levels of <b>chromatic</b> contrast. Si-milar <b>adaptation</b> effects were found for luminance contrast in images of natural scenes. For both, observers reliably chose the contrast balance that appeared correct, and these choices were rapidly recalibrated by adaptation. This recalibration of the norm for contrast could reflect both changes in sensitivity and shifts in criterion.

40|$|Explains the Effects of Viewing Context on Color Appearance The {{idea that}} color {{appearance}} is a unitary experience {{is central to}} contemporary accounts of color. I test this idea using measurements of the shift in appearance between a bluish and a yellowish viewing context. My experiments took place within a naturalistic experimental room that contained real surfaces illuminated by computer-controlled lights and a projection colorimeter. Observers indicated appearance using asymmetric matching when the contexts were presented spatially and simultaneously. Observers also indicated appearance by naming the color category to which a stimulus belonged, by adjusting stimuli to appear achromatic, and by numerically scaling appearance. In these tasks the contexts were presented successively. I evaluate the agreement across tasks by fitting models to the appearance shifts. For each task, the shift in appearance was consistent with a model in which gains on cone-specific channels were affected by the viewing context. The shifts were in reasonable agreement across tasks for three observers. This indicates {{that the effects of}} context on color appearance are largely independent of the task used to assess appearance. Of the four tasks, asymmetric matching provided the most precise determination of the contextdependent model parameters. vi Vitae Personal Information: Born January 3, 1967, Cleveland, OH Education: 1991 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, B.

40|$|The chronobiological studies {{presented}} in this habilitation show qualitative differences in the non-visual effects of light depending on age, {{short and long term}} <b>adaptation.</b> <b>Chromatic</b> pupillometry was used to ask to what extent the pupillary reflex to light could be used in healthy subjects and patients with visual impairments as a marker for melanopsin-dependent functions. A major contribution of the work presented here is the demonstration of specific meanings of 'prior light history'. This term comprises the direct and indirect after-effects of light exposure in humans, such as the effects on cognitive performance in the evening dependent on precedent lighting conditions in the afternoon; or the greater alertness at night as a result of repeated light exposures with brighter lighting on the previous evenings. We demonstrated by means of very fast responses to different light stimuli in the evoked potentials of the EEG that different spectral compositions of light stimuli resulted in different neural activations. This could be of importance in situations which require very fast reaction times. In this interdisciplinary and partly new research field many exciting questions still remain unanswered. For example, what are the long-term consequences of (too) dim lighting conditions during daytime on our performance and health? This topic relates both to basic research as well as to practical applications, and there is certainly more work to do with strong impact on both fields. Two of the presented studies aimed to develop and validate chromatic pupillometry and its use for chronobiological questions.

40|$|Color {{perception}} depends profoundly on adaptation {{processes that}} adjust sensitivity {{in response to}} the prevailing pattern of stimulation. We examined how color sensitivity and appearance might be influenced by adaptation to the color distributions characteristic of natural images. Color distributions were measured for natural scenes by sampling an array of locations within each scene with a spectroradiometer, or by recording each scene with a digital camera successively through 31 interference filters. The images were used to reconstruct he L, M and S cone excitation at each spatial location, and the contrasts along three post-receptoral axes [L + M, L- M or S- (L + M) ]. Individual scenes varied substantially in their mean chromaticity and luminance, in the principal color-luminance axes of their distributions, and in the range of contrasts in their distributions. Chromatic contrasts were biased along a relatively narrow range of bluish to yellowish-green angles, lying roughly between the S- (L + M) axis (which was more characteristic of scenes with lush vegetation and little sky) and a unique blue-yellow axis (which was more typical of arid scenes). For many scenes L- M and S- (L + M) signals were highly correlated, with weaker correlations between luminance and chromaticity. We use a two-stage model (von Kries scaling followed by decorrelation) to show how the appearance of colors may be altered by light adaptation to the mean of the distributions and by contrast adaptation to the contrast range and principal axes of the distributions; and we show that such adjustments are qualitatively consistent with empirical measurements of asymmetric color matches obtained after adaptation to successive random samples drawn from natural distributions of chromaticities and lightnesses. Such adaptation effects define the natural range of operating states of the visual system. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd Color vision Color appearance Contrast adaptation Natural images Light <b>adaptation</b> <b>Chromatic</b> adaptatio...|$|R
