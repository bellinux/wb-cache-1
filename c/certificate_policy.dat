5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Tax <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policy</b> and the Distress Sale Policy incentives for encouraging diversity, the 1978 Broadcast Policy Statement authorized the use of comparative credit or favorable consideration for minority applicants. These comparative hearings would award merit to applicants poised {{to contribute to the}} Commission's goal of broadening ownership inclusion, and their aim for a [...] "diversity of viewpoints". Earning this favorable consideration meant that the applicant would be an active participant in the facilities daily operations, and serve a practicable purpose to the community in terms of content and viewpoints. Eventually the Distress Sale Policy was overturned in 1987 by a 2-1 vote within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and later, the Tax <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policy</b> was repealed by congress in 1995 with perceived abuses being the reason. [...] In the 1990's the court would eliminate policies that awarded extra credit using race and gender as a basis for consideration. This period saw a movement away from policies concerning the use of gender or racial factors in comparative hearings and employment practices, and the 1996 Telecommunications Act eliminated the comparative hearing process for renewal of broadcast licensing entirely.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{point of the}} <b>certificate</b> <b>policy</b> is {{the description of the}} authorized and prohibited certificate uses. When a certificate is issued, it can be stated in its attributes what use cases it is intended to fulfill. For example, a certificate can be issued for digital signature of e-mail (aka S/MIME), encryption of data, authentication (e.g. of a Web server, as when one uses HTTPS) or further issuance of certificates (delegation of authority). Prohibited uses are specified in the same way.|$|E

The NFC Forum Signature RTD <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policy</b> defines the policies under which certificate authorities can operate in the context of NFC. Root certificates are carried in verification devices and are not contained in the signature record. This separation is important for the security of the system just as web browser certificates are separated from web server certificates in TLS.|$|E

50|$|First, {{the program}} sought to stimulate {{diversity}} with the Tax <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policy.</b> This policy worked by awarding like-kind tax exchange breaks to licensees who sell their licenses to minorities. This was a two-year like-kind exchange, whereby the seller {{would not be}} required to pay taxes on money made by selling their license, as long as the capital gains are reinvested into a similar communication industry within two years of the sale. In addition the second program implemented through this statement was the Distress Sale Policy, which held that any license owners facing scrutiny by the FCC and potential license revocation, can sell their station to a minority buyer for 75% of the appraised value. The benefit of the Distress Sale Policy for licensees under investigation by the FCC, is that once they sell their license to a minority owner, the FCC would reward them by ceasing their inquiry into the licensee. The statement would also formalize the Comparative Hearing Process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Managing the {{security}} of complex cloud and networked computing environments requires crafting security policy—ranging from natural-language text to highly-structured configuration rules, sometimes multi-layered—specifying correct system behavior in an adversarial environment. Since environments change and evolve, managing security requires managing evolution of policies, which adds another layer, the change log. However, evolution increases complexity, and the more complex a policy, {{the harder it is}} to manage and update, and the more prone it is to be incorrect. This paper proposes hierarchical change mining, drawing upon the tools of software engineering and data mining, to help practitioners introduce fewer errors when they update policy. We discuss our approach and initial findings based on two longitudinal real-world datasets: low-level router configurations from Dartmouth College and high-level Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) <b>certificate</b> <b>policies</b> from the International Gri...|$|R

One of {{the main}} PKI {{problems}} is currently the lack of interoperability at international level, which is greatly dependent on the automation of the cross-certification procedure using <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policies</b> (CP). This paper addresses the above-mentioned need by presenting an XML-based tool for the automated development and comparison of CPs, with main emphasis on healthcare environments. The CP tool is developed in JAVA and is characterized as flexible, standards-based and extendable, since all data representation is in XML. The implementation follows a prototype CP content standardization for healthcare using RFC 2527 Standard, whereas the CP comparison algorithm {{is based on a}} multi-criteria decision support system. The final aim of the CP tool is to serve as a baseline for an on-line automated cross-certification service, thus enhancing PKI co-operation and interconnection for several business sectors. ...|$|R
