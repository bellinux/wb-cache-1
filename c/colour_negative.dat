2500|$|Much to {{the chagrin}} of Warner Bros., Russell decided to use a number of {{experimental}} cinematic techniques in the film. Handheld cameras and Steadicam shots were used to give the film a journalistic feel. Russell shot a majority of the film on Ektachrome transparency stock that was cross processed in <b>colour</b> <b>negative</b> chemicals, to reproduce [...] "the odd colour of the newspaper images [...]" [...] Though the process produced a unique quality and look to the film, it was exceedingly unreliable to develop, and many film labs would not provide insurance for the transparency stock if it did not develop properly. Russell feared that the scenes would need to be reshot until finally a lab was found that would develop the transparency stock in the negative chemicals. The opening was shot on conventional negative stock and bleach bypassed to give a deep black and high contrast look. Some interior shots were also filmed on conventional negative stock and processed normally. Russell also credited the realism of the firefights to the film's cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, who had shot several documentaries on South American civil wars, saying [...] "he knew {{what it was like to}} be in that kind of world." ...|$|E

This includes one {{scene of a}} scared scavenger stealing money from a dead milkman's satchel that was omitted from the broadcast version; this would have formed part of the deserted London montage. Black-and-white prints were used for practice by BBC film editors, in deciding where to make cuts, before cutting the master <b>colour</b> <b>negatives.</b> The surviving film recording of Episode 1 is the only telerecording of a Season 11 episode held in the archives; this is {{probably due to the}} long-standing practice within BBC Enterprises of making a film print for overseas sales purposes prior to wiping any master tape.

5000|$|The Time Leap series (Light Boxes, 2007-8, Stitched Photos, 2008 [...] ) {{represent}} a complex construction of different layers {{of time and}} subjectivity. It is the documentation of the artist’s efforts to displace records, deconstruct documents preserving personal memories, to rewrite the past, and, by doing so, change the present.In the case of Light Boxes the artist took colour shots of herself, and from the <b>colour</b> <b>negatives</b> she inserted her figure into old black-and-white negatives depicting her as a child. As a result, she appears twice {{in each of these}} negatives, in two different ages, then and now. She constructed an installation for these film negatives by making a wire frame and placing a mirror behind each negative at a 45-degree angle. This mirror reflects the light from a light-bulb fixed to the wall above the frame, and illuminates the scenes from behind, making the negative images visible.|$|R
40|$|In {{interviews}} and writings throughout his career, Andrei Tarkovsky repeatedly {{returned to the}} theme of cinematic colour. He referred to it in order to repudiate it: colour film was ‘monstrous’ and ‘false’, an artistic ‘blind alley’. Despite his objections, Tarkovsky also repeatedly struggled with the Soviet bureaucracy to secure the use of Eastman Kodak <b>colour</b> <b>negatives.</b> Having secured the use of colour, he then minimised its impact in his films through a combination of desaturated production design and laboratory techniques, and counterbalanced its presence with repeated transitions between colour and black-and-white sequences. This essay explores the contradictions in Tarkovsky’s response to colour. It roots his work in the stagnation-era political economy of the Soviet Union, before moving on to an exploration {{of the ways in which}} his chromatic ambivalence manifested itself in the aesthetics of his films. The essay concludes by suggesting a final contradiction, namely that Tarkovsky’s chromatic conservatism anticipated the colour aesthetics of digital cinema...|$|R

Rather than nominate a particular theme, the selection panel, drawn from PhtoForum's committee, and consisting of Mark Adams, Julie Downie, Tim Mackrell, Garry Sturgess and John B. Turner, put forward the names of more than 80 candidates to represent a diversity of approaches and experience, from which the final selection of 14 was reached by consensus [...] . Irrespective of content, technology has always affected the way photographs look and how they are received. This is one obvious thread in this selection, which includes pinhole contact prints from scanned <b>colour</b> <b>negatives</b> or tranparencies and b&w negatives, digital duratrans, and classic analogue b&w contact prints. In effect, this collection bridges the beginnings of photography in the early 19 th Century through to recent developments in the digital era. " extract from John B.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that for certain colour samples, the chromatic adaptation transform CAT 02 imbedded in the CIECAM 02 colour appearance model predicts corresponding <b>colours</b> with <b>negative</b> tristimulus values (TSVs), which can cause problems in certain applications. To overcome this problem, a mathematical approach is proposed for modifying CAT 02. This approach combines a non-negativity constraint for the TSVs of corresponding colours with the minimization of the colour differences between those values for the corresponding colours obtained by visual observations and the TSVs of the corresponding colours predicted by the model, which is a constrained non-linear optimization problem. By solving the non-linear optimization problem, a new matrix is found. The performance of the CAT 02 transform with various matrices including the original CAT 02 matrix, and the new matrix are tested using visual datasets and the optimum colours. Test results show that the CAT 02 with the new matrix predicted corresponding <b>colours</b> without <b>negative</b> TSVs for all optimum colours and the colour matching functions of the two CIE standard observers under the test illuminants considered. However, the accuracy with the new matrix for predicting the visual data is approximately 1 CIELAB colour difference unit worse compared with the original CAT 02. This indicates that accuracy has to be sacrificed to achieve the non-negativity constraint for the TSVs of the corresponding colours...|$|R

50|$|In <b>colour</b> <b>negative</b> films, {{there are}} 3 types of dye couplers. There are the normal cyan, magenta and yellow dye forming couplers, but also {{there is a}} magenta {{coloured}} cyan masking coupler and a yellow coloured magenta masking coupler. These form respectively normal cyan dye, and magenta dye, but form an orange positive mask to correct colour. In addition, {{there is a third}} type of coupler called a DIR (Developer Inhibitor Release) coupler. This coupler releases a powerful inhibitor during dye formation, which affects edge effects and causes effects between layers to enhance overall image quality.|$|E
50|$|In colour and {{chromogenic}} black-and-white photography, {{a similar}} development process is used {{except that the}} reduction of silver simultaneously oxidizes the paraphenylene colour developing agent which then takes part {{in the production of}} dye-stuffs in the emulsion by reacting with the appropriate couplers. There are three distinct processes used here. The C-41 process is used for almost all <b>colour</b> <b>negative</b> films and in this process dye couplers in the emulsion react with the oxidized colour developing agent in the developer solution to generate the visible dyes. An almost identical process is then used to produce colour prints from films. The developing agents used are derivates of paraphenylene diamine.|$|E

Our approach includes multi-channel spectral calculations and removes the need for 7 channel and 6 channel alpha colour operations. It provides a unified explanation of pre-multiplied and non pre-multiplied <b>colours,</b> including <b>negative</b> coordinates and infinite points in colour space.

40|$|Gender can {{influence}} the lateralization of emotional processing. Specifically, women exhibit more bilateral activation while men are more lateralized. This study sought to investigate the influence of gender on emotional processing. The lateralized Emotional Stroop Task was used to present 50 male and female participants with positive, negative, and neutral words in one of four different colours to the right visual field or the left visual field. Participants had to indicate the colour that each word was printed in. Participants were more accurate at indicating the <b>colour</b> of <b>negative</b> words relative to other words. There were no {{significant main effects for}} reaction time latencies. The results suggest that there are no laterality differences with respect to how men and women process emotional words.
