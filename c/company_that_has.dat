25|$|Ex-dividend date — the day {{on which}} shares bought and sold no longer come {{attached}} {{with the right to}} be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 trading days before the record date.

Existing holders of the stock will receive the dividend even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of the dividend.|$|E
