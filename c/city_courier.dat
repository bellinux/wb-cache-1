2500|$|In Europe, {{the bicycle}} {{had fallen out}} of favour as a means of {{delivery}} {{in the third quarter of}} the 20th century. [...] It was not until 1983 that bicycle messengers made their reappearance in Europe. [...] London's [...] "On Yer Bike" [...] and [...] "Pedal-Pushers" [...] were pioneers of pedal over petrol, and the rest of the <b>city's</b> <b>courier</b> companies followed suit. [...] By the late 1980s, cycle couriers were a common sight in central London and a British manufacturer named a range of mountain-bikes for them, the Muddy Fox 'Courier'. [...] Entrepreneurs in continental Europe, some inspired by seeing couriers in the U.S. or in London, began to offer bicycle courier services in the late 1980s, and by 1993 there were sufficiently large numbers of bicycle couriers in Northern Europe and North America that over 400 attended the inaugural Cycle Messenger Championships in Berlin, Germany. [...] Bicycle messengers have not become common in southern Europe, the heartland of world competitive cycling. There are very few bicycle couriers in Portugal, France, Spain, or Italy. Outside Europe and North America, there are now large bicycle messenger services in Japan, and also in New Zealand and Australia. More recently, several companies started offering bike messenger services in Central and South America, specifically in México City, México; San José, Costa Rica; Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|$|R

Although Harris re-centered the paper in its community roots, the content of the paper was not regulated to social gossip, and news was always the papers' main focus. The Courier would run until April 4, 1903, when the last issue of the newspaper was published.|$|E

5000|$|The Tampa Tribune was Tampa's longest-running newspaper, first {{published}} in 1895. The Tribune {{was one of several}} local daily newspapers serving Tampa in the early 20th century, but after buying the Tampa Times in 1958, it became Tampa's main morning daily for the next several decades. (The Tribune published the Tampa Times as an afternoon daily until 1982.) In more recent years, [...] "The Trib" [...] published a portfolio of standalone weekly newspapers throughout the region, many of which are still published by the Tampa Bay Times, including the Plant <b>City</b> <b>Courier</b> & Tribune, Brandon News & Tribune, South Shore News & Tribune, Northeast News & Tribune, Carrollwood News & Tribune, South Tampa News & Tribune, Northwest News & Tribune, Central Tampa News & Tribune, The Suncoast News, and the Spanish language CENTRO Tampa. Stiff competition with the St. Petersburg / Tampa Bay Times for subscribers and advertising revenue led to several changes of ownership and rounds of layoffs for the Tampa Tribune during the 2000s, and in May 2016, the Tampa Bay Times bought and folded its main competitor. The Times added some of the Tribune's reporters and columnists to its staff while laying off others as it consolidated operations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn <b>city</b> logistics, <b>courier</b> {{express and}} parcel {{services}} (CEP) deal with last mile deliveries {{in an urban}} environment. CEP route vehicles to deliver parcels to costumers distributed in the cities area. Customers expect fast and reliable services to reasonable prices. As a result, CEP have to plan and execute their routing efficiently. In a city logistic environment, CEP faces several challenges. Especially, travel times between customers are not deterministic but uncertain and differ during the day regarding traffic volumes and stochastic events like congestion. Further, city traffic flows are controlled by traffic control management (TM). TM decisions additionally impact travel times for CEP. This paper shows the impact of TM decisions to travel times and emphasizes the benefit of cooperational planning between CEP and TM...|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to prevent a gang of drug smugglers {{completing}} a delivery of heroin, by tracking down their cars and destroying them, or ramming them into submission. The player takes the role of a special agent driving the titular Lotus Esprit car, which had been used in a James Bond film a few years previously. The player must travel around one of four available cities looking for the criminals. Messages from HQ will flash up periodically giving the location of a target armoured car, which may then be tracked on the map. A courier car would then attempt to rendezvous with the armoured car to transfer the heroin, and the armoured car would then flee the <b>city.</b> Other <b>courier</b> cars would act as decoys.|$|R

40|$|Courier {{services}} form {{an important}} sector of urban freight traffic; {{leading to a}} daily volume of traffic that is problematic in economic and ecologic respects. New logistic concepts for reducing costs, distances and emis-sions could improve this situation by increased application of bicycle couriers and bundling of consignments. In this paper we summarise our previous work on the multi-agent-based simulation of alternative logistic con-cepts for <b>city</b> <b>courier</b> services. We discuss models of different organisation forms {{as well as the}} tools applied to their analysis. Since the logistic strategies analysed so far could not display the expected economic and ecologic benefits, a new concept named Fixed Exchange Points is presented that is closely related to actual work-sharing mechanisms of city couriers. We present a simulation model of this strategy and discuss first preliminary results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} part we provide {{a review of the}} rather young field of Environmental Informatics. We argue that Environmental Informatics methods and tools are {{powerful}} means in environmental information processing for supporting sustainable development. In the second part we introduce a case study dealing with sustainable logistic systems for <b>city</b> <b>courier</b> services based on agent-based simulation methodology. New logistic strategies together with an increased employment of bicycle couriers and bundling of consignments seem to be appropriate for reducing costs, transportation distances, and emissions. By means of this simulation model ecological, economic as well as social implications of two alternative logistic strategies have been analysed and evaluated. Promising results have been found in the study by introducing inner city interchange stations for bundling deliveries for the suburban areas. It turns out that agent-based simulation methodology is a powerful tool for modelling sustainable logistic systems in Environmental Informatics...|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of Oregon politics, the {{importance}} of developments {{in the early twentieth}} century have been largely overlooked by popular historians. As a result, many have lost the perspective of the sweeping reforms that reformers presented to Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s electorate. Another complicating factor is that voters dealing with the issues during the period had such disparaging attitudes towards some of the reforms, that no thought was given to preserving their memory for future generations. In addition, the personal papers of W. S. U 2 ̆ 7 Ren, Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s leading reformer, are not available. This makes perspective even more difficult. Therefore, the research problem is basically attempting to place all the proposed reforms in perspective with one another and arriving at an idea of exactly what the reformers had in mind. The data used for the thesis, W. S. U 2 ̆ 7 Ren and the Fight For Gov­ernment Reform and the Single Tax: 1908 - 1912, was found in the personal papers of George Chamberlain, in newspapers, pamphlets, other theses, and official Oregon State publications. George Chamberlain 2 ̆ 7 s papers are found in the Oregon Historical Society, and provide valuable in-sight into the election year of 1908. The use of newspapers presented a problem, because many of them were antagonistic toward U 2 ̆ 7 Ren 2 ̆ 7 s efforts. To balance the view, the Oregon <b>City</b> <b>Courier</b> was closely scrutinized because it was the most objective in dealing with reformer 2 ̆ 7 s proposals. Pamphlets were found in the Multnomah County Library, the Oregon Historical Society Library, and in the Oregon State Library. They provided insights into the thinking of both reformers and counter­-reformers. Both the pamphlets and the newspapers, especially the Courier, aided in sensing the mood of people. The Oregon Grange yielded information on the mood of farmers, an important part of the electorate, through records of state Grange sessions. The theses, found in the Oregon Historical Society, that contained interviews with people who worked with U 2 ̆ 7 Ren were the most valuable. Records of the legislature and the tax commission, found in the Oregon State Library, were of importance in gaining a view of the opposition to reform. W. S. U 2 ̆ 7 Ren presented reforms which, if carried out, would have greatly altered Oregon government and economy. In studying them, they appear to be workable, while placing more power in the hands of the people. Whether they actually would work is impossible to know. The study does point to a sweeping program that the reformers had in mind that would have given every individual the opportunity to develop to the highest possible point, while eliminating crime and poverty. The inference is given that if Oregon adopted all the tax and governmental reforms that the reformers presented, the entire nation would follow the example. At that time, there was a widespread belief that as Oregon went, so went the nation. Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s electorate only went part of the way with W. S. U 2 ̆ 7 Ren and his supporters. The greatest factor in this is that money and corruption persuaded Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s farmers that the reforms would make them slaves to the government. This was simply not the objective of the reformers. In fact, the opposite was true. They wanted to free farmers from control by business and government...|$|E
40|$|Combined with shared service {{points in}} prime {{locations}} {{the use of}} Light Electric Vehicles (LEV) can help optimize the cost expensive „last mile“ of parcel service. [1] At the same time, a shared service point enables the switch from diesel driven engines to muscle-powered electric driving in cities. It is known, that in <b>city</b> operating <b>courier</b> services up to 80 % of actual used diesel fuel can be substituted by muscle supported electric driving. [2] To cover the needs of global operating parcel services a muscle-power supported LEV must {{meet the requirements of}} ergonomics (regarding usability in the modes drive and delivery) and parcel security. To gain economic benefits the construction of LEV for parcel delivery should be flexible enough to meet specific needs in cities - like the topography of the roadways, daily amount of goods to deliver and the legal provision at the local situation. Production of LEV in small and medium enterprises will unlock a niche for first industrial uses of Natural Fiber Composites (NFC) in load-bearing structures. By pre-impregnation a replicable quality will bring the structural light-weight construction with NFC to new fields of use, as the construction of a LEV will demonstrate. At the end of its life cycle, the vehicle proves further economic and ecological benefits due to the use of NFC: A cost effective thermal conversion under a reduced release of fossil CO 2 is guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been much {{discussion}} around changing patterns of employment. An increasingly globalised economy: demands for a flexible labour force and the increase in part time employment: the shift from manufacturing to service industries: a time, some argue, of increasing individualisation and risk all contribute to a social and economic period being understood as the ‘new economy’. There has been a large body of work undertaken to study recent trends in employment in the new economy in certain sectors of the service industry. Call centres have been an area of increasing scrutiny, as have fast food outlets, notably McDonalds. Most of the literature on young adults concentrates on the transition from school to work. However other groups of workers, especially young workers - are largely absent from the literature. It is in this context that the study will be an analysis of a relatively new occupation serviced by relatively young adults, specifically in the 20 – 40 age bracket – bicycle couriers. Bicycle couriering has developed as a major part of messenger/parcel transportation in Britain, with firms operating in most major <b>cities.</b> Despite bicycle <b>couriering</b> being a legitimate service industry, those working as bicycle couriers contradict the image of traditional employment legitimacy. Bicycle messengers often operate outside of traditional formal employment. They rarely, if ever, have contracts; they have no pension, and are on low commission based pay. Risk of injury is a significant component of many occupations, but the question needs to be asked, what is it that makes bicycle couriering attractive to those that work in the industry when the pay and conditions are poor and the risk of injury high? Much of the literature concerning 'new economy' labour markets highlight features such as flexibility, lack of long term tenure and 'risk' as being indicative of a wholesale shift from one labour market paradigm to another. This paper uses the bicycle messenger industry to interrogate the 'new economy thesis'...|$|R
