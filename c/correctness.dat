5|$|Scores are {{calculated}} for individual translated segments—generally sentences—by comparing {{them with a}} set of good quality reference translations. Those scores are then averaged over the whole corpus to reach an estimate of the translation's overall quality. Intelligibility or grammatical <b>correctness</b> are not taken into account.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to the {{character}} varied, with some, including Spider-Man's creator, Stan Lee, approving {{the creation of a}} positive role model for non-white children, to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by political <b>correctness,</b> a charge Alonso denied. Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for {{the character}} to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which {{he argued that the}} language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming able to read the texts, and the <b>correctness</b> of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E
25|$|The Triggering: Has Political <b>Correctness</b> Gone Too Far? was {{an event}} {{hosted by the}} College Republicans Club of the University of Massachusetts Amherst on April 25, 2016, {{featuring}} former philosophy professor and host of The Factual Feminist YouTube series Christina Hoff Sommers, political commentator Steven Crowder and former Breitbart senior technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. The topic of discussion was the effect of political <b>correctness</b> on free speech, and whether political <b>correctness</b> culture has grown to be detrimental. Additional topics included social justice, feminism, trigger warnings, and microaggressions. Some students attending began protesting mid-event, accusing the panelists of hate speech and demanding that they leave campus.|$|E

25|$|To {{verify the}} <b>correctness</b> of an FFT implementation, {{rigorous}} guarantees {{can be obtained}} in O(NlogN) time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Ergün, 1995).|$|E
25|$|In series 1 of the British {{alternative}} {{comedy series}} Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, Hitler (played by Paul Putner) appears in black & white newsreel-style footage making {{a speech in}} which he sarcastically derides political <b>correctness.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} was reinvented {{several times and}} is due to Hans Boltz (1923), who used it for the inversion of geodetic matrices, and Tadeusz Banachiewicz (1937), who generalized it and proved its <b>correctness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 1901, the Powers {{refused to}} make any change to the island's status. Although this {{demonstrated}} the <b>correctness</b> of Venizelos' approach, something Prince George publicly admitted, it was the minister who endured attacks from the press.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if this is}} {{done with}} the benign {{intention}} to acknowledge some contributions, it is problematic since authors carry responsibility for <b>correctness</b> and thus {{need to have the}} opportunity to check the manuscript and possibly demand changes.|$|E
25|$|He also {{coined the}} term Regressive left to denote {{the section of the}} western left which, for the sake of {{political}} <b>correctness</b> and respect for other cultures, excuses, overlooks and sometimes passively encourages illiberal and bigoted ideas emerging from minority communities.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{position}} on homosexuality, many people of faith look to both sacred texts and tradition for guidance on this issue. However, the authority of various traditions or scriptural passages and the <b>correctness</b> of translations and interpretations are continually disputed.|$|E
25|$|Various {{transformation}} {{properties for}} ensuring OT system <b>correctness</b> have been identified. These properties {{can be maintained}} by either the transformation control algorithm or by the transformation functions. Different OT system designs have different division of responsibilities among these components. The specifications of these properties and preconditions of requiring them are given below.|$|E
25|$|William Burroughs {{said that}} the American {{revolution}} begins in books and music, and political operatives implement the changes after the fact. To this maybe we can add art. And Helnwein's art might {{have the capacity to}} instigate change by piercing the veil of political <b>correctness</b> to recapture the primitive gesture inherent in art.".|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is formal software verification, which uses mathematical proof techniques {{to show the}} absence of bugs. Researchers at NICTA and its spinout Open Kernel Labs have recently performed such a formal verification of , {{a member of the}} L4 microkernel family, proving functional <b>correctness</b> of the C implementation of the kernel.|$|E
25|$|BCLSs {{can provide}} expert witness {{testimony}} {{in matters of}} litigation, where survey or boundary determinations are in question. The BCLS and a land surveying firm authorized to practice under permit must assume full responsibility for the <b>correctness,</b> validity, and accuracy of their own surveys including raw data and field notes collected.|$|E
25|$|An {{early and}} {{important}} application of CSP was its use for specification and verification of {{elements of the}} INMOS T9000 Transputer, a complex superscalar pipelined processor designed to support large-scale multiprocessing. CSP was employed in verifying the <b>correctness</b> of both the processor pipeline, and the Virtual Channel Processor which managed off-chip communications for the processor.|$|E
25|$|Other criticisms {{include the}} publish or perish {{pressures}} creating trivial or junk research, a caste system treating those without tenure poorly, and indolence after having achieved tenure. The tenured faculty can resist necessary reforms by administrators who they generally outlast. The tenured faculty also usually can control appointments which contributes to political <b>correctness</b> and groupthink.|$|E
25|$|It's {{just too}} dreadful. While the book's {{storytelling}} virtues are enormous, you don't {{have to be}} a bluestocking of political <b>correctness</b> to find some of this fantasy anti-Arab, or anti-Eastern, or anti-Ottoman. With all its stereotypes, mostly played for belly laughs, there are moments you'd like to stuff this story back into its closet.|$|E
25|$|To some modern readers it {{can appear}} that some {{dynamical}} quantities recognised today {{were used in}} the Principia but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, Locke asked Huygens whether he could trust the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their <b>correctness.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the XOR metric is {{not needed}} to {{understand}} Kademlia, it is critical {{in the analysis of}} the protocol. The XOR arithmetic forms an abelian group allowing closed analysis. Other DHT protocols and algorithms require simulation or complicated formal analysis in order to predict network behavior and <b>correctness.</b> Using groups of bits as routing information also simplifies the algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Peter Jonathan Hitchens (born 28 October 1951) is an English {{journalist}} and author. He has published six books, including The Abolition of Britain, The Rage Against God, and The War We Never Fought. He {{is a frequent}} critic of political <b>correctness,</b> and describes himself as an Anglican Christian and Burkean conservative, {{as well as a}} social democrat.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{has also}} been cited many times by lower courts. At the appellate level, {{there have been several}} notable cases where it has {{factored}} into the analysis, sometimes helping to decide the case, and in others allowing judges to develop aspects of the holding in greater depth. Two cases concerned academic freedom and political <b>correctness.</b> Others involved same-sex marriage and satanic ritual abuse.|$|E
25|$|In {{concurrency}} control of databases, transaction processing (transaction management), and other transactional distributed applications, Global serializability (or Modular serializability) is a property {{of a global}} schedule of transactions. A global schedule is the unified schedule of all the individual database (and other transactional object) schedules in a multidatabase environment (e.g., federated database). Complying with global serializability means that the global schedule is serializable, has the serializability property, while each component database (module) has a serializable schedule as well. In other words, a collection of serializable components provides overall system serializability, which is usually incorrect. A need in <b>correctness</b> across databases in multidatabase systems makes global serializability a major goal for global {{concurrency control}} (or modular concurrency control). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), as well as increase in systems management sophistication, the need for atomic distributed transactions and thus effective global serializability techniques, to ensure <b>correctness</b> in and among distributed transactional applications, seems to increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{project is}} known for its developers' insistence on {{open-source}} code, good documentation, code <b>correctness,</b> and security. It has strict policies on licensing, preferring the ISC license and other variants of the Simplified BSD License. Many of its security features are optional or absent in other operating systems. Its developers frequently audit the source tree for software bugs and security holes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tool that}} generates full {{reaction}} networks from {{a set of}} rules is the Allosteric Network Compiler (ANC). Conceptually, ANC sees molecules as allosteric devices with a Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) type regulation mechanism, whose interactions are governed by their internal state, as well as by external modifications. A very useful feature of ANC is that it automatically computes dependent parameters, thereby imposing thermodynamic <b>correctness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some ethnonyms {{have been}} {{considered}} offensive, although not always by the group involved, but {{because they had been}} used by others or in the past in a derogatory sense and were therefore considered tainted, and requiring replacement for that reason. Examples are Gypsy, Negro, Vandal, Bushman, Philistinism. This change is not, however, a matter of anglicisation but of political <b>correctness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{declarative}} {{reading of}} logic {{programs can be}} used by a programmer to verify their <b>correctness.</b> Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques {{can also be used to}} transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.|$|E
25|$|While Robert Quigley did {{rear and}} educate David King on his Cumberland County, Pennsylvania farm, {{he did not}} adopt him, which is why David's last name stayed King. The Quigleys were devout members of the nearby Middle Spring Presbyterian Church. David King grew up, {{regularly}} attending that church, which began a strong tradition of religious <b>correctness</b> in the King family that beyond question made its way down to Ward.|$|E
