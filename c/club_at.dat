40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the reasons for {{participation}} in intercollegiate athletic <b>clubs</b> <b>at</b> university, through the use of text mining. A questionnaire survey was conducted among university freshmen (N= 1087). The questionnaire inquired about participation in athletic <b>clubs</b> <b>at</b> high school and at university, as well as the reasons for participation in intercollegiate athletic <b>clubs</b> <b>at</b> university. The results indicated that 35 % of university students participated in intercollegiate athletic clubs. Of the students who participated in high school clubs, 39 % did not participate in intercollegiate clubs. Words that appeared frequently in free descriptions regarding the reasons for participation in intercollegiate athletic <b>clubs</b> <b>at</b> university were analyzed using morphological analysis. Next, refined categories were analyzed using category web. The following discoveries were made: (1) attitudes toward sports, previous participation in high school athletic clubs, and health influenced the likelihood of participating in intercollegiate athletic <b>clubs</b> <b>at</b> university; (2) the lack of of participation in intercollegiate athletic <b>clubs</b> <b>at</b> university was dependent upon a variety of personal values and environmental factors...|$|R

5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel <b>Club</b> <b>at</b> the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel <b>Club</b> <b>at</b> the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel <b>Club</b> <b>at</b> a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E
