40|$|The {{parameters}} of the <b>chromate</b> <b>bath,</b> like temperature, pH, and fluoride content, strongly affect the morphology and chemical composition of the chromate conversion coating {{and as a consequence}} have a large influence on its corrosion performance. In this paper, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used in combination with other techniques to investigate the role played by the pH of the <b>chromate</b> <b>bath</b> on the properties of the chromate film formed on Alclad 2024 aluminium alloy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) have shown the formation of a thicker and less dense chromate layer when the pH of the <b>chromate</b> <b>bath</b> is changed from 2. 4 to 1. 2. The analysis of the EIS spectra have highlighted that this change in pH leads to the formation of more protective and more resistant chromate corrosion products (CCP) inside the defects of the chromate film. When a thin, dense and protective layer of CCP is formed in the defects, the corrosion behaviour of the chromate conversion coating improves for two main reason: (a) further attack of the defects is avoided or delayed; (b) the change in volume caused by the formation of the CCP is limited resulting in a low level of stress in the film, which as a consequence is not detached from the aluminium substrate...|$|E
40|$|Infrared and Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{were used}} to characterize a chromate conversion coating (CCC) on 2024 -T 3 alu-minum aircraft alloy with a long range objective of determining the anticorrosion mechanism of the CCC. Spectra were compared to those from synthetic mixed oxides of aluminum, Cr(III), and Cr(VI) made by treating pure reagents with NaOH. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectra of the CCC showed similar behavior to the chromium Ill/VI mixed oxide for both the initial materials and after heat-treatment. Analysis of the CCC and chromium mixed oxide by UV-vis spectroscopy indicated that both have a 3 : 1 ratio of Cr(III) to Cr(VI). When the chromium mixed oxide was im-mersed in pH 4 HNO 3, the ratio of released H to released Cr(VI) ranged from 0. 98 to 1. 07. In addition, a compound with a Raman spectrum {{very similar to that}} of a CCC was formed by a reaction of Cr(III) hydroxide with Cr 2 O 2, CrO 2, or the Alodine <b>chromating</b> <b>bath.</b> The results indicate a strong structural similarity between the Cr-mixed oxide and a major component of the CCC. A likely structure for this common material involves covalent bonding between polymeric Cr(III) hydroxide and Cr 202 or CrO. This mixed oxide structure may hydrolyze to release H and soluble chromate...|$|R
40|$|WO 200272924 A UPAB: 20030214 NOVELTY - Chroming {{apparatus}} comprises: (1) {{a working}} anode(s) for deposition; and (2) a separate oxidation anode(s), for oxidation of the Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, {{that is an}} electrode with a conductive diamond coating on a substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a chromating process, in which different anodes are used for deposition and oxidation of Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, in which the oxidation anode as above is used. USE - Used for regenerating solutions containing chromic acid by anodic oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) in electrolytic <b>chromating</b> <b>baths,</b> which are used for electroplating, chromation, etching e. g. acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastics and anodizing e. g. aluminum. ADVANTAGE - Chromium plating is normally carried out with lead anodes, which combine a double function, as counter-electrode (working electrode) and oxidation anode. In anodic operation, it becomes coated with lead dioxide. However, lead anodes form sludge and have limited dimensional stability. Various coated titanium anodes avoid this problem but have other drawbacks, including the need to add lead. The novel apparatus with the diamond-coated oxidation anode ensures effective oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) without costly maintenance procedures. The process is flexible and simple, even with complex geometries and structures, e. g. internal in plating of pipes and it eliminates the need to add lead and its associated drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{treatment}} of zinc galvanized steel {{is carried out}} usually using <b>chromate</b> based <b>baths.</b> These baths are used for improvement of the corrosion resistance and enhancement of the chemical adhesion of organic coatings. Anticorrosive effects of the chromium conversion coatings were not completely exceeded yet by another kind of passivation. Toxicity of CrVI is a basic problem of chromate conversion coats. This paper presents the main results and conclusions of experimental study on zinc conversion layers based on vanadates, using a good CrVI bath as reference. Anticorrosive mechanisms were compared by the corrosion tests in saline cabinet. Inhibition effects were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, by X-ray dispersive spectrometry (EDS) associated X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy...|$|R
