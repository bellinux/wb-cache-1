5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It was the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve.

Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E

Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E
