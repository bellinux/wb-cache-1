Magnetic actuation in LTCC and Kapton system was demonstrated successfully with a permanent magnet cantilever beam actuator. A permanent magnet attached to a Kapton beam was deflected with the magnetic field produced by electromagnetic coils fabricated on LTCC. A permalloy beam was also actuated using the same coils on LTCC. Magnetically actuated diaphragm pump was successfully fabricated, tested, and analyzed. Three pump designs were considered.

50|$|An obvious {{solution}} to this problem is to bend the solenoid around into a circle, forming a torus (a ring or donut). In this case the particles will still be confined {{to the middle of the}} cylinder, and even if they move along it they would never exit the ends - they would circle the apparatus endlessly. However, Fermi noted a problem with this arrangement; consider a series of <b>circular</b> <b>magnets</b> with the toroidal confinement area threaded through their centers, the magnets will be closer together on the inside of the ring, with a stronger field.

Selection of a particular bit was the same as in core, with one X and Y line being powered, generating a field at 45 degrees.

The numerical optimization technique uses the positions and/or orientations of the field generating elements as parameters (currents or permanent magnets). The technique has proved to be very effective in obtaining a good uniformity of field in a large fraction of the magnet volume. It should reduce the subsequent shimming operations.

40|$|Abstract. Strong magnets, such as neodymium-iron-boron magnets, are {{increasingly}} being manufactured as spheres. Because of their dipolar characters, these spheres can easily be arranged into long chains that exhibit mechanical properties reminiscent of elastic strings or rods. While simple formulations exist for the energy of a deformed elastic rod, {{it is not clear}} whether or not they are also appropriate for a chain of spherical magnets. In this paper, we use discrete-to-continuum asymptotic analysis to derive a continuum model for the energy of a deformed chain of magnets based on the magnetostatic interactions between individual spheres. We find that the mechanical properties of a chain of magnets differ significantly from those of an elastic rod: while both magnetic chains and elastic rods support bending by change of local curvature, nonlocal interaction terms also appear in the energy formulation for a magnetic chain. This continuum model for the energy of a chain of magnets is used to analyse small deformations of a <b>circular</b> ring of <b>magnets</b> and hence obtain theoretical predictions for the vibrational modes of a <b>circular</b> ring of <b>magnets.</b> Surprisingly, despite the contribution of nonlocal energy terms, we find that the vibrations of a <b>circular</b> ring of <b>magnets</b> are governed by the same equation that governs the vibrations of a circular elastic ring...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- It can be {{demonstrated}} experimentally that interaction between magnetostatic fields for which both poles geometrically coincide obeys the inverse cube law of attraction and repulsion with distance (far fields interaction law) which proves by similarity that localized (in the sense of behaving {{as if they were}} point-like) electromagnetic elementary particles must obey the same interaction law since both of their own magnetic poles have to coincide with each other by structure, given their pointlike behaviour. 2) As a corollary, and contrary to electric dipoles whose two aspects (opposite sign charges) can be separated in space and observed separately, it can also {{be demonstrated}} that both aspects of magnetic dipoles whose poles coincide can be separated only in time, which characteristic highlights the fact that point-like behaving scatterable elementary electromagnetic particles can magnetically interact only as if they were physical magnetic monopoles at any given moment. 3) The related cyclic polarity reversal of the magnetic aspect of elementary electromagnetic particles such as electrons, quarks up and quarks down and of their carrying energy brings a new and very interesting explanation to the reason why electrons cannot crash on their own onto nuclei despite electrostatic attraction by demonstrating that magnetic interaction between nuclei and electronic escort can only be repulsive.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a new levitation technique, {{which uses a}} small superconductor {{and a set of}} permanent magnets. In the system, a small superconductor is connected {{to the bottom of the}} vertical shaft. The gravity force and axial vibration force are supported by the superconductor. A <b>circular</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> is attched to the top of the shaft, and the other <b>circular</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> lies at the frame. The N-pole of one of the magnets faces to the S-pole of the other magnet, so a drag force acts between the magnets. The drag force is unstable in the axial direction, but the pinning force in the axial direction of the superconductor makes it stable. There is a restoring force in the horizontal direction between two permanent magnets, and in addition, there is a pinning force of the superconductor, so that both ends of the shaft are stable in the horizontal direction. This implies that the levitated shaft is stable without control. In general, controls have to be made in either axial or horizontal direction when the ordinary magnets are used. The levitation technique presented in this paper has advantages, Because, in order to have stable levitation, only one small superconductor is required, and a cooling system is simple.

A small <b>circular</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> with a diameter of 3 mm is used to control the size of the ferrofluid droplets within a microfluidic device. In the absence of a magnetic field, the size of the ferrofluid droplets decreases linearly with the increase of the flow rate of the continuous phase. In the presence of a magnetic field, the size of the droplets depends on the magnetic field strength, magnetic field gradient and the magnetization of the ferrofluid. The magnetic field strength is adjusted in our experiment by the location of the magnet. The induced attractive magnetic force affects the droplet formation process leading to the change in the size of the formed droplets.

40|$|The {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines with fractional slot and concentrated winding configuration have been steadily gaining traction in various applications in recent times. This is mainly driven by several advantages offered by this configuration such as high-torque density, outstanding efficiency, and easy and low-cost fabrication. The {{main focus of}} this thesis {{is dedicated to the}} investigation of three main topologies of fractional-slot and concentratedwinding {{permanent magnet}} synchronous machines specifically suited for particular applications. Additionally, the cogging torque and torque ripple reduction technique based on a novel axial pole pairing scheme in two different radial-flux permanent magnet synchronous machines with fractional-slot and concentratedwinding configuration are investigated. First, an axial flux permanent magnet segmented-armature-torus machine with laminated stator is proposed for in-wheel direct drive application. Both simplified analytical method and three-dimensional finite element analysis model accounting for anisotropic property of lamination are developed to analyze the machine performance. The predicted and experimental results are in good agreement and indicate that the proposed machine could deliver exciting and excellent performance. The impact of magnet segmentation on magnet eddy current losses in the prototype is carried out by the proposed three-dimensional finite element analysis model. The results show that the eddy current losses in the magnet could be effectively reduced by either circumferentially or radially segmenting the magnets. Furthermore, a magnet shaping scheme is employed and investigated to reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple of the prototype. This is validated using the three-dimensional finite element analysis model as well. Second, a coreless axial flux permanent <b>magnet</b> machine with <b>circular</b> <b>magnets</b> and coils is proposed as a generator for man-portable power platform. Approximate analytical and three-dimensional finite element analysis models are developed to analyze and optimize the electromagnetic performance of the machine. Comprehensive mechanical stress analysis has been carried out by threedimensional structural finite element analysis, which would ensure the rotor integrity at expected high rotational speed. The results from both three-dimensional finite element analysis and experiments have validated that the proposed prototype is a compact and efficient high speed generator with very simple and robust structure. Additionally, this structure offers simplified assembly and manufacturing processes utilizing off-the-shelf magnets. Third, a novel radial flux outer rotor permanent magnet flux switching machine is proposed for urban electric vehicle propulsion. Initial design based on the analytical sizing equations would lead to severe saturation and excessive magnet volumes in the machine and subsequently poor efficiency. An improved design is accomplished by optimizing the geometric parameters, which can significantly improve the machine efficiency and effectively reduce the overall magnet volumes. Magnet segmentations can be employed to further improve the machine performance. Finally, a novel axial pole pairing technique is proposed to reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple in radial flux fractional-slot and concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machines. The implementation of the technique in outer rotor surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine shows that the cogging torque and torque ripple can be reduced very effectively with different magnet pairs. However, careful pair selection is of particular importance for compromise between cogging torque and torque ripple minimizations during the machine design stage. This technique is also employed to minimize the cogging torque in a permanent magnet flux switching integrated-stator-generator and it is compared with rotor step skewed technique. The estimated and experimental results show that the axial pole pairing technique can not mitigate the torque ripple of the machine as effectively as rotor step skewed approach although both the techniques could reduce the cogging torque to the same level...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{arrangement}} of several spherical or cylindrical magnets presents different stable configurations. One {{of them is}} the straight chain, whose dynamics is studied in the present work. This structure behaves similarly to a beam, but here the rigidity is exclusively due to magnetic forces. Theoretically, the dynamical equations of the structure are obtained by first providing an expression of the energies involved in the system. At this stage, the magnetic interactions are either modelized by considering dipoles approximations for the magnets or by computing numerically the magnetic field around the magnets. Conditions of contact are introduced in the model thanks to Lagrange multipliers and a dynamical system governing the displacement of each magnet is finally obtained. An analogy with the eigenfrequencies of elastic beams allows to provide a model of an equivalent flexural rigidity induced by magnetic forces. Good agreement is found with the equivalent rigidity obtained for <b>circular</b> rings of <b>magnets.</b> An experimental study of rigid assembly composed with neodymium permanent magnets is also performed.

According to experimental results, the device could generate powers up to 17. 2 W. On the other hand, the maximum reclaimable power was obtained as 25. 7 W from COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2 simulations. Promising energy harvesting results imply that the output from this device {{could be used as a}} power source in many applications such as in lighting and GPS (Global positioning system) devices. In the second part of the thesis, a miniature system was used for flow boiling in mini/microtubes. Flow boiling was investigated with surface enhancements provided by crosslinked polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (pHEMA) coatings, which were used as a crosslinker coating type with different thicknesses (~ 50 nm, 100 nm and 150 nm) on inner microtube walls. Flow boiling heat transfer experiments were conducted on microtubes (with inner diameters of 249 μm, 507 μm and 908 μm) coated with crosslinked pHEMA coatings. pHEMA nanofilms were deposited with the initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) technique. De-ionized water was utilized as the working fluid. Experimental results obtained from coated microtubes were compared to their plain surface counterparts at two different mass fluxes (5, 000 kg/m 2 s and 20, 000 kg/m 2 s), and significant enhancements in Critical Heat Flux (up to 29. 7 %) and boiling heat transfer (up to 126. 2 %) were attained. The enhancement of boiling heat transfer was attributed to the increase in nucleation site density and incidence of bubbles departing from surface due to porous structure of crosslinked pHEMA coatings. The underlying mechanism was explained with suction-evaporation mode. Moreover, thicker pHEMA coatings resulted in larger enhancements in both CHF and boiling heat transfer. In the third part, a platform for gene delivery via magnetic actuation of nanoparticles was developed. The importance of high transfection efficiency has been emphasized in many studies investigating methods to improve gene delivery. Accordingly, non-viral transfection agents are widely used as transfection vectors to condense oligonucleotides, DNA, RNA, siRNA, deliver into the cell, and release the cargo. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is one of the most popular non-viral transfection agents. However, the challenge between high transfection efficiency and toxicity of the polymers is not totally resolved. The delivery of necessary drugs and genes for patients and their transport under safe conditions require carefully designed and controlled delivery systems and constitute a critical stage of patients’ treatment. Compact systems are considered as the strongest candidate for the preparation and delivery of drugs and genes under leak free and safe conditions because of their low energy consumption, low waste disposal, parallel and fast processing capabilities, removal of human factor, high mixing capabilities, enhanced safety, and low amount of reagents. Motivated by this need in the literature, The use of PEI-SPION (Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) as transfection agents in in-vitro studies was investigated with the effect of varying magnetic fields provided by a special magnetic system design, which was used as a miniature magnetic actuator device offering different magnet's turn speeds in the system.
