5|$|Queen <b>conch</b> shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used <b>conch</b> shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen <b>conch</b> shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used <b>conch</b> shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen <b>conch</b> as a food source.|$|E
5|$|The queen <b>conch</b> {{fishery is}} usually managed under the {{regulations}} of individual nations. In the United States all taking of queen <b>conch</b> is prohibited in Florida and in adjacent Federal waters. No international regional fishery management organization exists {{for the whole}} Caribbean area, but {{in places such as}} Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, queen <b>conch</b> is regulated {{under the auspices of the}} Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC). In 2014, the Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) included queen <b>conch</b> in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol). Species included in the Annex III require special measures to be taken to ensure their protection and recovery, and their use is authorised and regulated accordingly.|$|E
5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (in this case, the queen <b>conch).</b> Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} commensal and a small cardinalfish, known as the <b>conch</b> fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
50|$|While most <b>conches</b> are {{batch process}} machines, {{continuous}} flow <b>conches</b> separate the stages with weirs {{over which the}} product travels through separate parts of the machine. A continuous conche can reduce the <b>conching</b> time for milk chocolate to as little as four hours.|$|R

2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{process is}} called <b>conching.</b> A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass {{is kept in}} a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to <b>conching</b> has an uneven and gritty texture. The <b>conching</b> process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the <b>conching</b> process determines the final smoothness {{and quality of the}} chocolate. High-quality chocolate is <b>conched</b> for about 72hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about [...] until final processing.|$|R
5|$|Brought by explorers, queen <b>conch</b> shells {{quickly became}} a popular asset in early modern Europe. In the late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, queen <b>conch</b> shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as doorstops or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen <b>conch</b> shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider <b>conch</b> (Harpago chiragra) and queen <b>conch</b> (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen <b>conch).</b>|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas is a prey {{species for}} several {{carnivorous}} gastropod mollusks, including the apple murex Phyllonotus pomum, the horse <b>conch</b> Pleuroploca gigantea, the lamp shell Turbinella angulata, the moon snails Natica spp. and Polinices spp., the muricid snail Murex margaritensis, the trumpet triton Charonia variegata and the tulip snail Fasciolaria tulipa. Crustaceans are also <b>conch</b> predators, {{such as the}} blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the box crab Calappa gallus, the giant hermit crab Petrochirus diogenes, the spiny lobster Panulirus argus and others. Sea stars, vertebrates, including fish (such as the permit Trachinotus falcatus and the porcupine fish Diodon hystrix), loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and humans also dine on the queen <b>conch.</b>|$|E

40|$|Chocolate is {{a highly}} {{processed}} cocoa product known to be rich in flavonoids, compounds which have been long associated to both healthy and sensory properties. A multi-step process involving cocoa beans fermentation, drying, roasting, nib-grinding and refining, <b>conching</b> and tempering is implied {{in the production of}} chocolate. To our knowledge, scarce {{attention has been paid to}} the effect of <b>conching</b> on the procyanidins profile, on their polymerisation from monomers up to oligomers and polymers, as well as on the in vitro functional properties such as antiradical activity and reducing power. Two <b>conching</b> processes, characterized by different time/temperature combinations, a Long Time <b>Conching</b> (LTC) and a Short Time <b>Conching</b> (STC), were thus taken studied and the effect on flavan- 3 -ols monomers, on the degree of polymerization and on the in vitro functional properties of dark chocolates was studied. Procyanidin content was determined by HPLC analysis, while the total polyphenol index (TPI), the antiradical activity as well as the reducing power were evaluated by the reaction with the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, the decolorization assays of the ABTS radical (TEAC) and the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) methods, respectively. The procyanidins content and profile were deeply affected by the different processing conditions: at the end of <b>conching</b> the STC-samples were characterized by a higher amount of monomers, compared to the LTC-ones which, in turn, resulted more polymerised as confirmed by the presence of P 10 polymers. Both STC- and LTC <b>conched</b> products presented comparable TPI and FRAP values but products collected at different steps during the <b>conching</b> process, and in particular during LTC, showed a significant improvement of the radical scavenging properties. This result suggest the possibility to modulate the <b>conching</b> process in terms of time and temperature combination in order to improve the antioxidant activity of the final products.

5|$|The dog <b>conch</b> {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and {{seagrass}} beds on insular and continental shores. It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although {{this is not an}} absolute rule. L.canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses (with a predominance of Halophila), and also prefers sediment with high levels of organic matter. This <b>conch</b> avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog <b>conch</b> can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water to a depth of 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen <b>conch</b> is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen <b>conch</b> lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the suitability of Stephan mixer for use as conche during small-scale chocolate production {{in an attempt to}} reduce cost and processing time. Molten chocolate was processed using the Stephan mixer under different temperature and time combinations and Buhler Elk’Olino conche (as reference), and the flow properties (Casson plastic viscosity, Casson yield stress and thixotropy) were studied using a shear-rate-controlled rheometer. Optimum settings of 65 °C for 10 min at 443 g dry <b>conching</b> followed by 50 °C for 15 min at 443 g wet <b>conching</b> in the Stephan mixer resulted in similar flow properties as the reference sample. Increasing the blade rotary speed for both dry and wet <b>conching</b> resulted in a decrease in flow properties. The Stephan mixer proved to be suitable for <b>conching</b> small-scale (approximately 1 kg) chocolate productions and could be explored as a fast and cost-effective method for smallscale chocolate <b>conching</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|Alkalization is an {{addition}} of alkali into cocoa mass to improve product quality {{in terms of}} flavour and colour appearance. Sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate are usual to be added into cocoa cotyledon prior to roasting. A study {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the effects of alkalization proceeded upon <b>conching</b> on chocolate sensory properties, hardness and colour. Re sponse Surface Methodology design at alkali concentrations of 1 — 15 g kg - 1 and <b>conching</b> temperature of 40 — 80 oC have been used in the study. Parameters evaluated were sensory properties, particle size, hardness and colour. Results of the study showed that alkali concentration significantly influenced aroma, overall preference, particle size and hardness; meanwhile, <b>conching</b> temperature showed significant influence on aroma, taste, appearance, overall preference and texture of chocolate. Alkali concentration and <b>conching</b> temperature showed interactively influence on aroma and overall preference. A good quality of chocolate could be found at the alkali concentration of 8 — 15 g kg - 1 and <b>conching</b> temperature of 74 — 80 oC.

Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools.
