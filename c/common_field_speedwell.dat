Some of the more common ones are: white clover, common spotted orchid, selfheal, sheep’s sorrel, herb robert, bugle, agrimony, bee orchid, {{perforate}} St John’s wort, <b>common</b> <b>field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> bird's foot trefoil and, perhaps, most notable of all, buttercups (the Forest has perhaps the most extensive fields of buttercups in England during late May and early June). In addition over 600 species of fungi can be seen.|$|E
50|$|Veronica persica (common names: birdeye speedwell, common field-speedwell, Persian <b>speedwell,</b> large <b>field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> bird's-eye, or winter speedwell) (سیزاب ایرانی) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is native to Eurasia and is widespread as an introduced species in the British Isles (where it was first recorded in 1825), North America, and eastern Asia, including Japan and Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{diversity}} of plants, especially in the meadow area.

Some of these have been introduced, others found their own way here.|$|R
50|$|Veronica polita or Grey Field-speedwell is a {{herbaceous}} {{flowering plant}} {{species in the}} plantain family Plantaginaceae. It has hairy stems, is either prostrate or ascending, with dark green leaves that are one of petiolate, crenate, toothed, rounded, or oval. All flowers are small and bright blue. The plant has solitary axillary peduncles that are shorter or slightly longer than the leaves. It grows in many different continents of the world, including Europe, especially France, western Asia, northern Africa, and North America. Common names include enough chickweed, <b>field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> and yerba gallinera.|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} weed species were grown in all {{combinations}} with four crop species (wheat, barley, bean and oilseed rape) {{under field conditions}} of 1990 - 91. The weeds were ranked {{on the basis of}} their competitive abilities. The degree to which competitive ability was specific to particular combination of crops and weed species was examined. Two indices-crop equivalent and aggressivity were compared to measure the competitive ability of the weeds. Based on aggressivity the ranking order of the weeds for their competitive abilities was, cleavers (Galium aparine L.) > wild oats (Avena fatua L.) > <b>field</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica persica Poir.) > common chickweed (Stellaria media L. Cyrill.) > scented mayweed (Matricaria recutita). The ranking of the weeds varied depending on the associated crop and at different growth stages. There was a poor correlation between crop equivalent and aggressivity...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainty-based multi camera {{calibration}} from relative poses can basically {{be applied}} to multi camera systems in which some camera pairs {{do not have a}} <b>common</b> <b>field</b> of view. However, there are limitations to this method. In practice, the uncertainty measures are not perfect and sometimes fail to assign a high uncertainty to invalid relative pose estimates. We hence suggest using a specialized measure to remove camera pairs without a <b>common</b> <b>field</b> of view before calibrating. Furthermore, in case of an ad hoc camera network placed in two or more separate rooms, we first have to separate the cameras before we can calibrate. We use <b>common</b> <b>field</b> of view detection for this task and show that the <b>common</b> <b>field</b> of view threshold can be automatically determined if the number of rooms is known. In quantitative experiments, we show that <b>common</b> <b>field</b> of view detection improves the multi camera calibration and that separating cameras into rooms works well. ...|$|R

(7) We know {{so little}} about land tenure in Homeric times--and, indeed, early land tenure is a subject so complex and obscure {{that it is not}} easy to prove advance towards {{separate}} property in the Odyssey--beyond what was the rule in the time of the ILIAD. In the Making of the Arms (XVIII. 541-549) we find many men ploughing a field, and this may have been a <b>common</b> <b>field.</b> But in what sense? Many ploughs were at work at once on a Scottish runrig field, and each farmer had his own strip on several <b>common</b> <b>fields,</b> but each farmer held by rent, or by rent and services, from the laird. These <b>common</b> <b>fields</b> were not <b>common</b> property. In XII. 422 we have [...] "a common field," [...] and men measuring a strip and quarrelling about the marking-stones, across the [...] "baulk," [...] but it does not follow that they are owners; they may be tenants. Such quarrels were common in Scotland when the runrig system of <b>common</b> <b>fields,</b> each man with his strip, prevailed.
