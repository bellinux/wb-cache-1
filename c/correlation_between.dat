This result was explained by a negative <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> hair length and age.|$|E

Previous research generally finds small or negative <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> real {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) and GDP deflator shocks but positive <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> industrial production (IP) and consumer price index (CPI) shocks at short forecast horizons.

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first {{measurements}} of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due to random motions, but later Hubble discovered a rough <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism for producing redshifts seen in certain cosmological solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity. Hubble's law of the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> redshifts and distances is required by all such models that have a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the cosmological redshift.|$|E

We show that there are quantum <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> the outcomes of sequential measurements which cannot be attained with spatially separated systems. We present examples of <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> spatially separated systems whose quantum maximum tends to the sequential maximum as the number of parties increases and examples of <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> spatially separated systems whose quantum maximum fails to violate the noncontextual bound while its corresponding sequential version does.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intensity}} interferometry (HBT), which are mainly {{reflected by the}} measured momentum correlations, have been fully discussed since 1950 's. The analogous momentum <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> identical fermions are however less argued. Besides the fermion statistics, the momentum <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> identical fermions are also determined by some other aspects, such as coulomb interaction, spin interactions and resonances formation. In this paper, we discussed {{the factors that influence}} the momentum <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> Λ's, especially spin interaction. It is also argued that the momentum <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> Λ's are affected significantly by the yield ratio of Σ^ 0 /Λ, due to the limitation of experimental measurement. The mixture of Σ^ 0 's and Λs would significantly weaken the measured two-particle momentum correlations of Λ's. Comment: 4 page...|$|R
