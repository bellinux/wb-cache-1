25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{banned the}} sale of <b>cyclamate</b> in 1969 after lab tests in rats {{involving}} a 10:1 mixture of <b>cyclamate</b> and saccharin that at levels comparable to humans ingesting 550 cans of diet soda per day, caused bladder cancer, a disease to which rats are particularly susceptible. Cyclamates are still used as sweeteners {{in many parts of}} the world, including Europe (e.g. UK and Russia).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclamate</b> is an {{artificial}} sweetener 30–50 times sweeter than sugar, {{making it the}} least potent of the commercially used artificial sweeteners. It was invented in 1937 by graduate student Michael Sveda at the University of Illinois.|$|E
500|$|During 1965 and 1966, Cade, {{together}} with his team of research doctors Dana Shires, James Free, and Alejandro M. de Quesada, {{conducted a series of}} trial-and-error experiments with his glucose-and-electrolytes rehydration drink on members of the Gators football team of coach Ray Graves, first with members of the freshman squad, and after initially promising results, with starting members of the varsity team. [...] "It didn't taste like Gatorade," [...] Cade said in a 1988 interview with Florida Trend magazine. In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste. Dana Shires remembered that [...] "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner." [...] To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade's wife, the researchers added lemon juice and <b>cyclamate</b> to the original formula of water, salt, sodium citrate, fructose and monopotassium phosphate.|$|E
50|$|The first {{artificial}} sweeteners used in diet {{soft drinks}} were <b>cyclamates</b> (often synergistically with saccharin). While many say these cyclamate-sweetened beverages {{had a more}} pleasant taste than the diet drinks that followed them, the Food and Drug Administration banned <b>cyclamates</b> in the United States in 1970 on evidence that they caused cancer in lab rats. <b>Cyclamates</b> are still used in many countries outside of the United States.|$|R
50|$|In other {{countries}} in which <b>cyclamates</b> are not banned (as {{they were in the}} US in 1970), Diet Coke or Coca-Cola light may be sweetened with a blend containing <b>cyclamates,</b> aspartame, and acesulfame potassium.|$|R
5000|$|Funny Face, (primarily {{marketed to}} children) a Pillsbury product {{originally}} sweetened with <b>cyclamates,</b> then with saccharin, then sold as an unsweetened mix.|$|R
2500|$|When {{sweeteners}} {{are provided}} for restaurant customers {{to add to}} beverages such as tea and coffee themselves, they are often available in paper packets which can be torn and emptied. [...] In North America, the colors are typically white for sucrose, blue for aspartame, pink for saccharin, yellow for sucralose (United States) or <b>cyclamate</b> (Canada), tan for turbinado, orange for monk fruit extract, and green for stevia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and sucralose (e.g., Splenda, Altern). Maltitol and sorbitol are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in {{foods such as}} [...] "no sugar added" [...] ice cream. Erythritol is gaining momentum {{as a replacement for}} these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries, xylitol, <b>cyclamate,</b> and the herbal sweetener stevia are used extensively.|$|E
2500|$|Sucralose {{is found}} in many food and {{beverage}} products, used {{because it is a}} no-calorie sweetener, does not promote dental cavities, is as safe for consumption by diabetics and nondiabetics, and does not affect insulin levels, although the sucralose-based sweetener product Splenda contains 95% (by volume) bulking agents dextrose and maltodextrin that do affect insulin levels. Sucralose is used as a replacement for, or in combination with, other artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium or high-fructose corn syrup. Sucralose is used in products such as candy, breakfast bars and soft drinks. [...] It is also used in canned fruits wherein water and sucralose take the place of much higher calorie corn syrup-based additives. Sucralose mixed with maltodextrin or dextrose (both made from corn) as bulking agents is sold internationally by McNeil Nutritionals under the Splenda brand name. In the United States and Canada, this blend is increasingly found in restaurants, in yellow packets, in contrast to the blue packets commonly used by aspartame and the pink packets used by those containing saccharin sweeteners; in Canada, though, yellow packets are also associated with the SugarTwin brand of <b>cyclamate</b> sweetener.|$|E
50|$|The product's {{ingredients}} {{changed over}} time and as various artificial sweeteners were banned by the FDA. At various times it was sweetened with <b>cyclamates</b> and saccharin. At one point the directions instructed children to add sugar and ice. In the early seventies, the manufacturer finally concluded {{that it would not}} be able to make a version that was both legal and sufficiently palatable to be profitable, and so discontinued the product.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{introduction}} in 1966, Fresca {{has been}} marketed in the United States as a calorie-free, lime and grapefruit-flavored soft drink. Fresca has undergone several major ingredient changes since its introduction. It was originally sweetened with <b>cyclamates,</b> which were {{banned by the}} FDA in 1969, and replaced with saccharin. That was replaced by NutraSweet-brand aspartame. Around {{the time of the}} 2005 redesign, acesulfame potassium was added as a secondary sweetener.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{apparent}} specific volume (ASV) {{for a series}} of alternative sweeteners (<b>cyclamates,</b> sulfamates, saccharins, acesulfames and anilinomethanesulfonates) have been made. Taste data have been obtained for many of the new compounds unless the toxicity of the associated metals precluded this. Apparent molar volume (AMV), isentropic specific (IASC) and isentropic molar (IAMC) compressibilities were also measured. Sixteen metallic <b>cyclamates</b> cyc-C 6 H 11 NHSO 3 M and two phenylsulfamates ArNHSO 3 Na, namely 3. 5 -dimethyl- and 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylsulfamates have been examined. When the ASVs for these are combined with those for 15 aliphatic, aromatic and alicyclic sulfamates from a previous study, many of the values are seen to fall into the region that was previously identified as being the "sweet area", i. e. the ASVs lay between similar to 0. 5 and similar to 0. 7 (a few sweet compounds fall below this range and it is suggested that it could be extended slightly to accommodate these). Interestingly, the anilinomethanesulfonates, ArNHCH 2 SO 3 Na (Ar = C 6 H 5 -, 3 -MeC 6 H 4 - and 3 -ClC 6 H 4 -) lie clearly in the sweet region but only one of them shows slight sweetness showing that the molecular structural change made (compared with the 'parent' sulfamate-NHSO 3 -) cannot be accommodated at the receptor site.

50|$|Sales {{continued}} to expand, and in 1969, {{annual sales of}} <b>cyclamate</b> had reached $1 billion, which increased pressure from public safety watchdogs to restrict the usage of <b>cyclamate.</b> In October 1969, Department of Health, Education & Welfare Secretary Robert Finch, bypassing Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Herbert L. Ley, Jr., removed the GRAS designation from <b>cyclamate</b> and banned its use in general-purpose foods, though it remained available for restricted use in dietary products with additional labeling; in October 1970, the FDA, under a new Commissioner, banned <b>cyclamate</b> completely from all food and drug products in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{patent for}} <b>cyclamate</b> was {{purchased}} by DuPont but later sold to Abbott Laboratories, which undertook the necessary studies and submitted a New Drug Application in 1950. Abbott intended to use <b>cyclamate</b> to mask the bitterness of certain drugs such as antibiotics and pentobarbital. In 1958, it was designated GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the United States Food and Drug Administration. <b>Cyclamate</b> was marketed in tablet form for use by diabetics as an alternative tabletop sweetener, {{as well as in}} a liquid form. As <b>cyclamate</b> is stable to heat, it was and is marketed as suitable for use in cooking and baking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclamate</b> is {{approved}} as a sweetener {{in at least}} 130 countries. In the late 1960s <b>cyclamate</b> was banned in the United Kingdom but was approved after being re-evaluated by the European Union in 1996.|$|E

50|$|While {{some are}} made with sugar, or sold unsweetened, the {{products}} are often made with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, <b>cyclamates</b> or saccharin, and often include artificial flavors and colors. Some of the product include vitamins or other nutrients. The products are variously marketed to children, athletes, bodybuilders, dieters, or as a vitamin supplement. Some brands are only sold as drink mixes, while some beverage companies produce powdered versions of their products, as does Gatorade and Ocean Spray. Another form of drink mix is represented by products mixed into milk, such as malted milk, Nesquik, Ovaltine and Carnation Instant Breakfast.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of the diet drink or refreshment era was in 1952, when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar-free ginger ale called No-Cal. It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained local. Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in 1958 announcing a diet product, Diet Rite. In 1962, Dr Pepper released a diet(etic) version of its soft drink, although it sold slowly due to the misconception that it was meant solely for diabetic consumption. In 1963, The Coca-Cola Company joined the diet soft drink market with Tab, which {{proved to be a}} huge success. Tab was originally sweetened with <b>cyclamates</b> and saccharin.|$|R
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on sulfur-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclohexylsulfamate sulfohydrolase. Other names in common use include <b>cyclamate</b> sulfamatase, <b>cyclamate</b> sulfamidase, and cyclohexylsulfamate sulfamidase. This enzyme participates in caprolactam degradation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclamate</b> sugar {{substitute}} {{was discovered in}} 1937 by two American chemists and tested over the subsequent twenty years. After <b>cyclamate</b> was declared safe for consumption in the mid-1950s, the Hermes Company announced their new product, Assugrin, in 1954. Almost a decade later, in 1965, Hermes company {{came up with a}} mixture of saccharin and <b>cyclamate.</b> It was later introduced to the market under Assugrin brand with wide endorsements. In that same year, aspartame was discovered. Aspartame was introduced into the Assugrin brand as Assugrin Gold.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclamate</b> is {{currently}} {{banned in the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|Once <b>cyclamates</b> were banned, American {{producers}} {{turned to}} saccharin. When used by itself, saccharin was often criticized {{for having a}} bitter taste and [...] "chemical" [...] aftertaste. Some products, such as Coca-Cola's Tab, attempted to rectify this by adding {{a small amount of}} sugar. In 1977, the FDA was petitioned to ban saccharin, too, as a carcinogen, but a moratorium was placed on the ban until studies were conducted. The ban was lifted in 1991, but by that time, virtually all diet soft drink production had shifted to using aspartame. Perhaps the most notable holdout is Tab, which also uses some aspartame in its formula.|$|R
50|$|Women's {{groups are}} in the {{forefront}} of the consumer movement. They include the National Federation of Regional Women's Associations, the Housewives Association, and the National Association of Consumer Cooperatives. Their activities depend on the support of neighborhood women's associations, the women's sections of local agricultural and fishing cooperatives, and government-sponsored consumer education groups. Although boycotts have been organized against companies making products that the groups viewed as dangerous (for example, canned foods containing carcinogenic <b>cyclamates),</b> they do not, for the most part, demand lower prices for food or other goods. In tandem with agricultural interests, consumer groups oppose increased food imporshemts {{on the grounds that the}} supply is unpredictable and likely laced with dangerous additives.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{introduce}} the sweeteners which {{are used in the}} food industry in the Czech Republic but also in the world. The basic sweetener which {{is a measure of the}} other sweeteners is regarded as sugar (sucrose). In this bachelor´s work, I described the history of the production of beet sugar in the Czech Republic, the products which are made of it and also its usage in food industry. Furthermore, I introduce the basic types of sweeteners by which we try to replace the beet sugar. I describe the history, production, characteristics and their usage. These are mainly the natural sweeteners which are divided into the carbohydrate (sucrose, fructose, glucose, honey, lactose and sugar alcohols), non-carbohydrate (stevioside, thaumatin) and artificial align (aspartame, saccharin, <b>cyclamates,</b> acesulfame-K, sucralose) ...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, seven {{intensely}} sweet sugar substitutes {{have been}} approved for use. They are stevia, aspartame, sucralose, neotame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), saccharin, and advantame. <b>Cyclamates</b> are used outside the U.S., but have been prohibited in the U.S. since 1969. Others, {{which may or may}} not be approved depending on jurisdiction, include allulose (psicose) and monk fruit. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives. [...] Food additives must be approved by the FDA, which publishes a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list of additives. [...] Stevia is exempt under the FDA's GRAS policy due to its being a natural substance in wide use well before 1958, and the FDA has approved it on these grounds. The conclusions about safety are based on a detailed review of a large body of information, including hundreds of toxicological and clinical studies.|$|R

40|$|Nine wistar M W- 3 {{pathogen-free}} rats, {{selected for}} this study, were observed {{for the effects}} of cyclohexylamine (CHA) on chromosomes. The rats were divided into three groups, each consisting of three animals. Group I served as control, group II received doses of 20 mg/kg body weight, and group III received 50 mg/kg body weight of CHA. The experiment ran for seven consecutive weeks, with CHA being injected intraperitoneally for five consecutive days. One day after the last injection, blood was taken from the tail vein and prepared in vitro for chromosome analysis. The prepared chromosomes were first observed under light microscope and oil immersion, and chromosome spreads which appeared to be abnormal were photographed for detailed examination. The results indicate that CHA did not produce any significant chromosme abnormalities {{during the course of this}} study. It is suggested that longer term experimentation utilizing a larger number of animals and employing in vitro technique should be considered in an effort to resolve conflicting results concerning the effects of <b>cyclamates</b> and CHA on chromosomes.

5000|$|The highest profile {{issue that}} Ley {{had to confront}} was sodium <b>cyclamate.</b> An {{artificial}} sweetener, it was originally brought to market as a flavoring ingredient in drugs, but in 1958, it was designated GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) and its uses expanded, first into table sugars, then into many foods. By 1969 there were $1 billion in annual sales of <b>cyclamate.</b> However, by that time some animal studies had shown that very high doses of cyclamates, at levels of humans ingesting 350 cans of diet soda per day, led to higher rates of bladder cancer in rats.

40|$|Bibliography: pages [127]- 136. Until 1965, the American sugar {{industry}} was the undisputed {{leader in the}} sweetening field. But at this time, a surge of public interest in diet and heath began to erode both the industry and its reputation. This has caused an industrial emphasis on non-nutritive sweeteners such as <b>cyclamates</b> and saccharin, which were followed by the discovery of aspartame. None of these alternatives was accepted smoothly by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, extensive tests and legislation surrounded their final status {{as well as the}} status of sugar. The leadership of the {{sugar industry}} was, nevertheless, challenged by these sweeteners, as well as by technological developments improving high-fructose corn syrup, which was a cheaper industrial alternative to sugar. Sugar also has considerable international trade significance, since its importation provides a source of federal revenue. This study traces the major developments in these factors. Historical research and literature are used throughout. The conclusions drawn are: (1) the sugar industry will not regain its former superiority, since several new sweetening alternatives have developed; (2) sugar is not a major cause of health problems; and (3) sugar legislation should be broadened to encompass other prominent sweeteners.

40|$|This seventy-third {{volume of}} IARC Monographs covers 20 {{individual}} compounds and {{three groups of}} compounds (<b>cyclamates,</b> saccharin and its salts, and nitrilotriacetic acid and its salts). All but two of these, meta-dichlorobenzene and methyl tert-butyl ether, were evaluated by previous IARC working groups (Table 1). Since the previous evaluations, new data have become available, and the Preamble to the IARC Monographs has been modified to permit more explicit inclusion of mechanistic considerations and of data on aspects other than cancer in the evaluation process (Vainio et al., 1992). In particular, evidence has accumulated concerning certain pathological processes that lead to tumour development in the kidney and urinary bladder of rats exposed to some chemicals. These include specifically the role of alpha- 2 urinary (α 2 u) globulin-associated nephropathy {{in the development of}} epithelial neoplasms of the renal cortex in male rats, and the roles of bladder stones and certain amorphous urinary precipitates in carcinogenesis in the urinary bladder of rats. Specific guidelines have been developed on the use of information on the mechanisms of induction of tumours of the kidney, urinary bladder and thyroid gland in rodents in evaluating the carcinogenicity of certain chemicals (Capen et al., 1999), and these guidelines were used where appropriate in making the current evaluations...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} safety of saccharin for human consumption started shortly after its discovery over 100 {{years ago and has}} yet to subside appreciably. The consumption of saccharin, particularly in North America, began to escalate when the U. S. Food and Drug Administration set new standards of identity which allowed foods containing artificial sweeteners to be promoted as "nonnutritive" or "noncaloric" sweeteners for use by the general public. In 1969, when <b>cyclamates</b> were banned, at least 10 single-generation feeding studies were undertaken with saccharin to more accurately assess the potential toxicological consequences resulting from the anticipated increase in its consumption. None of these studies resulted in any overt regulatory action. Subsequently, the introduction of the two-generation chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity bioassay added a new tool to the toxicologist's arsenal. Three two-generation studies using saccharin have since been conducted. The results from these studies clearly show that when rats were exposed to diets containing 5 or 7. 5 % sodium saccharin from the time of conception to death, an increased frequency of urinary bladder cancers was found, predominantly in the males. While some study results suggested that impurities in commercial saccharin or the presence of urinary tract calculi may have been responsible for the observed bladder tumors, it now appears that these possibilities are highly unlikely. The mechanism by which saccharin elicited the bladder tumors using the two-generation experiment has not been ascertained...|$|R
