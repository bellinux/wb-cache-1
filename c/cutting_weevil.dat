BARI mango- 1, BARI mango- 2, BARI mango- 3 (Amrapali), Fazli, Gopalbhog, Khirsapat, Kazla sinduri, Kazla- 01 (Subarna), Langra, Mallika, Rad and seedling (stock plant) on the incidence of mango leaf <b>cutting</b> <b>weevil</b> (Deporaus marginatus P.), its extent of damage to mango leaves {{and the effectiveness of}} non-chemical and chemical (insecticide) for control. The highest infestation of 52. 55 % leaves recorded in BARI mango- 3 (Amrapali) followed by Rad, Mallika, BARI mango- 1 and BARI mango- 2 and the lowest infestation of 13. 78 and 18. 55 % found in Langra and Gopalbhog followed by Kazla- 01 and Khirsapath. The other three varieties sustained 27. 49 - 30. 64 % leaf damage. To control the mango leaf <b>cutting</b> <b>weevil</b> bagging with mosquito net and bagging with polythin bag had the best performance with 100 % reduction of leaf infestation followed by spraying of Ripcord. Spraying of Decis caused 82. 23 % reduction of leaf damage followed by Sevin, Azodrin and Diazinon with the least control efficiency of Sumithion...|$|E
