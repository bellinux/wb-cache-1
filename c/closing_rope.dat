50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each <b>closing</b> <b>rope</b> in the two girders. The <b>closing</b> <b>rope</b> is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E

5000|$|The ropewalk at Chatham Dockyard (as {{part of the}} Ropery or Ropehouse) {{is still}} {{producing}} rope commercially and has an internal length of 1,135 ft (346 m). When it was constructed in 1790, it was the longest brick building in Europe. Before steam power was introduced in 1836, it took over 200 men to form and close a 20-inch (circumference) cable laid rope. [...] The rope walk is used to form and <b>close</b> the <b>rope,</b> these being the final stages in rope making.

60|$|By {{this time}} {{four of the}} jackies of the small boat had come on board. All were armed and they lined up at the rail, <b>close</b> to the <b>rope</b> ladder.

60|$|While the {{men were}} hauling on the rope, little Tommy had bounded over the side into the boat, which he quickly brought <b>close</b> to the <b>rope,</b> and, seizing it, guided his craft to the end to which Bax was fastened.

60|$|It was wholly {{beyond the}} {{capacity}} of the fort to accommodate a tenth of their number. Troops were therefore ordered down from the barracks, and formed a cordon round the fugitives.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we give {{a precise}} and {{workable}} {{definition of a}} quantum knot system, the states of which are called quantum knots.

Moreover, this definition of a quantum knot system is intended to represent the “quantum embodiment ” of a closed knotted physical piece of rope. A quantum knot, as a state of this system, represents the state of such a knotted <b>closed</b> piece of <b>rope,</b> i. e., the particular spatial configuration of the knot tied in the rope. Associated with a quantum knot system is a group of unitary transformations, called the ambient group, which represents all possible ways of moving the rope around (without cutting the rope, and without letting the rope pass through itself.) Of course, unlike a classical <b>closed</b> piece of <b>rope,</b> a quantum knot can exhibit non-classical behavior, such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement.

60|$|Sullenly the men obeyed his orders, and {{the boat}} went dancing through {{the water in a}} {{direction}} which, Will calculated, would enable him to cut off the frigate. In the meantime the captain and his companion, unable to understand what was going on, were thumping at the hatchway. Will, however, paid no attention to them, but stood on it, keeping his eye upon the men in the stern. Twenty minutes brought them close to the frigate, which, on seeing a small boat making for her, threw her sails aback to wait for it. As they came <b>close</b> a <b>rope</b> was thrown; Will grasped it and swung himself up the side, leaving the boat to drift away. The sailors stood looking in surprise at him, but Will went straight up to the first lieutenant.|$|R

The paper discusses experiments made with a pilot size closed grinding circuit treating 0. 5 – 1. 0 t/h crystalline limestone.

Equations based on underflow particle size did not give good results. Roping had mixed effects on the performance of the grinding circuit depending upon how it was obtained.

50|$|The unknot {{arises in}} the {{mathematical}} theory of knots. Intuitively, the unknot is a <b>closed</b> loop of <b>rope</b> without a knot in it. A knot theorist would describe the unknot {{as an image}} of any embedding that can be deformed, i.e. ambient-isotoped, to the standard unknot, i.e. the embedding of the circle as a geometrically round circle. The unknot is also called the trivial knot. An unknot is the identity element {{with respect to the}} knot sum operation.|$|R

60|$|Eight-sixty-one Jessamine Street was a decayed mansion. Thirty yards {{back from}} the street it stood, outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and {{untrimmed}} shrubbery. A row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight; the gate was kept <b>closed</b> by a <b>rope</b> noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate.

No one perceived him, for he was very much the color of the tree, and there he sat alone, quivering with spite and malice.|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} the plan, which was considerate, having a {{regard to the}} feebleness of our boat's crew, {{and the weight of}} the boat itself. Accordingly, when she had room enough, the frigate wore, hauling up close on the other tack, and laying her main-yard square. As soon as the ship was stationary, Neb cast off the hawser, and Marble and he manned two oars. We got the boat round without much risk, and, in less time than it takes to write it, were sending down towards the ship at a furious rate. I steered, and passed so near the frigate's rudder, that I thought, for an instant, I had gone too <b>close.</b> A <b>rope</b> was hove as we cleared the lee-quarter of the frigate, and the people on board hauled us alongside. We caught the man-ropes, and were soon on the quarter-deck. A respectable-looking elderly man, of a square, compact frame, and a fine ruddy English face, in a post-captain's undress, received me, with an extended hand, and a frank, generous, hearty manner.|$|R

We also study the Hamiltonians associated with the generators of the ambient group, and briefly look at the quantum tunneling of overcrossings into undercrossings. A basic building block in this paper is a mosaic system which is a formal (rewriting) system of symbol strings.

It was found that the principal axis directions is highly dependent on the satellite trajectory through the structure and, therefore, the PAA of magnetometer data from a single satellite pass is insufficient to differentiate between magnetic closed loop and flux rope models.
