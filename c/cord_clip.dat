40|$|Swine Industry Day 1971 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 1971 Fourteen litters (120 pigs) were used to study effects of iron {{injections}} on day one or day four after birth. No differences were detected in weight gains, hematological values of hemoglobin, packed cell volume, or red blood-cell count. The results indicate that injectable iron dextran may be administered on day one along with other husbandry practices (dipping navel <b>cords,</b> <b>clipping</b> needle teeth, ear notching) with no adverse effects. A disadvantage would be iron lost in pigs that die before day four from crushing, inanition, etc...|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} on the back mounted buoyancy compensator is used without a backplate for side mount diving This arrangement is functionally similar to wearing the buoyancy compensator sandwiched between the cylinder(s) and backplate, {{but there is no}} backplate or back mounted cylinder. The buoyancy cell may be mounted between the sidemount harness and the diver, or on top of the harness. The sides of the bladder may be restrained from floating upwards when inflated by bungee <b>cords</b> <b>clipped</b> to the waistband in front of the diver or clipped to each other, forming an elastic belt across the front of the hips, well below the diaphragm.|$|R
5000|$|The M112 {{demolition}} {{blocks of}} C-4 are commonly manufactured into the M183 [...] "demolition charge assembly", {{which consists of}} 16 M112 block demolition charges and four priming assemblies packaged inside military Carrying Case M85. The M183 is used to breach obstacles or demolish large structures where larger satchel charges are required. Each priming assembly includes a five- or twenty-foot length of detonating cord assembled with detonating <b>cord</b> <b>clips</b> and capped at each end with a booster. When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted into compressed gas. The gas exerts pressure {{in the form of}} a shock wave, which demolishes the target by cutting, breaching, or cratering.|$|R

50|$|Some luggage carts at {{airports}} and exercise treadmills have this feature. In {{the case of}} treadmills, the dead man's switch usually consists of an external magnet attached to a <b>cord</b> that <b>clips</b> to the user. If the user falls or walks away without turning off the treadmill, the switch cuts power to the treadmill belt.|$|R
5000|$|Any phone made {{overseas}} by AT&T Technologies {{no longer}} had Western Electric markings, except for plugs on modular telephone <b>cords</b> whose <b>clips</b> were marked with [...] "WE" [...] initials. Telephones made overseas by AT&T Technologies were produced in Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and China. Telephones produced at these plants were also marked with [...] "Custom Manufactured in (country) by AT&T"; Chinese made telephones were marked [...] "Custom Manufactured in China for AT&T".|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} V-shaped form of {{the death}} triangle involves clipping a single loop of webbing or cord to both anchors, then clipping the third carabiner over the loop rather than through it, allowing the latter to slip off the loop if either anchor fails. Two better methods are (a) putting a half twist in the <b>cord</b> and <b>clipping</b> the free carabiner through it. If either anchor fails, the free carabiner will remain attached to the cord but if the cord fails, the entire anchor still fails or (b) tying off both strands of the cord with e.g. an overhand knot achieving redundancy by sacrificing perfect equalization, since {{the length of the}} cord to each anchor is now fixed.|$|R
50|$|Badge tethers {{consist of}} a thin cord, {{dimensions}} {{on the order of}} a millimetre diameter by a metre long with one end wound round a spring-loaded reel contained within a small badge-like body that has a clip for a belt, belt loop, pocket, the edge of the clothing itself, or an attachment specifically for such a tether. The other end of the <b>cord</b> has a <b>clip,</b> loop, splitring, strap, or other fastener.|$|R
50|$|Leonor {{was born}} on 31 October 2005 at 1:47 am in the Ruber International Hospital in Madrid {{by means of a}} {{caesarean}} section necessitated by non-progression of labour. Her birth was announced by the Royal Family to the press via SMS. Her umbilical <b>cord</b> was <b>clipped</b> and sent for storage to Cord Blood Registry based in Arizona. Leonor left the Ruber Clinic with her parents on 7 November 2005. She was baptised in the Zarzuela Palace by the Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid, Antonio Rouco Varela, on 14 January 2006. Like her father in 1968, Leonor was christened with water from the Jordan River, a royal custom. She was also given the additional names of de Todos los Santos, a Bourbon tradition. Her godparents were her paternal grandparents, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof√≠a.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of memantine on overactive detrusor (OAD) 15 days after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Twenty-eight adult Wistar rats were used in this study. Fourteen animals served as normal controls, while 14 underwent spinal <b>cord</b> transection (<b>clip</b> compression technique) at the 10 th thoracic vertebra. Fifteen days after SCI, all animals underwent urodynamic testing to confirm OAD. Memantine (16 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into rats with SCI and OAD. Parameters measured included voiding volume, micturition pressure, resting bladder pressure, the period between micturitions and the maximum pressure of the OAD during the filling period. Results have showed that OAD developed in 8 / 14 animals (57. 1 %). OAD was resolved in 5 / 8 (62. 5 %) of these animals after memantine administration. Resting bladder pressure was significantly different in dependent groups (p < 0. 05). Micturition pressure increased after SCI but decreased in rats with SCI after memantine injection. However, the period between micturitions was prolonged in both SCI and memantine groups, compared with normal rats. These results show that memantine could be useful for treating neurogenic OAD after SCI by modulating the micturition reflex pathway. Memantine may also provide an alternative treatment option for OAD in the future...|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the tools}} of the trade have greatly evolved while some have stayed the same, such as the tattoo machine. In itself, the {{traditional}} machine has not changed from its original design and/or concept. With the rise of new machine designs, however, both air- and electric-powered tools such as the rotary and pneumatic tattoo machine have made their way into the industry. A practitioner may also use many different needle sets, such as round liner needles, round shader needles, flat shaders, and magnum (mag) needles. The amount of needles attached to the needle bar change, as well. For instance, large magnum needle groups range from 15 to 55 needles on one bar. There are cheap needle alternatives that have poor hardness and therefore blunt quickly.A practitioner must have the basic tools to provide a tattoo. All other items at the artist's disposal are as different as each tattoo. Basic tools include the tattoo machine, power supply, <b>clip</b> <b>cord,</b> foot pedal, grip, tips, grip stem, needles, and tattoo ink. In the UK equipment must only be sold to registered studios who are provided a certificate by their local environmental health department.|$|R
