40|$|A {{conversion}} coating is a coating produced by chemical or electrochemical {{treatment of a}} metallic surface that gives a superficial layer. This layer which is actually a compound of the metal gives corrosion protection and guarantee paint adhesion. A chromating liquid for forming the <b>chromate</b> <b>film</b> was prepared. The solution {{is a mixture of}} Cr+ 6 and Cr+ 3 at a ratio of 1. 5 to 2. 0, 1 - 20 g/l of H 2 S 04, 1 - 20 g/ 1 of HNO 3, 1 - 20 ml NaOH and 1 - 10 % Si oil. The solution was applied on a surface of zinc-based plated steel sheet of approximately 0. 25 mm thickness and then dried. The <b>chromate</b> <b>film</b> formed on the sheet surface was approximately 0. 5 - 1. 0 Î¼m in thickness. The steel sheet with <b>chromate</b> <b>film</b> was then analysed and mechanically tested. It was found that the chromate solution has better stability over wide range of pH and the formability of its film is improved whence providing a better corrosion resistivity...|$|R
50|$|Chromium {{trioxide}} {{is mainly}} used in chrome plating. It is typically employed with additives {{that affect the}} plating process but do not react with the trioxide. The trioxide reacts with cadmium, zinc, and other metals to generate passivating <b>chromate</b> <b>films</b> that resist corrosion. It is also used {{in the production of}} synthetic rubies. Chromic acid solution is also used in applying types of anodic coating to aluminium, which are primarily used in aerospace applications. A Chromic Acid/ Phosphoric Acid solution is also the preferred stripping agent of anodic coatings of all types.|$|R
50|$|The {{corrosion}} protection is {{primarily due to}} the anodic potential dissolution of zinc versus iron. Zinc acts as a sacrificial anode for protecting iron (steel). While steel is close to -400 mV, depending on alloy composition, electroplated zinc is much more anodic with -980 mV. Steel is preserved from corrosion by cathodic protection. Alloying zinc with cobalt or nickel at levels less than 1% has minimal effect on the potential; but both alloys improve {{the capacity of the}} zinc layer to develop a <b>chromate</b> <b>film</b> by conversion coating. This further enhances {{corrosion protection}}.|$|R
40|$|The {{parameters}} of the chromate bath, like temperature, pH, and fluoride content, strongly affect the morphology and chemical composition of the chromate conversion coating {{and as a consequence}} have a large influence on its corrosion performance. In this paper, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used in combination with other techniques to investigate the role played by the pH of the chromate bath on the properties of the <b>chromate</b> <b>film</b> formed on Alclad 2024 aluminium alloy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) have shown the formation of a thicker and less dense chromate layer when the pH of the chromate bath is changed from 2. 4 to 1. 2. The analysis of the EIS spectra have highlighted that this change in pH leads to the formation of more protective and more resistant chromate corrosion products (CCP) inside the defects of the <b>chromate</b> <b>film.</b> When a thin, dense and protective layer of CCP is formed in the defects, the corrosion behaviour of the chromate conversion coating improves for two main reason: (a) further attack of the defects is avoided or delayed; (b) the change in volume caused by the formation of the CCP is limited resulting in a low level of stress in the film, which as a consequence is not detached from the aluminium substrate...|$|R
40|$|Bulk or <b>film</b> Lead <b>Chromates</b> {{have been}} {{manufactured}} by several methods, and reported as humidity-sensing material. Multi-source electron beams evaporation method has good {{ability to control}} film composition because multi sources can be controlled independently. But Lead Chromates had not been manufactured by this method. Therefore this method {{was applied to the}} growth of Lead <b>Chromate</b> <b>film</b> with the sources of Lead,Chromium and Oxygen gases. Evaporated atoms or molecules were activated by using RF plasma in order to crystallize the film. As the result,the growth condition, under which Pb 2 CrO 5 and the mixture of PbCrO 4 and Pb 2 CrO 5 films were crystallized,was found. The films were tighter and smoother than Lead Chromates manufactured by the other methods. The humidity-sensing characteristics of the films indicated narrow hysteresis loop and small change of standing...|$|R
40|$|Silver {{articles}} like jewellery, silverwares, cosmetic containers, novelties, presentation items etc. {{are usually}} plated with gold in very thin deposits to give good appearance {{and to protect}} silver from tarnishing. A verythin deposit of gold is often porous, and the silver tarnishes through the pores. This tarnishing will spread laterally over the gold and the whole component will turn black. This is often thought {{to indicate that the}} gold has tarnished, but this is not true. Thick layers of gold is useful in preventing tarnish films. However, it is very expensive. Other methods of reducing the tendency of silver to tarnish are to coat the surface with a special lacquer, grease, oil or wax or to apply special oxide or <b>chromate</b> <b>films.</b> Electrolytic treatment of goldplated silver in an electrolyte containing 40 g/l potassium chromate, 40 g/l potassium carbonate at pH 8. 8 at a cathodic current density of 2. 5 A/dm 2 'for 1 - 3 minutes significantly improves the tarnish resistance as revealed by the accelerated stain proofing tes...|$|R
40|$|A Master's Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The literature on the surface treatment of zinc and tin in aqueous solutions containing sodium chromate, sodium molybdate and sodium tungstate has been reviewed. A search for suitable alternatives to chromate due to its toxicity level has been established. A. review on methods of film analysis has also been completed. Zinc was anodically passivated in aqueous solutions containing 0. 01 - lM sodium chromate, sodium molybdate and sodium tungstate maintained between pH 5 - 11 and operated at temperatures {{in the range of}} 20 - 600 C by the application of an external current for 3 V overpotential. The effects of solution concentration, process pH and temperature variation on passivity have been established. It has been found that passivity is favoured between 0. 1 - lM oxy-an. ion concentration and pH 7 - 11. Chromate treatment favours room temperatures whereas molybdate and tungstate treatment are best at 60 oC. Coulometric analysis was used to estimate the chromium content and <b>film</b> composition of <b>chromate</b> <b>films</b> on zinc in which {{it was found that the}} chromium content increases with the corresponding increase in concentration, process pH, process potential or a fall in the treatment temperature [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Zinc {{coatings}} {{are used}} to protect metallic parts of automobiles from corrosion. Zinc protective coatings are often chromated additionally treating them in acidic solution of chromium compounds. In recent years new technologies were designed to deposit <b>chromate</b> <b>films</b> of various thickness and resistance on zinc surface from acidic solution of Cr(III) compounds. It has been noticed, that under atmospheric corrosion conditions microscopic fungi {{are present in the}} environment affect zinc coating. The aim of the presented study was to determine if zinc coatings treated with Cr(III) solution become more resistant to fungi influence or their resistance diminishes. The analysis of steel plates coated with a zinc film and treated in four different chromium solutions has shown that in all the specimens fungi of Cladosporium herbarium species were detected and their frequency of detection was quite high, sometimes up to 50 %. However, we failed to determine the regularities of distribution of some fungi on the surface of plates chromated in different solution. The comparison of changes in the surfaces of plates treated with the four solutions has shown that the plates treated in the Likonda 3 Cr 5 passivation solution changed least after being exposed to atmospheric conditions. Chromated plates contaminated with mixtures of different fungi and kept for 60 days at a temperature of (26 ± 2) °C under humid conditions were examined by using a scanning electron microscope (EVO 5 O XP Carl Zeiss STM AG, Germany) and the peculiarities of their surface damage were determined. The peculiarities of growth of some fungi species were determined on the plates chromated in the Likonda 3 Cr 5 and Cr(NO 3) 3 * 9 H 2 O + malonic acid solutions. Under these conditions the fungi of Chrysosporium merdarium, Fusarium proliferatum, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Penicillium stoloniferum can either generate and promote the damage of metal surface or stabilize its corrosion processes.

40|$|Abstract. An {{anticorrosion}} {{conversion coating}} on metal magnesium surface was prepared using immersion method {{in an aqueous}} solution containing mainly phytic acid. The coating after the preparation could be dry in the air without a rinse process using water in the final stage. Hence there is no discharge of waste water and waste gas in the whole process. Influence of several factors on the anticorrosion performance of coating was tested. And optimal parameters in the coating formation process were obtained from orthogonal test. The {{results indicated that the}} coating had better corrosion resistance, when the solution contained 3 % phytic acid, and the immersion time is 7 minutes and the PH value was 3. 5. The surface conversion coating was characterized by SEM and EDS. The conversion coating is better than the traditional <b>chromate</b> passive <b>film</b> by testing corrosion speed of coatings using hydrogen evolution method. The technology of the environment-friendly conversion coating containing phytic acid {{has the potential to be}} a new anti-corrosion technology for magnesium surface...|$|R
40|$|Alloys {{used in the}} {{aeronautical}} industry, {{mainly of}} the series 7 xxx and 2 xxx, are liable to suffer several types of corrosion attack {{due to the fact}} that they are exposed to humid atmospheres of different aggressiveness. For this reason they are protected by surface treatments that can lengthen their service life. These treatments are mainly based on the use of <b>chromates</b> in anodic <b>films,</b> in conversion layers, or as inhibitor pigments in paint system primer coatings. However, in view of the high toxicity of chromates, viable alternatives are being researched to replace them. The literature includes a number of studies focused on the use of rare earth salts as inhibitors that can offer good levels of protection on Al-Zn-Mg-Cu and Al-Cu-Mg alloys. On the other hand, the need to reduce the weight of aeronautical structures means that research continues to be carried out on lightweight aluminium alloys such as Al-Li. The authors have not found references on the inhibition of this type of alloys, which may be of interest in the future. This work presents the results of localized corrosion inhibition on the Al-Li-Cu alloy 8090 T- 8171 in 3. 56 % NaCl by means of the addition of CeCl 3 and LaCl 3 as inhibitors. The corrosion/inhibition mechanism and kinetics have been studied using electrochemical and surface analysis techniques (SEM, EDS, XPS). The inhibiting ability of the two salts in this system has been compared for the inhibitor concentrations used. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
