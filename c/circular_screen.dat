25|$|The story {{includes}} interior scenes {{inside the}} TARDIS {{for the first}} time in the Pertwee (and colour) era of the show. The configuration of the TARDIS set-up is unique for this adventure. The TARDIS monitor appears to be a <b>circular</b> <b>screen</b> embedded in one of the 'roundels' in the console room wall, rather than the traditional rectangular screen (this feature is seen again once, a year later, on the unique set built for The Time Monster). The doors of the console room do not open directly into the exterior as in all other adventures; instead they open into a corridor that features the 'roundel' motif. When the TARDIS interior reappears, in the next production (Colony in Space), both these features have been eliminated.|$|E
500|$|In November 1974, they {{employed}} {{for the first}} time the large <b>circular</b> <b>screen</b> that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named [...] "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a [...] high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of [...] "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.|$|E

It would make no difference if one should become invisible, provided there was no one else to know it.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a three-dimensional (3 D) hologram display system. The 3 D hologram display system includes a projector device for projecting an image upon a display medium {{to form a}} 3 D hologram. The 3 D hologram is formed such that a viewer can view the holographic image from multiple angles up to 360 degrees. Multiple display media are described, namely a spinning diffusive <b>screen,</b> a <b>circular</b> diffuser <b>screen,</b> and an aerogel. The spinning diffusive screen utilizes spatial light modulators to control the image such that the 3 D image is displayed on the rotating screen in a time-multiplexing manner. The <b>circular</b> diffuser <b>screen</b> includes multiple, simultaneously-operated projectors to project the image onto the <b>circular</b> diffuser <b>screen</b> from a plurality of locations, thereby forming the 3 D image. The aerogel can use the projection device described as applicable to either the spinning diffusive <b>screen</b> or the <b>circular</b> diffuser <b>screen...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{screening}} process performance {{can be affected}} heavily by many factors, such as intensity of vibration, size fraction of the feed and feed rate. The process performance can be assessed by screening efficiency. It also refers to product yield. Screening efficiency {{is defined as the}} comparison of the undersized materials brought on the screening and discharged oversized product in contrast to the original amount of undersized materials in the feed stream. Tumbler screening technique allows separation efficiency to be as high as 99% due to the <b>circular</b> <b>screening</b> assembly’s three-dimensional oscillations,. which will increase the effective screening area four times greater than normal vibrating screen.|$|R

50|$|For {{an ideal}} point source, the {{intensity}} of the Arago spot equals that of the undisturbed wave front. Only the width of the Arago spot intensity peak depends on the distances between source, <b>circular</b> object and <b>screen,</b> as well as the source's wavelength and the diameter of the circular object. This means that one can compensate for a reduction in the source's wavelength by increasing the distance l between <b>circular</b> object and <b>screen</b> or reducing the circular object's diameter.|$|R

50|$|The Krugovaya Kinopanorama or Circular Kinopanorama (Круговая кинопанорама) - is a cinema in Moscow of Russia {{which plays}} Krugorama, {{a type of}} cinema {{presentation}} in which film is projected on a <b>circular</b> <b>screen</b> with a horizontal 360° view. This was pioneered in 1896 by French engineer Raoul Grimoin-Sanson, who played ten projectors simultaneously on a <b>circular</b> <b>screen,</b> a process he called Cinéorama. Cinerama though spelled similarly has a different meaning, and denotes three projectors on an arched screen, as does Kinopanorama. The technology used in the Moscow Circular Kinopanorama was also previously carried out by Walt Disney in 1955, in a process he called Circarama (later known as Circle-Vision 360° from 1967 onward).|$|E

Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was assessing performance of soybean seeds, sorted by size, and grown in soils with different phosphorus levels. To this, seeds of two soybean cultivars (MSoy 9144 RR and MSoy 8527 RR) were sorted with aid of <b>circular</b> <b>screens</b> with perforations of 5. 5 mm and 7. 5 mm in diameter. Sowing was carried out into plastic pots, with 3. 0 dm³ substrate capacity each, containing a Red-Yellow Oxisol, fertilized with increasing phosphorus dosages (50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg. Kg- 1), and performed under greenhouse environmental conditions. Seed size did not significantly influence the values obtained to the variables analyzed; however, to the larger seeds there was a trend of increase on these values. There was also a trend of increase on these values to all variables assessed when the dosages of phosphorus in the soil were increased...|$|R

50|$|They {{are widely}} used for {{screening}} quarry stone stock and classifying products in mining, sand, gold, energy and chemical industrial processes. The targeted substance is predominantly finer particles, which can then be directed into a separation unit, such as a hydrocyclone or are materials that can be removed and used. Removed materials are often formed intentionally and are classified by their shape, size and physical properties. For example, construction wastes are sorted and sieved by a <b>circular</b> vibrating <b>screen</b> into coarse and fine particles. The particles are taken to make concrete, architectural bricks and road base materials.|$|R
