5|$|It is {{possible}} for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c).

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{fluorescence}} or emission spectra {{that have}} characteristic spectral peaks, <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> is continuous. Around the visible spectrum, the relative intensity per unit frequency is approximately {{proportional to the}} frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation.</b> This is why visible <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> is in the ultraviolet spectrum—it is only with sufficiently accelerated charges that it even becomes visible; {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

The moment method is utilized to study the temporal dynamics of intracavity solitons.

The role of high-order dispersion on the frequency comb envelopes is carefully elucidated through analyzing the intracavity <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiations.</b> We further demonstrate that the spectra envelope of an ultrabroadband optical frequency comb can be engineered by using dispersion profiles with multiple zero dispersion wavelengths.

25|$|<b>Cherenkov</b> <b>{{radiation}},</b> {{also known}} as Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation (named after Sergey Vavilov and Pavel Cherenkov), is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor is due to <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation.</b> It is named after Soviet scientist Pavel Cherenkov, the 1958 Nobel Prize winner {{who was the first}} to detect it experimentally. A theory of this effect was later developed within the framework of Einstein's special relativity theory by Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank, who also shared the Nobel Prize. <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> had been theoretically predicted by the English polymath Oliver Heaviside in papers published in 1888–89.|$|E
40|$|A broadened or double humped away-side {{structure}} {{was observed in}} 2 -particle azimuthal jet-like correlations at RHIC and SPS.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) recurrence phenomenon in the 1950  s was a major step in science that later led to the {{discovery of}} solitons in nonlinear physics. More recently, it was shown that optical fibers can serve as a medium for observing the FPU phenomenon. In the present work, we have found experimentally and numerically that in the low-dispersion region of an optical fiber, the recurrence is strongly influenced by the third-order-dispersion (TOD) term. Namely, the presence of TOD leads to several disappearances and recoveries of the FPU recurrence when the central frequency of the pump wave is varied. The effect is highly nontrivial and can be explained in terms of reversible and irreversible losses caused by <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiations</b> interacting with a multiplicity of modes sharing the optical energy in the process of its partition...|$|R
25|$|Vacuum <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> at superluminal {{speed of}} any {{particle}} (protons, electrons, neutrinos) having a charge structure. In this case, emission of Bremsstrahlung can occur, until the particle falls below threshold and subluminal speed is reached again. This {{is similar to}} the known <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> in media, in which particles are traveling faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Deviations from the limiting velocity can be constrained by observing high energy particles of distant astronomic sources that reach Earth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring example of almost perfect blue noise, {{with the power}} density growing linearly with frequency over spectrum regions where the permeability of index of refraction of the medium are approximately constant. The exact density spectrum is given by the Frank-Tamm formula. In this case, the finiteness of the frequency range comes from the finiteness of the range over which a material can have a refractive index greater than unity. <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> also appears as a bright blue color, for these reasons.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{velocity}} {{that must be}} exceeded is the phase velocity of light rather than the group velocity of light. The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, {{and in that case}} one can even achieve <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> with no minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the Smith–Purcell effect. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> forms an acute angle with the particle velocity).|$|E
40|$|The <b>Cherenkov</b> <b>radiations</b> (CRs) at visible {{wavelengths}} are efficiently generated {{based on}} the soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS) by coupling the 120 fs pulses into the fundamental mode propagated in the multi-knots of a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber cladding (HC-PCFC). When the pump operates at 830 nm with the average power of 300 mW at the knots 1 – 4, the central wavelengths of generated CRs λCR are 476 nm, 454 nm, 554 nm, and 580 nm, the conversion efficiencies ηCR are 33 %, 35 %, 30 %, and 29 %, and the corresponding bandwidths BCR are 57 nm, 74 nm, 25 nm, and 50 nm, respectively. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, ηCR of 35 % and BCR of 74 nm are the best experimental results reported with > 100 fs pump pulse.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{ground-based}} methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use.

While these telescopes are extremely good at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic-ray origin, they can only function well on clear nights without the Moon shining, and have very small fields of view and are only active for a few percent of the time.

40|$|Characteristics of polar cusp hiss {{and other}} VLF {{emissions}} {{observed in the}} cusp region are studied by using f-t spectra and narrow-band intensity data at six frequencies which were processed from VLF electric field data received from ISIS- 1 and ISIS- 2 at Syowa Station, Antarctica. The polar cusp hiss is very irregular in frequency, intensity and time (or space), and shows fine intensity variations in the narrow-band intensity data at 5 and 8 kHz bands as compared with coarse intensity variations of the polar hiss (or auroral hiss) appearing {{on either side of}} the polar cusp region. The polar cusp hiss occurs over several hours centered around the geomagnetic noon in geomagnetic local time for a few minutes in UT on ISIS west to east passes. The regions of polar hiss with curtain-like f-t spectrum lie on both sides of the polar cusp hiss region. The irregular and structured spectra of polar cusp hiss and saucer emissions may reflect irregular and structured electron precipitations in the cusp region. The polar cusp VLF emissions, such as the polar cusp hiss and VLF saucers occur at invariant latitudes from 72 °to 86 °, and at geomagnetic local times from 09 to 15 hours.
