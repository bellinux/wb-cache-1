5|$|The Middle Kingdom saw {{the decline}} of the {{official}} <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Nyuserre. Evidence from this period come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by Senusret I, who dedicated a number of statues of Old Kingdom kings including at least one of Nyuserre, to a <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Amun and of the royal ancestors. At the same time, the 12th Dynasty saw the widespread dismantling of many Old Kingdom funerary temples for their materials, which were notably reused in the pyramid complexes of Amenemhat I and Senusret I. These events are contemporaneous with the life of the last priest serving the official <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Nyuserre, a certain Inhotep. Both of these facts hint at a lapse of royal interest in the state-sponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comparative}} study {{of the relationship between}} the sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis in Lakonian and Messenia, after the liberation of Messenia from Lakonia (370 BCE). Four hypotheses are explored in order to answer the central question of whether the sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis in Messenia after the liberation were mimeses of those in Lakonia: essential religious similarity from the fourth century onwards, post-liberation Messenian revival of pre-conquest religious practices, conscious Messenian determination of religious difference from Lakonia and independent evolution of Messenian sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis. From literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic evidence as well as observations made during personal visits to sites and museums in Greece, relevant data on the physical and historical landscape, This dissertation is a {{comparative study of}} the relationship between the sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis in Lakonia and Messenia, after the liberation of Messenia from Lakonia (370 BCE). Four hypotheses are explored in order to answer the central question of whether the sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis in Messenia after the liberation were mimeses of those in Lakonia: essential religious similarity from the fourth century onwards, post-liberation Messenian revival of pre-conquest religious practices, conscious Messenian determination of religious difference from Lakonia and independent evolution of Messenian sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis. 	From literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic evidence as well as observations made during personal visits to sites and museums in Greece, relevant data on the physical and historical landscape, epicleseis, sanctuary components, relevant myths and <b>cult</b> practices <b>of</b> all Artemisia in the southern Peloponnese are assembled into two comprehensive catalogues, one for each polity. A synthesis and analysis of that data is then conducted to establish patterns for purposes of comparison. The emergent patterns demonstrate that sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis in post-liberation Messene are not essentially Lakonian mimeses. 	This study advances our collective understanding <b>of</b> sanctuaries and <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Artemis in Lakonia and Messenia. It points to unknowns which could provide fertile avenues for future research into the complexity and diversity of ancient Greek religion in the Peloponnese...|$|R

5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{is that this is}} due to a change of ideology. The advent of the 5th dynasty marks the growing importance of the <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the sun as hinted by the Westcar Papyrus. This is also directly evidenced by the large sun temples built at Abusir throughout the dynasty, a tradition initiated by Userkaf. Finally, the Abusir Papyri demonstrate the strong connection between the <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the sun and the mortuary <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the pharaohs of this dynasty: offerings for a deceased ruler were first consecrated in a sun temple before being dispatched to his mortuary temple. Thus, Userkaf located his mortuary temple to the south of the main pyramid so that the sun would shine directly into it all year round.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped {{feathered}} serpent deities. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art. Although the <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata.

Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god of well-known transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E

5|$|Silent Hill 3 {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of the Silent Hill series. Seventeen years before the start of Silent Hill 3, in the year 1983, Harry Mason defeated a god brought forth by the resident <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Silent Hill and at the ending, was given a baby girl to care for. The protagonist and player character of Silent Hill 3 is Heather, the teenaged adopted daughter of Harry. Claudia Wolf, the cult's priestess who plans to bring about a paradise on Earth, serves as the game's antagonist. As Heather attempts to unravel the reasons why the <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Silent Hill is pursuing her, she encounters a private investigator named Douglas Cartland; Vincent, a member of the cult who detests Claudia; and Leonard Wolf, Claudia's abusive father.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Saint Andrew {{may have}} come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had the <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in {{particular}} from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. Óengus, like his successors and possible kinsmen Caustantín and Eógan, is recorded prominently in the Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis, a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in religious institutions connected with Durham.|$|E

5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a priestly role in the <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the emperor.

5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642.

5000|$|The {{first edition}} of the {{role-playing}} game RuneQuest was released in 1978. On the back cover of this edition, the game world was called [...] "Glorontha" [...] (sic). Several later editions were made; the second edition ("RuneQuest 2") in 1979 introduced many sophisticated game aids, such as <b>Cults</b> <b>of</b> Prax and <b>Cults</b> <b>of</b> Terror, and highly polished campaign packs, such as Griffin Mountain. Using materials such as <b>Cults</b> <b>of</b> Prax, players aligned their characters with any of several distinct religions, grounding those characters in the political, cultural, and metaphysical conflicts of Glorantha. Each religion offered a distinct worldview and cultural outlook, none of which are objectively correct. This approach of offering competing mythical histories and value systems continues in current Glorantha material. <b>Cults</b> <b>of</b> Terror focused on the worship of evil gods and adversaries, such as Vivamort, a vampire cult, and Lunar and Chaos cults.|$|R
