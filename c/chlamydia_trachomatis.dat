5|$|<b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{are usually}} {{the main cause of}} PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobes and facultative {{microorganisms}} have been obtained from the upper genital tract. N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and anaerobic organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{pathways}} used in microorganisms {{differ from}} those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast Candida glabrata and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae are NAD auxotrophs– they cannot synthesize NAD– but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD or its precursors. precursors in Candida glabrata | journal = Mol. Microbiol. | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17725566 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05886.x }} Even more surprising is the intracellular pathogen <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> which lacks recognizable candidates for any genes involved in the biosynthesis or salvage of both NAD and NADP, and must acquire these coenzymes from its host.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Inclusion {{conjunctivitis}} of {{the newborn}} (ICN) is a conjunctivitis {{that may be}} caused by the bacteria <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> and may lead to acute, purulent conjunctivitis. However, it is usually self-healing.|$|E
25|$|A {{study at}} the {{hospital}} showed high rates of sexually transmitted diseases among pregnant women including Candidosis (28.76%), Vaginal Trichomoniasis (13.88%), <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> (3.37%), HIV (2.38%), Syphilis (0.99%) and Gonococcus (0.40%).|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} is an RF-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked arthritis often {{precipitated by}} genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Infections {{with the}} {{following}} sexually transmitted pathogens {{have a negative effect}} on fertility: <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. There is a consistent association of Mycoplasma genitalium infection and female reproductive tract syndromes. M. genitalium infection is associated with increased risk of infertility.|$|E
25|$|LGV is {{primarily}} an infection of lymphatics and lymph nodes. <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> is the bacterium responsible for LGV. It gains entrance through {{breaks in the}} skin, or it can cross the epithelial cell layer of mucous membranes. The organism travels {{from the site of}} inoculation down the lymphatic channels to multiply within mononuclear phagocytes of the lymph nodes it passes.|$|E
25|$|A bout of food {{poisoning}} or a gastrointestinal infection may also precede the disease (the last four genera of bacteria mentioned above are enteric bacteria). Shigella {{is the most}} common organism causing reactive arthritis following diarrhea. <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> {{is the most common}} cause of reactive arthritis following urethritis. Ureaplasma and mycoplasma are rare causes. There is some circumstantial evidence for other organisms causing the disease, but the details are unclear.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{is associated}} with the HLA-B27 gene on chromosome 6 and by the presence of enthesitis as the basic pathologic lesion and is triggered by a preceding infection. The most common triggering infection in the US is a genital infection with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis.</b> Other bacteria known to cause reactive arthritis which are more common worldwide are Ureaplasma urealyticum, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., and Campylobacter spp.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS. BV is associated with up to a six-fold increase in HIV shedding. There is also a correlation between the absence of vaginal lactobacilli and infection by Neisseria gonorrhea and <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis.</b> BV is {{a risk factor for}} viral shedding and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. BV may increase the risk of infection with or reactivation of human papillomavirus (HPV).|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia infection, often simply {{known as}} chlamydia, is a sexually {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis.</b> Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles. The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{vulvovaginitis}} can {{be caused}} by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (7-20% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, Yersinia, or common STI organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus). Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific vulvovaginitis and are treated with amoxicillin. STI-associated vulvovaginitis may be caused by sexual abuse or vertical transmission, and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis.</b> In women, symptoms may include abnormal vaginal discharge, burning during urination, and bleeding in between periods, although most women do not experience any symptoms. Symptoms in men include pain when urinating, and abnormal discharge from their penis. If left untreated in both men and women, Chlamydia can infect the urinary tract and potentially lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause serious problems during pregnancy and even {{has the potential to}} cause infertility. It can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly ectopic pregnancy, in which the egg implants outside of the uterus. However, Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} blood-borne infection which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include Listeria monocytogenes and a variety of mycobacteria. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and enterovirus can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E

[...] Tubal factors cause 25-30% of infertility cases. Tubal factor is one complication of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection in women.|$|E
2500|$|Nevada law {{requires}} that registered brothel prostitutes be tested weekly (by a cervical specimen) for gonorrhea and <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> and monthly for HIV and syphilis; furthermore, condoms are mandatory for all oral sex and sexual intercourse. Brothel owners may be held liable if customers become infected with HIV after a prostitute has {{tested positive for the}} virus. [...] Women work a legally mandated minimum of nine days for each work period.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria such as <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> or Moraxella {{can cause}} a non-exudative but {{persistent}} conjunctivitis without much redness. [...] Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva. [...] Pseudomembranes consist {{of a combination of}} inflammatory cells and exudates, and are loosely adherent to the conjunctiva, while true membranes are more tightly adherent and cannot be easily peeled away. [...] Cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, β-hemolytic streptococci, and C. diphtheriae. [...] Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of non-immunized children.|$|E
2500|$|Amoxicillin {{attaches}} to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a bactericidal compound. It is effective against Streptococci, Pneumococci, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> Salmonell, Borrelia burgdorferi and Helicobactor pylori. As a derivative of ampicillin, amoxicillin {{is a member of}} the same family as penicillins and like them, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive and a minor component of Gram-negative bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{conjunctivitis}} {{causes the}} rapid onset of conjunctival redness, {{swelling of the}} eyelid, and mucopurulent discharge. [...] Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days. [...] Bacterial conjunctivitis due to common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish mucopurulent discharge that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep. [...] Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur. [...] The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. [...] The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Common bacteria responsible for non-acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus sp. Less commonly <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> is involved.|$|E
