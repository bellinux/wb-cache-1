5000|$|In ground start signaling, {{the central}} office initiates a call by {{grounding}} tip and putting the ringing signal on the line. The PBX has 100ms to sense this condition. The PBX goes off hook; {{if it had been}} trying to seize the line by grounding ring, it releases ring from ground and the <b>call</b> <b>proceeds</b> normally.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Jeanneret and the Sabres {{released}} a CD that collected {{some of his}} most memorable <b>calls.</b> <b>Proceeds</b> from the CD, which was titled Roll the Highlight Film, went to charity. It was followed up in 2006 with Top Shelf (named after his signature call, [...] "Top Shelf, where momma hides the cookies!"), a similarly themed DVD.|$|R
2500|$|Throbbing Gristle's best-selling single was [...] "Zyklon B Zombie" [...] (1978), {{the title}} being a {{reference}} to the Zyklon B poison gas used at Auschwitz extermination camp. With their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats they attempted to move away from their industrial sound, and produced songs in a variety of different musical genres. P-Orridge received a number of threatening phone <b>calls,</b> <b>proceeding</b> to record them and use them as a backing track for the TG song [...] "Death threats".|$|R
5000|$|Early Assignment. The network assigns the TCH+FACCH after sending CC <b>Call</b> <b>Proceeding</b> and completes {{call setup}} on the FACCH. This allows {{the use of}} in-band {{patterns}} (like the ringing or busy patterns) generated by the network. This is the example shown.|$|E
5000|$|In an idle circuit, {{the central}} office {{supplies}} -48V (nominally) on the ring conductor {{with respect to the}} tip side. A ground start PBX initiates an outgoing trunk seizure on an idle circuit by connecting of the ring lead to ground (maximum local resistance of 550 ohms). The central office senses this condition and grounds the tip lead. When the PBX senses this, it goes off-hook, then removes the ground on ring. The central office sends dial tone {{and the rest of the}} <b>call</b> <b>proceeds</b> normally.|$|R
60|$|Brother John, who, be it remembered, {{was a very}} earnest missionary by <b>calling,</b> <b>proceeded</b> to {{administer}} some compressed religious consolations, when, quite near to us, the god began to beat upon some kind of very large and deep drum. He didn't roar this time, he only worked away at a massed-band military drum. At least {{that is what it}} sounded like, and very unpleasant it was to hear in that awful forest with skulls arranged on boxes all round us, I can assure you, my reader.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{assured that}} Anty {{had not been}} smuggled upstairs, her lover, or suitor as he might perhaps be more {{confidently}} <b>called,</b> <b>proceeded</b> to visit her. If he wished her to believe that his first impulse, on hearing of her being in the house, had been to throw himself at her feet, {{it would have been}} well that this conversation should have been carried on out of her hearing. But Anty was not an exigent mistress, and was perfectly contented that as much of her recent history as possible should be explained before Martin presented himself.|$|R

500|$|Settlers {{called them}} the [...] "Chickamauga Cherokee" [...] after their {{location}} and to distinguish {{them from the}} greater Cherokee tribe. The Chickamauga (or [...] "Lower Cherokee" [...] as they were also sometimes <b>called)</b> <b>proceeded</b> to carry on an unconventional war against the encroaching Euro-American settlers, ambushing small patrols and attacking small settlements. After Oconastota's death in the early 1780s, Chief Old Tassel was recognized {{as the leader of}} the Overhill Cherokee. He sought more distance from the Chickamauga. [...] After an expedition by Sevier destroyed the Chickamauga towns in 1782, Dragging Canoe moved the Chickamaugas southwest to modern-day Marion County, Tennessee, where he continued his struggle.|$|R
30|$|AC or AUC This is the Authentication Center which {{contains}} a secured database handling authentication and encryption keys. It {{is also a}} key component of the HLR. It validates the mobile SIM (Security Information Management) card which attempts to connect to a mobile network. It verifies a mobile device by sending a randomly generated number to the mobile device. The mobile device then performs a calculation against it with a number it has stored and sends the result back. If the switch gets the number it expects then the <b>call</b> <b>proceeds.</b> The AC stores all data needed to authenticate a call and to encrypt both voice traffic and signaling messages [3].|$|R

5000|$|This is a {{monologue}} by the [...] "whoremonger" [...] prosecuting a merchant-trader for breaking into his establishment {{at night and}} attempting to carry {{off one of the}} inmates, who is produced in court. The vulgar blackguard, who is a stranger to any sort of shame, remarking that he has no evidence to <b>call,</b> <b>proceeds</b> to a peroration in the regular oratorical style, appealing to the Coan judges not to be unworthy of their traditional glories. In fact, the whole oration is also a burlesque in every detail of an Attic speech at law; and in this case we have the material from which to estimate the excellence of the parody.|$|R
60|$|Following in this direction, the Carbonels, much amused, passed {{under the}} hunt, went some {{distance}} further, {{and found a}} green churchyard, quite shut in by tall elm trees, which, from the road, almost hid the tiny tumble-down church, from whose wooden belfry the <b>call</b> <b>proceeded.</b> It really seemed {{to be buried in}} the earth, and the little side windows looked out into a ditch. There were two steps to go down into the deep porch, and within there seemed to be small space between the roof and the top of the high square pew into which they were ushered by Master Hewlett, who, it seemed, was the parish clerk.|$|R

50|$|Some Voice over IP (VoIP) {{solutions}} {{provide for}} painless encryption of voice traffic when possible. Some {{versions of the}} Sipura and Linksys lines of analog telephony adapters (ATA) include a hardware implementation of SRTP with the installation of a certificate from Voxilla, a VoIP information site. When the call is placed an attempt is made to use SRTP, if successful a series of tones are played into the handset, if not the <b>call</b> <b>proceeds</b> without using encryption. Skype and Amicima use only secure connections and Gizmo5 attempts a secure connection between its clients. Phil Zimmermann, Alan Johnston, and Jon Callas have proposed a new VoIP encryption protocol called ZRTP. They have an implementation of it called Zfone whose source and compiled binaries are available.|$|R
50|$|A third number call {{or third}} party call is an {{operator}} assisted telephone call {{that can be}} billed to the party other than the calling and called party. The operator calls the third number for the party to accept the charges before the <b>call</b> can <b>proceed.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} denotational {{semantics}} of an aspect calculus by compositional translation to a functional language with higher-order store and ML-style references. The calculus {{is designed to}} construct only “additive ” aspects i. e. {{those that do not}} elide the execution of the base computation. Such an aspect calculus is sufficiently expressive to encode before(), after() and around() advice which <b>calls</b> <b>proceed().</b> We prove that our translation is adequate i. e. it reflects observational equivalence. Further if a standard object-oriented view of labels is adopted, the translation is fully abstract i. e. it preserves and reflects observational equivalence. A pleasing consequence is that full abstraction of the targetlanguage semantics is thereby inherited by the source-language semantics. This yields the first fully abstract game model for a functional language of additive aspects. 1...|$|R

Our calculus includes type ranges, an intuitive and concise alternative to explicit type variables that allows advice to be polymorphic over intercepted methods. We use calculus parameters to cover type safety for a wide design space of other features. Type soundness is verified in Coq. ...|$|R
