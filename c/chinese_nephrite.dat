5000|$|The Burmese {{government}} under Aung San reached the Panglong Agreement with the Shan, Kachin, and Chin peoples on 12 February 1947. The agreement accepted [...] "Full autonomy in internal administration for the Frontier Areas" [...] in principle and envisioned {{the creation of}} a Kachin State by the Constituent Assembly. Kachin State was formed in 1948 out of the British Burma civil districts of Bhamo and Myitkyina, together with the larger northern district of Puta-o. The vast mountainous hinterlands are predominantly Kachin, whereas the more densely populated railway corridor and southern valleys are mostly Shan and Bamar. The northern frontier was not demarcated and until the 1960s Chinese governments had claimed the northern half of Kachin State as Chinese territory since the 18th century. Before the British rule, roughly 75% of all Kachin jadeite ended up in China, where it was prized much more highly than the local <b>Chinese</b> <b>nephrite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Osmanagić's {{theories}} and credibility {{have come under}} near-universal criticism from the scientific community since he came to prominence over the excavations at Visočica. In his doctoral thesis Osmanagič claims that the Maya Civilization predates the Olmec, and that their culture mysteriously ceased to exist after the 10th century CE. He also discusses in some detail Mayan crystal skulls, positing that they were created {{with the use of}} advanced technology, as well as discussing the alleged psychological and parapsychological phenomena surrounding them. He suggests that the Maya had contact with the Chinese, giving as an example a jade carving of a jaguar which he posits is carved from <b>Chinese</b> <b>nephrite.</b> Others have identified the material as jadeite which was used by the Mayans. His doctoral advisor was Hidajet Repovac, Professor of Sociology at Faculty of Political Science in Sarajevo who was part of the Foundation as early as 2007 and one of the co-chairmen of the 2008 International Conference on the Bosnian Pyramids.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{integrated}} analytical approach for the noninvasive characterization of <b>Chinese</b> <b>nephrite</b> samples, encompassing both geological reference specimens and museum objects. Natural variations induced by cationic substitutions, {{as well as}} human-induced alterations such as heating, which both affect color, {{are the focus of}} this contribution. Totally noninvasive methods of analysis were used, including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, visible reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction; moreover, the feasibility of using a portable Raman spectrometer for the in-field identification of jades has been demonstrated. Fe/Fe+Mg (% p. f. u.) ratios of the jades have been calculated based on hydroxyl stretching Raman bands, which will provide an important addition to similar data that are being collected at major museums in the Western and Eastern hemispheres...|$|E
