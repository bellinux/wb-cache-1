The best wavelet fusion results were combined with the IHS image fusion method using two types of <b>colour</b> <b>composites.</b> The IHS image fusion method was also implemented. The crossbred wavelet and IHS transform provides the most accurate colour representation of the spectral information of the initial bands, improving also their spatial resolution.

40|$|Autonomous sensor {{platforms}} such as unmanned {{airborne vehicles}} (UAVs) are becoming an established technology in many fields of monitoring {{and their use}} is steadily increasing, including {{in the field of}} cultural heritage. This paper presents the output achievable by a micro‐UAV for the rapid generation of aerial imagery, digital terrain models (DTM) and broadband vegetation indices for archaeological prospection from a single platform. Combined, these datasets can be used in the rapid survey of areas of interest that would not normally be considered practical due to time and cost implications and to identify archaeological features that are not readily visible in aerial imagery alone. The adoption of a single platform with a dual camera set up was used to generate a suite of datasets covering and area of 10 km 2 in seven flights. This study provides a work‐flow protocol for the deployment of a micro‐UAV in terms of data acquisition and processing {{that can be used for}} site prospection and site investigation. Real‐time processing of the aerial imagery and generation of well established broadband indices (e. g. normalized vegetation index (NDVI), false <b>colour</b> <b>composites,</b> NDVI <b>colour</b> <b>composites)</b> enabled in‐field decision making and planning to maximise the best use of researchers in the field. The time spent post‐processing data was significantly reduced as all data was sourced from one platform.

The datasets generated provided new insights into the wider context of known sites and highlighted additional areas of (human) disturbance for field reconnaissance.

However, the results for thological mapping were compromised due to the small size of the study area vis-à-vis the spatial resolution of ASTER data.

40|$|Abstract:Quality of the <b>Colour</b> <b>Composite</b> {{video signal}} {{has become the}} basic {{criteria}} of today’s TV transmission systems (Terrestrial / Satellite / Cable). Video streaming is increasingly finding its way in day-to-day lives of people. The videos typically passes through several processing stages {{before they reach the}} end user. The effect of most processing stages is to degrade the quality of the video that passes through it. The only reliable method to assess the video quality perceived by a human observer is to ask human subjects for their opinion, which is termed subjective video quality assessment (VQA). Subjective VQA is impractical for most applications due to the human involvement in the process. Hence we go for objective analysis, which includes the verifying <b>Colour</b> <b>Composite</b> Video Signal parameters like sync pulses, colour burst and the luminance.
