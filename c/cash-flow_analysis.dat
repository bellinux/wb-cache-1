40|$|Many models used in {{management}} and economics {{are based on}} an arithmetic basis. Moreover, the imperfection of generally available information in these disciplines has led to numerous decision support systems based on fuzzy arithmetic. However, their practical use did not have success expected, because their output were generally too imperfect to help a manager with relevant information. This paper outlines a computational method for decreasing the imperfection of the output of fuzzy arithmetic models. We suggest an approach aiming at integrating into the arithmetic models fuzzy information still not taken into account: the vague knowledge of the interaction potentially existing between the two variables of an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, division or product). Thanks to the modelling of three standard relations, we propose a solution towards an interactive fuzzy arithmetic, which reduces the imperfection of the output to help the decision maker. We apply this approach to the choice of investment by the criterion of the Net Present Value resulting from a Discounted <b>Cash-Flows</b> <b>Analysis...</b>|$|R

This paper introduces a costing methodology and applies it {{to a piece of}} capital equipment. Although designed for the forest industry, the methodology is readily transferable to other sectors. Based on discounted <b>cash-flow</b> <b>analysis,</b> ChargeOut! provides more accurate financial outputs than traditional single-period models. ChargeOut! produces a break-even charge-out rate that will return any specified after-tax real rate of return over the economic life of the capital equipment. Alternatively, given a negotiated charge-out rate, the model produces net present values and real and nominal rates of return before tax and financing, before tax, and after tax. It also compares the negotiated charge-out rate with the calculated break-even rate, incorporates inflation, accounts for depreciation, and automatically conducts a sensitivity analysis. Graphs illustrate the major cost centers and cash flows. The model is both automated and flexible. Interpretation of ChargeOut!’s results requires some knowledge of discounted <b>cash-flow</b> <b>analysis.</b> The target audience is financial professionals in the logging industry or equipment owners who have some background in engineering economics.

Rather than increasing the business Expected Net Present Value (that, with real interest rate of 3 %/year, is between 1. 5 €/m 2 and 2. 2 €/m 2), the optimal strategy decreases the business risk.

40|$|The {{creation}} of shareholder value {{has become the}} standard by which companies worldwide are now being judged and for global companies the value creating process is largely a matter of constructing an optimal portfolio of businesses, products, and markets.

Correspondingly, few investment decisions are as difficult to value or are characterized by more uncertainty and, consequently, more risk, than the market entry decision.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} key {{insights}} of Hyman P. Minsky in arguing why finance cannot {{be left to}} free markets, drawing on the East Asian development experience. The paper suggests that Minsky's more complete stock-flow consistent analytical framework, by putting finance {{at the center of}} analysis of economic and financial system stability, is much more pragmatic and realistic compared to the prevailing neoclassical analysis. Drawing upon the East Asian experience, the paper finds that Minsky's analysis has a system-wide slant and correctly identifies Big Government and investment as driving employment and profits, respectively. Specifically, his two-price system can aid policymakers in correcting the systemic vulnerability posed by asset bubbles. By concentrating on <b>cash-flow</b> <b>analysis</b> and funding behaviors, Minsky's analysis provides the link between cash flows and changes in balance sheets, and therefore can help identify unsustainable Ponzi processes.

40|$|This {{article will}} discuss the aspects of {{financial}} operation via <b>cash-flow</b> <b>analysis</b> in large-scale dairy farm management that strategically aims to expand its operation further. The conclusions are as follows. First, when trying to analyze management {{in the process of}} dynamic expansion, {{there was a significant difference}} in evaluating between the management analysis method with its emphasis on profitability, versus one with an emphasis on cash flow and stability. It becomes important to diagnose financial stability based on cash flow when evaluating large amounts of investment and dairy farm management in the process of further expansion. Second, the investment timing and priority were deeply related to the increase and decrease in cash amount. In dairy farm management, the production process goes through multiple stages such as feeding, raising and milking, thus decision-making concerning where to place investment priority among various sectors becomes highly critical. Especially for the type of large-scale, extensive land use dairy farming seen in Hokkaido, investment priority should be placed on milking (including the purchase of new cattle) rather than upgrading the feeding stage in order to stabilize financial operation...|$|E

40|$|Many {{guidelines}} and recommendations for sugarcane farming are aimed at achieving {{a large number of}} ratoon crops. One of the reasons for this is that the replanting costs can be considerable when a field is conventionally tilled and replanted. Thus, delaying reestablishment makes financial sense provided the cost savings are greater than any yield and revenue penalties. An alternative is to introduce a controlled traffic and zero-till farming system (CTF), thereby lowering re-establishment costs and potentially allowing for fewer ratoon crops and more frequent green manure or break crops. A rigorous yield, sucrose content, costing and <b>cash-flow</b> <b>analysis,</b> based on published research findings and detailed costing of representative machinery, showed that a CTF system with only three ratoon crops was far more profitable than a conventional farming system involving eight ratoon crops and more intensive tillage operations. A doubling in profitability was shown when the yield benefits reported with break crops and the yield decline rates reported under conventional farming systems were included in the analysis. Substantial gains in water use productivity were also shown, up to nearly 80 % improvement over a conventional farming system. Adoption of a CTF system with only three ratoon crops is therefore highly recommended and should be taken very seriously by decision-makers in the sugarcane industry...|$|E

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{population growth}} and resource scarcity {{have led to a}} recent renaissance of food production research. Over the past few decades, scientists have discovered new and innovative methods for growing food that, cumulatively, may hold the key to efficiently and sustainably feeding an ever-increasing world population. One method, known as aquaponics, has shown promise as being a sustainable solution for producing food locally {{in all parts of the}} world. Although many studies have shown aquaponic food production to be technically feasible, there are relatively few studies concerning the economic feasibility of aquaponics in various regions. To determine whether aquaponics could be economically feasible under greenhouse conditions in temperate climates, cost and revenue data for constructing and operating the University of the Virgin Islands’ Commercial Aquaponics 2 system were collected from various sources. These data were then used to develop enterprise budgets for the aquaponic production of tilapia, lettuce and basil. Additional financial analyses included the calculation of break-even prices for each crop, a <b>cash-flow</b> <b>analysis</b> of three farm scenarios and the determination of investment payback period. Overall, it appears that aquaponic food production using the UVI CA 2 system could be economically feasible in temperate climates, assuming a proper selection of crops, in conjunction with the existence of viable markets.
