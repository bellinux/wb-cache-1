60|$|Although, however, direct {{verification}} is impossible, {{there is}} an indirect verification, which is scarcely of less value, and which is always practicable. The conclusion drawn as to the individual case can only be directly verified in that case; but it is verified indirectly, by the verification of other conclusions, drawn in other individual cases from the same laws. The experience which comes too late to verify the particular proposition to which it refers, is {{not too late to}} help toward verifying the general sufficiency of the theory. The test of the degree in which the science affords safe ground for predicting (and consequently for practically dealing with) what has not yet happened, is the degree in which it would have enabled us to predict what has actually occurred. Before our theory of the influence of a particular cause, in a given state of circumstances, can be entirely trusted, we must be able to explain and account for the existing state of all that portion of the social phenomena which that cause has a tendency to influence. If, for instance, we would apply our speculations in political economy to the prediction or guidance of the phenomena of any country, we must be able to explain all the mercantile or industrial facts of a general character, appertaining to the present state of that country; to point out causes sufficient to account for all of them, and prove, or show good ground for supposing, that these causes have really existed. If we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> it is a proof either that the facts which ought {{to be taken into account}} are not yet completely known to us, or that although we know the facts, we are not masters of a sufficiently perfect theory to enable us to assign their consequences. In either case we are not, in the present state of our knowledge, fully competent to draw conclusions, speculative or practical, for that country. In like manner, if we would attempt to judge of the effect which any political institution would have, supposing that it could be introduced into any given country, we must be able to show that the existing state of the practical government of that country, and of whatever else depends thereon, together with the particular character and tendencies of the people, and their state in respect to the various elements of social well-being, are such as the institutions they have lived under, in conjunction with the other circumstances of their nature or of their position, were calculated to produce.|$|E
60|$|In {{the inaugural}} address I briefly {{pointed out the}} total {{inadequacy}} of disunion as a remedy for {{the differences between the}} people of the two sections. I did so in language which I can not improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat: One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them, Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you. There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one-third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up {{on the part of the}} seceding section the fugitive-slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place.|$|E

5000|$|Tischendorf {{persuaded the}} monks {{to present the}} {{manuscript}} to Tsar Alexander II of Russia, {{at the cost of}} the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those ignorant of the details of his discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant monastery librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>done.</b> <b>This</b> token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a [...] "Schenkungsurkunde". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the National Russian Library the existence cannot be disputed in earnest National Russian Library. In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of [...] "von" [...] Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the Rus' state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.|$|R

40|$|By {{examining}} how care is {{practiced in the}} community in Thailand {{from the perspective of}} people with disabilities (PWDs), this paper attempts to trace how “disability” enhances communication between PWDs and people in the community, and how it organizes the human network towards formation of a new community that shares commonality and sociality. PWDs have needs for care which the public care system does not suffi ciently support. The more severe their disability, the greater will be demand for care to meet their basic daily care needs. Therefore, most Thais with disabilities who live in a community depend on care given by family or neighbors. It is not uncommon in Thai society for family take care of a disabled member with the cooperation of a wider network of kin. In addition to family support, most PWDs can utilize inexpensive community services. Thus, PWDs live closely with people in the community. In my investigation in Thailand, however, the role of “care” is not only in providing services for PWDs. It also functions as a tool for building relationships between PWDs and people in the community, as well as among PWDs. Through the practice of care, PWDs construct new relationships and re-defi ne what they can and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> means that disability no longer depends solely on the physical condition of PWDs, but rather that it must be defi ned as being created in the social processes involving both the PWDs and the surrounding environment. Relationships among PWDs as well as between PWDs and non-PWDs are based on the fact of “disability. ” Due to this common premise, PWDs and community members can have basic communication, and PWDs can gain care from them smoothly. In their community, PWDs manage their life and getting care by using disability as a skill of communication. Through cooperative activities of care, PWDs are creating a new community by sharing the common experience of disability and care, extending the practice of care into the public sphere...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} and development program was designed to improve nondestructive evaluation of large mechanical objects by providing both fast and thermal neutron sources for radiography. Neutron radiography permits inspection inside objects that x-rays cannot penetrate and permits imaging of corrosion and cracks in low-density materials. Discovering of fatigue cracks and corrosion in piping without the necessity of insulation removal is possible. Neutron radiography sources can provide for the nondestructive testing interests of commercial and military aircraft, public utilities and petrochemical organizations. Three neutron prototype neutron generators were designed and fabricated based on original research done at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The {{research and}} development of these generators was successfully continued by LBNL and Adelphi Technology Inc. under this STTR. The original design goals of high neutron yield and generator robustness have been achieved, using new technology developed under this grant. In one prototype generator, the fast neutron yield and brightness was roughly 10 times larger than previously marketed neutron generators using the same deuterium-deuterium reaction. In another generator, we integrate a moderator with a fast neutron source, resulting in a high brightness thermal neutron generator. The moderator acts as both conventional moderator and mechanical and electrical support structure for the generator and effectively mimics a nuclear reactor. In addition to the new prototype generators, an entirely new plasma ion source for neutron production was developed. First developed by LBNL, this source uses a spiral antenna to more efficiently couple the RF radiation into the plasma, reducing the required gas pressure so that the generator head can be completely sealed, permitting the possible use of tritium gas. This also permits the generator to use the deuterium-tritium reaction to produce 14 -MeV neutrons with increases of yield of two orders of magnitude. The first fast neutron radiographic images were obtained using neutron cameras and a new fast neutron generator. These early images demonstrated the feasibility of using fast neutrons for imaging and penetrating thick objects of high density and imaging. Fast neutrons can be used to image low atomic number materials (e. g. plastics, explosives, lubricants and ceramics) that are shielded by high density materials (e. g. lead, tungsten and uranium). Fast neutron radiography {{could be used as a}} means to screen weapons for flaws and chemical stability. X-ray radiography <b>can</b> <b>not</b> easily <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Fast neutron imaging is technically difficult and, consequently, a completely undeveloped market. Two of the generators were designed to have small source size and high brightness, ideal for fast-neutron imaging. With these generators we successfully used two fast neutron cameras: one developed by us, and another developed by a collaborator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, CSIRO. We have successfully used these cameras to obtain low resolution images of various objects such as pipe fittings filled with water and other mechanical objects. Higher resolution and contrast images are expected by decreasing the source size and increasing generator yield...|$|R
40|$|With the {{priority}} of poverty reduction and with accelerating change in many dimensions, up-to-date and realistically informed perceptions of the lives and conditions {{of people living in}} poverty have come to matter more than ever. At the same time, new pressures and incentives increasingly trap decision-makers in headquarters and capital cities, reinforcing earlier (1983) analysis of the attraction of urban ‘cores’ and the neglect of rural ‘peripheries’. These trends make decision-makers’ learning about poverty and from people living in poverty rarer and ever more important. One common means has been rural development tourism, the phenomenon of the brief rural visit from an urban centre. In 1983, six biases of such visits – spatial, project, person, seasonal, diplomatic and professional - against seeing, meeting and learning from the poorer people, were identified and described. Security can now be added as a seventh. Much can be done to offset the biases. The solution is to make more visits, not fewer, and to enjoy doing them better. In addition, new and promising approaches have been pioneered for experiential, direct learning, face-to-face with poor and marginalised people. Examples are: UNHCR’s annual participatory assessments by staff; SDC’s ‘views of the poor’ participatory research in Tanzania; and various forms of immersion, most recently those being convened and organised by ActionAid International. In many immersions, outsiders become guests for a few days and nights, and live, experience and learn in a community. The question now is not how an organisation can afford the time and other resources for immersions for its staff. It is how, if it is seriously pro-poor, it <b>can</b> possibly <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. <b>This</b> paper is a challenge to development actors to practice a responsible pro-poor professionalism; to be pioneers and champions, seizing and making space for themselves and others to offset the biases and traps of headquarters and capital cities; and to have the vision and guts to seek out direct experiential learning and so to be in touch and up-to-date with the realities of the people living in poverty whom they seek to serve.

Katalikų bažnyčia išleido katechetinius dokumentus, kuriuose pabrėžiamas dėmesys suaugusiųjų švietimui, padedančiam suaugusiesiems pažinti save, analizuoti visuomenėje vykstančius reiškinius ir prisideda prie pilietiš- kumo ugdymo. Straipsnyje analizuojami neformaliojo katalikiškojo suaugusiųjų švietimo ypatumai. In our {{contemporary}} society {{a lot of}} traditional values like family, freedom lose their importance. People are often intolerant each other because of their religious or nationality. With the weakening of social relations people feel unsafe for their future, they trying to find meaning of live, but alone often they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> These problems can help to solve informal adult catholic education, which are very important because helps people to know themselves, analyzes various phenomena in society and contributes to citizenship promoting. There is much information about children catholic education, however, adult education is little researched in the literature. The aim of research is identify the importance of informal adult catholic education. Objectives of research: To reveal the importance of informal adult education. To explain catholic education value for human and society. To dispute informal catholic adult education programs. To define and empirically verified informal catholic adult education features, motives and interferences. Methods of research: the analysis of scientific literature and other sources, empirical research – questionnaire survey. After the analysis of literature and different sources it is based that informal education can solve different problems. Informal education {{can be divided into}} informal vocational education, which helps to adapt to a constantly changing labour market and non-vocational training, which helps to develop socio-cultural competences. It was explained that the informal catholic adult education is valuable, because it promotes citizenship, community, tolerance and ability to live in a diverse society. There are many adult catholic education programs, some of them help reduce social exclusion, help people, who are in critical situation, other programs help improve social skills, know themselves. The empirical research ascertained that the main interferences for adult learning are lack of money and lack of time...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} {{is recognized}} as a dominant mechanism for converting magnetic energy into the convective and thermal energy of particles, and the driver of explosive events in nature and laboratory. Magnetic reconnection is often modeled using resistive magnetohydrodynamics, in which collisions play the key role in facilitating the release {{of energy in the}} explosive events. However, in space plasma the collisional resistivity is far below the required resistivity to explain the observed energy release rate. Turbulence is common in plasmas and the anomalous resistivity induced by the turbulence has been proposed as a mechanism for breaking the frozen-in condition in magnetic reconnection. Turbulence-driven resistivity has remained a poorly understood, but widely invoked mechanism for nearly 50 years. The goal of this project is to understand what role anomalous resistivity plays in fast magnetic reconnection. Turbulence has been observed in the intense current layers that develop during magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetosphere. Electron streaming {{is believed to be the}} source of this turbulence. Using kinetic theory and 3 D particle-in-cell simulations, we study the nonlinear development of streaming instabilities in 3 D magnetic reconnection with a strong guide field. Early in time an intense current sheet develops around the x-line and drives the Buneman instability. Electron holes, which are bipolar spatial localized electric field structures, form and then self-destruct creating a region of strong turbulence around the x-line. At late time turbulence with a characteristic frequency in the lower hybrid range also develops, leading to a very complex mix of interactions. The difficulty we face in this project is how to address a long-standing problem in nonlinear kinetic theory: how to treat large amplitude perturbations and the associated strong wave-particle interactions. In my thesis, I address this long-standing problem using particle-in-cell simulations and linear kinetic theory. Some important physics have been revealed. 1 : The lower hybrid instability (LHI) dominates the dynamics in low $beta$ plasma in combination with either the electron-electron two-stream instability (ETS) or the Buneman instability (BI), depending on the parallel phase speed of the LHI. 2 : An instability with a high phase speed is required to tap the energy of the high velocity electrons. The BI with its low phase speed, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> The ETS and the LHI both have high phase speed. 3 : The condition for the formation of stable electron holes requires $|v_p -v_g|< sqrt{ 2 e|phi|/m_e}$, where $|phi|$ is the amplitude of the electric potential, and $v_p$ and $v_g$ are the phase and group velocity of the relevant waves. Like ETS and BI, LHI all can form electron holes. 4 : The overlapping resonance in phase space is the dominant mechanism for transporting the momentum and energy from high velocity electrons to low velocity electrons, which then couple to the ions...|$|E
40|$|Continuum {{mechanics}} is nowadays {{widely used}} to describe the material behavior of systems, which occupies a specific area in space. In contrast to atomistic and molecular models, which can be solved using molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo simulations, we consider the system to exist as a continuum. Due to their different material behavior we distinguish between solid mechanics and fluid mechanics. The typical deformation of the former one allows us to follow the movement of each particle in space, whereas we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> for the latter one. This leads to different formulations, which will be presented here. Typically, we want to achieve a solution for the balance of linear momentum for the continuum mechanical system. Additionally, we will derive a pure mass transport problem to demonstrate the capabilities of the numerical framework we have developed to solve these kind of problems. Once we have introduced the continuum mechanical framework, we can extent this to include further physical effects. Moreover, we extent the solid mechanical system to include thermal contributions and apply an additional pressure field to enforce the incompressibility of the fluids in the case of low Mach numbers. Within the continuous setting, we can define various interfaces. Internal interfaces can be used to decompose bodies into different subsets, e. g. to define areas with different physical properties or, on a more technical level, to enable parallelization on modern cluster architectures. External interfaces on solids can be used to include contact between multiple bodies. Additionally we could establish an interface at the external boundary to transfer momentum between a solid and the surrounding fluid. To avoid technical problems in the case of large deformations of solids, embedded within a fluid, we employ continuum immersed strategies to include the effects of fluid-structure interaction. Finally, we want to use phase field models for the simulation of phase separation and coarsening in solder alloys. We obtain sharp interfaces between the phases using the well known Cahn-Hilliard model to represent the free energy of the phases {{as well as of the}} interface. Similar to the immersed strategies, we aim at the simulation of the whole domain, avoiding the explicit representation of interfaces. To solve the arising initial boundary value problem in space, we first apply the finite element method for all problems at hand. In particular, we introduce Lagrangian as well as NURBS based shape functions for the underlying approximation of the field equations, written in weak form. Furthermore, we show how to incorporate discrete interface models in an optimal sense with regard to the consistency error at the interface using the Mortar method. The application of Mortar methods to NURBS will be shown as well. Due to the higher continuity requirement of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the use of NURBS seems to be natural for this kind of problems. Since we deal with initial boundary value problems, suitable time integration schemes have to be developed as well. In general, we use a common implicit integration scheme for all problems at hand, such that we could use various fields simultaneously in a consistent framework. If possible, we aim at the development of structure preserving integrators, since they provide enhanced numerical stability for large time steps. For the explicit interface representation we apply additional augmentation techniques to simplify the algebraic constraints and verify the underlying conservation properties. Kontinuumsmechanische Ansätze werden heutzutage häufig zur Beschreibung des Materialverhaltens von Körpern verwendet. Im Gegensatz zu atomaren und molekularen Modellen, die via Molecular Dynamics oder Monte-Carlo Ansätzen simuliert werden können, betrachten wir das System als kontinuierlich. Aufgrund des unterschiedlichen Materialverhaltens unterscheiden wir hierbei zwischen Festkörper- und Fluidmechanik. Die typischen Deformationen von Festkörpern erlauben das verfolgen jedes einzelnen Partikels im Raum, was für die Fluidmechanik nicht möglich ist. Beide Formulierungen werden im Weiteren präsentiert. Das Ziel der verwendeten Ansätze ist die Lösung der Impulsbilanz für das kontinuumsmechanische System. Des Weiteren betrachten wir ein reines Massentransportsystem, um die Möglichkeiten des entwickelten numerischen Lösungsansatzes zu demonstrieren. Zusätzlich können weitere physikalische Effekte in das System mit eingebunden werden, so z. B. thermische Beiträge sowie Druckfelder um die Inkompressibilität von Fluiden bei niedrigen Machzahlen zu erfassen. Innerhalb der kontinuierlichen Darstellung können wir verschiedene Grenzflächen definieren. So können wir interne Zerlegungen von Körpern vorzunehmen, um z. B. Gebiete mit unterschiedlichen physikalischen Charakteristika zu definieren oder, auf einer mehr technischen Ebene, eine Parallelisierung auf modernen Rechnerarchitekturen zu ermöglichen. Externe Grenzflächen können für die Simulation von Kontaktvorgängen verwendet werden. Des Weiteren können wir externe Ränder für den Impulstransfer zwischen einem Körper und dem ihn umgebenen Fluid definieren. Zuletzt wird ein Phasen-Feld Modell für die Simulation einer Phasentrennung in Legierungen untersucht. Hierzu verwenden wir das bekannte Cahn-Hilliard Modell, um die freie Energie der Phasen als auch der Grenzflächen erfassen zu können. Wie zuvor für die Fluid-Struktur Interaktionen verwenden wir Ansätze die eine explizite Repräsentation der Grenzflächen vermeiden. Für die Lösung des Anfangs-Randwertproblems im Raum wenden wir eine Finite-Elemente Methode an. Hierzu kommen sowohl Lagrange als auch auf NURBS basierende Formfunktionen zur Anwendung. Für die Grenzflächen verwenden wir eine variationell konsistente Mortar-Methode. Die Anwendung von Mortar-Methoden für NURBS Funktionen wird ebenfalls gezeigt. Für die zeitliche Diskretisierung des Anfangs-Randwertproblems verwenden wir ein konsistentes Integrationsverfahren für alle vorkommenden Probleme. Soweit möglich, etablieren wir ein strukturerhaltendes Zeitintegrationsverfahren, was uns eine erhebliche Verbesserung der Stabilität bei Verwendung großer Zeitschritte erlaubt...|$|E
40|$|Collectively, {{the tenets}} and {{principles}} of management {{emphasize the importance of}} recognizing and understanding limits. These tenets require the demonstration, measurement and practical use of information about limits to natural variation. It is important to identify limits so as not to incur the risks and loss of integrity when limits are exceeded. Thus, by managing within natural limits, humans (managers) simultaneously can achieve sustainability and minimize risk, as well as account for complexity. This {{is at the heart of}} systemic management. Systemic management embodies the basic tenets of management. One tenet requires that management ensure that nothing exceed the limits observed in its natural variation. This tenet is based on the principle that variation is constrained by a variety of limiting factors, many of which involve risks. Another tenet of management requires that such factors be considered simultaneously, exhaustively, and in proportion to their relative importance. These factors, in combination, make up the complexity that managers are required to consider in applying the basic principles of management. This combination of elements is reflected in observed limits to natural variation that account for each factor and its relative importance. This paper summarizes conclusions from the literature that has addressed the concept of limits to natural variation, especially in regard to management. It describes: 1. How such limits are inherent to complex systems; 2. How limits have been recognized to be important to the process of management; 3. How they can be used in management. The inherent limits include both those set by the context in which systems occur (extrinsic factors) as well as those set by the components and processes within systems (intrinsic factors). This paper shows that information about limits is of utility in guiding human action to fit humans within the normal range of natural variation. This is part of systemic management: finding an integral and sustainable place for humans in systems such as ecosystems and the biosphere. Another part of sustainability, however, involves action to promote systems capable of sustainably supporting humans and human activities, not only as individuals, but also as a species. It is important to distinguish what can and what <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>done</b> in <b>this</b> regard...|$|R

40|$|THEME: Interdisciplinary: Changing Views It is {{generally}} understood that game {{development is a}} collaborative art – requiring and benefiting from the talents of individuals from disperse disciplines and backgrounds. In a professional setting, these individuals {{may or may not}} find ways to communicate effectively, {{depending on the size of}} the team and the strength of its leadership. But in the end, they are generally employed under the assumption that they can and will find their way amongst those of differing educations and biases to some sort of collaborative effort, harmonious or not. If they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in the end, they can always be replaced. The basic nature of cross-disciplinary trial and error in a business setting is quite brutal: those who can play well with others, stay; those who cannot, move on. This rather haphazard approach to collaborative practice may have worked to date, but as game development becomes more and more complex, more specialized and requiring of larger and larger teams, the question of how to train a new generation of developers, not only in their own specializations, but in cross-disciplinary teamwork seems more important than ever. At the University of Southern California, there are a number of initiatives underway that try to answer not only the question of how or under what discipline to teach games, but, more importantly, how to create cross-disciplinary communities of students and researchers that can from the foundations for multi-talented teams that all speak and play the same language of game design. One such initiative is the USC Game Design Community. The goal of this organization is to use game play itself as a community building tool and design practice, to build a community of game designers and developers who communicate in the shared language of activity and play. Inspired by independent and alternative games culture, the USC Game Design Community is a collaboration between the Institute for Multimedia Literacy at the Annenberg Center for Communication and the Interactive Media Division at the USC School of Cinema-Television. Monthly game play events alternate between the Institute for Multimedia Literacy and the Game Innovation Lab at the School of Cinema-Television. These events include experimental play projects, game critique salons, and social teambuilding exercises. Through these interactions, the IML and the Interactive Media Division hope to raise cross-disciplinary dialogue, build a community based in playful practice, and empower students and researchers from all areas of game expertise to expand the palette of game design for the future. The results of these community building efforts will hopefully be seen in a series of interdisciplinary game projects funded by the Interactive Media Division and supported by the Game Design Community. The past year has included the following initial events which have each been documented and evaluated as to their success in building community and creating shared practices between various disciplines: a) Cooperative Game Play Experiment Inspired by the New Games Movement of the 1970 ’s, the Cooperative Game Play Experiment is an ongoing investigation into building community through play. By exploring the New Games Movement, the community hopes to facilitate discussion around the social mechanisms of digital games and how they can be improved for more quality social interaction – both in our games and in our development teams. b) Surrealist Game Play Experiment Inspired by Surrealist games and activities, the Surrealist Game Play Experiment is an ongoing investigation into unlocking creativity and introducing playful practice into the game design process. Word games, visual plays, provocations and re-inventions are the heart of Surrealist games and activities, a sort of "provocative magic" that results in unexpected and surprising results. By playing these games, the community hopes to spur creative thinking and discussion about the nature and practice of art and design and its relation to the more technical aspects of game design. c) Game Salons In an effort to promote literacy and critical thinking, the Game Salons are regular screenings and "deconstruction" of influential new video games. Game features are presented by students who have developed extensive save files and are prepared to discuss the game critically. Games include the controversial Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and other influential titles. d) Teambuilding Events The community provides an ongoing forum for networking and team-building across University departments. Currently, this has been specifically geared toward development of teams for the Game Innovation Lab Research Grant (see below). In addition to in person networking via board games and multiplayer game events, prospective projects and talent are all listed on the community site for potential match-making. e) Game Innovation Lab Research Grant This grant provides $ 20, 000 in funding for innovative games. The grant is awarded to multiple, cross-disciplinary student design teams based on project submissions. One or more teams receive a grant in the Fall, in the Spring, and in the Summer. Winning teams receive up to $ 20, 000, a team office and equipment in the EA Game Innovation Lab, access to the lab’s usability testing facility and a faculty advisor/executive producer. All USC students are eligible to participate. The goals of the grant are to: • Provide funding and support for innovative student game projects and cross-disciplinary game development • Address important design problems that may have useful applications in the game industry • Investigate new game mechanics and push current game models beyond existing genres Current projects funded under the Game Innovation Grant are: Dyadin – Cooperative Game Play This project explores the potential of cooperative play mechanics in a 2 -player adventure game. The story of Dyadin involves two overlapping worlds, and two characters occupying these worlds, but only able to affect objects in their own space. The core mechanic involves moving closer or farther away from the other character to change color and affect objects in the space. Players must cooperate or they cannot escape the puzzle and combat based levels. Dyadin was funded by the Game Innovation Lab as the first in a series of student-produced games addressing important design problems and innovations. The crew is a cross-disciplinary team from the School of Cinema-TV Interactive Media Division and the Viterbi School of Engineering. The Spring 2005 project(s) will be announced in December 2004. This experiment in using experimental types of game play to bring together a cross-disciplinary game design community is an ongoing process. The proposed article would be an evaluation of the various techniques attempted and the success, failure and learning found in them. In addition to post-mortem analysis, documentary footage and game results, there is also the potential to play some of the more successful game experiments with the conference audience, thereby extending the reach of the community beyond the limits of the USC campus...|$|E
