5|$|Napoleon emancipated Jews, {{as well as}} Protestants in Catholic {{countries}} and <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> Protestant countries, from laws which restricted them to ghettos, and he expanded their rights to property, worship, and careers.

5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|After the {{transfer}} of Louisiana to the United States, the Spanish had ended subsidies to the Catholic Church in St. Louis. As a result, <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> St. Louis had no resident priest until the arrival of Louis William Valentine Dubourg in early January 1818. Upon his arrival, he replaced the original log chapel with a brick church, recruited priests, and established a seminary. By 1826, a separate St. Louis diocese was created.

5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E
5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E

5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, {{members of}} the Protestant Dissenter {{tradition}} (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>in</b> a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, {{with the aim of}} creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
