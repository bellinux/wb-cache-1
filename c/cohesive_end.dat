5000|$|Restriction enzymes can {{generate}} {{a wide variety}} of ends in the DNA they digest, but in cloning experiments most commonly-used restriction enzymes generate a 4-base single-stranded overhang called the sticky or <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> (exceptions include NdeI which generates a 2-base overhang, and those that generate blunt ends). These sticky ends can anneal to other compatible ends and become ligated in a sticky-end (or <b>cohesive</b> <b>end)</b> ligation. EcoRI for example generates an AATT end, and since A and T have lower melting temperature than C and G, its melting temperature Tm is low at around 6°C. For most restriction enzymes, the overhangs generated have a Tm that is around 15°C. [...] For practical purposes, sticky end ligations are performed at 12-16°C, or at room temperature, or alternatively at 4°C for a longer period.|$|E
5000|$|A sticky or <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> has {{protruding}} single-stranded strands with unpaired nucleotides called overhangs, each overhang can anneal {{with another}} complementary one to form base pairs. The two complementary cohesive ends of DNA can anneal together via hydrogen bonding, {{the stability of}} these paired ends depends on the melting temperature of the paired overhangs. DNA ligase can join two adjacent strands of DNA by forming a covalent bond between the sugar-phosphate moieties of adjacent nucleotides to join the two together via a phosphodiester bond in a process called ligation. The blunt ends however do not have such protruding strands, and therefore cannot anneal together, and consequently ligation between blunt ends is less efficient.|$|E

5000|$|An adapter or linker in genetic {{engineering}} is a short, chemically synthesized, single-stranded or double-stranded oligonucleotide {{that can be}} ligated {{to the ends of}} other DNA or RNA molecules. Double stranded adapters can be synthesized to have blunt ends to both terminals or to have sticky end at one end and blunt end at the other. For instance, a double stranded DNA adapter can be used to link the ends of two other DNA molecules (i.e, ends that do not have [...] "sticky ends", that is complementary protruding single strands by themselves). It may be used to add sticky ends to cDNA allowing it to be ligated into the plasmid much more efficiently. Two adapters could base pair to each other to form dimers.A conversion adapter is used to join a DNA insert cut with one Restriction enzyme, say EcoRl, with a vector opened with another enzyme, Bam Hl. This adapter can be used to convert the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> produced by Bam Hl to one produced by Eco Rl or vice versa.One of its applications is ligating cDNA into a plasmid or other vectors instead of using Terminal deoxynucleotide Transferase enzyme to add poly A to the cDNA fragment.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> site (cos) is {{the site}} of action of {{bacteriophage}} lambda terminase, the enzyme that introduces staggered nicks to generate the 12 -base cohesive ends of mature lambda DNA. Deletion mutations that remove the lambda <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> sequence have been isolated after in vitro mutagenesis. The deletions were obtained by digesting the DNA of a cos duplication phage with S 1 nuclease to remove the cohesive ends and adjacent base pairs, followed by blunt end ligation and DNA packaging into phage particles. cos 2 {{is the result of a}} 22 -base-pair deletion that exactly removes the segment of rotational symmetry that includes the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> sequence. The cos 2 mutation abolishes nicking by terminase but does not affect terminase binding. We conclude that cos contains two sites that interact with terminase: cosN, the nicking site; and cosB, a binding site for terminase...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage lambda {{packages}} the DNA of {{the related}} phage 21 poorly [Hohn, B. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 93 [...] 106]. To {{understand the nature}} of the packaging defect, the interaction of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> site (cos) specific for phage 21 (cos phi 21) with phage lambda terminase has been investigated. The ability of lambda terminase to cleave cos phi 21 was studied in vitro; lambda terminase cleaved cos phi 21 only 1 % as well as it cleaved the phage lambda <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> site (cos lambda). In vitro packaging experiments showed that the lambda and 21 packaging specificities observed in vivo are also found in vitro. The cos cleavage reaction was modified so that competition experiments could be performed; these experiments showed that cos phi 21 was unable to bind lambda terminase, thus identifying the nature of the defect. Previous work [Feiss, M., Fisher, R. A., Siegele, D. A., Nichols, B. P. & Donelson, J. E. (1979) Virology 92, 56 [...] 67] has shown that the base pairs giving lambda or 21 packaging specificity are at the left end of the chromosome, outside the 22 -base-pair symmetry region that includes the annealed cohesive ends. Therefore, terminase binding to cos requires interactions with base pairs to the Nu 1 side of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> symmetry segment. The evidence supports the proposition that cos consists of adjacent sites for binding of terminase and for nicking by terminase. Because cos phi 21 can be cut by lambda terminase to terminate DNA packaging, it is proposed that the terminase that binds and nicks at the initial cos site is brought into contact with the terminal cos site by the packaging process. Terminase recognizes and nicks the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> sequence of the terminal cos without requiring the binding site...|$|E
40|$|The {{ring closure}} probability, or j factor, has been {{measured}} for DNA restriction fragments of defined sequence bearing EcoRI <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> and {{ranging in size}} from 126 to 4361 base pairs (bp). The j factor is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium constants for cyclization and for bimolecular association via the <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends.</b> The end-joining reactions are fast compared to covalent closure of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> by T 4 DNA ligase. The rate of ligase closure is shown to be proportional to the equilibrium fraction of DNA molecules with joined <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends,</b> both in cyclization and in bimolecular association reactions. The j factor changes by less than 10 -fold between 242 and 4361 bp, whereas it decreases by more than 100 -fold between 242 and 126 bp as the DNA reaches the size range of the persistence length (150 bp). As regards ring closure, short DNA fragments are surprisingly flexible. These data are in good agreement with predictions by others for the ring closure probability of a wormlike chain...|$|R
40|$|The 0. 048502 {{megabase}} (Mb), primarily double-stranded DNA of {{bacteriophage lambda}} has single-stranded, complementary termini (<b>cohesive</b> <b>ends)</b> that undergo either spontaneous intramolecular joining to form open circular DNA or spontaneous intermolecular joining to form linear, end-to-end oligomeric DNAs (concatemers); concatemers also cyclize. In the present study, {{the effects of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the cyclization and concatemerization of lambda DNA are determined at temperatures that, {{in the absence of}} PEG, favor dissociation of <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends.</b> Circular and linear lambda DNA, monomeric and concatemeric, are observed by use of pulsed field agarose gel (PFG) electrophoresis. During preparation of lambda DNA for these studies, hydrodynamic shear-induced, partial dissociation of joined <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> is fortuitously observed. Although joined lambda <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> progressively dissociate as their temperature is raised in the buffer used here (0. 1 M NaCl, 0. 01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7. 4, 0. 001 M EDTA), when PEG is added to this buffer, raising the temperature sometimes promotes joining of <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends.</b> Conditions for promotion of primarily either cyclization or concatemerization are described. Open circular DNAs as long as a 7 -mer are produced and resolved. The concentration of PEG required to promote joining of <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> decreases as the molecular weight of the PEG increases. The rate of cyclization is brought, the first time, to values that are high enough to be comparable to the rate observed in vivo. For double-stranded DNA bacteriophages that have a linear replicative form of DNA (bacteriophage T 7, for example), a suppression, sometimes observed here, of cyclization mimics a suppression of cyclization previously observed in vivo. The PEG, temperature effects on DNA joining are explained by both the excluded volume of PEG random coils and an increase in this excluded volume that occurs when temperature increases...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a modification to the lambda vector EMBL 3 which greatly expedites {{the construction of}} restriction maps of cloned DNA sequences. In the modified vector, EMBL 3 cos, all the phage coding sequences are placed {{to the right of}} the cloning sites so that the left <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> is separated by only 200 bp, rather than 20 kb (as in conventional lambda vectors), from the inserted DNA fragment. We show that reliable restriction maps can be rapidly constructed from partial digests of clones made in this vector by labelling the left <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> with a complementary 32 P-labelled oligonucleotide. In addition, we quantify the restriction of clones containing human DNA by the McrA and McrB systems of E. coli and show that the use of Mcr- plating strains can increase the yield of recombinant phage up to tenfold, to give cloning efficiencies of greater than or equal to 10 (7) pfu/microgram of human DNA...|$|E

40|$|Integrated {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA {{is found}} in hepatocellular carcinomas which develop in HBV carriers. Presented here are the results of analyses of four integrants that show chromosomal rearrangements associated with the integrated HBV DNA. Two clones (p 4 and C 15) {{were found to have}} large inverted repeating structures, each consisting of HBV genome along with flanking cellular sequences. The structure must have arisen by duplication of the primary integrant, including the flanking cellular DNA, followed by recombination within the viral DNA. One of the two viral arms in each clone joins to the other viral arm at the "cohesive end region. " Two clones (DA 2 - 2 and DA 2 - 6) were found to have integrated HBV sequences, each flanked by cellular DNAs from different chromosomes (chromosome X joined to 17 and chromosome 5 joined to 9). They must be the products of cellular DNA translocations using the integrated HBV DNA as the switch point. The viral DNA in each clone is a continuous stretch of a single virus genome with one end in the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> region.

40|$|Loss of a {{functional}} mismatch repair (MMR) system in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells {{is associated with}} microsatellite instability and increased sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. In this study, we have investigated whether a defect in double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) could explain why MMR-deficient CRC cells are hypersensitive to camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor. To evaluate the efficiency and the fidelity of DSB repair, we have transiently transfected plasmids containing <b>cohesive</b> or non-complementary <b>ends</b> in cells with various MMR defects. We have observed that the repair efficiency of DSB with <b>cohesive</b> and non-complementary <b>ends</b> is comparable in all cell lines. In contrast to the MMR-proficient cell line HT 29, the MMR-deficient cell lines were highly accurate in repairing DSB with <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends,</b> but this characteristic could not be directly assigned to the primary MMR deficiency. Furthermore, CPT treatment had no detectable effect on the repair of <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> but significantly decreased the repair efficiency of non-complementary DSB. In conclusion, although our observations show that DSB repair efficiency by NHEJ decreases upon treatment with CPT, which possibly contributes to its cytotoxicity, it is quite unlikely that it accounts for the hypersensitivity of MMR-deficient cells to topoisomerase inhibitors...|$|R

Effective treatments require that the organisms be speciated and that drug susceptibilities for the causative organisms be characterized. Reporter phage technology has been developed as a rapid and convenient method for identifying mycobacterial species and evaluating drug resistance. In this report we describe the construction of luciferase reporter phages from mycobacterio-phage D 29 DNA. Shuttle phasmids were first constructed with D 29 {{in order to identify}} non-essential regions of the D 29 genomes and to introduce unique cloning sites within that region. Using this approach, we observed that all of the D 29 shuttle phasmids had the cosmid vector localized to one area of the phage genome near one <b>cohesive</b> <b>end.</b> These shuttle phasmids had been constructed with a cosmid that could be readily excised from the D 29 genome with different sets of restriction enzymes. Luciferase reporter phages were made by substituting the luciferase cassette for the cosmid vector. Recombinant phages with the luciferase cassette fall into two groups. One group produced light and had the expression cassette oriented with the promoter directing transcription away from the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end.</b> In contrast, the other group had the expression cassette in the opposite orientation and failed to produce light during lytic infection, but did produce light in L 5 lysogens which are known to repress D 29 promoters. These results suggest that a phage promoter of the D 29 phage can occlude the expression of a promoter introduced into this region. D 29 luciferase reporter phages are capable of detecting low numbers of L 5 lysogens like L 5 luciferase phages. However, unlike L 5 luciferase phages, D 29 luciferase phages can readily infect M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, demonstrating that these phages can be used to evaluate drug susceptibilities of many types of mycobacteria...|$|E

These complemen-tary <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> can form hybrids to link two sequences. Because the overhangs cre-ated by l exonuclease are slightly longer than the complementary sequence, after hy-brid formation, a stretch of single-strand gap remains, which then is repaired by Klenow (3 ¢® 5 ¢ exo-) enzyme. The repair process also stabilizes the linkage. Because of the independence from natural or artifi-cial restriction sites, this method allows rapid and precise insertion of one DNA fragment into another at virtually any posi-tion.
