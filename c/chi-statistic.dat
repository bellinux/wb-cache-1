40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel term selection method called distance to transition point (DTP) that is equally effective for unsupervised and supervised term selection. DTP computes {{the distance between}} the frequency of a term and the transition point (TP) and then by using this distance as a criterion, it selects the terms more close to TP. Experimental results on Spanish texts show that feature selection by DTP achieves superior performance to document frequency, and comparable performance to information gain and <b>chi-statistic.</b> Moreover, when DTP is used to select terms in an unsupervised policy, it improves the performance of traditional classification algorithms such as k-NN and Rocchio...|$|E
40|$|Noncentral {{distributions}} {{appear in}} two sample problems {{and are often}} used in several fields, for example, in biostatistics. A higher order approximation for a percentage point of the noncentral t-distribution under normality is given by Akahira (1995) and is also shown to be numerically better than others. In this article, without the normality assumption, we obtain a higher order approximation to a percentage point {{of the distribution of}} a noncentral t-statistic, in a similar way to Akahira (1995) where the statistic based on a linear combination of a normal random variable and a <b>chi-statistic</b> takes an important role. Its application to the confidence limit and the confidence interval for a noncentrality parameter are also given. Further, a numerical comparison of the higher order approximation with the limiting normal distribution is done and the former one is shown to be more accurate. As a result of the numerical calculation, the higher order approximation seems to be useful in practical situations, when the size of sample is not so small.
