40|$|Air-gap {{structures}} {{are of particular}} interest for packaging of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In this work, an overcoat material is used to cover a sacrificial polymer, which protects the MEMS device during packaging. Once the overcoat is in place, the sacrificial polymer is thermally decomposed freeing the MEMS structure while the overcoat dielectric provides mechanical protection from the environment. An epoxy POSS dielectric {{was used as a}} high-selectivity etch mask for the PPC and a rigid overcoat for the structure leading to the process improvements. The packaging structures can be designed for a range of MEMS device sizes and operating environments. However, the air-cavity structures need additional rigidity to withstand chip-level packaging conditions. Metalized air <b>cavity</b> <b>packages</b> were molded under traditional lead frame molding pressures and tested for mechanical integrity. The experimental molding tests and mechanical models were used to establish processing conditions and physical designs for the cavities as a function of cavity size. A semi-hermetic package was created using an in-situ sacrificial decomposition/epoxy cure molding step for creating large <b>cavity</b> chip <b>packages.</b> Through the optimization of the air cavity, new materials and processes were tested for general microfabrication. The epoxy POSS dielectric provides a resilient, strong inorganic/organic hybrid dielectric for use in microfabrication and packaging applications. Polycarbonates can be used for low cost temporary adhesives in wafer-wafer bonding. An improved electroless deposition process for silver and copper was developed.

40|$|An {{approach}} to curing thermosetting polymers ist {{the use of}} Variable Frequency Microwave (VFM) systems, which {{have been shown to}} cure encapsulation materials in substantially shorter times than conventional methods. The microwave curing of thermosetting polymer material is a complex process, with interactions between electromagnetic field intensity, temperature, polymer cure kinetics and resulting development of potential thermomechanical stresses. As the real-time in-situ experimental analysis of a number of these parameters is extremely challenging, a numerical model has been developed to assess this process. The integration of microwave curing into an existing assembly machine imposes the requirement of a compact microwave system, based on a solid state source.

40|$|Welcome {{to the new}} {{electronic}} {{plastic packaging}} paradigm! Several circumstances could help drive the component packaging industry to modern materials and processes. Most do not realize that our “modern ” plastic packages use very old materials and processes that have been pushed to their limits by increasing performance demands. After more than 50 years of epoxy resins and transfer molding, events are unfolding that open up opportunities for high-performance thermoplastics and automatic injection molding. Thermoplastics not only have superior properties, they’re halogen-free and can be completely recycled. But more motivating is the versatility of thermoplastic molding that can readily produce low cost <b>cavity</b> <b>packages</b> suitable for MEMS and MOEMS. Complex designs can also be manufactured without added cost and this includes multichip packages.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} {{of a new generation of}} innovative thermoplastics for microelectronic and photonic applications is essential to make <b>cavity</b> <b>packages</b> able to compete with ceramic packages in terms of cost and design flexibility. Among plastic materials, thermoplastic resins such as Liquid Crystal Polymers (LCP) offer attractive properties including low gas permeation, high temperature resistance, thermal stability and low dielectric constant (3. 1 at 1 MHz and 2. 8 at 10 GHz). However LCP present anisotropic mechanical properties (Young’s modulus, CTE, …) due to the straight rigid molecular chains oriented parallel to the molding direction during processing. The difference of properties between the molding direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD) of injection could induce a potential fragility of the material and then a lack of reliability of the package. In the present study, silica nanoparticles are introduced into the LCP matrix to reduce the anisotropy factor. The mineral fillers have been functionalized by sol-gel method using various chemical functions. The impact of the functionalization on the anisotropy factor is studied.

40|$|For {{the next}} {{generation}} of compact high-power FELs a new cryomodule is required that is capable of accelerating up to Ampere levels of beam current. Challenges include strong HOM damping, high HOM power and high fundamental-mode power (in operating scenarios without full energy recovery). For efficient use of space a high real-estate gradient is desirable and for economic operation good fundamental-mode efficiency is important. The technology must also be robust and should be based on well-proven and reliable technologies. For Ampere-class levels of beam current both halo interception and beam break-up (BBU) are important considerations. These factors tend to drive the designs to lower frequencies where the apertures are larger and the transverse impedances are lower. To achieve these goals we propose to use a compact waveguide-damped multi-cell <b>cavity</b> <b>packaged</b> in an SNS-style cryomodule. CONCEPT Future high-power FEL’s for scientific, defense or industrial applications could benefit from a compact, economical and efficient accelerator layout. A small but powerful energy recovered linac (ERL) with a single high-current cryomodule could meet those requirements. The parameters for such a module are listed in table 1 and can be met using six strongly HOM damped multi-cell cavities, figure 1, in a stretched SNS-style cryomodule [1].

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a MEMS RF switch designed and developed specifically for space communication systems, {{with a novel}} geometry and operating mode that overcome the drawbacks of previous devices. To avoid the need for high voltage control, the switch uses electro-thermal rather than electrostatic operation; although this requires higher power consumption during switching, a latching configuration was used such that the hold power is zero in either switch state. This requires that the actuation is lateral (with respect to the chip surface) rather than vertical as in most MEMS switches. Lateral actuation allowed a large open-state separation to be achieved, leading to high-isolation performance. The latching operation also inherently provides high mechanical stability. While most reported MEMS switches have been 2 -port series or shunt switches, the system requirement addressed here was for a 3 -port, single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch (i. e. one input, two selectable outputs). To keep the device compact, this necessitated the use of strongly confining transmission lines, so thin-film microstrip (TFMS), rather than coplanar waveguides (CPWG), was used. By integrating low-loss TFMS with our novel MEMS switch geometry, the SPDT switch operation was achieved with good initial performance, including operating voltage 3 V, isolation 50 dB and insertion loss 1. 8 dB at 5 GHz, and operating range 1 - 20 GHz.

40|$|Aluminum wire bonds, {{as used in}} {{a ceramic}} air <b>cavity</b> <b>package</b> for LDMOS, will {{intrinsically}} be prone to mechanical fatigue due to temperature and power cycling causing the wires to expand and shrink in a cyclical way. Under certain pulsed application conditions, the required amount of current cycles the product must survive is so high that not just low cycle fatigue, caused by cyclic plastic deformation, but also high cycle fatigue becomes a concern. This paper describes how in-situ monitored power cycling experiments, using the Joule heating of the bond wires, were performed on dedicated test structures at different stress levels with wire loop shapes and test settings critical enough to find failures within reasonable test times. Wire bond settings were varied to create different amounts of initial damage as introduced by the plastic deformation of the heel and the wedge. Finite element method was employed to calculate the stress amplitude in the heel of the bond wire in the experiments as function of current, pulse time and loop shape. This required a multi-physics approach using coupled electro-thermal and sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical simulations. The amount of initial damage was also estimated, using 2 D FE simulations, in order to quantitatively {{take into account the}} initial plastic strains. With the measured failure times (Nf) and calculated stress amplitude (S) the durability or S-N curves for different amounts of initial damage could be derived and fitted with the Basquin model. These fitted models were used to predict the expected lifetime for specified field conditions. Furthermore the models can be used to derive ‘design for reliability rules ’ for wire loop shapes that will survive a specified user profile. 1...|$|E

This dissertation reports the conceptual design, fabrication implementation, and experimental application of a piezoelectrically tunable Microoptoelectromechanical System (MOEMS) device as the central system for a combined spectral/time-resolved fluorescence biosensor for tissue characterization. From design point of view, this dissertation examined the theoretical characteristics using a piezoelectric multimorph model with the appropriate diffraction geometry and evaluated the ray tracing geometries to estimate the system spectroscopic performance. To realize the MOEMS device, the fabrication was divided into three main parts: 1) Piezoelectrically actuated grating, 2) microoptics for light coupling, and 3) a three-dimensional aligned packaging. The micrograting actuator was fabricated via bulk-micromachining process with a ZnO thin-film sandwich to provide linear actuation with input voltage. Its performance is characterized by measured frequency response and linearity of actuation as well as the optical efficiency of its lithographically patterned grating.

The approaches {{are based on}} temporary handling and permanent bonding of cap structures using adhesives or solder onto passive or active silicon wafers which are populated with MEMS components or the MEMS wafer themselves. Firstly, {{an overview of the}} possible packaging configurations based on different types of MEMS is discussed where TSV based and non-TSV based packaging solutions are distinguished in general. The cap in a TSV based solution can have the same lateral size as the MEMS carrying substrate, since the electrical contacts for the MEMS can be routed either thought the cap or base substrate. Thus, full format cap wafers can be used i n a regular wafer to wafer bonding process to create the wafer level <b>cavity</b> <b>packages.</b> However, if no TSVs are present in the cap or base substrate, the caps need to be smaller than the base chips, so that electrical contacts outside the cap area can be accessed after the caps were bonded.

Two options to create such help wafers with pre-arranged caps will be discussed in detail here in this manuscript...|$|R

40|$|The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) [1] will {{demonstrate}} ionization cooling {{in a short}} section of a realistic cooling channel using a muon beam at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK. The MICE RF and Coupling Coil (RFCC) Module consists of a superconducting solenoid mounted around four normal conducting 201. 25 -MHz RF <b>cavities.</b> The coil <b>package</b> that surrounds the RF cavities is to be mounted in a 1. 4 m diameter vacuum vessel. The coupling coil confines the beam in the RFCC module within the radius of the RF cavity beam windows. Each coupling magnet will be powered by a 300 A, 10 V power supply. The maximum design longitudinal force that will be carried by the cold mass support system is 0. 5 MN. The detailed design {{and analysis of the}} coupling magnet has been completed by ICST. The primary magnetic and mechanical design features of the coils are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Microbolometers are {{the most}} widely used {{detectors}} in long-wave infrared uncooled thermal imagers. An optical cavity is required within a microbolometer structure to increase its optical absorption. In this work we present a detailed study on the design and optimization of a microbolometer optical <b>cavity</b> using Essential-Macleod <b>package.</b> In the simulations, the cavity is considered as thin film multi-layers that form cascaded Fabry-Perot optical cavities. In the design phase, the structures of layers are selected, which includes selection of materials and initial thickness. The absorbing layers are chosen to be made of vanadium-pentoxide (V 2 O 5) and titanium (Ti). In the optimization phase, the designed layer thicknesses are varied to maximize optical absorption within the absorbing layers. The simulations show that Ti layer absorption dominates over the V 2 O 5 layer. Also, the optimization proves that the thickness of cavity's air-gap is not equal simply to quarter-wavelength, {{because of the presence of}} a complex cascaded Fabry-Perot structure. The optimized air-gap thickness is found to be ≈ 3. 5 µm at wavelength of 10. 6 µm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{thin-film}} encapsulation process, featuring low-temperature steps, {{hermetic sealing}} (preliminary), and RF-compatible shell, is reported. Uniquely attractive {{as compared with}} the existing MEMS packaging approaches is its capability to monolithically package metal microstructures inside a microcavity on chip in one continuous surface-micromachining process. The key for this process is a technique to fabricate a large freestanding porous membrane on chip by postdeposition anodization of thin-film aluminum at room temperature. The porous-alumina mem-brane allows for the diffusion of gas or liquid etchants through the nanopores to etch away the sacrificial material underneath, freeing the movable microstructures encapsulated inside the cav-ity. To seal the package, a thin film is deposited over the alu-mina shell whose nanoscale pores of a high aspect ratio (> 30) do not allow any detectable penetration of the sealing mater-ial. The low-temperature (< 300 ◦C) encapsulation process pro-duced a low-pressure seal (8 torr), monitored by a Pirani pressure gauge that also represents an encapsulated freestanding metal microstructure in the <b>cavity.</b> The thin-film <b>package</b> demonstrated a considerably low RF insertion loss of less than 0. 1 dB up to 40 GHz.
