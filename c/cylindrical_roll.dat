Afa is made from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the niu'afa (afa palm). The husks are soaked in fresh water to soften the interfibrous portion. The husks from mature nuts must be soaked from four to five weeks, or perhaps even longer, and very mature fibre is best soaked in salt water, but the green husk from a special variety of coconut is ready in four or five days.Soaking is considered {{to improve the quality}} of the fibre.

When this stage is completed, the fibres are manufactured into sennit by plaiting, a task usually done by elderly men or matai, and performed at their leisure. This usually involves them seated on the ground rolling the dried fibre strands against their bare thigh by hand, until heavier strands are formed.

These pupate in the rolls {{during the second half}} of April and beginning of May. At the turn of April and May, beetles fly onto host woody plants of the 1 st age class. They damage about 30 cm 2 of leaves in two months. Females create about 30 leaf rolls into which they lay 1 to 5 (on average 1. 1) eggs. The species develops through two larval instars, which damage 1. 7 to 2. 3 cm 2 of leaves and come of age towards the end of the growing season. On the primary shoots of oaks (with relatively large leaves), the females rolled below‑average sized leaves. On the secondary shoots (with relatively small leaves), they rolled leaves of average to above‑average size. The female gnaws a deep mine into the main vein (in a third of its length) from the adaxial side first. Then she makes a cross cut into the blade from both sides up to the main vein, which is damaged only on the surface. Into thicker sections of veins she bites out (mainly from the abaxial side) on average 350 cross cuts.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{properties of}} a new chromatographic support recently developed in this laboratory were experimentally evaluated and correlated with a modified van Deemter equation. Experimental techniques for reproducibly packing columns with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rolls</b> of woven cellulosic fabrics, also called rolled stationary phases, were a key step in investigating the properties of this material. Over 40 columns were packed and found to consistently give stable operating pressure for interstitial flow velocities up to 100 cm/min and plate heights of 2 to 20 mm. Retention behavior of molecular probes ranging in molecular weights from 18 to 2 million showed a sharp molecular cut-off at molecular weights {{equal to or greater}} than 3350. Improved plate heights were also obtained by detergent scouring and mild enzyme based surface cleaning methods, which decreased plate height by 50 % or more. These results suggest that opening the yarn up may reduce flow impedances in a manner which reduces dispersion. ^ Most importantly, the solute dispersion was found to be independent of flow rate for interstitial velocities greater than 20 cm/min. This is consistent with earlier observations of a flat plate height curve for other types of rolled stationary phases, and gives an indication that mobile phase flow occurs in the spaces between the fibers as well as the yarns of the textile fabric. An analysis of the theory of hydrodynamic chromatography in packed beds on non-porous spherical particles showed that this behavior is expected when convective flow dominates the solute transport process in the void volume between the nonporous particles. This concept was extended to the rolled stationary phases where fibers are the smallest structures in a macroporous assembly of yarns. Convective transport was shown to dominate over diffusive transport for probes whose molecular weight exceeded 3350. ^ The rapid separation of protein, bovine serum albumin (MW = 66, 000) from a small solute, NaCl, in 90 seconds or less indicated the potential usefulness of this type of stationary phase for rapid size exclusion chromatography. The utility of the approach was further illustrated by the rapid separation and partial removal of denaturants from a recombinant protein, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, which improved its processing into the renatured form. ...|$|R

Helicity {{is a measure of the}} strength of flow and its twist: the helicity density is the scalar product of the velocity of the flow and its vorticity. The vorticity is the curl of the velocity and thus gives a measure of the twist around the direction of motion.

40|$|Conventional liquid {{lubricants}} {{are faced}} with limitations under extreme cyclic operating conditions, such as in applications that require lubrication when changing from atmospheric pressure to ultrahigh vacuum and ambient air to dry nitrogen (e. g., satellite components), and room to elevated (> 500 °C) temperatures (e. g., aerospace bearings). Alternatively, solid lubricant coatings {{can be used in}} conditions where synthetic liquid lubricants and greases are not applicable; however, individual solid lubricant phases usually perform best only for a limited range of operating conditions. Therefore, solid lubricants that can adequately perform over a wider range of environmental conditions are needed, especially during thermal cycling with temperatures exceeding 500 °C. One potential material class investigated in this dissertation is lubricious oxides, because unlike other solid lubricant coatings they are typically thermodynamically stable in air and at elevated temperatures. While past studies have been focused on binary metal oxide coatings, such as ZnO, there have been very few ternary oxide and no reported quaternary oxide investigations. The premise behind the addition of the third and fourth refractory metals Ti and Zr is {{to increase the number of}} hard and wear resistant phases while maintaining solid lubrication with ZnO. Therefore, the major focus of this dissertation is to investigate the processing-structure-tribological property relations of composite ZnO, TiO 2 and ZrO 2 phases that form ternary (ZnTi) xOy and quaternary (ZnTiZr) xOy nanocrystalline coatings. The coatings were processed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using a selective variation of ALD parameters. The growth structure and chemical composition of as-deposited and ex situ annealed ternary and quaternary oxide coatings were studied by combined x-ray diffraction/focused ion beam microscopy/cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy/Auger electron spectroscopy, respectively. It was determined that the structure varied from purely nanocrystalline (ternary oxides) to composite amorphous/nanocrystalline (quaternary oxides) depending on ALD parameters and annealing temperatures. In particular, the ZnTiO 3 ilmenite phase with (104) textured nanocolumnar grains, exhibiting high stacking fault/partial dislocation densities > 1012 /cm 2, was responsible for the excellent tribological behavior. Steady-state sliding friction coefficients down to 0. 12 in humid air and 0. 2 in dry nitrogen were measured along with sliding and fretting wear factors in the range of 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 mm 3 /N·m, even after ex situ annealing to 550 °C. Additionally, the quaternary oxide phase Zn(Ti,Zr) O 3 in solid solution exhibited a low fretting wear rate of 1 x 10 - 6 mm 3 /N·m. In contrast, certain phases, such as Zn 2 TiO 4 cubic spinel, that form at annealing temperatures > 550 °C were responsible for high friction and wear. Mechanistic studies using the above techniques revealed low friction and wear-reducing surfaces and subsurfaces were due to different velocity accommodation modes (VAM). In the case of the ternary system, sliding-induced plastic deformation was possible when ZnTiO 3 (104) stacking faults, bordered by partial dislocations, serve as a pathway for the dislocations to glide parallel to the sliding direction and hence achieve low friction and wear via an intrafilm shear VAM. It was evident that the individual nanocolumnar ZnTiO 3 grains were plastically sheared as opposed to being fractured during wear. Conversely for the quaternary system, an interfacial sliding VAM between the counterface and a mechanically mixed layer (tribofilm) composed of the refined coating and counterface material, that also served as a source for the formation of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rolls,</b> was responsible for wear reduction. Therefore, these lubricious oxides are a potential candidate for solid lubrication at high temperatures (up to 550 °C) and in space environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cylindrical roller {{bearings}} with hollow rollers are advantageous in applications where weight, lubrication and speed are major considerations in {{the operations of}} the bearings. An improvement in load distribution and thus load capacity may be realized, as well as contact stress is also reduced considerably by using a bearing with hollow rollers. Since from the implementation, for hollow roller bearing no method is available for the calculation of hollowness and contact stresses and ultimately premature failure will occur without performing its optimum life. In the present work failure analysis of Hollow Cylindrical Roller Bearing (HCRB) made from AISI 52100 is carried out to understand the type and mode of failure.

40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of several naturally occurring minerals {{are known to}} contain various deformities such as cones, cylinders, and tapered hollow cylinders with different apex angles, which {{have been described as}} solid and hollow cones, “cups”, “lampshades” as well as <b>rolled</b> <b>cylindrical</b> planes. The present study was undertaken to determine how these different shapes within a crystal structure can be explained. Since the usual method of observing them is by either X-ray and electron diffraction or electron microscopy, we investigated Fourier transforms of these forms, which were considered in terms of spirals with varying radii. Three types of spirals were considered, namely: 1) Archimedean spiral; 2) Involute of a circle or power spiral and 3) Logarithmic spiral. Spiraling caused the radius r to be modified by a factor f(θ) , so that r becomes rf(θ) , where f(θ) = θ for Archimedean helix, θn for power helices like θ 1 / 2 for Fermat’s helix, θ- 1 for hyperbolic helix and eθ or e-θ for logarithmic helix, r and θ being co-ordinates of the map on which the helix has to be drawn, f(θ) is unaffected by the magnitude of r. Expressions have been derived that explain the diffraction of structures containing the distortions described above, and bring all of these phenomena under one “umbrella” of a comprehensive theory...|$|R
