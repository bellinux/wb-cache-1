60|$|Off {{we started}} {{again in the}} {{direction}} from which the faint murmur seemed to come, groping our way as before along the rocky walls. I remember that I laid down the basket full of diamonds, wishing {{to be rid of}} its weight, but on second thoughts took it up again. One might as well die rich as poor, I reflected. As we went the sound became more and more audible, till at last it seemed quite loud in the quiet. On, yet on; now we could distinctly make out the unmistakable swirl of rushing water. And yet how could there be running water {{in the bowels of the}} earth? Now we were quite near it, and Good, who was leading, swore that he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{old-timer}} on Sulphur Creek was right, {{he thought}} {{in the moment of}} controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept {{his head to one side}} to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.|$|E
60|$|A man crawled {{upon his}} belly through the snow. On every hand loomed the moose-hide lodges of the camp. Here {{and there a}} miserable dog howled or snarled abuse upon his neighbor. Once, one of them {{approached}} the creeping man, but the man became motionless. The dog came closer and sniffed, and came yet closer, till its nose touched the strange object which {{had not been there}} when darkness fell. Then Hitchcock, for it was Hitchcock, upreared suddenly, shooting an unmittened hand out to the brute's shaggy throat. And the dog knew its death in that clutch, and when the man moved on, was left broken-necked under the stars. In this manner Hitchcock made the chief's lodge. For long he lay in the snow without, listening to the voices of the occupants and striving to locate Sipsu. Evidently there were many in the tent, and from the sounds they were in high excitement. At last he heard the girl's voice, and crawled around so that only the moose-hide divided them. Then burrowing in the snow, he slowly wormed his head and shoulders underneath. When the warm inner air smote his face, he stopped and waited, his legs and the greater part of his body still on the outside. He could see nothing, nor did he dare lift his head. On one side of him was a skin bale. He <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it,</b> though he carefully felt to be certain. On the other side his face barely touched a furry garment which he knew clothed a body. This must be Sipsu. Though he wished she would speak again, he resolved to risk it.|$|E

40|$|The urinary {{excretion}} of (an) odorous substance(s) {{after eating}} asparagus {{is not an}} inborn error of metabolism as has been supposed. The detection of the odour constitutes a specific smell hypersensitivity. Those who <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the odour in their own urine <b>could</b> all <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> in the urine of anyone who had eaten asparagus, {{whether or not that}} person was able to <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> himself. Thresholds for detecting the odour appeared to be bimodal in distribution, with 10 % of 307 subjects tested able to <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> at high dilutions, suggesting a genetically determined specific hypersensitivity...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the smoke}} in eastern North America was borne aloft by climatic {{conditions}} to high altitudes.

Explanations included nuclear armageddon, local fires, supernatural forces, a solar eclipse and alien invasion.|$|R
5000|$|Alder died in June 1958, aged 55. The {{cause of}} his death is unknown, however his {{body was found in}} his {{apartment}} in Cologne, Germany after two weeks. His niece, who found the body, stated that the odor of rotting flesh was so bad that she <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> from the street outside. Gertrud Alder reported that her husband was incredibly distressed when she last saw him and often muttered the phrase [...] "Les Jardins du Souvenir" [...] whilst writing out his research notes.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 Festival, held in Birmingham with Aston University as lead University partner, {{featured}} a prank event: {{the unveiling of}} Dulcis foetidus, a fictional plant purported to emit a pungent odour. An experiment in herd mentality, some audience members were induced into believing they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> The Festival also hosts the x-change- a lively informal roundup of the day's events where festival-goers can ask questions, debate and hear star speakers.The Festival has also been the home to protest and debate. In 1970 there were protestors {{over the use of}} science for weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{format of}} the show is {{basically}} the same, except that tasting time has been completely eliminated for the contestants (Sekiguchi and Miyake still get to taste the works in progress). The contestant roster was expanded from 7 to 11 (occasionally 9), with 4 celebrity contestants (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi still appeared as a regular) and 7 (occasionally 5) additional contestants, called [...] "Hara-Helicopters," [...] drawn from a pool. Typically, the Hara-Helicopters are everyday people, though some groups are distinctly categorized, e.g. schoolchildren, [...] "idols," [...] "young men who have not eaten for 48 hours," [...] or restaurateurs. During the preparation of the meals, the celebrity contestants would be allowed to observe each chef's methods up close, and smell/feel (not taste) the various ingredients used, while the Hara-Helicopters would watch the action from their seats overlooking the stage. In some episodes, Kusanagi would bring a plate of one of the special ingredients up to the Hara-Helicopters so they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> The series went on hiatus on September 14, 2006and returned on January 4, 2007 for a one-time only TV special.http://www.ytv.co.jp/docchi/dotch_set.html ...|$|E

When we came down to drink I knew that no danger lurked near upon {{this side of the}} water hole, for else the zebras would have {{discovered}} it and fled before we came; but upon the other side toward which the wind blows danger might lie concealed. We <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> for its scent is being blown in the other direction, and so I bent my ears and eyes down wind where my nose cannot travel." ...|$|R
60|$|Over {{in the top}} of a tall {{pine tree}} Blacky the Crow was hiding and chuckling to himself as he watched. Reddy Fox was getting impatient. He was hungry. He had had no breakfast, and as he lay hiding in the hollow log, he could peep out and see all the good things, and he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them, too. <b>It</b> seemed as if his stomach would just give him no peace at all. He wished that Sammy Jay would bring the false message that Bowser the Hound was coming, so as to frighten all the rest away.|$|R
5000|$|Rudd {{became a}} {{vegetarian}} after passing Harris Ranch, California's largest factory farm, during a United States tour. Rudd described {{in an interview}} with PETA how the experience made him change his diet, saying: [...] animals stood crammed together on this piece of land. They could hardly move as the area was too small for all those animals. Plus, they'd already eaten or trampled down the grass and all the feces were just left there. They were standing in their own waste and—what I found worse—even had to eat it because the workers didn't offer them anything else. I asked the driver about it and he said, [...] "Well, that's California's biggest beef producer." [...] I <b>could</b> still <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> after we had driven for another 30 kilometers. That was when I knew it was the right choice to go vegetarian.|$|R
5000|$|He only {{traveled}} {{a few yards}} and came back, ice sticking to his body. We asked him to not try again, but he insisted. Someone grabbed some short rope and battery cables and he went out again, maybe only going 30 feet. We pulled him back. Someone had backed up their jeep and we picked him up {{and put him in}} there. All anyone could do was tell the survivors was to hold on not to give up hope. There were a few pieces of the plane on shore that were smoldering and you could hear the screams of the survivors. More people arrived near the shore from the bridge but nobody could do anything. The ice was broken up {{and there was no way}} to walk out there. It was so eerie, an entire plane vanished except for a tail section, the survivors and a few pieces of plane debris. The smell of jet fuel was everywhere and you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> on your clothes. The snow on the banks was easily two feet high and your legs and feet would fall deep into it every time you moved from the water.|$|E
5000|$|I drove there, with an SS driver....We <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> {{kilometers}} away. The road ran {{alongside the}} railway tracks. As we got nearer Treblinka but still perhaps fifteen, twenty minutes' drive away, {{we began to}} see corpses next to the rails, first just two or three, then more and as we drove into what was Treblinka station, {{there were hundreds of}} them - just lying there - they'd obviously been there for days, in the heat. In the station was a train full of Jews, some dead, some still alive - it {{looked as if it had}} been there for days.When I entered the camp and got out of the car on the square I stepped knee-deep into money; I didn't know which way to turn, where to go. I waded in notes, currency, precious stones, jewelry, clothes... The smell was indescribable; the hundreds, no, the thousands of bodies everywhere, decomposing, putrefying. Across the square in the woods, just a few hundred yards away on the other side of the barbed-wire fence and all around the perimeter of the camp, there were tents and open fires with groups of Ukrainian guards and girls - whores from Warsaw I found out later - weaving, drunk, dancing, singing, playing music - Dr Eberl, the Kommandant showed me around the camp, there was shooting everywhere ...|$|E
5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his career}} Horn was {{appointed}} to referee the Leeds United v Valencia match in the Inter Cities Fairs Cup on 2 February 1966. Jack Charlton, after being struck by a Valencian player, struck out and a free-for-all ensued, only to be broken up by the police. Horn lead both sides off the pitch, expelling Charlton and Vidagany in the tunnel. Of this game, Jack Charlton said: [...] "One of the greatest storms in European football burst about the heads of Leeds United when they played Valencia. I was in the centre of the row - three players, including myself, were ordered off; both teams were also summoned from the field for a spell to allow heated tempers to cool" [...] Horn claimed: 'Money was the cause of the trouble. You <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> on the pitch.' Don Revie, said: 'If this is European football I think we are better out of it'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hill {{made his}} first Broadway stage {{appearance}} in Ben Hecht's A Flag Is Born in 1946, which also featured a young Marlon Brando. Hill said that his big break came when he landed a small part in the hit Broadway show Mister Roberts. [...] "The director, Joshua Logan, thought I had some ability, and he let me create one of the scenes," [...] said Hill. [...] "So, I improvised dialog and it went in the show. That was my first endorsement. It gave me tremendous encouragement {{to stay in the}} business." [...] Hill said this was a thrilling time in his life when, fresh out of the Navy, he played the hapless sailor Stefanowski. [...] "You <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> from the very first reading that took place; {{this is going to be}} an overwhelming hit," [...] said Hill. [...] "We all felt it and experienced it and were convinced of it, and we were riding the crest of a wave from the very first day of rehearsals." ...|$|R

60|$|All at {{once there}} was a sound like a tiny muffled {{explosion}} and the cover lifted right up on a level plane a few inches; there was no mistaking anything now, for the whole room was full of a blaze of light. Then the cover, staying fast at one side rose slowly up on the other, as though yielding to some pressure of balance. The coffer still continued to glow; from it began to steal a faint greenish smoke. I <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> fully on account of the respirator; but, even through that, I was conscious of a strange pungent odour. Then this smoke began to grow thicker, and to roll out in volumes of ever increasing density till the whole room began to get obscure. I had a terrible desire to rush over to Margaret, whom I saw through the smoke still standing erect behind the couch. Then, as I looked, I saw Doctor Winchester sink down. He was not unconscious; for he waved his hand back and forward, as though to forbid any one to come to him. At this time the figures of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck were becoming indistinct in the smoke which rolled round them in thick billowy clouds. Finally I lost sight of them altogether. The coffer still continued to glow; but the lamps began to grow dim. At first I thought that their light was being overpowered by the thick black smoke; but presently I saw that they were, one by one, burning out. They must have burned quickly to produce such fierce and vivid flames.|$|R
