Other analysts have however continued to assert that ongoing tensions over currency valuation remain, with currency war and even trade war still a significant risk.

40|$|In the postglobal {{financial}} crisis period, the central {{banks of the}} advanced economies pursued unconventional monetary policies, such as the United States (US) Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE).

In this paper, we examine the spillovers from the taper tantrum on emerging markets more rigorously by using econometric analysis to empirically assess the effect on equity markets in emerging markets.

[...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Federal Reserve <b>Chairman</b> <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> {{recipe for}} deflation fighting {{and the specific}} policy actions he took {{in the aftermath of}} the 2008 financial crisis. Both in his academic and in his policy work, Bernanke has made the case that monetary policy is able to stem deflationary forces largely because of its "fiscal components," and that governments like those in the United States or Japan face no constraints in financing these fiscal components. On the other hand, he has recently expressed strong concerns about the size of the federal budget deficit, calling for its reversal in the name of financial sustainability. The paper argues that these positions are fundamentally at odds with each other, and resolves the paradox by arguing on theoretical and technical grounds that there are no fundamental differences in financing conventional government spending programs and what Bernanke considers to be the fiscal components of monetary policy.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically examine the effect on US stock, bond and real estate {{investment}} trust (REIT) prices triggered by the US Federal Reserve <b>Chairman</b> <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> announcement of a possible intent to unwind, or taper, quantitative easing (QE). In particular, the author assessed whether the effect of the “Taper Tantrum” was fundamental or financial on financial markets. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology used to determine whether the effect of the “Taper Tantrum” was fundamental or purely financial is that suggested by French and Roll (1986) as extended by Tuluca et al. (2003). The analysis is based on daily data for large cap stocks, small cap stocks, long-term bonds and REITs for 18 months before <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> announcement and for 18 months after the announcement. Findings – The results show that the “Taper Tantrum” had a fundamental, rather than a financial effect on all asset classes, especially so for REITs. Practical implications – The author also found that in the post-taper period following <b>Ben</b> <b>Bernanke’s</b> announcement the correlation of REITs with stocks decreased compared with pre-taper period, whereas the correlation of REITS with bonds increased substantially. In other words, the “Taper Tantrum” had a profound effect on the risk/return benefits of including REITs in the US mixed-asset portfolio. Originality/value – This is the first paper to examine the effect of the “Taper Tantrum” on REITs...|$|R
