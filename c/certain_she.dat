5|$|Óláfr {{is known}} to have been survived by three {{children}}; Haraldr (d. 1248), Rögnvaldr (d. 1249), and Magnús (d. 1265)—all of whom ruled as kings in their own right. Although the mother of Óláfr's children is not known for <b>certain,</b> <b>she</b> is thought to have been Christina. The Chronicle of Mann states that Óláfr's immediate successor, Haraldr, was only fourteen {{years old at the time}} of his father's death, which dates his birth to about the time of the marriage of Óláfr and Christina.|$|E
5|$|Coltrane was the Simpsons fourth cat, {{adopted from}} an animal shelter {{shortly after the}} death of Snowball III. Lisa is not <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> wants another cat, but her other one has haunted her and Coltrane name wins her over due to its {{resemblance}} of jazz musician John Coltrane's name. Upon bringing Coltrane home, Lisa decides to play him some of John Coltrane music on her saxophone, but the noise frightens him and he commits suicide by jumping out the window. Coltrane was the Simpsons only cat since Snowball I to have been white, although {{he was the only one}} not to be named Snowball. However, Lisa evidently considers him as part of the Snowball lineage, as she names her next cat Snowball V, implying that Coltrane was Snowball IV.|$|E
5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes {{that a lot of}} her exploits are poorly documented, and it is not always possible to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E

25|$|Based on the Pairi {{inscription}} {{dated to}} her 3rd Regnal Year, it appears she enjoyed a sole reign. How {{much of her}} reign was as coregent and how much as sole ruler {{is a matter of}} debate and speculation. The same tomb inscription mentions an Amun temple in Thebes, perhaps a mortuary complex, which would seem to indicate that the Amun proscription had abated and the traditional religion was being restored towards the end of her reign. Since much of her funeral equipment was used in Tutankhamen's burial, it seems fairly <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> was denied a pharaonic burial by her successor. The reasons for this remain speculation, as does a regency with Tutankhaten.|$|E
25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a psychotic episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards. Desmond and Celia recognise the sadness of the true events, but now knowing the facts are able to face a future together.|$|E
500|$|Murasaki {{disliked the}} men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> was {{involved}} romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote {{to him in a}} poem, [...] "You have neither read my book, nor won my love." [...] In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of Genji. However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described his daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the [...] "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.|$|E

500|$|Shark {{sightings}} increased {{along the}} Mid-Atlantic Coast following the attacks. On July 8, armed motorboats patrolling {{the beach at}} Spring Creek chased an animal they {{thought to be a}} shark, and Asbury Park's Asbury Avenue Beach was closed after lifeguard Benjamin Everingham claimed to have beaten off a [...] long shark with an oar. Sharks were spotted near Bayonne, New Jersey; Rocky Point, New York; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Jacksonville, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama, and a columnist from Field & Stream captured a sandbar shark in the surf at Beach Haven. Actress Gertrude Hoffmann was swimming at the Coney Island beach shortly after the Matawan fatalities when she claimed to have encountered a shark. The New York Times noted that Hoffman [...] "had {{the presence of mind to}} remember that she had read in the Times that a bather can scare away a shark by splashing, and she beat up the water furiously." [...] Hoffman was <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> was going to be devoured by the [...] "Jersey man-eater", but later admitted she was [...] "not sure... whether she had had her trouble for nothing or had barely escaped death." ...|$|E
500|$|On the topic, Krause elaborated: [...] "The {{only one}} who didn't do {{anything}} particularly heroic was Sloan. That made him being with Addison at the end even better, because she was using him to sate a desire {{and that was very}} clear." [...] Krause positively reviewed the idea of Ellis Grey's becoming temporarily lucid, deeming it [...] "amazing": [...] "She was not very endearing when she was lucid, that's for <b>certain.</b> <b>She</b> was unbelievably cruel to Meredith, telling her how disappointed she was that Meredith was merely ordinary. Ouch. But she did a great thing this episode too, during her short time as a sane person. She gave Cristina the answer she was looking for." [...] The arc involving Callie and George's sudden marriage, named by Krause [...] "a roller coaster", was described as being a way to emphasize the contrast between the two. Krause also noted the contrast between Stevens' kindhearted personality in the past, and the cruelty she proves to have in the episode, which was noted to have been [...] "a highlight in perfect fashion", as well as a reminder for the multi-dimensional personalities of the characters. Also noted was Cristina's way of accepting Burke's proposal, following Ellis' answer, which gave her the hope she had been previously looking for.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{suggested}} that Campbell may have been adopted by Netawatwees. The adoption into an Indian family, of captives taken in raids, was common practice among the Native Americans of that time period, and Campbell most probably was adopted into a Lenape family according to this custom. Nevertheless, although it seems <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> {{was a member of}} the tribal group which followed and moved with Netawatwees, it cannot be definitely established that she was adopted into his own household.|$|E

2500|$|Leslie predeceased her in 1382, whereupon she married, secondly, Alexander Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan, {{better known}} {{in history as}} [...] "The Wolf of Badenoch." [...] This {{marriage}} occurred on 24 or 25 July 1382. However, on 9 June 1392, Pope Clement VII issued a commission to dissolve this marriage and then on 5 and 15 December to grant a divorce. The date of Euphemia's death is not <b>certain.</b> <b>She</b> was still alive on 5 September 1394, {{and it is possible}} that 20 February 1394/5, usually assigned as the date of Stewart's death, was that of her own.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lion {{contacted}} Rob Marshall about {{directing the}} musical. [...] At {{the time he}} was involved in negotiations to direct the screen adaptation of Chicago, but he agreed to become involved in the early development stages of Hairspray with the stipulation he would drop out if assigned the film. [...] Marshall remembered Marissa Jaret Winokur from her brief appearance in the film American Beauty and arranged a meeting with Shaiman and Wittman. [...] The two immediately felt she was right for the role of Tracy Turnblad but hesitated to commit without seeing any other auditions. [...] They hired Winokur to work with them on the project with the understanding she might be replaced later. [...] One year later, Winokur was diagnosed with cervical cancer. <b>Certain</b> <b>she</b> would lose the role if the creative team learned about her condition, she underwent a hysterectomy without telling anyone but her immediate family. [...] The treatment and surgery succeeded, and Winokur returned to the project. [...] Meanwhile, Marshall had started work on Chicago, and Lion hired Jack O'Brien and Jerry Mitchell to direct and to choreograph, respectively. Winokur {{was one of the first}} to audition for the role of Tracy Turnblad and spent two years preparing with voice and dance lessons. Tracy's mother had been portrayed by Divine in the original film, and Shaiman liked the idea of maintaining the tradition of casting a male as Edna Turnblad. [...] Harvey Fierstein auditioned for the role with a [...] "half hour vocal audition". [...] He thought they were [...] "pacifying" [...] him, but he was told [...] "they don't want anyone but you".|$|E

2500|$|The {{opening line}} of the novel famously announces: [...] "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in {{possession}} of a good fortune must be in want of a wife." [...] This sets marriage as a central subject—and really, a central problem—for the novel generally. Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men are, in fact, in want of a wife, or if such desires are dictated by the [...] "neighbourhood" [...] families and their daughters who require a [...] "good fortune". Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political economy, and economy more generally, into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, for example, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable economy of their household, while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological). The Bennets' marriage is one such example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, will come to re-enact with Wickham, and the results are far from felicitous. Though the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work [...] to understand each other and themselves so that they can marry each other on compatible terms personally, even if their [...] "equal" [...] social status remains fraught. When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of only marrying when one is in love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when she is <b>certain</b> <b>she</b> loves him and her feelings are reciprocated. Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable, {{especially when it comes to}} privileging economic, sexual, companionate attraction.|$|E
