5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant,</b> and {{weatherproof}} architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> and chemically inert transition metal.

25|$|Copper {{cladding}} is used {{in building}} exteriors and indoor environments. On building exteriors, copper cladding sheets, shingles, and pre-fabricated panels shield buildings from the elements, acting as first line of defenses against wind, dust, and water.

50|$|Mullite is a {{compound}} of alumina and silica, with the formula 3Al2O3-2SiO2. It has a low density, along with good mechanical properties, high thermal stability, low thermal conductivity, and is <b>corrosion</b> and oxidation <b>resistant.</b> However, it suffers from crystallization and volume contraction above 800C, which leads to cracking and delamination. Therefore, this material is suitable as a zirconia alternative for applications such as diesel engines, where surface temperatures are relatively low and temperature variations across the coating may be large.|$|R

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200mg/kg of tin. A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested cans contained below the UK regulatory limit of 200mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to {{the increased use of}} fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers.

25|$|The copper patinas {{are very}} thin: just 0.05080–0.07620millimeters in thickness. Yet, {{they are highly}} {{adherent}} to the underlying copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant.</b> The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the underlying metal against further weathering. As patination progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the rate of corrosion decreases, averaging between 0.0001–0.0003millimeters per year. For a 0.6millimeter-thick sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion {{over a period of}} 100 years. Further information is available on copper patination.|$|E
25|$|The Tenifer process {{produces}} a matte gray-colored, nonglare {{surface with a}} 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration. Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed gas nitriding process. After applying the nitriding process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.|$|E
