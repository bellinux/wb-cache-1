40|$|The conference theme invites {{contrasts}} between {{objectivity and}} bias, {{since the two}} are commonly considered <b>contraries.</b> But {{there are a variety}} of meanings of the two and a corresponding variety of <b>contraries.</b> Thus there is a problem for any attempt to discuss bias and objectivity in relation to argument as a contrasting pair.

40|$|A philosopher {{who thinks}} {{substantive}} necessities obtain in re, this paper argues, need {{not believe in}} non-actual worlds, or maximal consistent sets of propositions, but merely in properties. For most properties, on even the sparsest property realism, are flanked by <b>contraries</b> with which they cannot be co-instantiated. True, Armstrong {{has shown that the}} impossibility that a property bearer should bear each of two <b>contraries</b> is sometimes just the impossibility that the bearer should be identical with its own proper part-hence is no substantive impossibility. But for many genuine <b>contraries</b> Armstrong 2 ̆ 7 s analysis fails; their incompatibility cannot be reduced to facts of identity. The main examples are dispositional properties, so the paper also argues that being dispositional is no bar to a property 2 ̆ 7 s being real in its own right...|$|R

40|$|A focused {{review of}} the {{literature}} on reasoning suggests that mechanisms based upon <b>contraries</b> are of fundamental importance in various abilities. At the same time, the importance of <b>contraries</b> in the human perceptual experience of space has been recently demonstrated in experimental studies. Solving geometry problems represents an interesting case as both reasoning abilities and the manipulation of perceptual–figural aspects are involved. In this study we focus on perceptual changes in geometrical problem solving processes in order to understand whether a mental manipulation in terms of opposites might help. Four conditions were studied, two of which concerned the search for <b>contraries</b> as an implicit or explicit strategy. Results demonstrated that <b>contraries,</b> when used explicitly in solution processes, constitute an effective heuristic: The number of correct solutions increased, less time was needed to find a solution and participants were oriented towards the use of perception-based solutions—not only were perceptual solutions more frequent, but also, more specifically, the number of correct perceptual solutions increased. These last results concerning perception-based solutions were found both when participants were advised about the usefulness of the strategy and when they were not advised. Differences concerning which aspects of a problem were focused on during the solution process also emerged...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fuzzy sets theory {{affirmed that}} the {{linguistic}} value for every <b>contraries</b> relation is complementary. It was stressed in the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) {{that the conditions}} for <b>contraries</b> relations, which are the fuzzy values, cannot be greater than one. However, complementary in two contradict phenomena are not always true. This paper proposes a new idea condition for conflicting bifuzzy sets by relaxing the condition of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Here, we will critically forward examples using triangular fuzzy number in formulating a new condition for conflicting bifuzzy sets (CBFS). Evaluation {{of positive and negative}} in conflicting phenomena were calculated concurrently by relaxing the condition in IFS. The hypothetical illustration showed the applicability of the new condition in CBFS for solving non-complement <b>contraries</b> intuitionistic evaluation. This approach can be applied to any decision making where conflicting is very much exist. Keywords—Conflicting bifuzzy set, conflicting degree, fuzzy sets, fuzzy numbers. I...|$|R
