5|$|While some pet rats {{retain the}} agouti {{coloring}} {{of the wild}} brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single <b>color</b> <b>on</b> each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include agouti, cinnamon, and fawn. Black-based colors include black, beige, and chocolate.|$|E

5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and <b>color</b> <b>on</b> forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is one of}} {{the three}} colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the <b>color</b> <b>on</b> their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray <b>color</b> <b>on</b> the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The N3 center {{consists}} of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always {{just a fraction of}} the A and B centers. The N3 center is paramagnetic, so its structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce <b>color</b> <b>on</b> its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.|$|E
5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the <b>color</b> <b>on</b> the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E

5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and <b>color</b> <b>on</b> the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of <b>color</b> <b>on</b> daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the exact nature of Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in <b>color</b> <b>on</b> the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E

5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in <b>color.</b> <b>On</b> the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke <b>color</b> <b>on</b> the first day of that conclave.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children – Black Book and Red Book were {{released}} for the Game Boy <b>Color</b> <b>on</b> November 17, 2000 in Japan, and re-released digitally through the Virtual Console {{service on the}} Nintendo 3DS on November 13, 2013. A PlayStation remake of both games was released on March 28, 2002, and re-released digitally on the PlayStation Store on October 13, 2010. Black Book follows Setsuna, whose little brother has been kidnapped by an army of Jack Frosts and taken to the demon world, and who is accompanied by the Cerberus Cool. Red Book follows Mirai, whose father has disappeared in the demon world, and who is accompanied by the pink bird Veil.|$|E
