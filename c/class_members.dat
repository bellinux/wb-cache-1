5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two <b>class</b> <b>members</b> (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Spanish explorers {{arriving}} in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status in sandy graves, while upper <b>class</b> <b>members</b> were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves. One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands. The loss of such {{a large amount of}} mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of mummia, a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the <b>class</b> <b>members</b> themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the three}} <b>class</b> <b>members,</b> Yorktown had the longest U.S. Navy career, {{spanning}} from her 1889 commissioning to her final decommissioning in 1919. Concord remained afloat the longest: she was decommissioned in 1910, but {{served as a}} training ship for the Washington Naval Militia until 1914, and as a quarantine ship for the Public Health Service in Astoria, Oregon, until 1929. Bennington had the shortest Navy career: she suffered a boiler explosion in July 1905 at San Diego, California, that killed over 60 crewmen. Her hulk {{was used as a}} water barge at Honolulu for the Matson Line from 1912 to 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E
5|$|Several inner-city neighborhoods {{have begun}} to gentrify in recent years. Areas on both the west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been {{successful}} in attracting increasing numbers of creative <b>class</b> <b>members,</b> which in turn is spurring new residential development. Furthermore, a live-work zoning overlay for the city's near east side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline after {{completion}} of the Kent Coast route electrification in 1959. The reduction of work precipitated a phased reduction of the class {{that began with the}} withdrawal of No.31409 in November 1962. The withdrawal programme intensified after boundary changes on the Southern Region placed the lines west of Salisbury under Western Region control in 1963. <b>Class</b> <b>members</b> based at Exmouth Junction shed were withdrawn in 1964, whilst the Southern Region's allocation was gradually replaced by Bulleid's Light Pacifics. The last operational members of the class were Nos.31405 and31408; both were withdrawn in June 1966.|$|E

5|$|In June 2009, a {{group of}} {{consumers}} filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple, Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes gift cards and who were then unable to use the cards to purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised {{the price of the}} music after it sold the cards to consumers. The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the gift cards to purchase songs for US$.99 a song and then, after such gift cards were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes of other states. The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that <b>class</b> <b>members</b> purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' fees and costs. Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010. The settlement provides <b>class</b> <b>members</b> with an iTunes Store credit of $3.25 if an online claim form was submitted on or before September 24, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Robert Urie {{completed}} his H15class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype {{was built in}} August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond’s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, which prevented construction of further <b>class</b> <b>members.</b> Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR’s passenger locomotive fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.|$|E

5|$|The English army {{consisted}} {{entirely of}} infantry. It {{is possible that}} some of the higher <b>class</b> <b>members</b> of the army rode to battle, but when battle was joined they dismounted to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the fyrd, also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the shield wall, in which all the men in the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and men with javelins as well as archers.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the <b>class</b> <b>members</b> and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life.|$|E

25|$|The {{representation}} of identity in forms of language can be subdivided into language, dialect, and accent. For example, {{the use of}} different dialects in an area can represent a varied social status for individuals. A {{good example of this}} would be in the case of French. Until the French Revolution, the difference of dialects usage directly reflected ones social status. Peasants and lower <b>class</b> <b>members</b> spoke local dialects, while only nobles and higher <b>class</b> <b>members</b> were fluent with the official French language. Accents can reflect an area's inner conflict with classifications and authority within a population.|$|E

Second, if there is a settlement proposal, the court will usually direct the class counsel to send a settlement notice to all the members of the certified class, informing them of the details of the proposed settlement.|$|E
