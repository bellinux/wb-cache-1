5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating <b>confidence-building</b> measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly hit, some local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out <b>confidence-building</b> measures among the migrants in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city.|$|E
25|$|A sign of {{improved}} relations was {{visible in the}} response to a mid-air collision by Greek and Turkish fighter jets in the southern Aegean in May 2006. While the Turkish pilot ejected safely, the Greek pilot lost his life. However, both countries agreed that the event should not affect their bilateral relations and made a strong effort to maintain them by agreeing {{to a set of}} <b>confidence-building</b> measures {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the country}} {{there are also}} LGBT camps that help {{families}} “struggling with their unusual circumstances”. They {{can serve as a}} kind of therapy for families since they are with others they can relate to- making these camps become more popular. The camps offer fun activities like swimming, horseback riding, and campfires but they also offer <b>confidence-building</b> workshops, affirmation exercises, and social justice programs- all very important offerings to the LGBT community.|$|E
25|$|Peacekeepers {{monitor and}} observe peace {{processes}} in post-conflict areas and assist ex-combatants {{in implementing the}} peace agreements they may have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including <b>confidence-building</b> measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers (often referred to as Blue Berets or Blue Helmets because of their light blue berets or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.|$|E
25|$|The first {{usage of}} the hotline was in 1991 between the militaries of India and Pakistan to work on <b>confidence-building</b> measures. The second {{usage of the}} hotline was in 1997, when both {{countries}} informed each other on trade issues. In 1998, when both countries had publicly conducted nuclear tests, the hotline was extensively used between the leaders of both countries. Since 2005, the hotline is used by each country to inform their nuclear missile tests in the region.|$|E
25|$|The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a formal, official, multilateral, {{dialogue}} in the Asia Pacific region. As of July 2007, {{it consists of}} twenty-seven participants. ARF's objectives are to foster dialogue and consultation, and to promote <b>confidence-building</b> and preventive diplomacy in the region. The ARF {{met for the first}} time in 1994. The current participants in the ARF are: all ASEAN members, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, East Timor, the United States, and Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|Within the United Nations (UN) {{group of}} {{nation-state}} governments and organisations, {{there is a}} general understanding that at the international level, peacekeepers monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas, and may assist ex-combatants in implementing peace agreement commitments that they have undertaken. Such assistance may come in many forms, including <b>confidence-building</b> measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development.

25|$|Throughout Belize's history, Guatemala {{has claimed}} {{ownership}} of {{all or part}} of Belizean territory. This claim is occasionally reflected in maps drawn by Guatemala's government, showing Belize as Guatemala's twenty-third department. , the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious. Guatemala's claim to Belizean territory rests, in part, on Clause VII of the Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859, which obligated the British to build a road between Belize City and Guatemala. At various times the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, Caribbean Community heads of government, the Organization of American States (OAS), Mexico, and the United States. Notably, both Guatemala and Belize participate in <b>confidence-building</b> measures approved by the OAS such as the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project.|$|E
25|$|The UN {{has played}} various roles during the {{conflict}} and peace process: a military role through its observer mission (UNOMIG); dual diplomatic roles through the Security Council and {{the appointment of a}} Special Envoy, succeeded by a Special Representative to the Secretary-General; a humanitarian role (UNHCR and UNOCHA); a development role (UNDP); a human rights role (UNHCHR); and a low-key capacity and <b>confidence-building</b> role (UNV). The UN’s position has been {{that there will be no}} forcible change in international borders. Any settlement must be freely negotiated and based on autonomy for Abkhazia legitimised by referendum under international observation once the multiethnic population has returned. According to Western interpretations the intervention did not contravene international law since Georgia, as a sovereign state, had the right to secure order on its territory and protect its territorial integrity.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{high-level}} visits {{between the two}} nations have helped improve relations. In December 1996, PRC President Jiang Zemin visited India during a tour of South Asia. While in New Delhi, he signed with the Indian Prime Minister a series of <b>confidence-building</b> measures for the disputed borders. Sino-Indian relations suffered a brief setback in May 1998 when the Indian Defence minister justified the country's nuclear tests by citing potential threats from the PRC. However, in June 1999, during the Kargil crisis, then-External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh visited Beijing and stated that India did not consider China a threat. By 2001, relations between India and the PRC were on the mend, and the two sides handled the move from Tibet to India of the 17th Karmapa in January 2000 with delicacy and tact. In 2003, India formally recognised Tibet as a part of China, and China recognised Sikkim as a formal part of India in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the ceasefire, {{both sides}} made small {{gestures}} of peace, with Santos ordering that the bodies of guerrillas killed in combat be identified and returned to their families while the FARC reiterated their will to remain in the negotiations. A technical sub-commission for {{the end of the}} conflict began discussions about <b>confidence-building</b> measures, while the mine clearance pilot project began in Briceño (Antioquia), with Humberto de la Calle highlighting the historic nature of the military and the FARC working alongside one another. The FARC's negotiators in Havana and their leader, Timochenko, adopted a conciliatory tone. Analysts opined that the talks had reached a point of maturity where both sides appreciated their common objective and jointly protect what has been accomplished. On June 4, the negotiating sides created a commission for the clarification of truth, coexistence and non-repetition - the basis for an extrajudicial truth commission on the victims of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, he {{met with}} Indian prime {{minister}} Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the Wagah border and signed a joint communique, known as the Lahore Declaration. Since both countries had ordered their nuclear tests, both prime ministers proceeded towards maintaining peace and security. In 1998, both governments signed an agreement recognising the principle of building an environment of peace and security and resolving all bilateral conflicts, which became {{the basis of the}} Lahore Declaration. On 1 February 1999, Prime Minister Sharif made a breakthrough with India when he invited his counterpart to Pakistan. On 19 February, Indian premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid a historic state visit to Pakistan travelling on the inaugural bus service connecting the Indian capital of New Delhi with the major Pakistan's cultural city of Lahore, establishing a major transport link for the peoples of both nations. On 21 February, both Prime ministers signed the bilateral agreement with a memorandum of understanding to ensure the nuclear-free safety in South Asia. This bilateral agreement was widely popular in Pakistan and India onwards, the people of Pakistan supported the Prime minister's move and the Prime minister received wide appreciation from the opposition as well as the civil society. This agreement known as Lahore Declaration, it was widely assumed to development of nuclear weapons brought added responsibility to both nations towards avoiding conflict and promoted the importance of <b>Confidence-building</b> measures, especially to avoid accidental and unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. To some Western observers, this treaty was more like as of SALT Treaties signed by both superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States.|$|E
500|$|On 21 January 2012, Khar {{secretly}} {{left for}} Moscow with an agenda of strengthening bilateral relations, with Pakistan's {{relationship with the}} United States strained. On this trip invited the Russian leadership to visit Pakistan and to maintain bilateral cooperation and commitment and support for [...] "Afghan-led and Afghan-owned" [...] efforts {{for peace in the}} country. On 12 August 2012, while speaking at the 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Tehran, Khar maintained that regional stability was imperiled due to the increasing tensions relating to Iran's nuclear program, and a [...] "peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible on the basis of reciprocal <b>confidence-building</b> measures and security assurances against external threats".|$|E
500|$|Homer takes a {{fatherhood}} quiz and discovers {{he knows}} {{next to nothing}} about his son. He signs up for therapy at the National Fatherhood Institute and after a <b>confidence-building</b> pep talk, offers to help Bart build his own soapbox racer for the upcoming Soap Box Derby. At the qualifying race, Bart and Martin form an alliance vowing that either must somehow beat bully Nelson and his very intimidating racer, the Roadkill 2000, [...] "armed with every dirty trick in the book." [...] As the race starts, Bart can barely reach any kind of noticeable speed with Homer's racer and it eventually falls apart. Martin's sleek, aerodynamic racer easily wins, but loses control at high speed and crashes. Martin finds out that due to his injuries {{he can no longer}} race and opts for Bart and himself to combine forces by having Bart race Martin's racer over the racer he and Homer built.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Israel held {{thousands}} of Palestinians as political prisoners, {{and called on}} Israel to release them. Ban said the release of political prisoners would [...] "serve as a significant <b>confidence-building</b> measure" [...] and boost prospects of peace in the region. Amnesty International has called on Israel to release political prisoners, saying [...] "all political prisoners held without charge or trial should be tried in fair trials or immediately released".|$|E
2500|$|North Korea is a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Protocol, {{which prohibits}} {{the use of}} chemical weapons in warfare. North Korea is also a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). Although the nation has signed the BWC, it [...] "has failed to provide a BWC <b>Confidence-Building</b> Measure declaration since 1990." [...] North Korea is not {{a party to the}} Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). It is one of four countries that have not ratified the CWC (the others are Israel, Egypt, and South Sudan).|$|E
2500|$|Calling on {{both parties}} {{to follow up on}} {{dialogue}} initiatives, it further urged them to comply fully with all previous agreements regarding non-violence and <b>confidence-building,</b> in particular those concerning the separation of forces. Regarding the disputed role of the peacekeepers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Council stressed the importance of close, effective cooperation between UNOMIG and that force and looked to all sides to continue to extend the necessary cooperation to them. At the same time, the document reaffirmed the [...] "commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, The sixth-round of {{the joint}} working group talks was held in New Delhi but {{resulted}} in only minor developments. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Premier Li Peng signed a border agreement dealing with cross-border trade, cooperation on environmental issues (e.g. Pollution, Animal extinction, Global Warming, etc.) and radio and television broadcasting. A senior-level Chinese military delegation made a goodwill visit to India in December 1993 aimed at [...] "fostering <b>confidence-building</b> measures between the defence forces of the two countries." [...] The visit, however, {{came at a time}} when China was providing greater military support to Burma. The presence of Chinese radar technicians in Burma's Coco Islands, which border India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands caused concern in India.|$|E
2500|$|After {{intensive}} {{diplomatic efforts}} by other countries, India and Pakistan began to withdraw {{troops from the}} international border on 10June 2002, and negotiations restarted. From 26November 2003, India and Pakistan agreed to maintain a ceasefire along the undisputed international border, the disputed Line of Control, and Actual Ground Position Line near the Siachen glacier. This was the first such [...] "total ceasefire" [...] declared by both powers in nearly 15 years. In February 2004, Pakistan increased pressure on Pakistanis fighting in Indian-administered Kashmir {{to adhere to the}} ceasefire. Their neighbours launched several other mutual <b>confidence-building</b> measures. Restarting the bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani- administered Kashmir has helped defuse tensions between the countries while both India and Pakistan have decided to co-operate on economic fronts.|$|E
2500|$|Nayef Al-Rodhan {{argues that}} humans' strong {{tendency}} towards [...] "fear(survival)-induced pre-emptive aggression" [...] means that situations of anarchy or near anarchy should be prevented at all costs. This is because anarchy provokes fear, {{which in turn}} results in aggression, brutality, and injustice. Even in non-anarchic situations, survival instincts and fear can be very powerful forces, {{and they may be}} incited instantaneously. [...] "Fear(survival)-induced pre-emptive aggression" [...] {{is one of the key}} factors that may push naturally amoral humans to behave in immoral ways. [...] Knowing this, Al-Rodhan maintains that we must prepare for the circumstances that may arise from humans' aggressive behavior. According to Al-Rodhan, the risk of this aggression and its ensuing brutality should be minimized through <b>confidence-building</b> measures and policies that promote inclusiveness and prevent anarchy.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations (UN) has {{attempted}} to facilitate dialogue between the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi. On 6 May 2002, following secret <b>confidence-building</b> negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman {{said that she was}} free to move [...] "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed [...] "a new dawn for the country". However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene {{with the help of her}} driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U. The government imprisoned her at Insein Prison in Rangoon. After she underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.|$|E
2500|$|While India and China remain {{strategic}} rivals, India's [...] "Look East" [...] {{policy has}} included significant rapprochement with China. In 1993, India began holding high-level talks with Chinese leaders and established <b>confidence-building</b> measures. In 2006, China and India opened the Nathu La pass for cross-border trade {{for the first}} time since the 1962 war. On 21 November 2006 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Chinese President Hu Jintao issued a 10-point joint declaration to improve ties and resolve long-standing conflicts. Trade between China and India increases by 50% each year, and is set to reach the $60 billion target set for 2010 by both Indian and Chinese governments and industrial leaders. However, China's close relations with Pakistan, skepticism about India's annexation of Sikkim, and Chinese claim over Arunachal Pradesh have threatened the improvement in bilateral relations. India's providing asylum to the political-cum-spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama also causes some friction in bilateral ties.|$|E
2500|$|France, Germany and the United Kingdom (the EU-3) {{undertook}} a diplomatic initiative with Iran to resolve questions about its nuclear program. On 21 October 2003, in Tehran, the Iranian government and EU-3 Foreign Ministers {{issued a statement}} known as the Tehran Declaration in which Iran agreed to co-operate with the IAEA, to sign and implement an Additional Protocol as a voluntary, <b>confidence-building</b> measure, and to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities {{during the course of}} the negotiations. The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran's nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide [...] "satisfactory assurances" [...] regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology. Iran signed an Additional Protocol on 18 December 2003, and agreed to act as if the protocol were in force, making the required reports to the IAEA and allowing the required access by IAEA inspectors, pending Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Paris Agreement, on 14 November 2004, Iran's chief nuclear {{negotiator}} announced a voluntary and temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment program (enrichment is not a violation of the NPT) and the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol, after pressure from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany acting on behalf of the European Union (EU, known in this context as the EU-3). The measure was said at the time to be a voluntary, <b>confidence-building</b> measure, to continue for some reasonable period of time (six months being mentioned as a reference) as negotiations with the EU-3 continued. On 24 November, Iran sought to amend {{the terms of}} its agreement with the EU to exclude a handful of the equipment from this deal for research work. This request was dropped four days later.

2500|$|While India has {{remained}} a staunch supporter of the [...] "One China" [...] policy and recognised the People's Republic of China on the mainland over the Republic of China authorities on Taiwan, it has, nevertheless, pursued a policy of increasing engagement with the island. India has stepped up engagement with East Asia fueled by its need for cooperation on counter-terrorism, humanitarian relief, anti-piracy, maritime and energy security, <b>confidence-building</b> and balancing the influence of other powers, notably China. Driven {{by the fact that}} more than 50% of India's trade passes through the Malacca Strait, the Indian navy has established a Far Eastern Naval Command off Port Blair on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. India has also been conducting joint naval exercises with Singapore (SIMBEX) since 1993, with Vietnam in 2000 and has engaged in joint patrols with Indonesia in the Andaman Sea since 2002. Japan and India were also members of the tsunami relief regional core group in the Indian Ocean in 2004 along with Australia and the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Mohamed ElBaradei, former {{director}} general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that [...] "the only way to resolve the Iranian issue is to build trust. Moving 1200, half, or at least {{more than half of the}} Iranian nuclear material out of Iran is a <b>confidence-building</b> measure would defuse the crisis and enable the US and the West [...] the space to negotiate. I hope that it would be perceived as a win-win situation. If we see what I have been observing in the last couple of days that it is an [...] "empty dressing", I think it is a wrong approach...we lost six years of failed policy frankly vis-à-vis Iran. And it's about time now to understand that the Iranian issue is not going to be resolved except, until and unless we sit with the Iranians and try to find a fair and equitable solution."

2500|$|Gillispie {{asked for}} a budget large enough {{to allow them to}} play <b>confidence-building</b> non-conference {{schedule}}s, rarely venturing out of Reed Arena in the first two seasons. Using the padded non-conference schedule to their advantage, the Aggies won the first eleven games of Gillispie's debut season before finishing the season 21–10, a fourteen-game improvement over the previous season. Although the Aggies were picked to finish last in the Big 12 Conference, they finished 8–8 in conference play, winning games against the number 9 Texas Longhorns and number 25 Texas Tech Red Raiders on their way to becoming only the third college team to ever finish [...]500 in league play after being winless the previous season. For the first time in eleven years, the team received a postseason bid. The Aggies' two wins in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) were their first postseason wins in 23 seasons. With the best first-season record of any head basketball coach in Texas A history, the Aggies had the most season wins since the 1979–80 team had won 26 games. The Aggies were named the country's most improved team, making Gillispie the only coach in history to lead the most improved team in consecutive seasons. As a result of his success, he was the consensus selection for Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year. and was selected to serve as a court coach at the 2005 USA Men's World University Games Team Trials.|$|E
