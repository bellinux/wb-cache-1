5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E

Thy1 knock out mice have increased fibrosis in the lung. Fibrosis induced by radiation mimicking <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> Bleomycin is also increased in these mice.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is {{also used}} as a direct <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> in certain {{haematological}} malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{intravenous}} methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the winged infusion device, peripheral venous catheter, midline catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), {{central venous catheter}} and implantable port.

25|$|In 1999, Smith and his {{co-workers}} have reported the first gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide, which make the development of (+)-discodermolide as a potential <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> possible. This synthetic route was licensed to Novartis Pharmaceuticals. One of the major improvements was that no purification was required {{in the first four}} steps of the five-step sequence towards the common precursor as the intermiedate, aldol adduct, is a crystalline solid. A chelation-controlled Mukaiyama-aldol reaction was used to set the stereogenicity at C(5) of the lactone fragment.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{looked for}} {{specific}} markers and for proteomic and genomic tumor signatures that distinguish CSCs from others. In 2009, scientists identified the compound salinomycin, which selectively reduces {{the proportion of}} breast CSCs in mice by more than 100-fold relative to Paclitaxel, a commonly used <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent.</b> Some types of cancer cells can survive treatment with salinomycin through autophagy, whereby cells use acidic organelles such as lysosomes to degrade and recycle certain types of proteins. The use of autophagy inhibitors can kill cancer stem cells that survive by autophagy.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel is a {{cytotoxic}} <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent.</b> As {{with all}} chemotherapy, adverse effects are common, and many side effects have been documented. Because docetaxel is a cell-cycle-specific agent, it is cytotoxic to all dividing {{cells in the}} body. This includes tumour cells as well as hair follicles, bone marrow and other germ cells. For this reason, common chemotherapy side effects such as hair loss occur; sometimes this can be permanent. North west France are conducting a survey to establish exactly {{how many people are}} affected in this way. Independent studies show it could be as high as 6.3%, which puts it in the 'common and frequent' classification.|$|E
30|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{pancreatitis}} is {{well documented}} in the literature and is associated with several <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents.</b> These <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> include L-asparaginase, carboplatin cisplatin, cytarabine, ifosfamide, paclitaxel, tretinoin, and vinorelbine [27, 28]. The onset of pancreatitis is variable and may range from hours to 1  month after drug administration [27].|$|R

25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent.</b> TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{internal}} radiation therapy (SIRT) {{can be used}} to destroy the tumor from within (thus minimizing exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent.</b> The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy. There are currently two products available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA approved treatment for primary liver cancer (HCC) which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer but outside the US SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any non-resectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.|$|E
2500|$|... 5-HT3 antagonists {{are most}} {{effective}} in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), especially that caused by highly emetogenic drugs such as cisplatin; when used for this purpose, they may be given alone or, more frequently, with a glucocorticoid, usually dexamethasone. They are usually given intravenously, shortly before administration of the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent,</b> although some authors have argued that oral administration may be preferred.|$|E

The method {{is based on the}} diazo-coupling reaction of these <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> with a new, coupling agent, acetyl acetone, in an alkaline medium. The optimum reaction conditions and other analytical parameters are evaluated. The influence of the substrates commonly employed as excipients with these <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> has been studied. The method is simple, rapid, and sensitive.

50|$|Chemotherapy is the {{treatment}} of cancer {{with one or more}} cytotoxic anti-neoplastic drugs (<b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents)</b> as part of a standardized regimen. The term encompasses a variety of drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as alkylating agents and antimetabolites. Traditional <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> act by killing cells that divide rapidly, a critical property of most cancer cells.|$|R
2500|$|In early 2004, Novartis Pharmaceuticals [...] have {{disclosed}} {{the detail}} of a 60g-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. This synthesis utilized the Smith gram-scale approach and the Paterson first-generation endgame. This synthesis allows (+)-discodermolide to be evaluated as an in vivo <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> for adult patients presenting with advanced solid malignancies in Phase I clinical trials. The Novartis synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 0.65% with a longest linear sequence of 26 steps and 33 total steps.|$|E
2500|$|Despite, or {{possibly}} because of, its long-known toxicity, arsenic-containing potions and drugs {{have a history}} in medicine and quackery that continues into the 21st century. [...] Starting in the early 19th century and continuing into the 20th century, Fowler's solution, a toxic concoction of sodium arsenite, was sold. The organoarsenic compound Salvarsan was the first synthetic <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent,</b> discovered by Paul Ehrlich. The treatment, however, led to many problems causing long lasting health complications. [...] Around 1943 it was finally superseded by penicillin.|$|E
2500|$|The word {{chemotherapy}} {{without a}} modifier usually refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning was broader. The term was coined {{in the early}} 1900s by Paul Ehrlich as meaning any use of chemicals to treat any disease (- + [...] ), {{such as the use}} of antibiotics (antibacterial chemotherapy). [...] Ehrlich was not optimistic that effective chemotherapy drugs would be found for the treatment of cancer. [...] The first modern <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> was arsphenamine, an arsenic compound discovered in 1907 and used to treat syphilis. This was later followed by sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) and penicillin. In today's usage, the sense [...] "any treatment of disease with drugs" [...] is often expressed with the word pharmacotherapy.|$|E
40|$|Available {{treatment}} options for patients {{diagnosed with cancer}} include surgery, the administration of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents,</b> radiation therapy, {{or a combination of}} these modalities. <b>Chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> utilized to treat cancer have a variety of potential side effects. One of the most common and well known side effects associated with the administration of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> is neutropenia. Neutropenia places oncology patients at an increased risk of contracting infections which may lead to a life threatening complication known as sepsis. Sepsis is an extremely dangerous oncologic emergency requiring prompt medical treatment. Failure to recognize symptoms associated with sepsis in the neutropenic patient and initiate appropriate medical treatment significantly increases the risk of patient mortality...|$|R

40|$|Studies in {{children}} treated with chemotherapy suggest that <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> have deleterious effects on bone metabolism. We therefore evaluated the in vitro effects of clinically relevant concentrations of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> on {{the synthesis of}} type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and mineralization by primary human osteoblast-like (HOB) cells derived from children. Because serum 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations may be reduced during treatment with chemotherapy, the effect of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> on HOB cells cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D(3) was also evaluated. Type I collagen synthesis was reduced by all agents (P < 0. 01) other than methotrexate, whereas the relative AP activity was increased (P < 0. 01) by all agents. The relative number of cells staining intensely for AP after culture with agents increased (P < 0. 05), and AP mRNA expression was increased (P < 0. 01) with vincristine. 1, 25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ameliorated (P < 0. 01) the depletion of HOB cell numbers by <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore, vincristine and daunorubicin inhibited 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D(3) -mediated AP activity (P < 0. 01). We conclude that <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> can adversely affect HOB cell function, and we speculate that this observation may account, in part, for the osteopenia observed during and after treatment of children with chemotherapy...|$|R
2500|$|At {{approximately}} the same time, Cordis (a division of Johnson & Johnson) was developing the Cypher stent, a stent that would release sirolimus (a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent)</b> over time. [...] The first study of these individuals revealed an incredible lack of restenosis (zero percent restenosis) at six months. [...] This led to the approval for the stent {{to be used in}} Europe in April 2002. [...] Further trials with the Cypher stent revealed that restenosis did occur in some individuals with high risk features (such as long areas of stenosis or a history of diabetes mellitus), but that the restenosis rate was significantly lower than with bare metal stents (3.2 percent compared to 35.4 percent). [...] About a year after approval in Europe, the United States FDA approved the use of the Cypher stent as the first drug-eluting stent for use in the general population in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s Chinese {{researcher}} Zhang Tingdong {{and colleagues}} investigated the potential {{use of the}} traditionally used Chinese medicine arsenic trioxide to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Building on his work, research both in China and the West {{eventually led to the}} development of the drug Trisenox by PolaRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc through NDA, which was approved for leukemia treatment by the US FDA in 2000 and subsequently marketed and sold by Cell Therapeutics, Inc., before being acquired by Cephalon. Arsenic trioxide, under the tradename Trisenox (manufacturer: Cephalon acquired by Teva), is a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> approved by the US FDA for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia that is unresponsive to [...] "first line" [...] agents, namely all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). It has been shown that arsenic trioxide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Due to the toxic nature of arsenic, this drug carries significant risks. Use as a cytostatic in the treatment of refractory promyelocytic (M3) subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. The combination therapy of arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain leukemias. University of Hong Kong developed a liquid form of arsenic trioxide that can be administered orally.|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>agent.</b> Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|E
