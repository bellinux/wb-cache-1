Recommended Actions: • 	Accurate measurement of soil <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> balances is exceptionally difficult, but can be accomplished with sufficient investment and long‐term planning. • 	The ideal approach will include a combination of measurements from farms and experimental networks that manipulate nutrient inputs. • 	With proper planning and cooperation, Iowa State University and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship can address the concerns raised in this report regarding the future of Iowa’s soil resource and agricultural productivity...|$|R
30|$|Vegetation type is {{the major}} cause of <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> {{concentration}} in the leaves, in our results there is a decreasing trend of <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> with increasing altitude. This is due to lower decomposition rates because of the decreasing temperature. The second major reason is the plant type as P. wallichiana leaves contain more <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> which is found at lower altitudes as compared to B. utilis which has lower <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations and is found at higher altitudes. Leaf to soil <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> show a weak positive correlation as leaves take nitrogen from the soil and carbon in the soil accumulates by root and microorganism respiration and decomposition of litter process. Leaf and soil carbon showed an increasing trend with increasing altitude except for the altitudes 2860 and 3500  m respectively. Leaf nitrogen also shows an increasing trend except at altitude 3500  m. As plant type is the more important factor when determining soil and leaf <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen,</b> altitude so far does not have much impact except on the temperature which decreases at high elevations. With increasing altitude the temperature decreases which further decreases the mineralization rate. Our results, however, somehow support the findings of Zhang et al. (2012) that Soil N mineralization and nitrification rates decreased with increasing altitude. The variety and types of herbs and grasses like legumes cause more <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> accumulation in the soil. We examined the <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> concentration in the soil with increasing herbaceous biomass in each plot. As under the forest, very few herbs were found and a weak correlation with <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> was observed.|$|R

40|$|We tracked {{flows of}} <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> during an {{experimental}} phytoplankton bloom {{in a natural}} estuarine assemblage in Randers Fjord, Denmark. We used 13 C-labeled dissolved inorganic carbon to trace the transfer of carbon from phytoplankton to bacteria. Ecosystem development was followed {{over a period of}} 9 d through changes in the stocks of inorganic nutrients, pigments, particulate organic <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen,</b> dissolved organic <b>carbon</b> (DOC), and algal and bacterial polar-lipid–derived fatty acids (PLFA). We quantified the incorporation of 13 C in phytoplankton and bacterial biomass by carbon isotope analysis of specific PLFA. A dynamic model based on unbalanced algal growth and balanced growth of bacteria and zooplankton adequately reproduced the observations and provided an integral view of <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> dynamics. There were three phases with distinct <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> dynamics. During the first period, nutrients were replete, an algal bloom was observed, and <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> uptake occurred at a constant ratio. Because there was little algal exudation of DOC, transfer of 13 C from phytoplankton to bacteria was delayed by 1 d, compared with the labeling of phytoplankton. In the second phase, the exhaustion of dissolved inorganic nitrogen resulted in decoupling of <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> flows caused by unbalanced algal growth and the exudation of carbon-rich dissolved organic matter by phytoplankton.

Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E

In elevations of 100 m (lowland), 400 m (submontane), and 1000 m (montane) four 1 -ha plots were established, and above- (live and dead) and belowground (live and dead) biomass were determined. <b>Carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations in each compartment were determined and used to convert biomass into <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> stocks. The <b>carbon</b> aboveground stock (CAGB) varied along the elevation range from approximately 110 to 150 Mg·ha- 1, and nitrogen aboveground stock (NAGB), varied from approximately 1. 0 to 1. 9 Mg·ha- 1. The carbon belowground stock (CBGB) and the nitrogen belowground stock (NBGB) {{were significantly higher than}} the AGB and varied along the elevation range from approximately 200 - 300 Mg·ha- 1, and from 14 to 20 Mg·ha- 1, respectively. Finally, the total carbon stock (CTOTAL) varied from approximately 320 to 460 Mg·ha- 1, and the nitrogen total stock (NTOTAL) from approximately 15 to 22 Mg·ha- 1. Most of the <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> stocks were found belowground and not aboveground as normally found in lowland tropical forests. The above- and belowground stocks, and consequently, the total stocks of <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> increased significantly with elevation. As the soil and air temperature also decreased significantly with elevation, we found a significantly inverse relationship between <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> stocks and temperature. Using this inverse relationship, we made a first approach estimate that an increase of 1 °C in soil temperature would decrease the <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> stocks in approximately 17 Mg·ha- 1 and 1 Mg·ha- 1 of <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen,</b> respectively...|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E

This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type main-sequence star.

5|$|Nonmetals have {{structures}} {{in which each}} atom usually forms (8−N) bonds with (8−N) nearest neighbours, where N {{is the number of}} valence electrons. Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration. Exceptions to the (8−N) rule occur with hydrogen (which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell), <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and oxygen. Atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative (more stable) bonding structures, with fewer nearest neighbours. Thus, carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure, and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds, respectively. The larger size of the remaining non-noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms. Sulfur, for example, forms an eight-membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring, with each atom forming two single bonds to different atoms.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea was}} taken up again {{in the search for}} solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun {{produced}} neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton–proton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N.

This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time scientists contemplated the awful possibility that the Sun might have burned out.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E
