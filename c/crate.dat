5|$|To take revenge, Chedi burns Makkhi's factory. Makkhi's father {{suffers a}} heart attack due to shock and is hospitalised. Makkhi goes to Chedi seek help from him, without knowing that it was Chedi, who burnt his factory. Chedi agrees to finance his father's treatment, if he {{delivers}} a <b>crate</b> of mangoes to Dayal Babu's house. Unknown to Makkhi, there is a bomb inside the <b>crate,</b> which explodes after he leaves, killing Dayal Babu. Chedi gives Makkhi a task to kill Chulbul. Makkhi accepts, and confesses it to Chulbul. He reveals to Chulbul that Chedi made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Chulbul forgives him and reconciles with his stepfather. Makkhi then reveals to Chulbul that it was Chedi, who killed their mother. Enraged, Chulbul suffocates Chedi to death.

5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release <b>crate</b> full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The <b>crate</b> opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
50|$|Such <b>crates</b> can be long-lived. In the 1980s in Sweden, a take-back {{campaign}} was organized, when 25-bottle <b>crates</b> {{were replaced by}} the more ergonomic 20-bottle <b>crates.</b> Some of the <b>crates</b> returned for recycling had been in use since the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|TNT and Nitro <b>Crates</b> are {{the only}} boxes that can damage Crash. TNT <b>Crates</b> have a three-second fuse when jumped on, but Nitro <b>Crates</b> will explode {{instantly}} upon any contact with Crash {{or anything else that}} runs into them. Switch Boxes (distinguished by an exclamation mark) are used to make previously invisible <b>crates</b> appear. A green Switch Box will detonate all Nitro <b>Crates</b> in the level.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} {{three types of}} resources: <b>Crates,</b> oil and Crystals. Supply <b>crates</b> sent from the future are the {{foundation}} of all construction. Small piles of <b>crates</b> appear on the map with a thunderclap at random intervals. Most maps in the game have regions where <b>crates</b> appear the most often. American optoelectronics enable them to pinpoint the exact locations of the <b>crates</b> as they arrive, while the Soviets, who have focused on time-based technology, are able to predict a perimeter where the <b>crates</b> will arrive {{a few seconds before}} they materialise.|$|R
5|$|Bart {{places a}} collect call to Lisa, {{who has spent}} the entire spring break with Homer at work, to ask her for advice.

5|$|Stymied, Black {{and fellow}} Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) {{investigate}} the ship, finding several bodies {{hidden in a}} <b>crate,</b> all having died of exposure. Black then interviews Law and his crew individually, each time being given a contradicting {{story of how the}} woman came to be on board the ship. However, they all agree that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E
5|$|The Ark of the Covenant {{is seen in}} {{a broken}} <b>crate</b> during the Hangar 51 opening sequence. Lucasfilm used the same prop from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

A replica of the staff carried by Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments was also used to {{populate}} the set to illustrate the Hangar's history.|$|E
5|$|Titan Quest {{would be}} one of only three {{projects}} Iron Lore worked on in its lifetime, and the only original project alongside Immortal Throne: after completing work on , an expansion to , the studio was forced to close in February 2008 due to difficulties in securing any funding for future projects. The team founded a new studio called <b>Crate</b> Entertainment and licensed the Titan Quest engine to develop Grim Dawn, dubbed by staff as a spiritual successor to Titan Quest.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturers {{claim that}} this {{rectangular}} design has cut water use by 67% to 70%, according to one dairy, {{since there are no}} <b>crates</b> to be cleaned; the absence of dirty <b>crates</b> also reduces the risk of jugs carrying contamination. There is also the reduced cost with no <b>crates</b> to be stolen: Pennsylvania dairies alone spent US$6 million replacing milk <b>crates</b> in 2005, mostly from theft.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{seeing that}} Adams was dead, Colt {{cleaned up the}} blood. The next morning (September 18), Colt placed the body into a large {{shipping}} <b>crate</b> and packed it with salt.

5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one <b>crate</b> of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a <b>crate</b> filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{gestation}} <b>crates</b> {{for pregnant}} sows {{has resulted in}} lower birth production costs; however, this practice has led to more significant animal cruelty. [...] Many of the world’s largest producers of pigs (US, Canada, China, Mexico) use gestation <b>crates</b> but some nations and nine US states have banned and removed these <b>crates.</b> The European Union has banned the use of gestation <b>crates</b> after the 4th week of pregnancy.|$|R
5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific <b>crate.</b>|$|E

This paper is intended to determine the quantity of Fanta, Coca-Cola, Schweppes and Sprite (all in <b>crates)</b> that the Company should distribute in a month {{in order to minimize}} the cost of transportation and maximize profit. A problem of this nature was identified as a Nonlinear Transportation Problem (NTP), formulated in mathematical models and tackled by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality condition for the NTP.
