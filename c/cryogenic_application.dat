40|$|The {{luminescence}} and scintillation {{properties of}} ZnS-Ag/ 6 LiF where {{studied in the}} 7 - 295 K temperature range to evaluate the suitability of the scintillator for neutron detection at very low temperature (< 1 K). It is shown that decrease of temperature has little effect upon principal luminescence and scintillation characteristics of ZnS-Ag: the changes of emission intensity are small for photoexcitation and negligible for excitation with α-particles. The recombination kinetics of the scintillation decay exhibits modest shortening of the fast decay time constant, from 4. 52 to 3. 35 μs with cooling to 10 K.

A new version of the Reynolds equation was developed, using a polytropic expansion, for both steady-state and dynamic conditions. Polytropic exponents from 1 (isothermal) to 1000 (approaching an incompressible liquid) were evaluated for two bearing numbers, selected from a range of practical interest for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>application,</b> and without cavitation. Bearing loads were insensitive to fluid compressibility for low bearing numbers, as was expected. The effect of compressibility on attitude angle was significant, even when the bearing number was low. A small amount of fluid compressibility was enough to obtain stable running conditions. Incompressible liquid lacked stability at all conditions. Fluid compressibility can be used to control the bearing dynamic coefficients, thereby influencing the dynamic behavior of the rotor-bearing system...|$|E
40|$|The X-ray {{luminescence}} and scintillation {{properties of}} undoped ZnTe crystal were investigated as function of temperature down to T< 10 K. The luminescence of ZnTe is quenched at room temperature, but below 150 K the crystal exhibits emission at 575 nm with characteristic recombination decay kinetics. The emission {{is attributed to}} the radiative annihilation of electrons captured at the shallow levels of impurities or defects with holes trapped by Zn vacancies.

40|$|The optimal {{integration}} between heat and work may {{significantly reduce the}} energy demand and consequently the process cost. This paper introduces a new mathematical model for the simultaneous synthesis of heat exchanger networks (HENs) in which the pressure levels of the process streams can be adjusted to enhance the heat integration. A superstructure is proposed for the HEN design with pressure recovery, developed via generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation. The process conditions (stream temperature and pressure) must be optimized. Furthermore, the approach allows for coupling of the turbines and compressors and selection of the turbines and valves to minimize the total annualized cost, which consists of the operational and capital expenses. The model is tested for its applicability in three case studies, including a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>application.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} energy integration reduces the quantity of utilities required, thus decreasing the overall cost.

40|$|The Gaia {{mission will}} create an {{extraordinarily}} precise three-dimensional map {{of more than}} one billion stars in our Galaxy. The Gaia spacecraft 2, built by EADS Astrium, is part of ESA's Cosmic Vision programme and scheduled for launch in 2013. Gaia measures the position, distance and motion of stars with an accuracy of 24 micro-arcsec using two telescopes at a fixed mutual angle of 106. 5 °, named the ‘Basic Angle’, at an operational temperature of 100 K. This accuracy requires ultra-high stability at cryogenic conditions, which can only be achieved by using Silicon Carbide for both the optical bench and the telescopes. TNO has developed, built and space qualified the Silicon carbide Basic Angle Monitoring (BAM) on-board metrology system 3 for this mission, measuring the relative motion of Gaia’s telescopes with accuracies in the range of 0. 5 micro-arcsec.

40|$|Welded {{equipment}} for cryogenic applications is utilized in chemical, petrochemical, and metallurgical industries. One material suitable for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>application</b> is austenitic stainless steel, which usually doesn`t present ductile/brittle transition temperature, {{except in the}} weld metal, where the presence of ferrite and micro inclusions can promote a brittle failure, either by ferrite cleavage or dimple nucleation and growth, respectively. A 25 -mm- (1 -in. -) thick AISI 304 stainless steel base metal was welded with the SAW process using a 308 L solid wire and two kinds of fluxes and constant voltage power sources with two types of electrical outputs: direct current electrode positive and balanced square wave alternating current. The welded joints were analyzed by chemical composition, microstructure characterization, room temperature mechanical properties, and CVN impact test at - 100 degrees C (- 73 degrees F). Results showed that an increase of chromium and nickel content was observed in all weld beads compared to base metal. The chromium and nickel equivalents ratio for the weld beads were always higher for welding with square wave AC for {{the two types of}} fluxes than for direct current. The modification in the Cr(eq) /Ni(eq) ratio changes the delta ferrite morphology and, consequently, modifies the weld bead toughness at lower temperatures. The oxygen content can also affect the toughness in the weld bead. The highest absorbed energy in a CVN impact test was obtained for the welding condition with square wave AC electrical output and neutral flux, followed by DC(+) electrical output and neutral flux, and square wave AC electrical output and alloyed flux.

40|$|Printed circuit heat {{exchanger}} (PCHE) {{is a highly}} integrated plate type compact {{heat exchanger}} and most important {{as well as a}} most critical component in the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>application.</b> Compact heat exchangers are characterized by area density (? = AHT / V) i. e. heat transfer area per unit volume of the heat exchanger. The area density of compact heat exchanger is = 700 m 2 /m 3 where the area density of printed circuit heat exchanger is = 25000 m 2 /m 3. Printed circuit heat exchangers are highly compact compared to conventional heat exchangers. The hydraulic diameter is less than 1 mm. Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger manufacturing process is followed by chemical etching and chemical bonding. Microchannel for fluid flow are constructed by chemical etching of the metal plates according to different configuration then plates are stacked alternately and assembled by diffusion bonding. Due to its compact size, high efficiency, large heat transfer area PCHE (microchannel heat exchanger) are used in cryogenic refrigeration and liquefaction systems. A counter flow rectangular microchannel (40 mm × 1. 6 mm × 1. 2 mm) printed circuit heat exchanger is designed and simulated using commercial ANSYS FLUENT. The performance is investigated numerically with helium at cryogenic temperature. The performance is affected by axial conduction at low Reynolds number (Re = 100). Because of length and viscous nature, the fluid flow through the channel is laminar and thermally fully developed. The Nussle number (Nu), flux, dimensionless fluid temperature and wall temperature, effectiveness are determined for different Reynolds number Reynolds number (Re = 100) with varying material i. e. wall to fluid thermal conductivity ratio (ksf = 141. 58 - 5061. 5).

40|$|A {{recently}} discovered superconductor, magnesium diboride (MgB 2), {{can be used}} to fabricate conducting leads used in cryogenic applications. Dis covered to be superconducting in 2001, MgB 2 has the advantage of remaining superconducting at higher temperatures than the previously used material, NbTi. The purpose of these leads is to provide 2 A of electricity to motors located in a 1. 3 K environment. The providing environment is a relatively warm 17 K. Requirements for these leads are to survive temperature fluctuations in the 5 K and 11 K heat sinks, and not conduct excessive heat into the 1. 3 K environment. Test data showed that each lead in the assembly could conduct 5 A at 4 K, which, when scaled to 17 K, still provided more than the required 2 A. The lead assembly consists of 12 steelclad MgB 2 wires, a tensioned Kevlar support, a thermal heat sink interface at 4 K, and base plates. The wires are soldered to heavy copper leads at the 17 K end, and to thin copper-clad NbTi leads at the 1. 3 K end. The leads were designed, fabricated, and tested at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe - Institut foer Technische Physik before inclusion in Goddard's XRS (X-Ray Spectrometer) instrument onboard the Astro-E 2 spacecraft. A key factor is that MgB 2 remains superconducting up to 30 K, which means that it does not introduce joule heating as a resistive wire would. Because the required temperature ranges are 1. 3 - 17 K, this provides a large margin of safety. Previous designs lost superconductivity at around 8 K. The disadvantage to MgB 2 {{is that it is a}} brittle ceramic, and making thin wires from it is challenging. The solution was to encase the leads in thin steel tubes for strength. Previous designs were so brittle as to risk instrument survival. MgB 2 leads can be used in any <b>cryogenic</b> <b>application</b> where small currents need to be conducted at below 30 K. Because previous designs would superconduct only at up to 8 K, this new design would be ideal for the 8 - 30 K range...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} developed to implement an improved method of testing flat-plate specimens of thermal-insulation materials for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>application.</b> The method includes testing under realistic use conditions that could include vacuum and mechanical loading at a pressure up to 70 psi (= 0. 48 MPa). The apparatus can accommodate a rigid or flexible specimen having thickness up to 1. 25 in. (= 3. 2 cm) and diameters between 6 and 10 in. (about 15. 2 and 25. 4 cm, respectively). Typical test conditions include boundary temperatures between 77 K and 373 K and vacuum/interstitial gas filling at a pressure between 10 (exp - 6) torr (= 1. 3 x 10 (exp - 4) Pa) and 760 torr (atmospheric pressure = 0. 1 MPa). The interstitial gas could be N 2, He, CO 2, or any other suitable gas to which the insulation {{is expected to be}} exposed in use. Relative to prior apparatuses and testing methods, this apparatus and the testing method that it implements offer advantages of relative simplicity and ease of use. The basic principle of operation of the apparatus is that of boil-off calorimetry, using liquid nitrogen or any other suitable liquid that boils at a desired temperature below ambient temperature. Comparative rates of flow of heat through the thicknesses of the specimens (heat-leak rates) and apparent-thermal-conductivity values are obtained from tests of specimens. Absolute values of heat-leak rates and apparent thermal conductivities are computed from a combination of (1) the aforementioned comparative values and (2) calibration factors obtained by testing reference specimens of materials that have known thermal-insulation properties. The apparatus includes a full complement of temperature sensors, a vacuum pump and chamber, a monitoring and control system, and tools and fixtures that enable rapid and reliable installation and removal of specimens. A specimen is installed {{at the bottom of the}} vacuum chamber, and a cold-mass assembly that includes a tank is lowered into position above and around the specimen (see figure). A spring-based compensating fixture helps to ensure adequate thermal contact with possibly irregular specimen surfaces. For a high-compression test, the springs can be replaced with spacers. A flat circular load cell at the bottom of the chamber measures the compressive load on the specimen. Once the desired compressive-load, temperature, and vacuum/gas-filling conditions are established, testing begins. During a test, all measurements are recorded by use of a portable data-acquisition system and a computer. The total heat-leak rate is measured and calculated as the boil-off flow rate multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization. The parasitic heat leak (to the side of the specimen and to the top and side of the cold-mass tank) is reduced to a small fraction of the total heat leak by use of a combination of multilayer-insulation (MLI) shield rings, reflective film, a fiberglass/epoxy centering ring, and a bulk fill of aerogel beads. This combination eliminates the need for a cryogenic guard chamber used in a typical prior apparatus to reduce the parasitic heat leak...|$|E
