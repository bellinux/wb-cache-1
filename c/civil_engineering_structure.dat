Despite its unique features, the bridge remains relatively unknown, and only in the 1970s did researchers from the Istanbul branch of the German Archaeological Institute carry out field examinations on the site.|$|E

40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) aims {{to develop}} {{automated}} {{systems for the}} continuous monitoring, inspection, and damage detection of structures with minimum labour involvement. The first step {{to set up a}} SHM system is to incorporate a level of structural sensing capability that is reliable and possesses long term stability. Smart sensing technologies including the applications of fibre optic sensors, piezoelectric sensors, magnetostrictive sensors and self-diagnosing fibre reinforced composites, possess very important capabilities of monitoring various physical or chemical parameters related to the health and therefore, durable service life of structures. In particular, piezoelectric sensors and magnetorestrictive sensors can serve as both sensors and actuators, which make SHM to be an active monitoring system. Thus, smart sensing technologies are now currently available, and can be utilized to the SHM of <b>civil</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>structures.</b> In this paper, the application of smart materials/sensors for the SHM of <b>civil</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>structures</b> is critically reviewed.
