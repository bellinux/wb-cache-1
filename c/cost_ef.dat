A comprehensive controlled study in Washington state of an elderly population has shown that participants who attend at least one EF class per week reduce healthcare costs by 20 % per year. The present study reports the costs and potential benefits of replicating EF on Kaua‘i. For Kaua‘i the annual <b>cost</b> of an <b>EF</b> pilot program for 132 clients would be $ 204, 735.

40|$|The consumptive use {{of water}} by almond trees in California {{has become a}} {{controversial}} topic due to a worsening drought that began in 2011. The research reported herein was designed to provide information {{that could be used}} in irrigation decision-making including how to evaluate the risks/rewards of seeking/acquiring additional supplies in a drought. Ten irrigation levels ranging from 1000 to 1350 mm per season were applied in a mature southern San Joaquin Valley ‘Nonpareil’ almond orchard over a 5 -year period. Nut load was invariant over the range of irrigation regimes with no evidence of any sustained negative impacts. Individual kernel weight was reduced commensurate with the level of deficit irrigation; the lowest irrigation resulted in a 15 % lighter kernel. Maximum yield (3900 kg/ha) was achieved with 1250 mm of applied water. There was statistically significant tree stress in the 1250 -mm application regime with midday shaded leaf water potential about 0. 2 MPa more negative than trees receiving additional water. Maximum marginal water productivity (WPM) was 0. 30 kg/m 3 at 1080 mm of applied water, falling to zero at 1290 mm. With almond prices of $ 8 /kg, this is equivalent to water valued at $ 2 /m 3. Estimated annual statewide almond orchard evapotranspiration based on this study is 1100 – 1350 mm which is about 25 % higher than estimates made four decades ago. However, yields have increased in the 250 % range since that time. This tenfold difference between yield and evapotranspiration means that WPM is much higher now than in the past, and at current prices, it demonstrates that almond trees are suited for high water <b>cost</b> areas. <b>EF</b> acknowledges the support of the Junta de Andalucia, Spain (Grant P 12 -AGR- 2521).

40|$|The α-expansion {{algorithm}} [7] has had {{a significant}} impact in computer vision due to its generality, effectiveness, and speed. Thus far it can only minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms. Our main contribution is to extend α-expansion so that it can simultaneously optimize “label costs ” as well. An energy with label costs can penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it. The simplest special case is to penalize the number of labels in the solution. Our energy is quite general, and we prove optimality bounds for our algorithm. A natural application of label costs is multi-model fitting, and we demonstrate several such applications in vision: homography detection, motion segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. Our C++/MATLAB implementation is publicly available. 1. Some Useful Regularization Energies In a labeling problem we are given a set of observations P (pixels, features, data points) and a set of labels L (categories, geometric models, disparities). The goal is to assign each observation p ∈ P a label fp ∈ L such that the joint labeling f minimizes some objective function E(f). Most labeling problems in computer vision are ill-posed and in need of regularization, but the most useful regularizers often make the problem NP-hard. Our work is about how to effectively optimize two such regularizers: a preference for fewer labels in the solution, and a preference for spatial smoothness. Figure 1 suggests how these criteria cooperate to give clean results. Surprisingly, there is no good algorithm to optimize their combination. 1 Our main contribution is a way to simultaneously optimize both of these criteria inside the powerful α-expansion algorithm [7]. Label costs. Start from a basic (unregularized) energy E(f) = ∑ pDp(fp), where optimal fp can each be determined independently from the ‘data costs’. Suppose, however, that we wish to explain the observations using as few unique labels as necessary. We can introduce label <b>costs</b> into <b>E(f)</b> to penalize each unique label that appears in f: E(f) =...|$|R
40|$|Children often {{participate}} {{in the criminal justice}} system as victims of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and, in most cases, these children do not disclose the abuse for some time. During this period of non-disclosure, CSA victims may avoid thinking about or discussing their abuse experiences. Some scholars argue that this may lead to a directed forgetting (DF) effect, whereby later recall of the unrehearsed memories becomes more difficult, but limited empirical evidence exists to support this position. The present research employed an innovative application of the directed forgetting (DF) protocol to memory for a personally experienced event. Two hundred and forty-six participants from four age groups (grade one, grade three, grade five, and university) completed an activity session during which the experimenter issued list method DF instructions. Interviews consisting of executive functioning (EF), recall, and recognition tasks occurred six and seven days later. Findings demonstrated typical costs of the forget cue: Participants recalled fewer details from the first two activities when they were forget-cued than when they were remember-cued. However, follow-up tests revealed that only children in grade five and adults demonstrated these DF <b>costs.</b> Performance on <b>EF</b> tasks did not predict DF effects. In addition, those participants who recalled the activity session in the first interview did not demonstrate reduced DF costs during the second interview. This study marks the beginning of an important area of research; implications for the application of DF to memory for CSA are discussed in light of the present findings...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission's “Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe” proposes ways to {{increase}} resource productivity and to decouple economic growth from both resource use and environmental impacts, taking a life-cycle perspective. One of its objectives is to: “Establish a common methodological approach to enable Member States {{and the private sector}} to assess, display and benchmark the environmental performance of products, services and companies based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts over the life-cycle ('environmental footprint') ”. The European Council invited the Commission to develop supporting methodologies. The Environmental Footprint (EF), launched by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre in close cooperation with Directorate-General for the Environment, gives specific guidance for comprehensive, robust and consistent environmental assessment of products and organisations. This is an important step forward to ensure robust decision support for business and policy. However, for to be more relevant to the situation and problems of specific product categories more specific guidance on how to conduct the EF study is required. The guides on Product EF (PEF) and Organisation EF (OEF) provide more specific requirements that need to be defined in so called Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs). These PEFCRs are seen as crucial for EF studies aiming at business-to-business (B 2 B) and business-to-consumer (B 2 C) communication intended to be used for comparisons and comparative assertions. The role of PEFCRs are {{to increase}} the reproducibility, consistency, comparability and relevance of EF studies, but also to increase the efficiency (reduce time, efforts and <b>costs)</b> of <b>EF</b> studies by directing the focus on the most important processes and impact categories. First steps are taken by the European Commission to develop PEFCRs through several pilot studies. These will build on: •	The recent development of guidelines on the development of Product Category Rules (PCRs) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency •	Existing PCRs and specific sector guidance such as the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Round Table, PAS 2050, GEDNets PCRs for Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and the Repository of good practice in France (related to BP X 30 - 323) •	Knowledge and experience from a broad spectre of stakeholders For the development of PEFCR {{there are at least three}} major challenges that will be discussed in the presentation: definition of the Product Category/Sector in a way that allows for meaningful comparison of products fulfilling an equivalent function, definition and modelling of an average product(s) and identifying and focussing on what matters most.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the construction, the {{analysis}} and the implementation of new efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of evolutionary oscillatory problems. More specifically the thesis concerns: the computation of oscillatory integrals over unbounded intervals, the solution of Volterra integral equations with periodic solution and of special second-order ordinary differential equations with periodic or exponentially decaying solution. Some applications, analytical properties and theoretical results are reported in Chapter 1. General purpose methods require a small stepsize in order to follow the oscillations of the solution, therefore they result inefficient. Our idea is to exploit the qualitative knowledge of the solution in order to construct new efficient and accurate numerical methods specially tuned on the problem. These methods are derived by using the Exponential Fitting (EF) theory. A more detailed description of this theory is provided in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 {{a new class of}} exponentially fitted (ef) quadrature formulae for the computation of oscillatory infinite integrals is constructed and analyzed. The weights and the nodes of these ef formulae depend on the frequency of the integrand function and are solution of a nonlinear system. To solve this system we develop a suitable efficient version of Newton method. We study the error behaviour of these formulae and we prove that the error decreases as the oscillation increases. We build exponentially fitted Gauss-Laguerre rules with 1 up to 6 nodes. Numerical experiments on significant test examples confirm theoretical expectations and show that the ef Gauss-Laguerre rules are more efficient than the classical ones. In Chapter 4 an ef Direct Quadrature (DQ) method for the numerical solution of Volterra integral equations (VIEs) with periodic solution is described. This method is based on an ef two nodes Gaussian quadrature rule. The weights and the nodes of this quadrature formula depend on the frequency of the problem and are solution of a nonlinear system. This ef Gaussian DQ method requires the knowledge of the numerical solution in points not belonging to the mesh. Therefore we develop a suitable ef interpolation formula which depends on the frequency, too, and preserves the accuracy order of the whole method. The convergence analysis shows that the order of the ef DQ method is four like the classical Gaussian DQ method, but the error is smaller when periodic problems are treated. Various numerical experiments show that on test VIEs with oscillatory or periodic solution, at the same computational <b>cost,</b> the <b>ef</b> Gaussian DQ method is more accurate than the classical Gaussian DQ method even for approximated values of the frequency. In Chapter 5, we introduce multistage methods for special second order differential equations (ODEs) with periodic or with exponentially decaying solution. We introduce these multistage methods by considering the contributions of the stage errors in the overall numerical scheme and by means the EF technique. In this way we develop a revised version of some EF-based Runge-Kutta-Nyström (RKN) methods. The coefficients of these methods depend on the problem parameters, i. e. the frequency of oscillations, for periodic problems, or the exponent, for problems with exponentially decaying solution. Therefore we propose a suitable strategy to estimate these parameters when they are not available. This strategy is based on the annihilation of the principal term of the local truncation error and does not require further function evaluations. Then an example of revised explicit two-stages ef RKN method is given and some numerical experiments are carried out. These tests show that this ef-RKN method outperforms the standard one and that the parameter estimation is sharp. Finally, in Chapter 6 we propose a parallel quadrature algorithm on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) based on Newton-Cotes formulas. This is a preliminary step for the numerical solution of multidimensional integrals and discretized Volterra integral equations. We report some numerical results obtained by the multi-GPU cluster E 4 belonging to the Department of Mathematics, University of Salerno...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} two {{challenges facing}} the management of mature fine tailings (MFT) from oil sand processing. The first challenge is the high concentration of residual bitumen in tailings ponds, which poses a hazard to aquatic biota and impact to the environment. A laboratory scale study is carried out to assess the suitability of electro-flotation (EF) for removal of bitumen from oil sand tailings slurry. The {{results of the study}} confirm that EF is effective to reduce bitumen contents of tailings slurry. At a current density 150 A/m 2, the bitumen concentration is reduced from 106. 8 mg/L to less than 10 mg/L within 90 minutes. The electrolysis voltage has direct impact to the operating <b>cost</b> of an <b>EF</b> system, hence an electrochemical model is developed to predict the total electrolysis voltage required for an EF cell. Good agreement is found between the simulation results and experimental data from both this study and the literature. Hence the model derived can be used to predict the total electrolysis voltage required for an EF cell and to optimize operating conditions of an EF cell to reduce the operating cost. The performance of EF is strongly influenced by the size of O 2 and H 2 bubbles. Therefore, in this study the bubble sizes are measured in a lab scale EF cell using a high-speed camera. The mean bubble size is found to vary in the range of 32. 7 – 68. 6 μm under different operating conditions. This study shows that the electrode material, current density, water pH, ionic strength, and frother (Tennafroth 250) concentration are important factors in controlling the bubble size. Furthermore, four mathematical distributions (normal, log-normal, Weibull and gamma distributions) are fitted to the experimental data, among which the log-normal distribution is found to be the best fit based on the lower Anderson-Darling (AD) value. The second major challenge is to thicken and consolidate the MFT for water recycling and land reclamation. The suitability of electrokinetic (EK) sedimentation to accelerate sedimentation of MFT is investigated in this study. Based on the experimental data, an electric field intensity of 150 V/m along with an initial tailings solid concentration of no more than 5 % are the optimum operating condition for EK sedimentation of MFT, in terms of reducing the overall sedimentation time and increasing the final solid concentration. The results show that the current density of EK sedimentation for MFT should not be more than 20 A/m 2 to control the bubble effect and reduce power consumption...|$|R
