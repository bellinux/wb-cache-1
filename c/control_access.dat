5|$|After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Goebbels {{used his}} {{propaganda}} ministry and the Reich chambers to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' {{jurisdiction over the}} dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals {{for the remainder of}} the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the site}} was founded to honour {{the memory of the}} Newfoundland Regiment, it also {{contains}} a number of memorials as well as four cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; that of Y Ravine Cemetery, Hawthorn Ridge Cemeteries No. 1 and No. 2 and the unusual mass burial site of Hunter's Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The ever-increasing number of visitors to the Memorial has resulted in the authorities taking measures to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> by fencing off certain areas of the former battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Anderitum {{appears to}} have been a {{particularly}} important link in the Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted in coordination with naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through the Channel. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland. It was linked by a road built in the late Roman period, probably at the same time as the fort.|$|E

5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery {{played an important role}} in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E

In this paper we provide systematic constructions for various common forms of both of the traditional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> paradigms using the role-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (RBAC) models of Sandhu et al., commonly called RBAC 96.

5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. Falling out of favour with Bormann meant that access to Hitler was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to Hitler, this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise {{the inner workings of the}} Third Reich.|$|E

40|$|As the {{development}} of computer science and smart health-care technology, there is a trend for patients to enjoy medical care at home. Taking enormous users in the Smart Health-care System into consideration, <b>access</b> <b>control</b> is an important issue. Traditional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models, discretionary <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> mandatory <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> and role-based <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> do not properly reflect the characteristics of Smart Health-care System. This paper proposes an advanced <b>access</b> <b>control</b> model for the medical health-care environment, task-role-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> model, which overcomes the disadvantages of traditional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models. The task-role-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (T-RBAC) model introduces a task concept, dividing tasks into four categories. It also supports supervision role hierarchy. T-RBAC is a proper <b>access</b> <b>control</b> model for Smart Health-care System, and it improves the management of access rights. This paper also proposes an implementation of T-RBAC, a binary two-key-lock pair <b>access</b> <b>control</b> scheme using prime factorization...|$|R

5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and <b>control</b> <b>access</b> to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on {{the mental health of}} his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} to {{the inner}} bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with transomed windows and fireplaces, probably used as the lodgings for the judges. There were probably additional heraldic supporters displayed alongside the arms, since lost. A porter's lodge {{would have been on}} the right hand side of the entrance to <b>control</b> <b>access,</b> with the rooms accessed by a spiral staircase in a protruding tower, with prominent triple chimneys, since lost. Alongside the gatehouse was originally a half-timbered building, possibly a laundry, approximately , which has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{tourists}} can have negative effects; wildlife may be disturbed, particularly species that breed in exposed areas, such as ringed plovers, and plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. Damage can be reduced by measures such as wardening the breeding colonies and using fences, boardwalks and signs to <b>control</b> <b>access.</b> The access paths to the hides, other than the northernmost, are largely boardwalked, and an extensive programme of fence replacement and improvements to the control of water levels on the reserve took place in 2010–2011.|$|E
