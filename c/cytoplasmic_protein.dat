5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>protein</b> Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E
25|$|Like hemoglobin, {{myoglobin}} is a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>protein</b> {{that binds}} oxygen on a heme group. It harbors only one heme group, whereas hemoglobin has four. Although its heme group {{is identical to}} those in Hb, Mb has a higher affinity for oxygen than does hemoglobin. This difference is related to its different role: whereas hemoglobin transports oxygen, myoglobin's function is to store oxygen.|$|E

They are highly associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and are rarely found in other connective tissue diseases. Around 20–40% of polymyositis is positive for Jo-1 antibodies and most will have interstitial lung disease, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DRw52 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers; collectively known as Jo-1 syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Many {{microorganisms}} excrete typical <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> {{into the}} culture supernatant. As {{none of the}} classical secretion systems appears to be involved, this type of secretion {{was referred to as}} “nonclassical protein secretion. ” Here, we demonstrate that in Staphylococcus aureus the major autolysin plays a crucial role in release of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Comparative secretome analysis revealed that in the wild type S. aureus strain, 22 typical <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> were excreted into the culture supernatant, although in the atl mutant they were significantly decreased. The presence or absence of prophages had little influence on the secretome pattern. In the atl mutant, secondary peptidoglycan hydrolases were increased in the secretome; the corresponding genes were transcriptionally up-regulated suggesting a compensatory mechanism for the atl mutation. Using glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a cytoplasmic indicator enzyme, we showed that all clinical isolates tested excreted this protein. In the wall teichoic acid-deficient tagO mutant with its increased autolysis activity, GAPDH was excreted in even higher amounts than in the WT, confirming the importance of autolysis in excretion of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins.</b> To answer the question of how discriminatory the excretion of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> is, we performed a two-dimensional PAGE of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> isolated from WT. Surprisingly, the most abundant proteins in the cytoplasm were not found in the secretome of the WT, suggesting that there exists a selection mechanism in the excretion of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins.</b> As the major autolysin binds at the septum site, we assume that the proteins are preferentially released at and during septum formation...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> {{that are}} {{involved}} in G pro-tein-coupled receptor signaling cascades are known to translocate to the plasma membrane upon receptor acti-vation, such as beta-arrestin 2. Based on this example and in order to identify new <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> implicated in the ON-and-OFF cycle of G protein-coupled receptor, a live-imaging screen of fluorescently labeled <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> was performed using translocation criteria. The screening of 193 fluorescently tagged human proteins identified eight proteins that responded to activation of the tachykinin NK 2 receptor by a change in their intracel-lular localization. Previously we have presented the func-tional characterization of one of these proteins, REDD 1, that translocates to the plasma membrane. Here we re-port the results of the entire screening.

25|$|At least 25 {{vir genes}} on the Ti plasmid are {{necessary}} for tumor induction. In addition to their perception role, virA and chvE induce other vir genes. The virA protein has autokinase activity: it phosphorylates itself on a histidine residue. Then the virA protein phosphorylates the virG protein on its aspartate residue. The virG protein is a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>protein</b> produced from the virG Ti plasmid gene. It is a transcription factor, inducing the transcription of the vir operons. The chvE protein regulates the second mechanism of the vir genes' activation. It increases VirA protein sensitivity to phenolic compounds.|$|E

In these Con A-treated cells, {{the association of}} <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> with cell membranes was suggested by observing their Triton shells. The transition from G-actin to F-actin occurred in these cells. The association of membrane lipid with <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> extracted from AH cells was studied by the isolation of protein-bound liposomes and phase transition release. The analysis of isolated liposomes revealed that many <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> which specifically associated with liposomes were cytoskeletal elements including F-actins. The association of proteins with liposomes was affected by the lipid composition of the liposomal membrane and by the Ca 2 + concentration of the incubation medium. The strong interaction of liposomal membrane with <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> or isolated cytoskeletal proteins was demonstrated also by phase transition release using carboxy fluorescein-containing liposomes. These experiments showed {{that there was a}} strong affinity between lipid membrane and cytoskeletal elements including F-actins and that the amount of F-actin increased due to Con A treatment.

40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{serves as}} an {{excellent}} model to study protein secretion at a proteomic scale. Most of the extracellular proteins are exported from the cytoplasm via the secretory (Sec) pathway. Despite extensive studies, the secretion mechanisms of about 25 % of the extracellular proteins are unknown. This suggests that B. subtilis makes use of alternative mechanisms to release proteins into its environment. In search for novel pathways, which contribute to biogenesis of the B. subtilis exoproteome, we investigated a possible role of the large conductance mechanosensitive channel protein MscL. We compared protein secretion by MscL deficient and proficient B. subtilis cells. MscL did not contribute to secretion under standard growth conditions. Unexpectedly, we discovered that under hypo-osmotic shock conditions specific, normally <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> were released by mscL mutant cells. This protein release was selective since not all <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> were equally well released. We established that this protein release by mscL mutant cells cannot be attributed to cell death or lysis. The presence of MscL, therefore, seems to prevent the specific release of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> by B. subtilis during hypo-osmotic shock. Our unprecedented findings imply that an unidentified system for selective release of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> is active in B. subtilis...|$|R

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{the common}} name for a {{heterogeneous}} group of highly drug-resistant staphylococci. Two major MRSA classes are distinguished based on epidemiology, namely community-associated (CA) and hospital-associated (HA) MRSA. Notably, the distinction of CA-and HA-MRSA based on molecular traits remains difficult due to the high genomic plasticity of S. aureus. Here we sought to pinpoint global distinguishing features of CA-and HA-MRSA through a comparative genome and proteome analysis of the notorious MRSA lineage USA 300. We show {{for the first time}} that CA-and HA-MRSA isolates can be distinguished by 2 distinct extracellular protein abundance clusters that are predictive not only for epidemiologic behavior, but also for their growth and survival within epithelial cells. This 'exoproteome profiling' also groups more distantly related HA-MRSA isolates into the HA exoproteome cluster. Comparative genome analysis suggests that these distinctive features of CA-and HA-MRSA isolates relate predominantly to the accessory genome. Intriguingly, the identified exoproteome clusters differ in the relative abundance of typical <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins,</b> suggesting that signatures of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> in the exoproteome represent a new distinguishing feature of CA-and HA-MRSA. Our comparative genome and proteome analysis focuses attention on potentially distinctive roles of 'liberated' <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> in the epidemiology and intracellular survival of CA-and HA-MRSA isolates.

40|$|Novel markers for {{prostate}} cancer (PCa) are needed because current established markers such as prostate-specific antigen lack diagnostic specificity and prognostic value. Proteomics analysis of serum from mice grafted with human PCa xenografts resulted {{in the identification of}} 44 tumor-derived proteins. Besides secreted proteins we identified several <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins,</b> among which were most subunits of the proteasome. Native gel electrophoresis and sandwich ELISA showed that these subunits are present as proteasome complexes in the serum from xenograft-bearing mice. We hypothesized that the presence of proteasome subunits and other <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> in serum of xenografted mice could be explained by the secretion of small vesicles by cancer cells, so-called exosomes. Therefore, mass spectrometry and Western blotting analyses of the protein content of exosomes isolated from PCa cell lines was performed. This resulted in the identification of mainly <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>proteins</b> of which several had previously been identified in the serum of xenografted mice, including proteasome subunits. The isolated exosomes also contained RNA, including the gene fusion TMPRSS 2 -ERG product.
