25|$|Rubella has {{symptoms}} {{that are similar}} to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathy),</b> joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
500|$|Antibiotics {{tend to be}} {{used when}} local {{measures}} cannot be carried out immediately. In this role, antibiotics suppress the infection until local measures can be carried out. [...] Severe trismus may occur in when the muscles of mastication are involved in an odontogenic infection, making any surgical treatment impossible. Immunocompromised individuals are less able to fight off infections, and antibiotics are usually given. Evidence of systemic involvement (such as a fever higher than 38.5°C, <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> or malaise) also indicates antibiotic therapy, as do rapidly spreading infections, cellulitis, or severe pericoronitis. Drooling and difficulty swallowing are signs that the airway may be threatened, and may precede difficulty in breathing. [...] Ludwig's angina and cavernous sinus thrombosis are rare but serious complications of odontogenic infections. Severe infections tend to be managed in hospital.|$|E

Whole-body PET revealed increased FDG uptake into the corresponding tumors and lymph nodes with no detectable focal abnormalities elsewhere. FDG-PET excluded an adenocarcinoma metastasized from another part of the body and provided the diagnosis. Additionally, FDG-PET may be used as a biological marker for assessing the malignant potential of the tumor and predicting the outcome of the disease. ability of PET/PET-CT for patients with cervical lymph node metastases from UPT has been reported and was regarded to be a useful tool [1 - 4].

40|$|Fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy (FNAB) {{is currently}} the first line investigation for the diagnosis and triage of head and neck masses. Cytomorphological evaluation of FNAB specimens allows a diagnosis in many cases. However, there are many challenging diagnostic areas {{in the head and}} neck including thyroid neoplasia, salivary gland neoplasia, and lymph nodes. Important advances in FNAB diagnosis have been made over the last decades, especially with the routine use of several ancillary techniques and markers on FNAB specimens that have allowed optimizing the cytomorphological diagnosis, and have reshaped the practice of cytopathology. In this thesis, we discuss the major role and limitations of FNAB for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> and salivary gland lesions. We cover some of the current challenges in these areas, selected diagnostic pitfalls, and recent advances including ancillary techniques such as immunocytochemistry and molecular analyses that can be applied on FNAB samples...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIntroduction. Kimura's {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} and autoimmune disease that is endemic in Middle East and Asian countries but remains rare in Europe. It usually presents as subcutaneous nodules combined with <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> in the cervicofacial region. The oral mucosa localization is extremely rare. We {{report for the}} first time a case of hard palate localization. Observation. A 61 -year-old male patient from Martinique consulted for a recent median, extensive and poorly defined black area localized on the hard palate. It was painless and did not cause any discomfort. We performed a biopsy to rule out a melanoma. The pathology report led to diagnosing Kimura's disease. The biological parameters, especially the renal status, were normal. A simple medical supervision was prescribed. Discussion. This was the first time Kimura's disease was observed as a pigmented area located on the hard palate. The diagnosis of melanoma first had to be ruled out. The histological and immuno-histological parameters are mandatory to make a diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Making an {{accurate}} diagnosis of tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (TCL) {{has been a}} problem to clinicians because it is a versatile masquerader and is often confused with lymphomas or cervical metastases. Ultrasound (US) has advantages over other examination modalities in that it is noninvasive, inexpensive, time-saving, and able to guide procedures such as fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy. It is increasingly being recognized as a primary tool for the evaluation of cervical lymph nodes. In this article, we present six cases with microscopically and/or pathologically confirmed TCL and illustrate the US features. A literature review was also conducted. The key US features of TCL include hypoechogenecity, strong internal echoes, echogenic thin layers, nodal matting, soft tissue changes, and displaced hilar vascularity. US is a reliable and effective tool in assessing <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> When TCL is suspected under US, US-guided procedures such as fine-needle aspiration or core-needle biopsy can be conducted concomitantly to obtain the microscopic or pathological proof...|$|R
40|$|To {{establish}} {{the frequency of}} infectious aetiology in Mexican adult patients with <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> (CLAs), 87 consecutive patients with enlarged cervical lymphatic nodes, HIV negative and without anti-tuberculous treatment, were selected from a tertiary-level speciality concentration hospital. Histopathological studies, investigation of acid-fast bacilli, cultures in Löwenstein Jensen and Mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) media, and in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with IS 6110 -based primers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were performed in resected lymphatic nodes. Non-infectious aetiology corresponded to 45 cases (52 %). Tuberculosis was suspected in 42 cases (48 %) by histology and confirmed positive results were obtained by staining in 8 (19 %), by culture in 23 (55 %), and by PCR in 34 (81 %) patients. All were confirmed after therapeutic success. In addition to the epidemiological transition process occurring in Mexico, tuberculosis remains an important cause of CLA.

40|$|Background: Head and Neck {{region of}} the body has a rich network of lymphatic channel and {{intervening}} nodes. Out of total approximately 800 lymph nodes in the body about 300 are scattered in organized fashion in the neck region which are affected by various regional and systemic diseases. 1 The conventional method of excisional biopsy is used to diagnose etiological causes of lymphadenopathy. In comparison to open surgical biopsy, FNAC is a simple, reliable and acceptable tool for the etiological diagnosis of lymphadenopathies. FNAC was first practiced by Grieg and Gray for the diagnosis of trypanosome in lymphnode in 1904. Now a day it is widely practiced in United States, United Kingdom and many other countries. In Bangladesh, many studies on FNAC are carried out {{and the results are}} highly appreciable and reliable. Methods: A prospective study for a period of 24 months was carried out on 50 patients with enlarged cervical lymph nodes from July 2003 to June 2005. During the two years study period, 56 patients with <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> were selected for FNAC and ope...|$|R

In this report, we have presented {{an early stage}} case of tularemia with fever and pharyngitis and two cases from the same non-endemic region with typical lymphadenitis. All three patients were treated with non-specific medications in healthcare centres, the treatment being directed towards symptoms resembling those of upper respiratory tract infections. However, there was no regression in their complaints. Because the first case had been treated earlier, his lymphadenopaties regressed {{and there was no}} suppuration. The other two cases, which had been suspected to be exposed to the same pathogen based on their histories, were at a mild acute phase and presented to our clinic with typical lymphadenitis. The diagnoses of each of the three patients were made serologically. An early clinical recovery was achieved in the first patient with streptomycin (1 x 1 g/day im) and doxycyline (2 x 100 mg/day peroral) therapy.
