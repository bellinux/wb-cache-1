This method explicitly accounts for the remnant of the pilot, yielding continuous estimates of the pilot describing functions with lower variance.

40|$|A novel dual-frequency {{excitation}} {{technique is}} introduced which permits {{investigation of the}} low-frequency dispersion of Canola plant protoplasts using feedback-controlled dielectrophoretic levitation. The upper and intermediate frequency spectra obtained using the new technique are generally consistent with previous work. However, below some <b>cross-over</b> <b>frequency</b> fOL, the protoplasts exhibit an apparent positive dielectrophoretic response that is not predicted by conventional theory. This <b>cross-over</b> <b>frequency</b> is linearly related to suspension conductivity, virtually independent of the suspension pH, and inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} cell radius. Examination of the complex Clausius-Mossotti polarization coefficient reveals that the observed positive dielectrophoretic response can not be accounted for in terms of Maxwell-Wagner polarization associated with a conventional layered model for the protoplast. The failure of straightforward enhancements to the protoplast model in explaining the low frequency behavior may indicate the presence of an electrophoretic contribution to the net observable force on the particle.

The discovery of first transparent p-type semiconductor CuAlO 2 in 1997 by Kawazoe et.al[2] triggered the development of ‘transparent electronics’ field. Reducing crystallite size of materials from micron to the nanodimension led to fundamental and technological importance due to their enhanced properties. Because if the crystallite size reduced to nanoscale the volume fraction of the atoms residing in the grain boundaries are increased so it induce dramatic changes in their electrical and dielectric properties which are important for their applications. The inter-granular regions often {{have a significant effect on}} the flow of electronic current. It gives rise to some very interesting and useful properties which are exploited in many commercial devices, but this depends on the method of material preparation and post processing treatments. Recently Gao et.al[3] observed the enhancement of electrical conductivity from 1 [*]S/cm to 2.4 [*]S/cm when the crystallite size was reduced to nanodimension. Techniques like pulsed laser deposition[2], ion exchange reaction[3] and sputtering[4] were widely used to synthesis single phase CuAlO 2. Recently the author reported the synthesis of nanocrystalline CuAlO 2 by mechanical alloying process using Cu 2 O and α-Al 2 O 3 powders, the grain and grain boundary contribution electrical conductivities[5] and the existence of Debye type dielectric relaxation behaviour[6].

The current experiments were limited to a linear {{system in which the}} crossover frequency dividing the channels was systematically varied. The subjects for the experiment were nine individuals with mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss with various audiometric con-figurations. The subjects listened to continuous discourse, in noise, via a computer-controlled digital master hearing aid containing two real-time data acquisition processors. Initially, a modified simplex procedure was used to obtain preferred frequency-gain responses using several different crossover frequencies. A round-robin procedure was then conducted in which each preferred response from the simplex was compared with every other pre-ferred response. The frequency-gain responses chosen most often for the two- and three-channel systems were compared. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} preferred frequency-gain response for the two- versus the three-channel system. In addition, the preferred response chosen most often was not consistently observed at the same crossover frequency for all subjects, with the exception of those with steeply sloping hearing loss who chose 1, 120 Hz as the first or second preference for the two-channel system. The round-robin results were rank-ordered according to the number of times each frequency-gain response was chosen.

There were three preswirl conditions tested, each separated by a 6. 9 bar (100 psi) difference in inlet pressure. Therefore, normalized preswirl results were compared. The normalized results indicate that introducing inlet fluid preswirl affects the crosscoupled stiffness and effective damping coefficients. Inlet preswirl increases the magnitude of cross-coupled stiffness. Effective damping decreases with inlet preswirl, as well as the effective damping <b>cross-over</b> <b>frequency</b> increasing. These results indicate that swirl brakes would be of great value. Rotor speed had a significant effect on the cross-coupled coefficients; both increased with speed. Experimental results were compared to results for a constant hole depth holepattern seal. The variable hole-depth seal has higher direct damping. The crosscoupled stiffness and cross-coupled damping coefficients were very similar. The direct stiffness was always lower at lower frequencies and higher at higher frequencies for the variable hole depth hole-pattern seal. This was also the case for effective stiffness. The effective damping of the variable hole-depth seal was not only larger than for the constant hole depth seal, it also had a drastically lower <b>cross-over</b> <b>frequency.</b> The difference in <b>cross-over</b> <b>frequency</b> was 40 percent on average.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of high supply (up to 84 bar) pressure testing of hole-pattern annular gas seals performed at the Texas A & M Turbomachinery Laboratory in College Station, TX. The test variables were chosen to determine the influence of pressure ratio, rotor speed, and negative preswirl on seal performance. Preswirl signifies the circumferential fluid flow entering a seal, and negative preswirl indicates a fluid swirl in the direction opposite of rotor rotation. Changes in pressure ratio had only small effects on most rotordynamic coefficients. Cross-coupled stiffness showed slightly different profiles through the mid-range of excitation frequencies. Pressure ratio showed some influence on direct and cross-coupled damping at low excitation frequencies. Rotor speed significantly affected both cross-coupled stiffness and cross-coupled damping. As rotor speed increased, the magnitude of cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients increased due to the positive fluid swirl induced by rotor rotation. For the low rotor speed, negative inlet preswirl was able to overpower the positive rotor induced fluid rotation, producing a negative cross-coupled stiffness. This outcome showed that, for hole-pattern seals, positive fluid swirl does indeed produce positive cross-coupled stiffness coefficients and negative fluid swirl produces negative cross-coupled stiffness coefficients. The addition of negative preswirl greatly reduced cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients, while direct rotordynamic terms were unaffected. <b>Cross-over</b> <b>frequency</b> signifies the excitation frequency where effective damping transitions from a negative value to a positive value with increasing excitation frequency. Peak effective damping was increased by 50 percent and <b>cross-over</b> <b>frequency</b> reduced by 50 percent for high-negative preswirl versus zero preswirl results. This led to the conclusion that a reverse swirl could greatly enhance the stability of hole-pattern balance piston seals. A two-control-volume model that uses the ideal gas law at constant temperature (ISOT) was used to predict rotordynamic coefficients and leakage. This model predicted direct rotordynamic coefficients well, but greatly under predicted cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients especially at high negative preswirls. The model predicted seal leakage well at low pressure ratios, but showed increasing error as the pressure ratio was increased. These results showed that the prediction model could not adequately estimate cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients for a hole-pattern seal with negative inlet preswirl and requires modification to do so...|$|E
