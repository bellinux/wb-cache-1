5|$|In 1965 {{the term}} design {{management}} {{was first published}} {{in a series of articles}} in the Design Journal. This series includes a pre-publication of the first chapter of the book Design Management by Michael Farr, which is considered as the first comprehensive literature on design management. His thoughts on system theory and project management led to a framework on how to deal with design as a business function at the <b>corporate</b> <b>management</b> level by providing the language and methodology to effectively manage it.|$|E
5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of <b>corporate</b> <b>management</b> and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E

40|$|The {{media can}} make or break a reputation. This being said, it seems to be {{essential}} for companies, governments and institutions to pay specific attention to <b>corporate</b> media <b>management</b> in their daily operations. However, this thesis shows that they often neglect to pay adequate attention to <b>corporate</b> media <b>management.</b> This is primarily due to the complexity of the corporate media process and <b>corporate</b> media <b>management</b> and the scope of a possible media impact. This thesis argues that <b>corporate</b> media <b>management</b> should {{be an integral part of}} operations in companies, governments and institutions. This would lift <b>corporate</b> media <b>management</b> to the level of ‘governance’. But, how do you set up corporate media governance and <b>corporate</b> media <b>management</b> in such a way that organizations are able to strengthen their grip on the corporate media process in order to improve the output of their corporate media communication? The research for a method or tool that organizations can use to define their corporate media governance and professionalize their <b>corporate</b> media <b>management</b> in order to get more grip on their communication with the media, ultimately resulted in a Corporate Media Scorecard.

This asymmetric response follows from selective selfattribution: successes tend to be attributed to one’s own skill, while failures tend to be attributed to bad luck. Thus, our results show that managerial behavioral biases can also impact <b>corporate</b> risk <b>management.</b> <b>corporate</b> risk <b>management,</b> behavioral biases, managerial overconfidence, speculation...|$|R

40|$|Since {{economic}} reforms began in 1978, China’s enterprises have undergone considerable changes. So too have the taxation system have experienced major reforms {{over the last}} three decades to closely resemble those of the market economies, which included the introduction of corporate income taxes in the country. Since corporate tax is a significant cost to enterprises, firms have introduced <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> to strengthen financial decision-making. The extant theories on <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> have not always been consistent, which is more so with the empirical evidence from China given its unique transition from a socialist structure to one where the market have gradually increased its role in the economy. Given the complexity of the economy and still paramount role of the state in the economy there are still loopholes that corporations often exploit to their advantage, which may make tax management in Chinese listed companies inefficient and unpredictable. The central objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the economic consequences of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> in China. In doing so, the study posits the following three research questions: firstly, what is the impact of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> on firm performance and how tax management can help maximize firm value?; secondly, what are the market outcomes of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> and how does government ownership influence these outcomes?; and thirdly, what is the impact of corruption and marketization on <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management,</b> and how do they affect firm performance? The results show that that <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> has a negative direct impact on firms’ market value, which support the agency theory of tax <b>management.</b> Nevertheless, <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> can promote market value through the indirect improvement of firms’ profitability and growth, which suggests that tax management can help but they need the deployment of a sound and effective corporate governance mechanism. Next, the findings show that <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> has the potential to cause adverse future market outcomes so as to cause stock price crashes, which support the bad news hoarding theory. The evidence shows that state ownership cannot alleviate this crash risk. Indeed, municipal listed state-controlled enterprises are more likely to face future crash risks than other enterprises. Finally, the findings show that corruption affects <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> non-linearly in China, which support the theories of “grabbing hand” and “helping hand”. Moreover, corruption positively affects the performance of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management.</b> Furthermore, marketization helps to mitigate the impact of corruption on <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> at both phases of the inverted U-shaped curve. Overall, the thesis shows that <b>corporate</b> tax <b>management</b> is an important financial strategy that can be designed to enhance the wealth of shareholders. However, due to agency problems, the real consequences of tax management have remained uncertain. The solution to addressing agency problems is to bolster enterprise management with sound internal corporate governance through effective coordination with external markets and institutional development...|$|R
