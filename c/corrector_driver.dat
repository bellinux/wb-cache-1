It enables imaging, spectroscopic, and polarimetric analysis of the radiation from astronomical objects {{out of reach of}} northern hemisphere telescopes. It was originally planned to be a copy of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory, but while adapting the construction plans, significant changes were introduced to its design, especially to the spherical aberration <b>corrector.</b> The main <b>driver</b> for these changes were desired improvements to the telescope's field of view.|$|R
