Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level.

40|$|The {{climate of}} the North Atlantic region {{exhibits}} fluctuations on decadal timescales that have large societal consequences. Prominent examples include hurricane activity in the Atlantic 1, and surface-temperature and rainfall variations over North America 2, Europe 3 and northern Africa 4. Although these multidecadal variations are potentially predictable if {{the current state of}} the ocean is known 5, 6, 7, the lack of subsurface ocean observations 8 that constrain this state has been a limiting factor for realizing the full skill potential of such predictions 9. Here we apply a simple approach—that uses only sea surface temperature (SST) observations—to partly overcome this difficulty and perform retrospective decadal predictions with a climate model. Skill is improved significantly relative to predictions made with incomplete knowledge of the ocean state 10, particularly in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific oceans. Thus these results point towards the possibility of routine decadal climate predictions. Using this method, and by considering both internal natural climate variations and projected future anthropogenic forcing, we make the following forecast: over the next decade, the current Atlantic meridional overturning circulation will weaken to its long-term mean; moreover, North Atlantic SST and European and North American surface temperatures will <b>cool</b> <b>slightly,</b> whereas tropical Pacific SST will remain almost unchanged. Our results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade, as natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore whether there is {{evidence}} of heat acclimatization in the words used to express thermal sensation. A total of 458 urban Japanese and 601 Indonesians participated in a questionnaire. In addition, in a preliminary survey, 39 native English speakers in the UK participated. Our results showed that (1) for Indonesians, the closest thermal descriptor of a feeling of thermal comfort was ???cool??? (75 %) followed by ???slightly cool??? (7 %), ???slightly cold??? (5 %) and ???cold??? (5 %), while Japanese responses were distributed uniformly among descriptors ???<b>cool???,</b> ???<b>slightly</b> cool???, ???neither???, ???slightly warm???, and ???warm???; (2) the closest thermal descriptors of a feeling of discomfort for Indonesians were less affected by individual thermal susceptibility (vulnerability) than those for Japanese; (3) in the cases where ???cool??? and ???slightly cold??? were imagined in the mind, the descriptors were cognized as a thermal comfortable feeling by 97 % and 57 % of Indonesians, respectively; (4) the most frequently voted choice endorsing hot weather was ???higher than 32 ??C??? for Indonesians and ???higher than 29 ??C??? for Japanese respondents; for cold weather, ???lower than 15 ??C??? for Japanese and ???lower than 20 ??C??? for Indonesians. In summary, the descriptor ???cool??? in Indonesians connotes a thermally comfortable feeling, but the inter-zone between hot and cold weather that was judged in the mind showed a upward shift when compared to that of Japanese. It is suggested that linguistic heat acclimatization exists on a cognitive level for Indonesians and is preserved in the words of thermal descriptors...|$|E
