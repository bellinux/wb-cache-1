40|$|The {{symbiotic}} system AG Dra {{is one of}} {{the best}} representatives of the category of the supersoft X-ray sources. The system was subject in recent times to a sequence of visual outbursts which were monitored in X-rays with the EXOSAT and ROSAT satellites, and in the ultraviolet with the IUE satellite. We find that during all the outbursts so far monitored, the visual brightening was associated with an increase of the UV flux, while the X-ray countrate largely faded. This systematic optical/UV and X-ray anticorrelation is explained, rather than by a quencing of the high energy source, by the increase of the accretor radius during outburst, and by the <b>consequent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> its surface temperature which moves the maximum emission from soft X-rays to EUV.

30|$|It is {{important}} to underline that, to define a good WNP, {{it is necessary to}} satisfy two crucial major requirements for the optimal functioning of a WDN: 1) network connectivity, i.e. each demand node of the water network must be connected to at least one water source, and 2) nodal minimum pressure, i.e. each node must have a pressure equal or higher than the minimum level of service that allows satisfying the water demand of the users. Therefore, the design of a WNP, as any problem of network subdivision, is a complex challenge for operators, because the permanent partitioning changes the original topological layout of water systems. Indeed, network partitioning, achieved by pipe closures, reduces the overall pipe section availability, with the <b>consequent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> network water pressure, especially during peak hours, worsening the level of service offered to users.|$|R
30|$|Referring to Fig.  5, on the {{one hand}} the {{percentage}} of correct answers is a proper quantification of the efficiency of the application of the various reconstruction algorithms for low-contrast details identification, on the other hand the standard deviation is a good descriptor of inter-observer’s variability of image quality evaluation. The comparison between the different acquisition and image reconstruction modalities confirmed the highest efficiency for IMR, level 3 [22]. In fact, in all tested conditions low-contrast detection rates were greater for IMR than for FBP or iDOSE; low-contrast detectability was preserved with IMR up to a tube loading reduction to 40 mAs. In accordance to Katsura et al.

Detailed analysis of these spectra leads to a picture in which carbon initially enters into N vacancies producing a marked improvement in the crystalline properties of the material.

40|$|Abstract Background Surgical {{orthopedic}} {{treatment of}} the mandible depends {{on the development of}} techniques resulting in adequate healing processes. In a new technical and conceptual alternative recently introduced by Puricelli, osteotomy is performed in a more distal region, next to the mental foramen. The method results in an increased area of bone contact, resulting in larger sliding rates among bone segments. This work aimed to investigate the mechanical stability of the Puricelli osteotomy design. Methods Laboratory tests complied with an Applied Mechanics protocol, in which results from the Control group (without osteotomy) were compared with those from Test I (Obwegeser-Dal Pont osteotomy) and Test II (Puricelli osteotomy) groups. Mandible edentulous prototypes were scanned using computerized tomography, and digitalized images were used to build voxel-based finite element models. A new code was developed for solving the voxel-based finite elements equations, using a reconditioned conjugate gradients iterative solver. The Magnitude of Displacement and von Mises equivalent stress fields were compared among the three groups. Results In Test Group I, maximum stress was seen in the region of the rigid internal fixation plate, with value greater than those of Test II and Control groups. In Test Group II, maximum stress was in the same region as in Control group, but was lower. The results of this comparative study using the Finite Element Analysis suggest that Puricelli osteotomy presents better mechanical stability than the original Obwegeser-Dal Pont technique. The increased area of the proximal segment and <b>consequent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> the size of lever arm applied to the mandible in the modified technique yielded lower stress values, and consequently greater stability of the bone segments. Conclusion This work showed that Puricelli osteotomy of the mandible results in greater mechanical stability when compared to the original technique introduced by Obwegeser-Dal Pont. The increased area of the proximal segment and <b>consequent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> the size of lever arm applied to the mandible in the modified technique yield lower stress values and displacements, and consequently greater stability of the bone segments. </p...|$|R

40|$|Opioid-containing {{immune cells}} migrate {{preferentially}} to inflamed sites, where they release beta-endorphin which activates peripheral opioid receptors to inhibit pain(1, 2). Immunocyte recruitment is a multistep, sequential engagement of various adhesion molecules located on immune cells and vascular endothelium. Selectins mediate the initial phase of immunoctye extravasation into inflamed sites(3, 4). Here {{we show that}} anti-selectin treatment abolishes peripheral opioid analgesia elicited either endogenously (by stress) or by corticotropin-releasing factor. This results from a blockade of the infiltration of immunocytes containing beta-endorphin and the <b>consequent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> the beta-endorphin content in the inflamed tissue.

Welds of the material containing a flame retardant, which melts and volatizes at the temperatures used in welding, exhibited higher voiding and lower relative weld strengths on welding than the grade without a flame retardant.

ASAH 1 -null clones show significantly greater accumulation of long-chain saturated ceramides that are substrate for AC. As seen with administration of exogenous ceramide, AC ablation blocks cell cycle progression and accelerates senescence. Importantly, ASAH 1 -null cells also lose the ability to form cancer-initiating cells and to undergo self-renewal, which is suggestive of a key role for AC in maintaining malignancy and self-renewal of invasive melanoma cells.

In chromaffin cells, we previously reported that catecholamine secretion requires the translocation and formation of the annexin 2 tetramer near the exocytotic sites. Here, to obtain direct evidence for a role of annexin 2 in exocytosis, we modified its expression level in chromaffin cells by using the Semliki Forest virus expression system.

In darkness, the lower pH pretreatments induced an increase in IIi and a decrease in volumetric elastic modulus. In comparison to the response in unbuffered solutions, 10 and 25 millimolar Mes buffer at pH 6. 5 significantly reduced the degree of stomatal opening induced by light or by fusicoccin. These results indicate that acid-induced stomatal opening is, at least partially, due to an increase in guard cell wall elasticity which occurs in association with changes in IIi. It is suggested that the observed inhibitory effect of Mes buffer on stomatal opening may be due to a reduction in the degree of acidification of the guard cell wall and a <b>consequent</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> cell wall elasticity...|$|R
