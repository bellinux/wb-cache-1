40|$|During the 2014 - 2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, {{transmission}} chains {{were controlled}} through contact tracing, i. e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases. WHO recommendations for daily check-ups of physical symptoms with social distancing for 21 days were unevenly applied and sometimes interpreted as quarantine. Criticisms arose {{regarding the use}} of coercion and questioned contact tracing on ethical grounds. This article aims to analyze contact cases perceptions and acceptance of <b>contact</b> <b>monitoring</b> at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September-October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a biosecurity preventive measure, suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts' family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment. Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, <b>contact</b> <b>monitoring</b> raises several ethical issues. These insights should contribute to the ethics debate about individual rights versus crisis public health measures...|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} utility of {{ultrasound}} visualization for guiding ablation of cardiac tissue, an intracardiac ultrasound cardioscope incorporating a catheter visualization/delivery system into the imaging head of the device was examined in 16 dogs. The ultrasound ablation probe (Acuson 7. 5 MHz/ 8 mm) was introduced via the right external jugular vein into the right atrium/ventricle. Long axis imaging from the probe to a depth exceeding 7 cm enabled high resolution visualization extending from the pulmonary veins, through the level of each cardiac valve to the left ventricular apex. Ablation catheters along with tip electrodes were readily visualized, allowing their non-fluoroscopic passage across the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves for ventricular mapping and ablation. Specific parallel or perpendicular catheter tip/tissue orientation was readily documented in each case, as was the catheter tip/tissue contact {{with the use of}} standard and basket array catheters. For ablation of right heart structures, an ablation catheter port incorporated into the imaging head facilitated direct visualization of the catheter-tissue interface and evolving tissue injury and thrombus formation during ablation. Using non-contrast techniques, ablation lesions in the left ventricle could be measured and catheter-related clot formation monitored. Perfusion catheter tip flow used to ameliorate the ablation-related impedance rise was also documented by color flow techniques.

The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the A/V ratio on the mitral annulus and compare it to the A/V ratio on its atrial and ventricular side with transesophageal echocardiographic guidance and catheter tissue <b>contact</b> <b>monitoring.</b> MethodsTen patients in sinus rhythm undergoing atrial fibrillation catheter ablation under general anesthesia using a contact-force sensing catheter were included. After double transseptal puncture, we recorded the atrial and ventricular potentials on the mitral annulus at four defined points (3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock), with direct confirmation of the position of the catheter relative to the mitral annulus by transesophageal echocardio-graphy and contact assessment by the force sensor on the catheter tip. Then we performed the same procedure on the atrial and ventricular sides of the mitral annulus. ResultsThere is a homogeneous distribution of the amplitude of the atrial and ventricular electrograms on the mitral annulus with a good correlation (r= 0, 93; p < 0, 0001). The mean A/V ratio was 0, 57 (± 0, 078, IC 95 % 0, 540, 59) on the mitral annulus, 0, 725 (± 0, 09, IC 0, 65 - 0, 79) on the atrial side and 0, 348 (± 0, 09, IC 95 % 0, 18 - 0, 41) on the ventricular side near to the mitral annulus. These results were significantly different (p< 0, 0001). No correlation was found between this ratio and the size of the left atrium, left ventricular mass and the presence of hypertension. ConclusionsA/V ratio on the MA is 0. 57. It is significantly different from the A/V ratio on the atrial and ventricular sides of the MA, and may be used as an electrical criterion for MA localisation during ablation proceduresAbstract 0166 – Figur...|$|E

Comfort, mobility, and performance are all {{affected by the}} fit and contour of a garment to the body. Understanding the body-garment relationship allows for improvement {{of all of these}} aspects, and thus the garment and experience for the wearer. With current methods, it is possible to measure the body-garment relationship primarily in static positions, but mobile analysis is time- and equipment-intensive. A more direct garment contour and body <b>contact</b> <b>monitoring</b> procedure would benefit the functional clothing design community. Mobile measurement is especially important for functional garments, as the body-garment relationship changes over time during body movements. Here, we describe a new method developed to measure the body-garment relationship, specifically for mobile scenarios. This method detects body-garment contact using an electrical signal within a circuit formed between the garment and the body. The analog electrical connection (expressed as a varying voltage using a voltage-divider circuit) between the body and a conductive patch is processed and recorded by a microcontroller. In this investigation three main variables were evaluated for their influence on the measurement of body-garment contact: 1) patch materials, 2) applied force, and 3) patch sizes were tested within the body/garment interface. Material results showed that all of the tested materials (with the exception of one material, which contained the sparsest surface area of conductive material) facilitated a voltage response in the presence of body contact that could be viable for detecting contact between body and garment. However, preliminary tests revealed that materials with lower resistivity and more rigid structure facilitated a smoother signal with less noise, which correlated more closely with the input signal. Applied force results showed that the amount of force between the sensor and the body affects the response of the system. All patch sizes {{with the exception of the}} smallest size tested (0. 3175 cm) were effective in measuring body-garment contact. The smallest diameter possible for the conductive patch is of interest, in an attempt to minimize its effect on the body-garment measuring system. A 0. 635 cm diameter conductive hook fastener sensor was subsequently used to implement this method in a pilot evaluation of LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) fit. A grid of six analog sensors (maximum amount for microcontroller used) was integrated into the right torso region of the LCG for testing. Various movements that would be similar to movements that astronauts would be performing in EVA were used to test body-garment contact. Results show distinct differences in body contact for each sensor during each movement...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Since its conception decades ago, Photoplethysmography (PPG) the non-invasive opto-electronic technique that measures arterial pulsations in-vivo has proven its worth by achieving and maintaining its rank as a compulsory standard of patient monitoring. However successful, conventional <b>contact</b> <b>monitoring</b> mode is not suitable in certain clinical and biomedical situations, e. g., {{in the case of}} skin damage, or when unconstrained movement is required. With the advance of computer and photonics technologies, there has been a resurgence of interest in PPG and one potential route to overcome the abovementioned issues has been increasingly explored, i. e., imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG). The emerging field of iPPG offers some nascent opportunities in effective and comprehensive interpretation of the physiological phenomena, indicating a promising alternative to conventional PPG. Heart and respiration rate, perfusion mapping, and pulse rate variability have been accessed using iPPG. To effectively and remotely access physiological information through this emerging technique, a number of key issues are still to be addressed. The engineering issues of iPPG, particularly the influence of motion artefacts on signal quality, are addressed in this thesis, where an engineering model based on the revised Beer-Lambert law was developed and used to describe opto-physiological phenomena relevant to iPPG. An iPPG setup consisting of both hardware and software elements was developed to investigate its reliability and reproducibility in the context of effective remote physiological assessment. Specifically, a first study was conducted for the acquisition of vital physiological signs under various exercise conditions, i. e. resting, light and heavy cardiovascular exercise, in ten healthy subjects. The physiological parameters derived from the images captured by the iPPG system exhibited functional characteristics comparable to conventional contact PPG, i. e., maximum heart rate difference was < 3 bpm and a significant (p < 0. 05) correlation between both measurements were also revealed. Using a method for attenuation of motion artefacts, the heart rate and respiration rate information was successfully assessed from different anatomical locations even in high-intensity physical exercise situations. This study thereby leads to a new avenue for noncontact sensing of vital signs and remote physiological assessment, showing clear and promising applications in clinical triage and sports training. A second study was conducted to remotely assess pulse rate variability (PRV), which has been considered a valuable indicator of autonomic nervous system (ANS) status. The PRV information was obtained using the iPPG setup to appraise the ANS in ten normal subjects. The performance of the iPPG system in accessing PRV was evaluated via comparison with the readings from a contact PPG sensor. Strong correlation and good agreement between these two techniques verify the effectiveness of iPPG in the remote monitoring of PRV, thereby promoting iPPG as a potential alternative to the interpretation of physiological dynamics related to the ANS. The outcomes revealed in the thesis could present the trend of a robust non-contact technique for cardiovascular monitoring and evaluation...|$|E
