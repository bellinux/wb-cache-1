5|$|The <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> birds is a {{contentious}} issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
