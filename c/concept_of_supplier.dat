40|$|Recent {{thinking}} in academic and policy making circles puts forward {{the idea that}} ethnic minority businesses need to escape from their disadvantageous sectoral concentration through diversification into higher value-added activities. Drawing on the US experience, {{it has been suggested}} that intermediation initiatives that promote the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> diversity hold a great promise. Such initiatives are concerned with developing and bringing together corporate procurement officials (CPO) of large organisations and ethnic minority business owner-managers (EMBOs), so that the two parties can engage meaningfully. Yet, in the UK such initiatives are still at an early stage of development and there is little detailed evidence of their modus operandi or effectiveness. Hence, the main aim of this article is to demonstrate how nurturing and facilitating the interaction of communities of practice of CPOs and EMBOs can help their professional development and their approaches to procuring and supplying respectively. Situated learning theory is used to this effect, contributing to the debate around its usefulness and on the constructability and performative advantages of communities of practice. The paper reports on the researchers’ experience with two projects relating to intermediation initiatives that brought together and developed CPOs of large organisations and EMBOs.

40|$|Abstract. Although the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> {{diversity}} {{has been}} around for many years, the drivers for developing better supplier diversity programs have been changing over the past decade. In the past, supplier diversity has been seen as an important element of a corporation’s civic duty and social responsibility. While this continues to be a powerful justification for supplier diversity, companies increasingly believe that having a more diverse supply base will increase shareholder value and create a sustainable competitive advantage. This paper focuses on three of the key drivers for the increased value of supplier diversity programs. Censeo Consulting Group will periodically publish other articles on this topic including an upcoming article on best practices for supplier diversity programs. Introduction. Supplier diversity has been growing in importance over the past few years. In 2006, the Hackett Group estimated that “typical companies today dedicate 8 % of their spending to women- and minority-owned suppliers. ” Fueling this growth has been a major shift in the reasons for developing more effective supplier diversity programs.

40|$|Purpose – The {{ability of}} a {{manufacturing}} system to respond to customer demand {{in a timely fashion}} is widely accepted as a source of competitive advantage. While quick response concepts at system level have been widely discussed in a range of industry sectors, such as textile, electronics and fast moving consumer goods, few studies so far have specifically investigated the responsiveness of the component supply chain. This exploratory study hence aims to reconcile the considerable ambiguity that exists around the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> responsiveness, supported by an empirical investigation into the automotive parts industry. Design/methodology/approach – The study analyses the responsiveness of first‐tier automotive suppliers in Europe. The research is based on a multi‐method approach comprising of a survey, coupled with in‐depth processing mapping and complimenting interviews of production control staff at a subset of the surveyed companies. Findings – The findings suggest that supplier responsiveness is constrained by both endogenous factors originating from within their own manufacturing operations, as well as exogenous factors related to both their respective up‐stream and downstream tiers. Furthermore, the study highlights how first‐tier suppliers are “squeezed” between demanding vehicle manufacturers on the one hand, and an unresponsive raw material supply base on the other, constraining their overall ability to respond to changing market requirements. Research limitations/implications – The conclusions derived from this research are bound by the sample these are drawn from, and additional large‐scale analyses are suggested as further research. Originality/value – While the concept of “responsiveness” has been widely discussed in the supply chain literature, this debate has largely remained in the realms of qualitative description. Few studies have empirically addressed the issue of supply chain responsiveness, and if so, often focused on a subset of factors (e. g. schedule variations) only. In this paper, an holistic approach to responsiveness is adopted that aims at identifying the key variables that impact on supply chain responsiveness, as well as providing quantitative evidence to support these claims...|$|E

The research based on the relationship between them is rarely found. Purpose: To find, describe, and compare the significant relationship <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> information integration and supply risk and identify whether supplier information integration can help to mitigate supply risk in Chinese and Thai manufacturing industries. Methods: In order to answer the research questions, the search of the relevant literatures were carried out. The theoretical frame was made <b>of</b> basic <b>concepts,</b> approaches <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> information integration, and sources of supply risk. The questionnaire was designed based on the theoretical framework and sent out among Chinese and Thai listed manufacturing companies. The correlation analysis was carried out as the main approach to check the significant relationships while the   descriptive statistics were used to described, compared, and analyzed in order to indentify the level of SII and perception of supply risk. Conclusion: The level <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> information integration and the perception of supply risk showed differences in Chinese and Thai manufacturers. Chinese manufacturing industry was at medium level of IT and share tactical and strategic information with suppliers with a concern on suppliers’ suppliers while the Thai manufacturing industry was at low level of IT and shared only tactical information with suppliers with very less concern on suppliers’ suppliers. Chinese manufacturers showed an obvious lower perception of getting affected by terrorist incidents and natural disasters while Thai manufacturers showed the same perception of all sources of supply risk.

40|$|Integrated oil {{companies}} face major challenges in their businesses: While the world s {{demand for oil}} is rising, easy and cheap field exploitation is declining. In particular, the average volume of oil from the discovered oil fields in the Norwegian continental shelf is decreasing. To face these challenges, {{oil companies}} need to explore inconvenient sources like oil sands, ultra-deep-water fields or fields in arctic conditions by using specialized technology. Innovation and technological development are also necessary to improve oil recovery in maturing fields and more difficult reservoirs and to make these sites profitable. Every new development of an oil field and the activities within present unique difficulties and thus require special know-how and technology. Therefore, integrated operators must develop high levels of technology for the different needs of their field development projects as their area of action becomes even more international, which also demands {{a greater variety of}} know-how. This study explores ways that operators can resolve these difficulties by intensifying collaboration with their <b>suppliers.</b> The effects <b>of</b> involving <b>suppliers</b> in the early front-end phase of field development projects on the utilization <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> knowledge are analysed in detail. The research results are derived from a literature review {{on the one hand and}} analysis of research interviews with industry practitioners on the other.
