5000|$|Hydrocarbons (HC) - A {{class of}} burned or {{partially}} burned fuel, hydrocarbons are toxins. Hydrocarbons {{are a major}} contributor to smog, which can be a major problem in urban areas. Prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons contributes to asthma, liver disease, lung disease, and cancer. Regulations governing hydrocarbons vary according to type of engine and jurisdiction; in some cases, [...] "non-methane hydrocarbons" [...] are regulated, while in other cases, [...] "total hydrocarbons" [...] are regulated. Technology for one application (to meet a non-methane hydrocarbon standard) may not be suitable for use in an application that has to meet a total hydrocarbon standard. Methane is not directly toxic, but is more difficult to break down in a catalytic converter, so in effect a [...] "non-methane hydrocarbon" [...] regulation can be considered easier to meet. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, interest is rising in how to eliminate emissions of it. HC emissions can come not only from a vehicle's engine buts also directly from the fuel tank and lines, 24 hours a day, even when the engine is off; the complex system of fuel vent lines and a <b>charcoal</b> <b>canister</b> is meant to collect and contain fuel vapors and route them either back to the fuel tank or, after the engine is started and warmed up, into the air intake to be burned in the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of radon ((222) Rn) activity flux using activated <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters</b> was examined {{to investigate the}} distribution of the adsorbed (222) Rn in the charcoal bed and the relationship between (222) Rn activity flux and exposure time. The activity flux of (222) Rn from five sources of varying strengths was measured for exposure times of one, two, three, five, seven, 10, and 14 days. The distribution of the adsorbed (222) Rn in the charcoal bed was obtained by dividing the bed into six layers and counting each layer separately after the exposure. (222) Rn activity decreased in the layers that were away from the exposed surface. Nevertheless, the results demonstrated that only a small correction might be required in the actual application of <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters</b> for activity flux measurement, where calibration standards were often prepared by the uniform mixing of radium ((226) Ra) in the matrix. This was because the diffusion of (222) Rn in the charcoal bed and the detection efficiency {{as a function of the}} charcoal depth tended to counterbalance each other. The influence of exposure time on the measured (222) Rn activity flux was observed in two situations of the canister exposure layout: (a) canister sealed to an open bed of the material and (b) canister sealed over a jar containing the material. The measured (222) Rn activity flux decreased as the exposure time increased. The change in the former situation was significant with an exponential decrease as the exposure time increased. In the latter case, lesser reduction was noticed in the observed activity flux with respect to exposure time. This reduction might have been related to certain factors, such as absorption site saturation or the back diffusion of (222) Rn gas occurring at the canister-soil interface...|$|R
40|$|The EPA radon {{measurement}} device protocols of July 1992 specify several recommendations for quality assurance, {{which are now}} mandated as requirements by several states. These QA requirements include 1) annual calibration of measurement systems, 2) known spike measurements {{at a rate of}} 3 per 100 (minimum of 3 per year or a maximum of 6 per mo~th), 3) duplicates at a rate of 10 percent of devices deployed or a maximum of 50 per month, and 4) blanks at a rate of 5 percent of devices deployed or a maximum of 25 per month. While these requirements may have general merit for radon measurements, we propose that they axe not all needed, practical, or sensible for a primary <b>charcoal</b> <b>canister</b> laboratory.

Furthermore, in using their humidity adjustment curves, slight weight gain difference requiring the use of different calibration curves can cause the calculated radon activity to differ {{by as much as}} a factor of 2. 6. The authors have developed an improved methodology whereby the same canisters, counting equipment and similar system calibration procedures can be used to obtain more consistently reliable resu 1 ts.

Furthermore, we find that a single moisture correction factor curve, based on canister weight gain, can be used to correct the measured canister activity to the low moisture condition whereupon the average radon concentration can be directly calculated. Thus we recommend the use of oven dried canisters and an exposure time sufficient for the canisters to approach equilibrium with the environmental radon, which is three to seven days in our test.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this Project has been the {{radiological}} and alimentary assessment of the agriculture use of phosphogypsum (PG), a by-product of the fertilizer industry, as Ca-amendment in reclaimed salt-marsh soils in SW Spain. The work-plan included: PG characterization (concentrations of radionuclide and heavy metals, 222 Rn exhalation from PG stacks), experimental field studies attending {{to the effect of}} PG in agriculture soils and drainage waters, and studies on soil-to-plant transfer of radionuclides and heavy metals (through both, field and greenhouse studies). PG characterization (PG stacks) FERTIBERIA, a fertilizer factory located in Huelva (SW Spain) owns a non-active PG stack lying in the right bank of the Tinto River. From this PG stack, of about 1 km 2 and 8 - 10 m deep, PG could be extracted for agriculture uses. PG has being traditionally used since late 1970 ’s as a Ca-amendment for the reclaimed soils from the salt-marsh area of the Guadalquivir River. 222 Rn exhalation in this non-active stack has been measured following the USEPA method 115 (adapted for using cylindrical charcoal canisters). Experimental studies conducted in collaboration with the Institute of Biophysics from the University of Salzburg, demonstrated the repeatability and accuracy of the <b>charcoal</b> <b>canister</b> method for the commented determinations. The accuracy was demonstrated against the exhalation chamber method. Finally, experiments with PG columns of different heights demonstrated that the major contribution to Rn exhalation comes from the 0 - 50 cm horizon. A total of 162 measurements of 222 Rn exhalation have been carried out, corresponding to 49 sampling points distributed through three different regions in the stack (1, compacted and dry top surface area; 2, loose –tilled- dry top surface and 3, sides). Three charcoal canisters were placed at each sampling point, covering an area of ~ 1 m 2. 222 Rn exhalation values (510 ± 470, 250 ± 270 y 360 ± 170 Bq h- 1 m- 2 for regions 1, 2, y 3, respectively) show high dispersion, but their mean values were under the USEPA limit of 2664 Bq h- 1 m- 2. <b>Charcoal</b> <b>canister</b> placed over big cracks and freshly removed surfaces did not reveal any significant change in 222 Rn exhalation rates. The study of the normalized exhalation rates at different spatial scales (0. 1, 0. 75, 60 and 200 m) shows almost uniform standard deviations of ~ 0. 5. The major contribution to this variability in the scale 0. 1 - 1. 0 m has to be attributable to the variability, at the same spatial scale, of the micro and meso-structure of pores and cracks. For larger spatial scales, changes in 226 Ra concentration and percentage of humidity, contribute to the variability in the 222 Rn exhalation rates. PG samples were taken at surface level (0 - 20 cm) in 20 sampling points, and at three different depths (0 - 30 cm, 30 - 60 cm and 60 - 90 cm) in another 20 sampling points. 226 Ra was measured by liquid scintillation, providing activity concentrations of 720 ± 260 Bq kg- 1 and 690 ± 180 Bq kg- 1 (dry weight), for regions 1 and 2, respectively. These values are over the threshold level of 370 Bq kg- 1 established by the USEPA to allow the agriculture use of PG. 210 Po activity concentrations (measured by alpha spectrometry) of 660 ± 160 Bq kg- 1 y 575 ± 95 Bq kg- 1 were determined for regions 1 and 2, respectively. U-isotopes were measured by alpha spectrometry, obtaining 238 U activity concentrations of 170 ± 110 Bq kg- 1 for region 1, and 160 ± 80 Bq kg- 1 for region 2. The isotopic ratio 238 U / 234 U was 0. 97 ± 0. 03, as expected from secular equilibrium. 210 Pb concentrations were measured by gamma spectrometry in few samples, and their values were closed to the corresponding values for 210 Po activity concentrations. The above activity concentration for 226 Ra and its daughters (and in less extend U-isotopes), are more than one order of magnitude higher that those found in agriculture soils from the area of Las Marismas of Lebrija. Multi-elemental analysis of the PG samples was carried out by ICP-MS technique following USEPA 200. 8 method. PG samples, after oven-dried, disaggregated and sieved, were acid digested with supra-pure nitric acid in a microwave-oven (pseudo-total recovery). Cd concentrations were 2. 0 g/g, one order of magnitude higher than those found in the agriculture soils from Lebrija. Thus, the Cd and the radionuclides from the 238 U series will be the elements of major concern in the agriculture use of PG from FERTIBERIA stack. For the rest of the elements considered in the USEPA 200. 8 method, concentrations were not too much higher than the corresponding ones for soils (Hg was not measured). Thus, taking into account the important dilution of PG when is applied as soil amendment (homogenised in the 0 - 30 cm soil horizon), the input of these elements has to be considered as quantitatively negligible. Nevertheless, all these elements has been considered in the present study, since the scientific literature reports some effects of the PG in the mobility and bioavailability of some metals in soils...|$|E

Increasing the suction pit size and using more powerful fans improved {{the strength of the}} pressure fields within 3 to 8 m of the suction holes but did little to extend them beyond this radius. The most effective means for extending the field was found to be installing additional suction holes (depressurized by the same fan) in locations where the pressure field was the weakest. Suction holes were placed both in centralized and in near-perimeter locations reached either by interior slab holes or through holes in the exterior stem wall. Indoor radon levels were measured using 2 -day <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters,</b> continuous radon monitors, and long-term (3 mo- 1 yr) alpha track detectors.

40|$|An active {{sampling}} system using <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters</b> and an HPGe c-spectrometer {{was employed to}} survey 222 Rn and 220 Rn concentrations in 65 o$ces in Hong Kong, and a traditional method was used to record simultaneously the potential a-energy concentrations (PAEC) of 222 Rn and 220 Rn progeny at the same sites. The mean values of gas concentration, PAEC and equilibrium factor for 222 Rn were 48 $ 32 Bq m~ 3, 5. 2 $ 5. 1 mWL and 0. 38 $ 0. 13, respectively, and the corresponding values for 220 Rn were 14 $ 7 Bq m~ 3, 2. 7 $ 2. 1 mWL and 0. 050 $ 0. 016. These values were in general higher than those in dwellings in Hong Kong, which {{was due to the}} poorer fresh air exchange in o$ces. Factors a!ecting the concentrations of 222 Rn, 220 Rn and their progeny were also studied.

50|$|The {{company is}} best known for the Quadrajet carburetor, which was {{originally}} designed in the 1960s and remained in production, with modifications to meet progressively tightening exhaust emission limits, into the 1980s. The Quadrajet became computer controlled in 1980 in California and in 1981 {{in the rest of the}} states; its last application was on the 1990 Cadillac Brougham and 1990 full size GM station wagons with the Olds 307 engine. RPD was a pioneer in fuel injection systems in road cars in the 1980s. In addition to carburetors, Rochester also made various emissions control equipment such as <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters</b> and EGR valves, which found use in GM vehicles as well as those from other makes. Other products made at this plant were locks and keys as well as steel tubing for both vehicular and non-vehicular applications. The last major carburetor design by Rochester was the Varajet II, essentially a Quadrajet halved lengthwise, and was one of the few successful progressive 2-barrel carburetors. It was installed on 4- and 6-cylinder engines from 1979 to 1986.|$|R
40|$|The USEPA, {{identified}} South Central Pennsylvania as {{a region}} having elevated radon levels. The thrust {{of this paper}} is to examine in some detail the TCS Industries Inc., TCS, data base for eight Central Pennsylvania counties having a combined population of about 1. 7 million people, which is 14 % of the state population. TCS has been making and analyzing radon measurements since 1986. During the period 1986 to 1999 more than 125 thousand measurements were recorded in the TCS data base. The data consisted of analyzed results from four subsets. Results were from mail order <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters,</b> bulk orders from RMP certified companies for their placement, wholesales to retail vendors, and also direct home placement of canisters, track detectors, and continuous radon monitors. The data base for the eight South Central Pennsylvania counties for the thirteen year period consists of more than 23, 000 screening measurements from non-duplicated addresses. The results were assembled into three interesting studies. The locations of the measurements were converted into individual latitude and longitude values. The data were divided into four blocks of concentrations from 20 picocuries per liter, pCi/I, (. 74 kBq / m 3) to over 120 pCiA (4. 44 kBq 1 mJ. The data were plotted on computer generated maps for South Central Pennsylvania...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} the radon surface flux without disturbing either the soil or the flux are of interest in geologic studies and in monitoring the radon flux from uranium mine tailings piles. Such flux measurements may also be of use in assessing the radon risk at potential building sites. The flow-through surface flux method does not perturb either the radon flux or the soil. For (his method the flux, J, is given by the simple equation JisinpCiI m 2. s; R, the radon concentration,is in pC i / I; F, the flow ratters in I / min., and A, {{the area of the}} soil being measured. is in m 2. The constant, 60, converts the flow rate from 1 / min. to 1 / sec. This method requires an inverted basin which defines the area of the soil being measured. Equilibrium radon concentrations are established inside the basin between the radon surface flux and a steady, 0. S to 1. 0 1 / min, flow of ambient air whose radon concentration is low. The radon concentration in the basin is measured using electret ion chambers. Comparasion of preliminary surface flux data from the flow-through technique and data from Large Area Activated <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Canisters</b> measurements suggest that even at very low flux rates the flow-through method can gives useful results...|$|R
40|$|Radon testing {{by using}} open-faced <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters</b> is a cheap and fast {{screening}} method. Many laboratories perform the sampling and measurements {{according to the}} United States Environmental Protection Agency method - EPA 520. According to this method, no corrections for temperature are applied and corrections for humidity are based on canister mass gain. The EPA method is practiced in the Vinča Institute of Nuclear Sciences with recycled canisters. In the course of measurements, it was established that the mass gain of the recycled canisters differs from mass gain measured by Environmental Protection Agency in an active atmosphere. In order to quantify and correct these discrepancies, in the laboratory, canisters were exposed for periods of 3 and 4 days between February 2015 and December 2015. Temperature and humidity were monitored continuously and mass gain measured. No significant correlation between mass gain and temperature was found. Based on Environmental Protection Agency calibration data, functional dependence of mass gain on humidity was determined, yielding Environmental Protection Agency mass gain curves. The results of mass gain measurements of recycled canisters were plotted against these curves and a discrepancy confirmed. After correcting the independent variable in the curve equation and calculating the corrected mass gain for recycled canisters, the agreement between measured mass gain and Environmental Protection Agency mass gain curves was attained.

40|$|Abstract — Light-weight {{concrete}} (LWC) (or drywall construction) {{has been}} used for partition walls in public housing in Hong Kong for about 10 years. A previous laboratory investigation showed that all types of LWC had considerably smaller Rn exhalation rates than those from normal concrete (NC), and could thus theoretically reduce the indoor Rn concentrations and the correspond-ing radiation dose from Rn. In the present investigation, a survey of Rn exhalation rates and indoor Rn concentrations at 39 dwelling sites built using LWC were carried out using <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters</b> and g-spectroscopy. The mean Rn exhalation rate and the mean Rn concentration were around 1. 6 mBq. s- 1. m- 2 and 19 Bq. m- 3, respectively, which were significantly smaller than the corresponding values of 12 mBq. s- 1. m- 2 and 33 Bq. m- 3 for NC sites. The statistical t-test showed that both the mean Rn exhalation rate and the mean Rn concentration for NC and LWC sites walls were different at the 100 % confidence level. The Rn exhalation rate from an LWC surface was, on average, only about 14 % of that from an NC surface, while the Rn concentration in an LWC site was, on average, about 58 % of that in an NC site, which were significant. A person living at an LWC site receives an average annual equivalent dose smaller than one living at an NC site by an amount as large as 1 mSv. Therefore, the use of LWC for partition walls can be a simple and economical way to reduce the indoor Rn concentrations and the corresponding radiation dose from Rn. Furthermore, the mean Rn concentration theoretically predicted from the mean Rn exhalation rate agreed excellently with that from measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Short term {{sampling}} methods for Rn analyses {{have been considered}} by many to be unreliable for use in real estate transactions. This opinion has been based upon the recognized tact that Rn may vary with fairly short time periods and that some of these variations may be quite large. However, many of the published data regarding variation of concentration were not taken within the complete confines of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protocol for screening tests. This paper presents an analysis of data from alpha track detectors, continuous Rn monitors, passive activated <b>charcoal</b> <b>canisters,</b> passive electret detectors, and one hour air samples collected on activated charcoal in two homes where the EPA protocols were strictly followed. These data were used to describe the mean concentration over the period of the test, the variance of the mean, the confidence intervals and the probability of shorter term samples being within an acceptable range of the mean. Field data using one hour active collections of radon on charcoalconditions. By samplimg with both short-term and long- term methods, seasonal and weather variations in indoor Rn air concentrations can be described and the accuracy of the screening methods can be compared for their predictive power. The program was made available for participation by any National AARST member and three companies from other regions have participated coninuously or when feasible. A total of eleven companies have participated so far. This report presents interim results covering the first six months of the comparative measurement program and some of the comparisons may change when a full year of data is available. However, some of the results regarding correlations with sample means will probably remain at similar magnitudes...|$|R

A total of 88 air samples were taken by the validated methods to measure concentrations of TEA and DEA emitted from gas mask canisters during simulated use in an environmental chamber. Samples were collected on a mannequin equipped with a breather pump and also on human volunteers. Very low levels of TEA and moderately low levels of DEA emissions were measured during the simulations.
