Acquiring the best technologies is quickly becoming as important as understanding and improving the business model of organizations. As a result, many (inter) national standards and models for IT Management, IT Government and IT Security have been developed. This situation allows organizations to choose and improve their processes, selecting the models that best suit their needs. Since several relationships between these models can be found, carrying out the harmonization of their similarities and differences will make it possible to reduce the time and effort involved in implementing them. In this paper, we present a <b>harmonization</b> <b>strategy</b> which has been defined to harmonize COBIT 4. 1, Basel II, VAL IT, RISK IT, ISO 27002 and ITIL V 3.

30|$|In the {{framework}} of therapy monitoring with PET, pre- and post-treatment scans should ideally involve identical scan acquisition and image processing. However, this is often impractical in busy PET centres, especially those running several scanners. This can also be challenged by a scanner upgrade during the conduct of a trial or when a patient relocates. Previous studies aimed at validating the EARL <b>harmonization</b> <b>strategy</b> in the clinical setting have shown that SUVmax is more sensitive to reconstruction inconsistency than SUVpeak or their lean body mass equivalents, SULmax and SULpeak. Consequently, one could expect a more significant impact of reconstruction inconsistencies on EORTC classification than on PERCIST.|$|R

With OSEM used as a reference, this <b>harmonization</b> <b>strategy</b> led to concordance indices greater than 0.9, with very narrow confidence intervals. This supports the use of EARL-compliant images in multicentre studies, where MATVs extracted from 18 F-FDG PET are used for tumour targeting or as a prognostic tool (for example, using the median value of pooled data as a cut-off value). EARL-compliant images {{could also be used}} in clinical routine in centres running more than one PET system, a situation that is more frequently being encountered.|$|R

First, drawing on American literature that critically assesses similar developments in American administrative law, I suggest that expanded access to courts and administrative agencies might impair the quality of administrative policymaking in the Member States.

Second, again relying on the American reaction to the “ferment” of the 1960 s and 1970 s, I argue that the direction that <b>Community</b> <b>harmonization</b> has taken might compromise the constitutional powers of national parliaments and governments over state administration, to the advantage of national courts...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} {{forces are}} involved in the international harmonization of accounting: institutional endeavours to harmonize accounting internationally by developing common accounting rules and reporting standards, and spontaneous efforts by 'global players' to adopt accounting methods that will improve communication with users in other countries. These two developments are proceeding side by side, generally reinforcing one another but occasionally moving independently. This paper is primarily concerned with the process of harmonization of financial accounting within the European Union. The hypothesis we want to test is that, in spite of the obstacles to the harmonization of regulations in the European Union, there has been greater conformity in recent years in the accounting practices of companies which operate on the international stage. If so, the implications for the <b>harmonization</b> <b>strategies</b> of the international bodies are important. In this study, we first carry out a critical analysis of previous research on accounting harmonization, summarizing the methods used in empirical studies of de facto harmonization and the results obtained. We note that the major deficiency in the index-based methods of measuring harmonization is that no test of significance has been included in prior research. In this paper, we propose a bootstrapping test of the C index as a way of measuring the significance of the change in its value. We consider a sample of eighty-five 'global players' from thirteen countries and we analyse their financial statements with regard to four accounting issues (deferred taxation, goodwill, leasing and foreign currency translation), providing estimates of the significance of de facto accounting harmonization for the periods from 1991 - 2 to 1996 - 7. ...|$|R

In addition, four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of the future (2005 - 2100) are being provided by four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams to be used as input to the ESMs for future carbon-climate projections (Moss et al. 2010). The diversity of approaches and requirements among IAMs and ESMs for tracking land-use change, along with the dependence of model projections on land-use history, presents a challenge for effectively passing data between these communities and for smoothly transitioning from the historical estimates to future projections. Here, a harmonized set of land-use scenarios are presented that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land use with future projections, in the format required by ESMs. The land-use <b>harmonization</b> <b>strategy</b> estimates fractional land-use patterns and underlying land-use transitions annually for the time period 1500 - 2100 at 0. 5 ° × 0. 5 ° resolution. Inputs include new gridded historical maps of crop and pasture data from HYDE 3. 1 for 1500 - 2005, updated estimates of historical national wood harvest and of shifting cultivation, and future information on crop, pasture, and wood harvest from the IAM implementations of the RCPs for the period 2005 - 2100.

Next, it presents a brief history of modern luxury clothing and then provides a summary of the current malleable state of the fashion industry, the changing branding strategies and retail habits in the luxury goods market, and what holes the U.

This architecture generally performs well for languages with similar structure.

I address this problem through text harmonization, by making texts more similar before training and applying a PBSMT system. I investigate how text harmonization can be used to improve PBSMT with a focus on four areas: compounding, definiteness, word order, and unknown words. For the first three areas, the focus is on linguistic differences between languages, which I address by applying transformation rules, using either rule-based or machine learning-based techniques, to the source or target data. For the last area, unknown words, I harmonize the translation input to the training data by replacing unknown words with known alternatives. I show that translation into languages with closed compounds can be improved by splitting and merging compounds. I develop new merging algorithms that outperform previously suggested algorithms and show how part-of-speech tags can be used to improve the order of compound parts. Scandinavian definite noun phrases are identified as a problem forPBSMT in translation into Scandinavian languages and I propose a preprocessing approach that addresses this problem and gives large improvements over a baseline. Several previous proposals for how to handle differences in reordering exist; I propose two types of extensions, iterating reordering and word alignment and using automatically induced word classes, which allow these methods to be used for less-resourced languages. Finally I identify several ways of replacing unknown words in the translation input, most notably a spell checking-inspired algorithm, which can be trained using character-based PBSMT techniques. Overall I present several approaches for extending PBSMT by the use of pre- and postprocessing techniques for text harmonization, and show experimentally that these methods work. Text harmonization methods are an efficient way to improve {{statistical machine translation}} within the phrase-based approach, without resorting to more complex models...|$|R
