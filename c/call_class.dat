An approximation of these service levels is developed that allows an arbitrary overflow mechanism and customer abandonment. A two-stage heuristic that finds good solutions to mathematical programs with such constraints is developed. The first stage uses search methods supported by the approximation. Because service level approximation errors may be substantial, the solution is adjusted in a second stage in which performance is estimated by simulation. Realistic problems of varying size and routing policy are solved. The proposed approach is shown to be competitive with (and often better than) previously available methods...|$|E

40|$|Optimizing compilers for {{object-oriented}} languages apply static class {{analysis and}} other techniques {{to try to}} deduce precise information about the possible classes of the receivers of messages; if successful, dynamicallydispatched messages can be replaced with direct procedure calls and potentially further optimized through inline-expansion. By examining the complete inheritance graph of a program, which we <b>call</b> <b>class</b> hierarchy analysis, the compiler can {{improve the quality of}} static class information and thereby improve run-time performance. In this paper we present class hierarchy analysis and describe techniques for implementing this analysis effectively in both statically- and dynamically-typed languages and also in the presence of multi-methods. We also discuss how class hierarchy analysis can be supported in an interactive programming environment and, to some extent, in the presence of separate compilation. Finally, we assess the bottom-line performance improvement due to class hierarchy analysis alone and in combination with two other “competing ” optimizations, profileguided receiver class prediction and method specialization. ...|$|E
40|$|Connections between {{relations}} in relation extraction, which we <b>call</b> <b>class</b> ties, are common. In distantly supervised scenario, one entity tuple may have multiple relation facts. Exploiting class ties between relations of one entity tuple will be promising for distantly supervised relation extraction. However, previous models are not effective or ignore to model this property. In this work, to effectively leverage class ties, we propose to make joint relation extraction with a unified model that integrates {{convolutional neural network}} (CNN) with a general pairwise ranking framework, in which three novel ranking loss functions are introduced. Additionally, an effective method is presented to relieve the severe class imbalance problem from NR (not relation) for model training. Experiments on a widely used dataset show that leveraging class ties will enhance extraction and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to learn class ties. Our model outperforms the baselines significantly, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Comment: To appear in ACL 201...|$|E

First, we use the following simple idea to bound the performance of any coordinate-convex admission policy on a single link: the blocking probability of any <b>call</b> <b>class</b> is lower bounded by considering just this class in isolation and replacing the available bandwidth (a random quantity) by its mean. Then, following [15, 4], we use this single-link bound to obtain linear programs which give bounds {{in the case of}} sparsely connected networks with multiple bandwidth classes.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Liu et al. [281] propose a {{self-learning}} call admission control mechanism for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular networks that have both voice and data services. Their admission control mechanism is built atop a novel learning control architecture (e.g., adaptive critic design) that {{has only one}} controller module, namely, a critic network. The critic network is trained with an 3 : 6 : 1 MLP-NN that uses inputs such as network environment (e.g. total interference received at the base station), user behavior (e.g. call type—new or hand off call), <b>call</b> <b>class</b> (e.g. voice, data), and the action to accept or reject calls. The output is the Grade of Service (GoS) measure. The MLP-NN is retrained to adapt {{to changes in the}} admission control requirements, user behaviors and usage patterns, and the underlying network itself. Through simulation of cellular networks with two classes of services, the authors demonstrate that their admission control mechanism outperforms non-adaptive admission control mechanisms, with respect to GoS, in CDMA cellular networks.|$|E
40|$|Noise {{in class}} labels of any {{training}} set {{can lead to}} poor classification results no matter what machine learning method is used. In this paper, we first present the problem of binary classification {{in the presence of}} random noise on the class labels, which we <b>call</b> <b>class</b> noise. To model class noise, a class noise rate is normally defined as a small independent probability of the class labels being inverted on the whole set of training data. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate class noise rate at the level of individual samples in real data. Based on the estimation result, we propose two approaches to handle class noise. The first technique is based on modifying a given surrogate loss function. The second technique eliminates class noise by sampling. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal hypothesis on the noisy distribution can approximate the optimal hypothesis on the clean distribution using both approaches. Our methods achieve over 87 % accuracy on a synthetic non-separable dataset even when 40 % of the labels are inverted. Comparisons to other algorithms show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmark datasets in different domains with different noise rates.

40|$|In odontocetes, {{synchronous}} visible displays accompany a {{small proportion}} of vocalizations but the function of these multimodal signals is still unclear.   Bouts of stereotyped pulsed calls were collected from two adult female killer whales (Orcinus orca) concurrently with behavioral observations and the incidence of two synchronous behaviors, bubble streams and nodding, were measured.  Thirty-four hours of focal individual data were collected in the presence of dependent calves in 1993 and 1994.   Overall, 471 pulsed calls were attributed to the two subjects using synchronous behaviors or independent cues (proximity, localization by ear in air).  Both subjects used the same stereotyped pulsed call repertoire and they ordered calls within bouts similarly, despite dissimilar previous histories.  Both nodding and bubble streams were disproportionately associated with a subset of stereotyped pulsed calls, but the subset was different for the two behaviors.  General Linear Model analysis was used to predict the relative odds that the subjects would be swimming with calves given <b>call</b> <b>class</b> and attribution cue.   Bubbling was not associated with significant odds that a subject would be swimming with one or more calves, but nodding was associated with significantly higher odds and resting calls with lower odds.   Given these observations, synchronous behaviors in the presence of calves could function in {{one or more of the}} following ways: altering the signal value of calls, emphasizing an aspect of the social context, and facilitating learning.  All are possibilities at the interface between cognition and communication that would have interested Stan Kuczaj...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a report}} on the investigation of the vocal behavior of free-living Grey Parrots (Psittacus erithacus) that inhabit the Congo Basin in Central Africa. I observed Grey Parrots in the Central African Republic and Cameroon and made audio recordings of their vocalizations. The results of spectrographic analysis of vocalizations lend support to the assertion that Grey Parrots produce calls that fall into four major acoustical classes [...] tonal, harmonic, noisy-harmonic, and noisy [...] and that these call classes may be subdivided into as many as 39 different acoustical types. A reliability study of this classification scheme demonstrated that both clustering of these acoustical types into aggregate categories and the combined method of visual inspection and basic spectrographic measurement enable reliable classification of calls into classes, types and also subtypes. The majority of calls in the observed repertoire belong to pure tonal <b>call</b> <b>class,</b> which may suggest that a large proportion of Grey Parrot calling behavior is adapted for tonal call production. Grey Parrots may also adjust the acoustic characteristics of their calls to better adapt them to their environment and communication needs. Both observations of Grey Parrots and analysis of the acoustic and production characteristics of their calls indicate that Grey Parrots may share functional call types of some New World and Australian parrot species. Some Grey Parrot calling vocal behavior parallels that of captive Grey Parrots in the laboratory. I conclude with an exploration of possible reasons why Grey Parrots possess such a diverse vocal repertoire...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the semantics of a specific set of intensional verbs, those that are used to report a subject's standpoint on a given possibility. Among these verbs are permit, promise, offer, guarantee, demand, insist on, recommend, suggest, encourage, and a handful of others. When the objects of these verbs are disjunctive, we find the kind of free choice effects previously observed with possibility and necessity modals. Based on whether the verbs pattern like may or like must with respect to these inferences, we separate the verbs into two classes, which we <b>call</b> <b>Class</b> I (may -like), and Class II (must -like). This behavior suggests that at the level of interpretation, these verbs contain quantifiers over possible worlds—an existential one in the case of Class I, and a universal one for the members of Class II. However, motivated by an unexpected range of readings found when sentences built with these verbs are negated, an investigation reveals that the members of Class I and II are more than just modal. They also appear to be accomplishment verbs that describe external events. As a result, we give a semantic analysis of these verbs that casts them as complex creatures, describing external events in which subjects indicate their modal opinions. Taking the verbs to be reporters of external events, we then need to explain why some of the negative sentences built with the Class I/II verbs appear to describe internal cognitive states. The solution to this involves two elements: first, we appeal to a version of the habitual operator that can deliver dispositions that are not necessarily established by repetitive action. Second, after noticing that all habitual sentences have extra, unexpectedly strong readings with negation, we enlarge the scope of the phenomenon previously called Neg-raising, and show how an existing pragmatic account for this (that of Romoli (2013)) can be modified to deal with the broader array of extra strong negative readings. Along the way, we will account for why dispositions described by habitual Class I/II predicates seem to have different establishment requirements than those described by similar accomplishment verbs. We also address how the performativity of these verbs follows from the semantics proposed...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of morphological, ecological, genetic and vocal differences, North America Red Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) have been {{described}} as a cryptic sibling species complex consisting of at least 10 forms. These forms are most easily differentiated via spectrographic analysis of their vocalizations and are hence known as "vocal types. " However, little quantitative work has been done on forms' repertoires. For example, it is unclear if vocalizations, such as those named "excitement calls" or "chitter" by others, vary acoustically depending on the social context in which they are used or the physical state of the caller; it is also not known if such calls have characteristics that are systematically informative. Further, {{little is known about the}} vocal behaviour of Red Crossbills on the island of Newfoundland, an island which is generally presumed to contain the endangered Red Crossbill subspecies, L. c. percna. I made field recordings 1000 minutes) of Red Crossbills at 10 sites on the island in order to describe and document structural and contextual variation in vocalizations and to determine categories of calls (Call Classes) that might contain systematic information useful for subsequent comparative analyses. Subjectively classified calls, made on {{the basis of}} the social, behavioural, and physical contexts of calling birds, audible qualities of calls, and general appearance of spectrograms, corresponded closely to those of crossbills (Loxia spp.) described elsewhere in North America and Europe. Ln total, adults uttered five Call Classes (I- HI, V and VI); juveniles uttered two (IV and V). Both adult males and juveniles of unknown sex also sang. Multivariate clustering of calls, based on the individual averages of 10 acoustic variables measured from 1186 calls, corresponded with the subjectively established Call Classes. Acoustic variability within individuals and across contexts was relatively low among Call Classes I and III. <b>Call</b> <b>Class</b> Il was the most individualistic. A discriminant analysis (DA) on acoustic variables of Class I calls from Newfoundland individuals (n = 83) and individuals of vocal types from elsewhere in North America and Europe (n = 31) classified 89 % of birds to the correct vocal type; 98 % of birds from Newfoundland were differentiated successfully by DA. Further, many birds from Newfoundland also emitted Class III calls and song motifs that were distinct. Visual examination of Class I spectrograms, including those individuals misclassified by DA, confirmed that seven individuals from Newfoundland were spectrographically and audibly more similar to vocal types 2 and 10, which have been described previously on mainland North America. Thus, the results of this study show that multiple Red Crossbill forms, including possibly L. c. percna, are present on the island of Newfoundland...|$|E
