5000|$|On 14 January 2010, Coren {{attracted}} criticism {{after he}} posted on his Twitter feed: [...] "Next door have bought their 12-year-old son a drum kit. For fuck's sake! Do I kill him then burn it? Or do I fuck him, then kill him then burn it?" [...] Vivienne Pattison, director of watchdog Mediawatch UK, condemned the remark as [...] "very bad taste". Coren later posted: [...] "Oh hell's bells. Look, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> I didn't kill the kid, or {{have sex with}} him. And anyway he's not real. And I live in Vienna." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> where I'm {{worried about}} this leading. Next year we go into an {{election}} year. Every politician {{is going to find}} himself or herself subjected to the same sort of outrageous commentary that hit me, and hits others. I'm afraid we're going to get regulated media as a result of that. And I tell you, I think if you can't fix it, both fix the history as well as the biography pages, I think it's going to be in real trouble, and we're {{going to have to be}} fighting to keep the government from regulating you.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to have a {{headache}} myself," [...] said Lottie, with injury. [...] "But <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get on along without. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> simply <b>say</b> I'm not going. If he proposes to stay, too, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> soon settle that." ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 18, 2013, Yu Zheng was {{physically}} beaten by a man, later identified as actor Shen Tai (...) , {{in a coffee}} shop. Shen served 3 days in detention but refused to apologize. Yu claimed he was beaten because he refused Shen's demands of a role in his drama. Shen called it a lie, and wrote the following on his Sina Weibo microblog: [...] "Everybody has a bottom line. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> that knowing such a person {{can only be described}} as disgusting. If he does stupid things again I will slap him just the same." ...|$|R
60|$|That, I think, I {{must tell}} you another time. For when I speak of it I shall {{have to tell you}} more about Madam How, and her ways of making the ground on which you stand, than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>just</b> now. But {{if you want to know}} (as I dare say you do) what the {{eruption}} of a volcano is like, you may read what follows. I did not see it happen; for I never had the good fortune of seeing a mountain burning, though I have seen many and many a one which has been burnt--extinct volcanos, as they are called.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God! thank God!" [...] ejaculated Cap; [...] "the {{sound of}} your sweet voice, Magnet, lightens my {{heart of a}} heavy load, for I feared you had shared the fate of poor Jennie. My breast has felt the last four-and-twenty hours as if a ton of {{kentledge}} had been stowed in it. You ask me what you ought to do, child, and I {{do not know how}} to advise you, though you are my own sister's daughter! The most <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>just</b> now, my poor girl, is most heartily to curse the day you or I ever saw this bit of fresh water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{could prevent}} it somehow or other. We {{could get up}} a tale {{that he was an}} English sailor we had picked up at sea, and hand him over to the authorities, and tell them his story was, that he had fallen {{overboard}} from an English ship of war. Then they would send him away to some place in the interior where they keep English prisoners of war, and there he might lie for years; perhaps never get back again. He does not know a word of French, as you saw when you spoke to him, so he can't contradict any story we may tell, and if by chance any questions should be asked, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> what suits us." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2005, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Mike Myers discussed the possibility of studio sources moving forward with a fourth film. [...] "There is hope!". [...] "We're all circling and talking to each other. I miss doing the characters." [...] In May 2007, in {{an interview}} with IGN, [...] "So no more Austin Powers?" [...] was asked, and Myers replied, [...] "No, no, there is a fully conceived idea for a fourth and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> that it's from Dr. Evil's point of view. So if you balanced how much of it was Austin with Dr. Evil, it's more about Dr. Evil than Austin". Also, in the audio commentary from the DVD release of Austin Powers in Goldmember, Myers revealed that in the fourth film, Fat Bastard would return and regain the weight that he lost in Goldmember.|$|R
5000|$|Director Béla Tarr {{says that}} the film is about the [...] "heaviness of human existence". The focus is not on mortality, but rather the daily life: [...] "We {{just wanted to see}} how {{difficult}} and terrible it is when every day {{you have to go to}} the well and bring the water, in summer, in winter... All the time. The daily repetition of the same routine makes it possible to show that something is wrong with their world. It's very simple and pure." [...] Tarr has also described The Turin Horse as the last step in a development throughout his career: [...] "In my first film I started from my social sensibility and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wanted to change the world. Then I had to understand that problems are more complicated. Now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> it’s quite heavy and I don’t know what is coming, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see something that is very close - the end." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sia {{said the}} album [...] "Some People Have Real Problems" [...] {{was an easy}} album to write, except for, [...] "The Girl You Lost" [...] which took longer to pen than the other tracks. She explained: [...] "It's like a bath. It's a big bath. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sit down with my friends and play three chords or {{whatever}} or we'll hunt around and find the right three chords. Then they'll {{tell me what the}} song's about. Usually a sentence or a feeling will come or <b>I</b> <b>can</b> even <b>just</b> <b>say</b> to the person I'm with to tell me what it's about and give me a theme. Then eight minutes later, there it is. 'Academia' took eight minutes. 'Little Black Sandals' was five minutes. Then there are other songs that might take longer. 'The Girl You Lost to Cocaine' took a bit longer, but I don't remember why. I think I listened to it too much. It's different every time, but usually if it's a good one, it's like a bath." ...|$|R
40|$|God, I {{thank you}} for giving me the ability and {{determination}} to become a scientist. You could have taken me so many times, and for that I’m convinced I’m here for a real reason. Robin, I can’t thank you enough for helping to turn my mind to the Most High. To my family, I love you ALL!! Mom and Grama, without you I would be nowhere. Dad, I’m glad I decided to forgive you…I love you. Chris and Kelly, what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>just</b> keep doing your thing, you will find your treasures in due time. Amber, I’m just glad we met. We went through so much together, it’s amazing we’re still close. I will always be here for you…anything you need I will do my best to provide. Because of you I know what unconditional love is. As for everyone at IBB: Suzy, thanks for taking a chance on me. It’s been hard at times, but I’m a better person for going through graduate school. To my committee, thanks for having faith in me. You all could have kicked me out after that first candidacy exam, but you saw some potential in me. I don’t think I’ve fully realized the potential and when I do it’s going to be a sight to behold. Vicki, you were a grea...|$|R

6000|$|Thus much <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>just</b> now--and {{there is}} much more to be said--on the {{practical}} uses of the study of Natural History. But let me remind you, on the other side, if Natural History will help you, you in return can help her; and would, I doubt not, help her and help scientific men at home, if once you looked fairly and steadily at the immense importance of Natural History--of the knowledge of the [...] "face of the earth." [...] I believe that all will one day feel, more or less, that to know the earth ON which we live, and the laws of it BY which we live, is a sacred duty to ourselves, to our children after us, and to all whom we may have to command and to influence; ay, and a duty to God likewise. For is it not a duty of common reverence and faith towards Him, if He has put us into a beautiful and wonderful place, and given us faculties by which we can see, and enjoy, and use that place--is it not a duty of reverence and faith towards Him to use these faculties, and to learn the lessons which He has laid open for us? If you feel that, as I think you all will some day feel, then you will surely feel likewise {{that it will be a}} good deed--I do not say a necessary duty, but still a good deed and praiseworthy--to help physical science forward; and to add your contributions, however small, to our general knowledge of the earth. And how much may be done for science by British officers, especially on foreign stations, I need not point out. I know that much has been done, chivalrously and well, by officers; and that men of science owe them and give them hearty thanks for their labours. But I should like, I confess, to see more done still. I should like to see every foreign station what one or two highly-educated officers might easily make it, an advanced post of physical science, in regular communication with our scientific societies at home, sending to them accurate and methodic details of the natural history of each district--details ninety-nine hundredths of which might seem worthless in the eyes of the public, but which would all be precious in the eyes of scientific men, who know that no fact is really unimportant; and more, that while plodding patiently through seemingly unimportant facts, you may stumble on one of infinite importance, both scientific and practical. For the student of nature, gentlemen, if he will be but patient, diligent, methodical, is liable at any moment to the same good fortune as befell Saul of old, when he went out to seek his father's asses, and found a kingdom.|$|R
