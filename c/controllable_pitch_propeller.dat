40|$|Control {{systems for}} {{underwater}} vehicles {{have reached the}} level of sophistication where they are limited by the dynamic performance of the thrust actuators. Standard fixed-pitch propellers {{have been shown to}} have very poor dynamic characteristics, particularly at low thrust levels The dynamic response of a fixed-pitch propeller is dependent upon highly non-linear transients encountered while the shaft speed approaches its steady-state value. This thesis proposes the use of a <b>controllable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> system to address this problem. A <b>controllable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> varies the amount of thrust produced by varying the pitch angle of the blades at a constant shaft speed. The bandwidth of this type of thrust actuator would be dependent primarily on the speed at which the pitch angle of the blades are changed. A variable pitch propeller system suitable for retrofit into an ROV is designed and built. The system is designed for maximal pitch angle bandwidth with low actuator power consumption.
