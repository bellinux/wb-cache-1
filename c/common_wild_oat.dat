40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} distribution of <b>common</b> <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena fatua L.) on cultivated fields in the Olsztyn and Suwałki Districts. Data are presented on the occurrence of this species in 1908 - 1909, based on works of a German scientist Z a d e (1912), and the present author's own data for two periods: 1966 - 1975 and 1976 - 1982. Analysis of the data points to the invasive character of Auena fatua in north-eastern Poland in the period 1976 - 1982. At present, the distribution of <b>common</b> <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> {{is very similar to}} that {{at the beginning of the}} 20 century (1908 - 1909). In the area under study <b>common</b> <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena fatua L.) seems to be most dangerous for spring cereals cultivated upon soils of good wheat complex.

40|$|The {{inherent}} genetic {{similarity between}} oat (Avena sativa L.) and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena fatua L.) precludes selective herbicide use to control <b>wild</b> <b>oat.</b> Consequently, large reductions in oat yield and quality due to <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> consistently constrain oat production in western Canada. Traditionally, delayed seeding followed by tillage prior to planting {{was used to}} control <b>wild</b> <b>oat,</b> but new {{studies have shown that}} this practice also results in substantial reductions to oat yield and quality. Thus, new methods are needed to ameliorate the adverse effects of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition on oat. Planting more competitive varieties with earlier emergence and larger seeds may minimize losses associated with <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition. Therefore, the objectives of this research were i) to determine the influence of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> emerging at different times and varying densities on oat yield and quality and ii) to determine the relative importance of seed size and genotype in affecting <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> – oat competition. High densities of early emerging <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> greatly reduced oat yield and increased <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> contamination. Observed oat yield losses were as great as 70 % and resulted in a 15 % <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> contamination level. <b>Wild</b> <b>oat</b> that emerged before oat also had higher biomass and reproductive output than <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> that emerged after oat. Furthermore, early emerging <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> reduced percentage plump oat kernels and increased percentage thin kernels. Oat plants established from large caryopses produced 18 % more biomass and 15 % more panicles m- 2 than plants established from small caryopses. In addition, <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> produced 31 % less biomass and fewer panicles m- 2 when grown with oat plants established from large caryopses. CDC Boyer appeared to be the most competitive of the varieties examined, having significantly higher biomass and panicle production both in the presence and absence of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition. Conclusions that emerge from this research are i) emergence time is critical to <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> – oat competition, ii) it is essential for oat producers to control early emerging <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> and ensure crop emergence precedes <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> emergence, iii) planting large seed of competitive cultivars may improve the competitive response of <b>oat</b> to <b>wild</b> <b>oat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{studies on}} <b>common</b> <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena fatua L.) in {{north-eastern}} Poland {{were based on}} 120 herbarian sheets and 2000 panicles collected for statistical studies. The majority of the material (70 %) differed in respect to morphological features from the basic features accepted as species-specific in common keys of plants used in Poland (S z a f e r, 1919; S z a f e r et al., 1969). The differences referred mainly {{to the number of}} flowers in the spiklets, hairs of lower lemma and its callus, both as regards length of hairs and their distribution and colour. Basing on the results of foreign authors (M a l z e w, 1930; R o s h e w i t z, 1934; H e g i, 1965; S a v u l e s c u, 1972; T z v e l e v, 1974, 1976; K e m m e r et al., 1976) four basic varieties of Avena fatua L. were distinguished in the material: 1. var. fatua (= var. pilosissima S. F. Gray), 2. var. intermedia (Lestib.) Lej. et Court., 3. var. glabrata Peterm., 4. var. vilis (Wallr.) Hauskn. Statistical studies embraced 20 stations (fields with area of about 1 ha). 100 panicles of A. fatua were randomly collected from each station. All four varieties were found at 14 stations, three varieties only were found at 4 stations, while at two stations only two varieties grew. None of the populations under study was one-variety only. Totally the material (stations 1 - 20) contained 29, 6 % of A. fatua var. fatua (= pilosissima), 28, 4 % of A. fatua var. intermedia, 22, 4 % of A. fatua var. glabrata and 19, 6 % of A. fatua var. vilis. The studies took into account only specimens classified as A. fatua L., disregarding hybrids and fatuoids.

In all experiments treatments consisted of five doses of pinoxaden and two doses {{of each of the}} three commercial formulations of clodinafop propargyl (Topik, Behpik & Karent), with and without the adjuvants Adigor, Citogate, Citohef and Volk. Performance of all herbicides increased with enhancing their concentrations against the tested plants except for clodinafop propargyl in case of wild oat. The addition of Volk (followed by Adigor) had the highest effect on pinoxaden efficacy against ryegrass and littleseed canarygrass, supporting the idea that either Volk or Adigor solubilizes the cuticular waxes thus facilitating their uptake. Adding Volk and Adigor had the highest and lowest influence on pinoxaden performance against wild oat, respectively. Totally, the adjuvant receptivity for pinoxaden was higher than for clodinafop propargyl. Between the two surfactants, Citogate was more effective than Citohef in enhancing the efficacy of pinoxaden against ryegrass and littleseed canarygrass, while, Citohef was more effective in increasing the efficacy of pinoxaden against wild oat...|$|E
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} investigate the effects of full, above and below ground interactions of wheat with <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> on leaf characteristics and root to shoot ratio.

The treatments included four interference levels (above ground, below ground, above and below ground and check wheat and <b>wild</b> <b>oat)</b> and four <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> densities (2, 4, 6 and 8 plants/pot). The effects of full and root interference on wheat and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> traits was greater than shoot interference. For both species, full and below ground interaction significantly decreased the number of leaves, flag leaf area and chlorophyll content of flag leaf compared to above ground interaction and control. All traits of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> were reduced by above ground interaction compared to control. Number of leaves of wheat and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> showed greatest susceptibility to interaction treatments. There was no significant different between full and root interference. When <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> density increased, the number of leaves, flag leaf area and chlorophyll content of flag leaf of wheat decreased. With strongest competition followed by enhanced <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> density, root to shoot ratio in wheat and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> increased, which indicates more susceptibility of shoot than root to interference mean competition.

40|$|The {{inability}} to control <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena fatua L.) in oat (Avena sativa L.) crops {{by chemical means}} limits growers {{to the use of}} cultural control methods. Delayed seeding is the most commonly used measure; however, both crop yield and quality may suffer as a result. The objectives of this research were to i) determine if western Canadian oat genotypes differ in competitive ability, ii) determine the effect of increased plant populations on <b>oat</b> – <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition, iii) determine the effect of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition on oat quality, and iv) establish whether or not oat genotype and seed size affect germination characteristics under low temperature and moisture stress. These objectives were tested using field and laboratory experiments. Morphologically diverse oat genotypes differed in their ability to both tolerate <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition and interfere with <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> growth. Although low yielding under weed-free conditions, when subject to <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition CDC Bell was able to maintain yield, reduce <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> seed production and was the most competitive of the genotypes examined. Increased plant populations achieved through higher seeding rates provide an effective means by which to enhance the competitive ability of oat genotypes resulting in reduced yield loss and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> seed production. With the exception of the percentage of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> seed in harvested <b>oat</b> samples, <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition had minimal effect on oat quality.
