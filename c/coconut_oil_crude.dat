The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze demand elasticity of Indonesian palm oil in international market and it competition with other producers. This study used secondary data, i. e annual data of Indonesian <b>coconut</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> exports and other exporting countries in international market from 1984 to 2015.

Methods We investigated the effect of virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> post-natally and until 60 weeks old in mice (age of maturity). Females were fed with either standard, virgin olive <b>oil</b> or virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> diets 10 month prior to copulation, during gestation and continued until weaning of pups. Subsequently, groups of pups borne of the respective diets were continuously fed the same diet as its mother from weaning until 60 weeks old. Profiles of the standard and <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> diets were analysed by gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GCFID). Results Analysis of {{the mean of the}} total weight gained/ loss over 60 weeks revealed that in the first 30 weeks, pups whose mothers were fed virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> and virgin olive oil have a significantly lower body weight than that of standard diet pups.

The study of virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> production through centrifugation method is hoped to provide a better understanding of factor affect the yield of virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> and present of active compounds in this virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil.</b> Production of virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> was carried out successfully using the centrifugation method. An intact, the yield of virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> was higher with the increasing of centrifugation speed with a yield of 13. 53 % of 12000 rpm, whereas at 120 minutes it gave a yield of 13. 53 % and the yield of virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> at 40 °C gave a value of 13. 80 %. The moisture contents were in the range between 0. 88 % and 1. 03 %. The virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> was then subjected for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in order to determine the active compounds. HPLC was done successfully using reverse-phase HPLC and by using lauric acid standard with the injector temperature at 35 °C. 5 µL of the sample was injected into the HPLC system and the mobile phase used was 100 : 0, acetonitrile:methanol with the flow rate of 3. 5 mL/min. The highest peak was observed on the chromatogram and compared with the peak on the satndard lauric acid chromatogram. Virgin <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> production through centrifugation method and determination of active compounds by high performance liquid chromatography was managed to be performed...|$|R

In this study, the oil was modified into a value-added product using direct modification of substrate through fermentation (DIMOSFER) method. A coconut-based and coconut-oil-added solid-state cultivation using aMalaysian lipolyticGeotrichum candidumwas used to convert the <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> into MCFAs-rich oil. Chemical characteristics of the modified <b>coconut</b> <b>oils</b> (MCOs) considering total medium chain glyceride esters were compared to those of the normal <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> using ELSD-RP-HPLC. Optimum amount of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> hydrolysis was achieved at 29 %moisture content and 10. 14 % oil content after 9 days of incubation, where the quantitative amounts of the modified <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> and MCFA were 0. 330 mL/g of solid media (76. 5 % bioconversion) and 0. 175 mL/g of solid media (53 % of the MCO), respectively. MCOs demonstrated improved antibacterial activity mostly due to the presence of free lauric acid.

40|$|<b>Coconut</b> <b>oil</b> is oil which {{produced}} from the extraction process of coconut or copra. Generally, after {{being carried out}} by extraction and heating process, to get <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> wich ready to consume, it need to be process to the next purification process, such: sedimentation, degumming, neutralization, discolourization, and deodorization, wich this process can reduce the nutrient of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil.</b> At this time, many kind of processing technique to process <b>coconut</b> into <b>oil</b> was developed. For example: acidification manner, stratified heating, fermentation process, the inducement technique, and enzymatic. Using papain enzyme wich recivied from papaya leaves latex, it hoped that can improved the physical and chemistry characteristic of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> that producced. The aim {{of this research was}} to know the influence of increasing concentration of papaya leaves and fermentation on the the quality of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil,</b> knowing existence interaction between increasing concentration of papaya leaves and fermentation time in <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> processing.

50|$|<b>Coconut</b> <b>oil</b> is an {{important}} base ingredient for the manufacture of soap. Soap made with <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> tends to be hard, though it retains more water than soap made with other oils and therefore increases manufacturer yields. It is more soluble in hard water and salt water than other soaps allowing it to lather more easily. A basic <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> soap is clear when melted and a bright white when hardened.|$|R

This work considers the use of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> {{for the production of}} alternative renewable and environmental friendly biodiesel fuel as an alternative to conventional diesel fuel. Test quantities of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> biodiesel were produced through transesterification reaction using 100 g <b>coconut</b> <b>oil,</b> 20. 0 % ethanol (wt % <b>coconut</b> <b>oil),</b> 0. 8 % potassium hydroxide catalyst at 65 °C reaction temperature and 120 min. reaction time. The experiment was carried out three times and average results evaluated. Low yield of the biodiesel (10. 4 %) was obtained. The <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> biodiesel produced was subsequently blended with petroleum diesel and characterized as alternative diesel fuel through some ASTM standard fuel tests. The products were further evaluated by comparing specific gravity and viscosity of the biodiesel blend, the raw <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> and conventional petroleum diesel...|$|R
