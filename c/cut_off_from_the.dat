Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945.

5|$|On January 14 {{the weather}} {{improved}} {{enough to allow}} air support again and the Soviet advance resumed, albeit at a slow pace.

5|$|The bobcat is {{believed}} to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E
