5|$|The episode {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping to save at least two lives. During the scene in which Homer <b>chokes</b> on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is {{on the wall behind}} him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Padmé about Anakin's {{turn to the}} dark side, Obi-Wan stows aboard her ship. Padmé travels to Mustafar and implores Vader to leave the dark side. He refuses, and upon witnessing Obi-Wan, <b>chokes</b> Padmé into unconsciousness {{in a fit of}} rage. Obi-Wan duels and defeats Vader, severing most of his limbs and leaving him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda flees with Bail Organa while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.|$|E
5000|$|D'arce <b>choke</b> [...] - [...] the D'Arce <b>choke,</b> {{also known}} as the Brabo <b>choke,</b> is similar to the {{anaconda}} <b>choke,</b> the main divergence being the <b>choking</b> arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent's neck, and on top of the far arm.|$|R
50|$|A <b>choke</b> {{connection}} is formed by mating one <b>choke</b> flange and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} <b>choke</b> flange face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep <b>choke</b> trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the flange. <b>Choke</b> flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a gasket groove encircling the <b>choke</b> ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes <b>choke</b> flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a <b>choke</b> flange.|$|R
5000|$|The D'Arce <b>choke,</b> or Brabo <b>choke,</b> {{is similar}} to the Anaconda <b>choke.</b> The {{difference}} is that the <b>choking</b> arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent's neck, and on top of the far arm. The <b>choke</b> gets its name from Joe D'Arce, a third-degree Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Renzo Gracie. Though not the inventor of the <b>choke,</b> D'Arce performed this <b>choke</b> often and with great success in many Jiu-Jitsu and submission grappling tournaments. During a sparring session with Jason Miller, the <b>choke</b> surprised Miller, who gave it the name and pronunciation [...] "Darce" [...] rather than the proper [...] "D-Arsee," [...] when D'Arce did not have a title for the technique.|$|R
5|$|At {{a remote}} {{industrial}} site, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Jeremiah Smith (Roy Thinnes) are approached by the Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson). Mulder and Smith flee with both Scully and the Bounty Hunter in pursuit, eventually reaching a waterfront. Mulder sneaks {{up on the}} Bounty Hunter and stabs him in the neck with the alien stiletto. Both he and Jeremiah escape on a boat, leaving Scully alone with the seemingly dead Bounty Hunter. When she approaches the body, the Bounty Hunter wakes up and <b>chokes</b> her, demanding to know where Mulder and Smith are heading. He releases her after realizing she has no such knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then <b>chokes</b> him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>chokes.</b> In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E

40|$|<b>CHOKe,</b> xCHOKe and RECHOKe are {{preferential}} dropping {{schemes that}} have been proposed for detection, control and punishment of malicious flows at routers in IP networks. They use <b>CHOKe</b> hits, <b>CHOKe</b> misses and/or CHOKe-RED drops to carry out these tasks. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of malicious flow detection by using these hits, misses and drops (using ns- 2). We also point out the unreliability of <b>CHOKe</b> hits and misses, when compared to CHOKe-RED drops, as they affect TCP-friendly flows adversely. By doing so, we present two variations of <b>CHOKe</b> called Half 1 and Half 2 to improve <b>CHOKe</b> and compare them with <b>CHOKe.</b> Half 1 and Half 2 outperform <b>CHOKe</b> when the combined rates of malicious flows are less or greater than the link capacity respectively...|$|R
5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with <b>chokes</b> and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she <b>chokes</b> Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E
5|$|Ripley deciphers {{part of the}} transmission, {{determining}} it's not a distress signal, but {{a warning}} of some kind. In the spacecraft, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When he touches one, it opens and a creature springs out and attaches to his face through the facemask of his spacesuit. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash ignores Ripley and lets them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It later detaches on its own and is found dead. The ship is partly repaired, and the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he <b>chokes</b> and convulses in pain then dies as a small alien creature bursts from his chest and escapes into the ship. The crew attempts to locate it with a tracking device and capture or kill it with nets, electric prods and flamethrowers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Choking</b> is a preventable, but {{common cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the pediatric population, with children younger than 3 years at greatest risk. A number of factors place children at higher risk for <b>choking,</b> including narrower airways, immature dentition, underdeveloped chewing and swallowing ability, and high levels of activity and distractibility. Candy, meat, and bone are responsible {{for more than half of}} nonfatal food-related <b>choking,</b> while the hot dog is the most common food associated with <b>choking</b> fatalities. Coins, button batteries, small toys, and toy parts are the leading causes of nonfatal <b>choking</b> not due to food, while latex balloons are the leading cause of nonfood-related <b>choking</b> fatalities. Pediatric <b>choking</b> is an important public health concern that needs to be addressed during well-child visits and through increased public education. Parents and child caregivers should receive training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and <b>choking</b> rescue maneuvers. Increased efforts are also needed in the areas of public policy, <b>choking</b> surveillance, and food design and labeling...|$|R

50|$|The {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT is <b>choked</b> {{using two}} small <b>choking</b> pulleys. Here one <b>choking</b> pulley is positioned on the tense {{side of the}} chain of the iCVT. Hence there is a considerable load on that <b>choking</b> pulley, the magnitude of which {{is proportional to the}} tension in its chain. Each <b>choking</b> pulley is pulled up by two chain segments, one chain segment to the left and one {{to the right of the}} <b>choking</b> pulley; here if the two chain segments are parallel to each other, then the load on the <b>choking</b> pulley is twice the tension in the chain. But since the two chain segments are most likely not parallel to each other during operations of an iCVT, it is estimated that the load on a <b>choking</b> pulley is between 1 and 1.8 times of the tension of its chain.|$|R
5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} <b>chokes</b> under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E
5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she <b>chokes</b> to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing {{in the form of a}} green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he <b>chokes</b> himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E
50|$|Arm {{triangle}} <b>choke,</b> side <b>choke,</b> or {{head and}} arm <b>choke</b> are generic terms describing blood chokeholds {{in which the}} opponent is strangled in between {{his or her own}} shoulder and the practitioner's arm.
