40|$|Centrosomes are non-membrane-bound {{compartments}} that nucleate microtubule arrays. They {{consist of}} nanometer-scale centrioles {{surrounded by a}} micron-scale, dynamic assembly of protein called the pericentriolar material (PCM). To study how PCM forms a spherical compartment that nucleates microtubules, we reconstituted PCM-dependent microtubule nucleation in vitro using recombinant C. elegans proteins. We found that macromolecular <b>crowding</b> <b>drives</b> assembly of the key PCM scaffold protein SPD- 5 into spherical condensates that morphologically and dynamically resemble in vivo PCM. These SPD- 5 condensates recruited the microtubule polymerase ZYG- 9 (XMAP 215 homolog) and the microtubule-stabilizing protein TPXL- 1 (TPX 2 homolog). Together, these three proteins concentrated tubulin similar to 4 -fold over background, which was sufficient to reconstitute nucleation of microtubule asters in vitro. Our results suggest that in vivo PCM is a selective phase that organizes microtubule arrays through localized concentration of tubulin by microtubule effector proteins...|$|R

40|$|Electric mining shovels {{are used}} in open pit mining. Their {{efficiency}} of operation directly effects mine productivity and profitability. Shovel technologies such as trajectory following are a first step towards autonomous operation and have perceived cost saving benefits through improved efficiency and collision avoidance strategies. The development of such technologies requires rigorous testing which carries {{a high risk of}} lost production time and the potential for damaging machinery. The cost of lost production, and the remote location and nature of the environments in which electric mining shovels operate, make on site testing expensive and often infeasible. This thesis develops and validates a Simulink model of a P&H-class electric mining shovel. The model provides a framework for developing and testing shovel technologies. Its usefulness is shown in simulations which test model predictive control (MPC) as a control strategy for point-to-point motion control of each of the three freedoms of a P&H-class electric mining shovel. The thesis first presents a Simulink model describing the rigid body dynamics of a P&H-class mining shovel. The model is based on work presented by Wauge [1] and relates torques applied by the three actuating drives to motions of the shovel dipper. The material of this thesis differs from that of Wauge [1] in two respects; (i) the model is presented from a systems (input/output) perspective for implementation in Simulink, and (ii) explicit expressions for various terms are given. The rigid body dynamics model is extended to include models of the DC motors, power electronics and the control loops. The input to the extended shovel model is a joystick position and outputs are drive position, speed, armature current, armature voltage, and field current. The model is validated against data collected from a P&H 2100 BLE mining shovel and the predicted shovel response is shown to be in close agreement with measured values. MPC uses fit-for-purpose models to predict future plant behavior, from which a set of control inputs is computed that commands the plant to a desired output. Calculating good control inputs relies heavily on the ability to accurately predict future plant behavior. This thesis develops linear state space prediction models for each of the shovel’s three freedoms. The prediction models are verified against data collected from a P&H 2100 BLE mining shovel and shown to provide “accurate enough predictions” for the purpose of predicting future plant behavior. A typical MPC optimization problem is formulated that uses the linear state space prediction models to optimize a cost function and command time-optimal point-topoint motion of each of the shovels three freedoms. Simulations which use the shovel model as a proxy for a real machine show that MPC is capable of commanding timeoptimal point-to-point motion control for the swing and <b>crowd</b> <b>drives.</b> Hoist drive non-linearities cause predictions to become inaccurate and the hoist drive is shown to become unstable when controlled using MPC...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of control theory {{as a means to}} study and {{ultimately}} control the psychological dynamics of people in a crowd. Gustav LeBon's suggestibility theory, a well-known account of collective behaviour, is used to develop a discrete-time nonlinear model of psychological crowd behavior that, consistent with suggestibility theory, is open-loop unstable. As a first attempt to stabilize the dynamics, linear observer-based output-feedback techniques and a collection of simple nonlinear control strategies are pursued. The poor performance afforded by these schemes motivates an agent-oriented control strategy in which authoritative figures, termed control agents, are interspersed within the crowd and, similar to the technique of feedback linearization, use knowledge of the system dynamics to issue signals that propagate through the <b>crowd</b> to <b>drive</b> specific components of the state to zero. It is shown that if these states are chosen judiciously then it follows that a collection of other state signals are, themselves, zero. This realization is used to develop a stability result for a simple crowd structure and this result is, in turn, used as a template to develop similar results for crowds of greater complexity. Simulations are used to verify the functionality of the reported schemes and the advantages of using multiple control agents, instead of a single control agent, are emphasized. While the mathematical study of complex social phenomena, including crowds, is prefixed by an assortment of unique challenges, the main conclusion of this thesis is that control theory is a potentially powerful framework to study the underlying dynamics at play in such systems...|$|R

In {{the absence of}} conspecifics, locusts occur in a shy and cryptic solitarious phase. <b>Crowding</b> with conspecifics <b>drives</b> a behavioural transformation towards gregariousness that occurs within hours and is followed by changes in physiology, colouration and morphology, resulting in the full gregarious phase syndrome. We analysed methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphisms (MS-AFLP) to compare the effect of acute and chronic crowding on DNA methylation in the central nervous system. We find that crowd-reared and solitary-reared locusts show markedly different neural MS-AFLP fingerprints. However, crowding for a day resulted in neural MS-AFLP fingerprints that were clearly distinct from both crowd-reared and uncrowded solitary-reared locusts. Our results indicate that changes in DNA methylation associated with behavioural gregarisation proceed through intermediate states that are not simply partial realisations of the endpoint states.

Intense crowding within both the high (189 kg m− 3, 10 × stocking density) and normal (147 kg m− 3, 17 × stocking density) density cages occurred when sub-optimal temperatures limited the amount of vertical space available. In addition, when stocking density in the high treatment exceeded 26. 5 kg m− 3, feed intake, growth rate and feed utilisation declined and a greater number of cataracts, fin erosions and skin lesions developed. Fish with cataracts on both eyes were smaller than fish with only one or no cataracts.

The {{period between}} 1360 and 1600 {{witnesses}} {{the constitution of}} a national Russian State and a national Russian Church, {{the growth of a}} national "Russian Idea", firmly based upon the orthodox faith. The main vehicle of this faith, first embodying the local self-awareness of the various "Russian lands", then serving as a bridge over these local identities, is the rural cenobitic monasticism which St. Sergius of Radonezh (✝ 1392) brings back to life in North-Eastern Russia {{during the second half of}} the XIVth century. From then on, monastic economic presence is as strong in Russia as in Western Europe during the "golden age" of Cluny and Citeaux (X-XIIth c.) and the monk becomes the central figure of Russian holiness. Furthermore, during the XVth century, some big monasteries, such as the Trinity, the main foundation of Sergius, get to command a nationwide devotion. In times of peace, this piety <b>drives</b> <b>crowds</b> of pilgrims, including the grand-prince of Moscow, soon to become tsar; in times of national peril, it gives an anchor to the Russian identity, it develops a first form of Russian patriotism.

40|$|Phenomena such as Wikipedia {{and open}} source {{software}} are great examples of cultural activity that, on the surface, attempt to be more based on pleasures and rewards of co-operation rather than competition. It is most certain the case that firms in the digital era, increasingly seek to draw upon the participation of their users and consumers in the production process. In his book Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the <b>Crowd</b> Is <b>Driving</b> the Future of Business, Jeff Howe argues how crowdsourcing 1, which activates the transformative power of contemporary technology to liberate the creative potentials within us all, is increasingly being applied by businesses to harness these creative potentials for profits (2008). 	However, such celebratory accounts have not been without their critics. According to Hesmondhalgh, “too many of these discussions of transformations associated with new digital media rely on caricatured portrayals of supposedly bypassed eras” (2010, pp. 268). A dominant theme within critical analyses of digital media is that they involve unpaid work {{on the part of}} participants. For instance, Tiziana Terranova wrote about the phenomena of 'free labour' (2000). Various recent critical accounts have suggested that work in the cultural industries involves labour that is characterised by high degrees of autonomy and creativity, but also by overwork, casualisation and precariousness (Ross, 2003). This suggests that work in the cultural industries is also characterised by exploitation of the workers. However, there are also critics such as Cova et al. (2011), who question whether the term 'labor' or 'labour' is descriptive of the kinds of activities and contributions that take place on UGC sites. 	Moreover, most of the crowdsourcing literature uses the term amateurs or amateurism to refer to the crowd. However, labelling the crowd as mere amateurs or hobbyists undermines the fact that large amounts of work and expert knowledge are exerted by crowds for relatively little reward (Brabham, 2012). This then has critical implications for labour rights in the digital age and possibly presents us with labour struggles distinctive to the digital age. So what does crowdsourcing represent us with? Is it a phenomena characterized by terms such as collectivism, collaboration, and participation, or does it represent us with new labour struggles? Or is it a phenomena characterized by all the above...|$|R
