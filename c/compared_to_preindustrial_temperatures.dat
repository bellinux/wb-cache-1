40|$|We {{present results}} from {{transient}} sensitivity studies with the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) ocean model to increasing anthropogenic atmospheric inorganic nitrogen (N) and soluble iron (Fe) deposition over the industrial era. Elevated N deposition results from fossil fuel combustion and agriculture, and elevated soluble Fe deposition results from increased atmospheric processing {{in the presence}} of anthropogenic pollutants and soluble Fe from combustion sources. Simulations with increasing Fe and increasing Fe and N inputs raised simulated marine nitrogen fixation, with the majority of the increase in the subtropical North and South Pacific, and raised primary production and export in the high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. Increasing N inputs alone elevated small phytoplankton and diatom production, resulting in increased phosphorus (P) and Fe limitation for diazotrophs, hence reducing nitrogen fixation (∼ 6 %). Globally, the simulated primary production, sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) export. and atmospheric CO 2  uptake were highest under combined increase in Fe and N inputs <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> control. Our results suggest that increasing combustion iron sources and aerosol Fe solubility along with atmospheric anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are perturbing marine biogeochemical cycling and could partially explain the observed trend toward increased P limitation at station ALOHA in the subtropical North Pacific.

We were able to calculate over 41 thousand pH data points, resulting in a grand total of 73, 477 calculated and measured pH values for our analysis. Proﬁles of decadal pH change from multiple repeat cruises were used to determine focus regions where pH change was most dramatic for further trend analysis.

40|$|We {{developed}} a highly simplified approach {{to estimate the}} contributions of the past and present human generations to the increase of atmospheric CO 2 and associated global average temperature increases. For each human generation of adopted 25 -year length, we use simplified emission test cases to estimate the committed warming passed to successive children, grandchildren, and later generations. We estimate that the last and the current generation contributed approximately two thirds of the present-day CO 2 -induced warming. Because of the long time scale required for removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere as well as the time delays characteristic of physical responses of the climate system, global mean temperatures are expected to increase by several tenths of a degree {{for at least the next}} 20 years even if CO 2 emissions were immediately cut to zero; that is, there is a commitment to additional CO 2 -induced warming even in the absence of emissions. If the rate of increase of CO 2 emissions were to continue up to 2025 and then were cut to zero, a temperature increase of ≈ 1. 3 °C <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> conditions would still occur in 2100, whereas a constant-CO 2 -emissions scenario after 2025 would more than double the 2100 warming.

Significant lead enrichments in the upper layers at both sites reflect the increasing emission of lead into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities during the last century. At the Scottish site, a region under aeolian influence from Europe, anthropogenic derived lead could be recognized by the distinctive unradiogenic composition (206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios down to approximately 1. 115), being clearly different from the pre-industrial values (206 Pb/ 207 Pb approximately 1. 166).

40|$|The Last Interglacial (LIG, ∼ 129 - 116 {{thousand}} years ago, ka) represents an excellent case study {{to investigate the}} response of sensitive components of the Earth System and mechanisms of high-lati tude amplification to a climate warmer than present-day. The Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 4, hereafter referred as PMIP 4) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6, hereafter referred as CMIP 6) are coordinating the design of (1) a LIG Tier 1 equilibrium simulation to simulate the climate response at 127 ka, a time interval associated with a strong orbital forcing and greenhouse gas concentrations close <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> levels and (2) associated Tier 2 sensitivity experiments to examine {{the role of the}} ocean, vegetation and dust feedbacks in modulating the response to this orbital forcing. Evaluating the capability of the CMIP 6 /PMIP 4 models to reproduce the 127 ka polar and sub-polar climate will require appropriate data-based benchmarks which are currently missing. Based on a recent data synthesis that offers the first spatio-temporal representation of high-latitude (i. e. poleward of 40 °N and 40 °S) surface temperature evolution during the LIG, we produce a new 126 – 128 ka time slab, hereafter named 127 ka time slice. This 127 ka time slice represents surface <b>temperature</b> anomalies relative <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> and is associated with quantitative estimates of the uncertainties related to relative dating and surface temperature reconstruction methods. It illustrates warmer-than-preindustrial conditions in the high-latitude regions of both hemispheres. In particular, summer sea surface temperatures (SST) in the North Atlantic region were on average 1. 1 °C (with a standard error of the mean of 0. 7 °C) warmer relative <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> and 1. 8 °C (with a standard error of the mean of 0. 8 °C) in the Southern Ocean. In Antarctica, average 127 ka annual surface air temperature was 2. 2 °C (with a standard error of the mean of 1. 4 °C) warmer <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial.</b> We provide a critical evaluation of the latest LIG surface climate compilations that are available for evaluating LIG climate model experiments. We discuss in particular our new 127 ka time-slice in the context of existing LIG surface temperature time-slices. We also compare the 127 ka time slice with the ones published for the 125 and 130 ka time intervals and we discuss the potential and limits of a data-based time slice at 127 ka {{in the context of the}} upcoming coordinated modeling exercise. Finally we provide guidance on the use of the available LIG climate compilations for future model-data comparison exercises in the framework of the upcoming CMIP 6 /PMIP 4 127 ka experiments. We do not recommend the use of LIG peak warmth-centered syntheses. Instead we promote the use of the most recent syntheses that are based on coherent chronologies between paleoclimatic records and provide spatio-temporal reconstruction of the LIG climate.

To achieve the 2  °C goal, a large greenhouse gas emissions reduction is required, either in the early or latter half of this century. In the mid-term (from 2030 to 2050), it may be necessary to consider rapid changes to the existing energy or socioeconomic systems, while long-term measures (after 2050) will rely on the substantial use of biomass combined with carbon capture and storage technology or afforestation, which will eventually realize so-called negative CO 2 emissions. With respect to the policy context, two suggestions are provided here. The first is the review and revision of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in 2020, with an additional reduction target to the current NDCs being one workable alternative. The second suggestion is a concrete and numerical mid-term emissions reduction target, for example to be met by 2040 or 2050, which could also help to achieve the long-term climate goal.|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{cycle of}} phosphorus (P) is parameterized {{here in a}} state-of-the-art global 3 -D chemistry transport model, taking into account primary emissions of total P (TP) and soluble P (DP) associated with mineral dust, combustion particles from natural and anthropogenic sources, bioaerosols, sea spray and volcanic aerosols. For the present day, global TP emissions are calculated to be roughly 1. 33  Tg-P yr − 1, with the mineral sources contributing more than 80  % to these emissions. The P solubilization from mineral dust under acidic atmospheric conditions is also parameterized in the model and is calculated to contribute about one-third (0. 14  Tg-P yr − 1) of the global DP atmospheric source. To our knowledge, a unique aspect of our global study is the explicit modeling {{of the evolution of}} phosphorus speciation in the atmosphere. The simulated present-day global annual DP deposition flux is 0. 45  Tg-P yr − 1 (about 40  % over oceans), showing a strong spatial and temporal variability. Present-day simulations of atmospheric P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared with available observations, indicating however an underestimate of about 70  % on current knowledge of the sources that drive the P atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios showed a present-day increase of 75  % in the P solubilization flux from mineral dust, i. e., the rate at which P is converted into soluble forms, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> times, due <b>to</b> increasing atmospheric acidity over the last 150  years. Future reductions in air pollutants due to the implementation of air-quality regulations are expected to decrease the P solubilization flux from mineral dust by about 30  % in the year 2100 <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the present day. Considering, however, that all the P contained in bioaerosols is readily available for uptake by marine organisms, and also accounting for all other DP sources, a total bioavailable P flux of about 0. 17  Tg-P yr − 1 to the oceans is derived. Our calculations further show that in some regions {{more than half of the}} bioavailable P deposition flux to the ocean can originate from biological particles, while this contribution is found to maximize in summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the highest due to ocean stratification. Thus, according to this global study, a largely unknown but potentially important role of terrestrial bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the global ocean is also revealed. Overall, this work provides new insights to the atmospheric P cycle by demonstrating that biological materials are important carriers of bioavailable P, with very important implications for past and future responses of marine ecosystems to global change...|$|R

However, {{it is also the}} case that extremes of temperature and precipitation in G 1 differ significantly from those under preindustrial conditions. Probability density functions of standardized anomalies of monthly surface temperature inline image and precipitation inline image in G 1 exhibit an extension of the high-inline image tail over land, of the low-inline image tail over ocean, and a shift of inline image to drier conditions. Using daily model output, we analyzed the frequency of extreme events, such as the coldest night (TNn), warmest day (TXx), and maximum 5 day precipitation amount, and also duration indicators such as cold and warm spells and consecutive dry days.

In the present paper, we investigate the influence of vegetation change on the climate of the LGM by using a coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation general circulation model (GCM, the MIROC-LPJ). We examined four GCM experiments (LGM and preindustrial, with and without vegetation feedback) and quantified the strength of the vegetation feedback during the LGM. The result shows global-averaged cooling during the LGM is amplified by + 13. 5 % due to the introduction of vegetation feedback. This is mainly caused by the increase of land surface albedo due to the expansion of tundra in northern high latitudes and the desertification in northern middle latitudes around 30 ° N to 60 ° N. We also investigated how this change in climate affected the total terrestrial carbon storage by using a separated Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM). Our result shows that the total terrestrial carbon storage was reduced by 653 PgC during the LGM, which corresponds to the emission of 308 ppm atmospheric CO 2 . The carbon distribution during the LGM that is predicted from using an atmospheric-ocean-vegetation (AOV) GCM and using the LPJ-DGVM after an atmospheric-ocean (AO) GCM, is generally the same, but the difference is not negligible for explaining the lowering of atmospheric CO 2 during the LGM...|$|R
40|$|We apply GENMOM, a coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model, to {{simulate}} eight equilibrium time slices at 3000 -year intervals {{for the past}} 21 000 years forced by changes in Earth–Sun geometry, atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), continental ice sheets, and sea level. Simulated global cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is 3. 8 °C {{and the rate of}} post-glacial warming is in overall agreement with recently published temperature reconstructions. The greatest rate of warming occurs between 15 and 12 ka (2. 4 °C over land, 0. 7 °C over oceans, and 1. 4 °C globally) in response to changes in radiative forcing from the diminished extent of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets and increases in GHGs and NH summer insolation. The modeled LGM and 6 ka temperature and precipitation climatologies are generally consistent with proxy reconstructions, the PMIP 2 and PMIP 3 simulations, and other paleoclimate data–model analyses. The model does not capture the mid-Holocene "thermal maximum" and gradual cooling <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> (PI) global <b>temperature</b> found in the data. Simulated monsoonal precipitation in North Africa peaks between 12 and 9 ka at values ~ 50 % greater than those of the PI, and Indian monsoonal precipitation peaks at 12 and 9 ka at values ~ 45 % greater than the PI. GENMOM captures the reconstructed LGM extent of NH and Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice. The simulated present-day Antarctica Circumpolar Current (ACC) is ~ 48 % weaker than the observed (62 versus 119 Sv). The simulated present-day Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) of 19. 3 ± 1. 4 Sv on the Bermuda Rise (33 ° N) is comparable with observed value of 18. 7 ± 4. 8 Sv. AMOC at 33 ° N is reduced by ~ 15 % during the LGM, and the largest post-glacial increase (~ 11 %) occurs during the 15 ka time slice...|$|R
40|$|Changes of the Atlantic meridional {{overturning}} circulation (AMOC) in the mid-Holocene <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the <b>preindustrial</b> {{state are}} explored in different coupled climate models. Using time-slice integrations by a newly developed global finite-element model ECHAM 6 -FESOM with unstructured mesh and high resolution, our simulations show an enhanced mid-Holocene AMOC, {{accompanied by an}} increase in the ocean salinity over regions of deep water formation. We identify two different processes affecting the AMOC: (1) a more positive phase of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) increased water density over the Labrador Sea through anomalous net evaporation and surface heat loss; (2) a decreased import of sea ice from the Arctic causes a freshwater reduction in the northern North Atlantic Ocean. Using the coupled model ECHAM 6 -MPIOM in T 63 GR 15 and T 31 GR 30 grids, we find that the simulated AMOC has significant discrepancy with different model resolutions. In detail, stronger-than-present mid-Holocene AMOC is revealed by simulations with the T 63 GR 15 grid, which resembles the result of ECHAM 6 -FESOM, while a decline of the mid-Holocene AMOC is simulated by the low resolution model with the T 31 GR 30 grid. Such discrepancy can be attributed to different changes in Labrador Sea density which is mainly affected by (1) NAO-induced net precipitation and deep water convection, (2) freshwater transport from the Arctic Ocean, and (3) the strength of AMOC itself. Finally, we analyzed available coupled climate models showing a diversity of responses of AMOC to mid-Holocene forcings, most of which reveal positive AMOC changes related to northern high latitudes salinification...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic {{freshwater}} cycle {{plays an}} important role in regulating regional and global climate. Current observations suggest that an intensification of the highnorthern latitude hydrological cycle has caused a freshening of the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas, increasing the potential of weakening overturning strength in the Nordic seas, and reducing temperatures. It is not known if this freshening is a manifestation of the current anthropogenic warming and if the Arctic freshwater cycle has exhibited similar changes in the past, in particular as a response to naturally induced periods of warming, for example during the mid-Holocene hypsithermal. Thus, we have used an earth model of intermediate complexity, LOVECLIM, to investigate the response of the Arctic freshwater cycle, during two warm periods that evolved under different sets of forcings, the mid-Holocene and the twenty-first century. A combination of proxy reconstructions and modelling studies have shown these two periods to exhibit similar surface <b>temperature</b> anomalies, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the <b>preindustrial</b> period, however, it has yet to be determined if the Arctic freshwater cycle and thus, the transport and redistribution of freshwater to the Arctic and the sub-Arctic seas, during these two warm periods, is comparable. Here we provide an overview that shows that the response of the Arctic freshwater cycle during the first half of the twentyfirst century can be interpreted as an ‘extreme’ mid-Holocene hydrological cycle. Whilst for the remainder of the twenty-first century, the Arctic freshwater cycle and the majority of its components will likely transition into what can only be described as truly anthropogenic in nature...|$|R

We simulate the mPWP using the "alternate" protocol prescribed by the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) for the AOGCM simulation (Experiment 2). Results from the CCSM 4 mPWP simulation show a 1. 9 °C increase in global mean annual <b>temperature</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the 1850 <b>preindustrial</b> control, with a polar amplification of ~ 3 times the global warming.

40|$|AIM AND SCOPE Clarify the {{variations}} in carbon prices found in mitigation scenarios that limit global mean surface temperature increase to below 2 °C relative <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> levels. CONTEXT Integrated assessment models 1 (IAM) are dominant tools {{for the development of}} long-term emissions scenarios in line with climate objectives. There is a large variety of IAMs and, together with variations in socioeconomic and technological assumptions, this variety results in important differences in model behavior. For the achievement of low emissions scenarios, models typically assume or produce an implicit shadow price for carbon or represent policy instruments, including carbon pricing. This briefing aims at exploring and understanding the variation in these carbon price estimates for stringent climate change mitigation scenarios. The focus of this exercise will be on scenarios that limit global mean temperature surface increase (henceforth, warming) to below 2 °C relative <b>to</b> <b>preindustrial</b> levels with a greater than 66...|$|R

These changes to the planetary energy budget result in differential regional climate effects. For the first time, we quantitatively evaluate the potential for regional disparities in a multi-model context using results from a model experiment that offsets the forcing from a quadrupling of CO 2 via reduction in solar irradiance. We evaluate temperature and precipitation changes in 22 geographic regions spanning most of Earthʼs continental area.
