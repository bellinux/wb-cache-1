50|$|The Faultless {{test was}} a <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> {{conducted}} in a mine cavity 3,200 feet beneath the Hot Creek Valley near Tonopah, Nevada, with a yield of around 1 megaton. This test was conducted {{to see if the}} land was fit for testing a 5 megaton thermonuclear warhead for the Spartan missile. The test failed because of the large degree of faulting that resulted in the area around the test. It was decided that the land was unfit for multi-megaton nuclear tests, so a similar <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> was conducted at Amchitka Island, Alaska, in the fall of 1969 during Operation Mandrel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Calibration</b> <b>tests</b> are {{of great}} {{importance}} to ensure rate-sensing accuracy of GyroWheel, an innovative attitude determination and control device. In the process of <b>calibration</b> <b>tests,</b> turntable errors are inevitable, which hinder the calibration accuracy and rate-sensing capability. Hence, error analysis for GyroWheel <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> is conducted, {{and the relationship between}} the calibration accuracy and the orientation error is established based on analytical derivation and numerical simulations. Subsequently, an error model of the turntable system is derived using rigid body kinematics, by which the relationship between the orientation error and turntable errors is described. According to sensitivity analysis and manufacturing capability, an error allocation method is proposed to determine the accuracy requirement of the test turntable, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by repeated simulation tests. Based on the presented analysis and proposed method in this paper, the effects of various turntable errors on the calibration accuracy can be obtained quantitatively, and a theoretical basis for the determination of the turntable accuracy is provided, which are of great significance to guide the <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> and improve the calibration accuracy of GyroWheel...|$|R

40|$|Forecasts {{by nature}} {{should take the}} form of {{probabilistic}} distributions. Calibration, the statistical consistency of forecast distributions and observations, is a central property of good probabilistic forecasts. Calibration of univariate forecasts has been widely discussed, and significance tests are commonly used to investigate whether a prediction model is miscalibrated. However, <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> for multivariate forecasts are rare. In this paper, we propose <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> for multivariate Gaussian forecasts based on two types of the Dawid–Sebastiani score (DSS) : the multivariate DSS (mDSS) and the individual DSS (iDSS). Analytic results and simulation studies show that the tests have sufficient power to detect miscalibrated forecasts with incorrect mean or incorrect variance. But for forecasts with incorrect correlation coefficients, only the tests based on mDSS are sensitive to miscalibration. As an illustration, we apply the methodology to weekly data on Norovirus disease incidence among males and females in Germany, in 2011 – 2014. The results further show that tests for multivariate forecasts are useful tools and superior to univariate <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> for correlated multivariate forecasts...|$|R

5000|$|Both the 1969 <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> and Cannikin itself {{attracted}} protest. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, {{the plans}} raised concerns that tests might trigger earthquakes and cause a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000 [...] people blocked a major U.S.-Canada border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading [...] "Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes". Further demonstrations occurred at Canada-US border crossings in Ontario and Quebec. [...] The Canadian Don't Make a Wave Committee founded that year attempted to halt further testing on the island. With {{the intention of}} sailing to Amchitka to protest the 1971 test, the committee chartered a ship it renamed Greenpeace. The ship was turned back by the U.S. Coast Guard. However, under this name, the organization created for the protest continued to exist as the campaigning environmental organization Greenpeace.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the procedure currently {{applied for the}} calibration of the load cells used for the mechanical experiments in the ELSA laboratory. The procedure {{is based on the}} international norm ISO 7500 - 1 and the definitions there proposed. The calibration experiment consists of applying a number of load cycles simultaneously on the object load cell in series with a traceable measuring proving instrument externally calibrated (reference load cell). The accuracy of the measures of the object load cell is the most important result of the test delimiting the maximum difference between both instruments. Other important results of the test are the resolution, repeatability and reversibility of the object load cell. All these error parameters determine the quality of the object instrument at the state of the <b>calibration</b> <b>test.</b> In order to extend the validity of the <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> to the experiments performed with that load cell when connected to amplifiers different from the one of the <b>calibration</b> <b>test,</b> an additional gain test of the signal conditioning chain is also undertaken at ELSA after the <b>calibration</b> <b>test.</b> JRC.
