40|$|AIM: To compare an {{addiction}} severity score estimated from <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> to addiction severity index (ASI) scores. METHODS: During April-May 2004, 31 patients {{treated in a}} therapeutic community in the Piedmont region (Italy) were interviewed using the ASI questionnaire and their <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> were used to obtain severity scores in seven areas: physical health, occupational functioning, alcohol use, drug use, legal problems, family/social relationships, psychological health. Correlation, agreement, and discriminatory capacity of the <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> score in correctly classifying persons with low or high severity were investigated using Spearman, Kappa coefficient, and receiver operating characteristics curves. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Clinical</b> <b>records</b> score showed good correlation, agreement, and discriminatory accuracy with respect to ASI scores, especially in the drug use and legal problems areas.

40|$|A {{cohort of}} 130 working class mothers {{has been studied}} in depth over five years to {{quantify}} the extent of recording and counselling of lifestyle problems by general practitioners and their staff. <b>Clinical</b> <b>records</b> and mothers' personal accounts at two home interviews five years apart provide {{the data for this}} work. Fifty-nine per cent of women had one or more aspects of lifestyle recorded in their records, the commonest being smoking habits. Despite this evidence for good coverage of smokers in the population, alcohol and exercise problems were under-recorded. <b>Clinical</b> <b>records</b> only included details of advice given and follow-up plans for lifestyle problems in 40 % of patients' records yet the women themselves remembered advice being given in 48 % of cases. An analysis of the womens' accounts in conjunction with the <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> revealed that over three quarters of those receiving advice remembered it several years later. The primary care team was most likely to target advice and plans on women who were heavy smokers and very obese. This study shows that <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> underestimate the amount of lifestyle counselling which is conducted in general practice and that a surprising number of working class women remember and act on the advice from their doctors.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the quality of the <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> of the {{patients}} who are seen in public hospitals in Madrid after a suicide attempt in a blind observation. METHODS: Observational, descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at four general public hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Analyses of the presence of seven indicators of information quality (previous psychiatric treatment, recent suicidal ideation, recent suicide planning behaviour, medical lethality of suicide attempt, previous suicide attempts, attitude towards the attempt, and social or family support) in 993 <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> of 907 patients (64. 5 % women), ages ranging from 6 to 92 years (mean 37. 1 ± 15), admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt or who committed an attempt whilst in hospital. RESULTS: Of patients who attempted suicide, 94. 9 % received a psychosocial assessment. All seven indicators were documented in 22. 5 % of the records, whilst 23. 6 % recorded four or less than four indicators. Previous suicide attempts and medical lethality of current attempt were the indicators most often missed in the records. The study found no difference between the records of men and women (z= 0. 296; p= 0. 767, two tailed Mann-Whitney U test), although <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> of patients discharged after an emergency unit intervention were more incomplete than the ones from hospitalised patients (z= 2. 731; p= 0. 006), and <b>clinical</b> <b>records</b> of repeaters were also more incomplete than the ones from non-repeaters (z= 3. 511; p< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract- The <b>clinical</b> <b>record</b> is {{a primary}} support for the {{diagnostic}} process performed by physicians. The development of a <b>Clinical</b> <b>Record</b> Management System can significantly {{improve the quality of}} patient care by properly supporting the physicians' tasks and, in particular, the diagnostic process. In this paper we address some key issues in designing a medical decision support system. Acquisition of medical knowledge is supported by a knowledge editor based on a conceptual model of diseases, aetiologies, evidence and their relationships. Diagnostic support is carried out by an algorithm which, according to the production rules generated by the knowledge editor and to the patient's clinical data, formulates a set of diagnostic hypotheses and suggests tests and examinations for their validation. The definition of an internal model for the <b>clinical</b> <b>record</b> allows for clinical data from different departments to be integrated. On the other hand, the definition of external models allows for custom presentations of clinical data to be created. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background: Public health {{monitoring}} is commonly undertaken {{in social media}} but has never been combined with data analysis from electronic health records. This study aimed to investigate {{the relationship between the}} emergence of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in social media and their appearance in a large mental health database. Methods: Insufficient numbers of mentions of other NPS in case records meant that the study focused on mephedrone. Data were extracted on the number of mephedrone (i) references in the <b>clinical</b> <b>record</b> at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK, (ii) mentions in Twitter, (iii) related searches in Google and (iv) visits in Wikipedia. The characteristics of current mephedrone users in the <b>clinical</b> <b>record</b> were also established. Results: Increased activity related to mephedrone searches in Google and visits in Wikipedia preceded a peak in mephedrone-related references in the <b>clinical</b> <b>record</b> followed by a spike in the other 3 data sources in early 2010, when mephedrone was assigned a ‘class B’ status. Features of current mephedrone users widely matched those from community studies. Conclusions: Combined analysis of information from social media and data from mental health records may assist public health and clinical surveillance for certain substance-related events of interest.
