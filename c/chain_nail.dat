25|$|Zook and {{her mother}} reached the farm, where they asked Amos Smoker to call 911. Roberts and the boys carried lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, <b>chains,</b> <b>nails,</b> tools and a small bag. Also brought into the {{classroom}} was a length of wooden board with multiple sets of metal eye-hooks. The contents of the bag included a change of clothes, toilet paper, candles, and flexible plastic ties. Using wooden boards, Roberts barricaded the front door.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Carney co-founded British <b>nail</b> salon <b>chain</b> <b>Nails</b> Inc. with Thea Green. On {{trips to}} Manhattan, Green and Carney {{had noticed that}} soon after landing in the U.S, U.K. women tended to visit nail salons for quick, {{inexpensive}} manicures. After conducting consumer research to confirm consumer demand in Britain, the pair raised £250,000 in private funding and in November 1999 opened their first store on South Molton Street in the West End of London. Soon after they opened four additional stores. [...] The chain has since expanded to 60 locations and is the U.K.'s largest <b>nail</b> salon <b>chain.</b> In 2012 the company recorded sales at £21.7m, and expanded into Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Scattershot is {{an improvised}} form of grapeshot that uses <b>chain</b> links, <b>nails,</b> shards of glass, rocks or other similar objects as the projectiles. Although scattershot can be cheaply made, {{it is less}} {{effective}} than grapeshot {{due to the lack}} of uniformity in the projectiles' mass, shape, material, and resultant ballistics.|$|R

5000|$|Gunnarson {{narrowly}} escaped {{death in}} October 1983 during a stunt {{in which he}} was handcuffed and <b>chained</b> and <b>nailed</b> into a coffin which was then submerged into the Red River in Winnipeg. The stunt went wrong as the coffin was lowered into the water, leaving him unable to escape. He was eventually pulled from the river and freed by the support crew, at which point he was not breathing and had to be resuscitated by paramedics. The incident led Johnny Carson to refer to Gunnarson on The Tonight Show as [...] "that crazy Canadian".|$|R
50|$|Cramer {{is remembered}} for his emblem book The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross (1617). It was reprinted with {{different}} titles: Emblemata sacra (1624), and Emblematum sacrorum (1627), composed with {{the academic and}} poet Conrad Bachmann (1572-1646). The 1624 edition (with 50 emblems) is the better known. This {{was followed by the}} Octaginta emblemata moralia nova (1630).The common denominator of all the Cramer's emblems is a mystic heart, represented in the most different situations: <b>chained,</b> crowned, <b>nailed</b> to a cross, to the roots of a rosary, endowed with wings, undermined by the devil, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Outfitting the {{supplies}} and choosing the parties equipment of their journey becomes a possible point of player control leading to increased scoring chances. Additional supplies means adding {{weight to the}} player's wagon. When the wagon's weight limit is reached, {{it is not possible}} to continue on the trail and some good will have to be dumped. The game offers players an immense selection of supplies available for purchase. During the beginning of the game, package deals are available up to six months of provisions. However, many perils in the game will cause many provisions to be lost or used for trade. One has the option of taking a computer generated [...] "package deal", ostensibly offered by the trailhead town's merchants. Or the player can shop the town and choose a custom strategy, quantities, tools and so forthor take the package then shop or trade in addition to that. One problem with the package is finding someone to trade for unwanted items for useful ones. Conversely, some assets are only available by the package (e.g. Chains, anvils, plows) or by tradingthough many of those can be purchased from merchants or blacksmiths farther down the trails. If a player decides to buy supplies without the package, the player may buy chains or anvils from Westport, Fort Kearny or Fort Laramie. All forts or towns with a blacksmith's shop will sell <b>chains,</b> <b>nails</b> (measured in pounds), and anvils.|$|R
50|$|Wrede was {{recruited}} to lead Ab Dalsbruk in 1922; Dalsbruk produced basic ironware products, such as bar iron, <b>chain</b> and <b>nails.</b> Finland was in economical upswing and Wrede started an investment programme. Despite of intense price competition, the company's order book {{was in a}} good level. In January 1924 Dalsbruk became part of German Wuppermann company, which secured its financial status giving security to investments; the most important ones were a new foundry and modern rolling mill. The Wuppermann family had high expectations for potential of the Dalsbruk factory and invested on it total 23.5 million Finnish marks. The youngest son of the owning family Gerhard Wuppermann was appointed Deputy Director.|$|R
5000|$|Ella is a businesswoman {{who runs}} a [...] "lucrative" [...] <b>chain</b> of <b>nail</b> bars in Singapore and is {{described}} as [...] "sexy and savvy". In an interview with Sunday Mercury, Wicks described Ella as [...] "passionate, no-nonsense, funny and likeable". Discussing Ella’s relationship with Declan, she stated: [...] "It is a love-hate relationship. They have stayed in constant contact, particularly because of their daughter. Declan has been over to Singapore because Mia has a motorbike accident and I think seeing each other has sparked something between them again. Ella wants to pursue it. She's {{going to fight for}} her man. There is a lot of feeling between them. There is an irresistible pull but they drive each other mad." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s {{he began}} to win {{fighting}} tournaments and competitions in Prague. He repeatedly became a winner of the Prague heavy-weight club Prague—Bubenech and became a champion of Czechoslovakia in hand-to-hand fighting and weight-lifting. Later, he was a circus performer at the Hertsfert-circus. He visited a majority of European countries and traveled to the United States. He performed under the pseudonym Ivan-Syla (Strong Ivan) in 64 countries. His routine included ripping iron <b>chains</b> apart; bending <b>nails</b> with his fingers, making stick figures; lying on broken glass while hefting 500 kilograms of weight and juggling heavy objects.|$|R
5000|$|Salling sings, writes, and {{produces}} his own music, and plays the piano, guitar, bass guitar, and drums. His solo project's (under the stage name [...] "Jericho") debut album Smoke Signals {{was released on}} February 8, 2008, under Jericho Records. On October 25, 2010, Salling released a rock/jazz album entitled Pipe Dreams, which was inspired by Alice in <b>Chains,</b> Nine Inch <b>Nails,</b> Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. It was released by Pipe Dreams Records, Salling's own label, in partnership with Fontana Distribution. He is the composer, performer and producer, of each track. The first single, [...] "Higher Power", premiered on August 10, 2010.|$|R
60|$|Antonio Francisco, Captain Green's black servant, swore that, being <b>chained</b> and <b>nailed</b> to her forecastle, {{he heard}} the 'Worcester' fire six shots. Two days later a {{quantity}} of goods was brought on board (captured, it would seem, by the terrible sloop of the 'Worcester'), and Ferdinando then told this witness about {{the killing of the}} captured crew, and showed his own wounded arm. Francisco himself lay in chains for two months, and, of course, had a grudge against Captain Green. It was proved that the 'Worcester' had a cipher wherein to communicate with her owners, who used great secrecy; that her cargo consisted of arms, and was of such slight value as not to justify her voyage, unless her real business was piracy. The ship was of 200 tons, twenty guns, thirty-six men, and the value of the cargo was but 1,000l. Really, things do not look very well for the enterprise of Captain Green! There was also found a suspicious letter to one of the crew, Reynolds, from his sister-in-law, advising him to confess, and referring to a letter of his own in which he said that some of the crew 'had basely confessed.' The lady's letter and a copy of Reynolds's, admitted by him to be correct, were before the Court.|$|R
60|$|Far in this den of infamous resort, {{there was}} a low-browed, {{beetling}} shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys, <b>nails,</b> <b>chains,</b> hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without by a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line, and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.|$|R
50|$|Already in 1926 {{the company}} started to have problems; it {{was hit by}} {{recession}} and a strike that took for over two months from June until August. Problems continued in the following year, when Dalsbruk was in strike and lockout for total seven months. When this was over, the economic cycle had turned worse. Dalsbruk operated then just four days per week {{and the number of}} shifts was cut down. Wuppermann family had to fund the operations by bills of exchange. The company still owned large areas of land which was eventually sold; this reduced the need for money borrowed. In 1929 the company debt reached 5.5 million marks and in addition Wuppermann family had taken debt for Dalsbruk for 10.5 million. The Wuppermanns decided to run down operations in Dalsbruk in a hygienic manner. In September 1930 the family gave Dalsbruk shares to Wrede, whose task was now to make the tough decisions. Salaries were cut, <b>chain</b> and <b>nail</b> production was sold and headcount was reduced. As the Finnish government changed its tariff policy more favourable, Wrede managed to press the losses down in 1930-1931. Abandoning of gold standard in autumn 1931 and the subsequent devaluation improved Dalsbruk's competitiveness. On the other hand, following collapse of international raw material bar cartel, competition had become more intense and prices dropped.|$|R
5|$|By the evening, a {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as <b>nails,</b> <b>chains,</b> knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.|$|R
5000|$|Other media {{they have}} used for portraits include cotton thread for a series {{including}} Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill, pearls for Amalita Fortabat, matches for the gallery owner Ruth Benzacar, dried meat for Lucien Freud, burnt toast, stale bread and resin for Eva Perón, gold <b>chains</b> wrapped around <b>nails</b> for Diego Maradona and bullets and red resin for Che Guevara. Non-portrait subjects include a U.S. dollar note created with 80,000 nails, silver thread and resin on black wood, a lotus flower rendered in 300,000 hand-painted Chinese sticks and a depiction of childbirth as a mosaic of glass squares. [...] They frequently use edibles, such as smoked ham, salmon and cheese, freeze-dried and sealed in resin. For the Black Series, they transformed pornographic images from the internet into mosaics of cookies and crackers in shades of brown and black; the monochromy {{and the use of}} common foodstuffs are a commentary on the de-eroticisation of sex and its pervasive commodification. In 2012 they showed a triptych reminiscent of Catholic altarpieces, but depicting a favela.|$|R
50|$|During the French Revolution, Kusel was burnt {{down for}} the third time in 1794. Within half an hour, all the town’s {{inhabitants}} had to leave, under threat of death, before the soldiers set all the houses on ﬁre. The town burnt down and only two houses were left standing, among them the Reformed inspectorate house, today the Evangelical deaconry building. Nevertheless, French Revolutionary troops meant to spare the people’s lives. One story has it that the town was burnt down because somebody there was printing counterfeit assignats. This assertion cannot be proved, but there were certainly false assignats in town, as there were almost everywhere, and it is believed that the French were even offered false assignats in a bid to ransom some hostages. It is likelier, though, that the burning of Kusel was meant as a general example to others in the hope that they would thereafter desist from falsifying assignats. According to another version of the story, six houses were left standing afterwards. The deed is said in this case to have been a punishment for the town’s having supplied a few townsmen who had been held hostage in Metz with money (not speciﬁcally assignats), which had then turned out to be counterfeit, and apparently made in Kusel. It has also been hypothesized that it was actually Kasel (near Trier) that was supposed to be destroyed, and that Kusel was burnt down instead owing to a spelling mistake in the soldiers’ orders. Kusel grew gradually into a town of craftsmen and weavers. On 26 July 1794, French Revolutionary troops occupied the town (and burnt it down). During the time of French rule, Kusel kept its administrative function, but only as the seat of a canton. As compensation for the town’s destruction, though, the institution of a peace court was promised. The town lay during the time of French annexation in the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre. After victory over Napoleon in 1815, Kusel was at ﬁrst subject to a joint Prussian-Bavarian-Austrian Landesadministrationskommission (“State Administration Commission”), which was responsible for ascertaining new borders. Under the new order, the town was assigned in 1818 to the Bavarian Rheinkreis - a new exclave of that kingdom created by the Congress of Vienna - as the seat of a Landkommissariat (later Bezirksamt and now district). During the 19th century, the town’s industrialization began, which also led to the downfall of such traditional crafts as hat making, linen weaving and stocking knitting. Dwellers of the villages around Kusel for decades travelled worldwide plying their trade as travelling musicians (Wandermusikanten). Kusel is often seen nowadays as the hub of this movement, even though the town itself yielded very few of these Wandermusikanten. The ﬁrst watermain was laid in 1824. Voluntary donations funded the Maximilianbrunnen (fountain). Between 1850 and 1880, important cloth and knitting yarn factories were founded (Zöllner, Ehrenspeck, Fickeissen). In 1868, the railway from Landstuhl to Kusel was built, which brought the town great economic advantages. In the local quarries, “cuselite” was being mined for use as paving stones and for building railways. Also springing up were breweries, machine foundries, wool weaving factories, brickyards, printing shops and smithies making <b>chains</b> or <b>nails.</b> The town also became the regional agricultural hub with its livestock markets (later the Autumn Fair). Towards the end of the Second World War, the town was repeatedly bombed by Allied fighter-bombers and also by bigger aircraft. One air raid alone, on 6 January 1945, destroyed much of the town and killed 37 people. After 1945, new industrial operations arose, new building areas were opened (Holler-Siedlung) and schools were built. Further political changes came only with the realignment of political entities after the war and with the founding of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate. As early as 1939, the village of Diedelkopf was amalgamated with Kusel, while the same was done with the village of Bledesbach on 17 March 1974. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1968, the town became the seat of a Verbandsgemeinde administration. Belonging today to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kusel are the municipalities of Albessen, Blaubach, Börsborn, Dennweiler-Frohnbach, Ehweiler, Etschberg, Haschbach am Remigiusberg, Herchweiler, Konken, Körborn, Oberalben, Oberstaufenbach, Oberweiler im Tal, Oberweiler-Tiefenbach, Odenbach, Pfeffelbach, Ruthweiler, Schellweiler, Selchenbach, Thallichtenberg and Theisbergstegen. The district has remained, although its boundaries have now and then been adjusted. After the First World War, the Canton of Waldmohr in the Bezirksamt of Homburg was grouped into the Kusel district, while after the Second World War, six municipalities in the Oster valley passed to the Saarland. Further realignments took place as part of the administrative restructuring of 1969 to 1972. In 1964, Kusel became a garrison town. A smaller garrison was already in the town in 1938, billeted in a simple barracks camp. Only after the Second World War did the barracks buildings on the Windhof come into being. They are named the Unterofﬁzier-Krüger-Kaserne.|$|R
