Despite seeming to converge at a point, the rays are in fact near-parallel shafts of sunlight. Their apparent convergence is a perspective effect, similar, for example, to the way that parallel railway lines seem to converge at a point in the distance.|$|R

These effects include halos around light sources, volumetric shadows and <b>crepuscular</b> <b>rays.</b> By displacing the vertices of a base mesh with the depths from a standard shadow map, we construct a polygonal mesh that encloses the volume of space that is directly illuminated by a light source. Using this volume we can calculate the airlight contribution for each pixel by considering only points along the eye-ray where shadow-transitions occur.

40|$|Figure 1 : Volumetric shadows {{rendered}} in real-time with our method. We {{reduce the number}} of ray marching samples for computing the inscattered light by placing them along epipolar lines and depth discontinuities (center). Our sampling strategy is motivated by the observation that scattering varies mostly smoothly along these lines, and is confirmed by the frequency analysis (right). Scattering in participating media, such as fog or haze, generates volumetric lighting effects known as <b>crepuscular</b> or god <b>rays.</b> Rendering such effects greatly enhances the realism in virtual scenes, but is inherently costly as scattering events occur at every point in space and thus it requires costly integration of the light scattered towards the observer. This is typically done using ray marching which is too expensive for every pixel on the screen for interactive applications. We propose a rendering technique for textured light sources in single-scattering media, that draws from the concept of epipolar geometry to place samples in image space: the inscattered light varies orthogonally to <b>crepuscular</b> <b>rays,</b> but mostly smoothly along these rays. These are epipolar lines of a plane of light rays that projects onto one line on the image plane. Our method samples sparsely along epipolar lines and interpolates between samples where adequate, but preserves high frequency details that are caused by shadowing of light rays. We show that our method is very simple to implement on the GPU, yields high quality images, and achieves high frame rates...|$|R
40|$|A typical modern engine has a {{postprocessing}} pipeline {{which can}} be used to augment the final image from a previous render process with several effects. These usually include depth-of-field, <b>crepuscular</b> <b>rays,</b> tonemapping or morphological antialiasing. Such effects can be easily added to any existing renderer, since they usually rely only on information readily available in screen space. Recently, global illumination algorithms have been mapped to postprocessing effects, such as the wide selection of Screen Space Ambient Occlusion methods. An insight in [Ritschel et al. 2009] is that screen space algorithms can sample more information than just occlusion: in addition to visibility Screen Space Direct Occlusion samples neighboring pixels to gather indirect bounces. Soler et al. [Soler et al. 2010] use mipmapped buffers to sample diffuse farfield indirect illumination and importance sample specular cones for glossy reflections, but do not consider to use mipmaps to access prefiltered bounces for specular cones. We present Screen Space Cone Tracing (SSCT), a method to simulate glossy and specular reflections. Instead of regular screen-space ray tracing, we adopt the concept of cone-tracing on hierarchical, prefiltered buffers to reduce integration costs...|$|R
40|$|Fig. 1. Regarding a tumor as a {{volumetric}} light source, {{we estimate}} {{the safety of}} all straight access paths {{in the region of}} interest based on the light intensity reaching every point. We display the safety information in 3 D using direct volume rendering (a) and in 2 D slice views that allow millimeter-accurate intervention planning, which are widespread in medicine (b). The 3 D view (a) shows the safe (green) and the medium-safe paths (yellow). The 2 D slice view (b), shows only the safe paths from the volumetric representation and provides additional information about the extent of safe areas using color-coded thick lines. Thin red lines signify that the available leeway is very small and that the physician must be very precise to use such access areas. In contrast, thick green lines mean that less precision is required, as the corresponding safe area is large. The datasets used in these examples are (a) porcine abdomen CT and (b) artificial XCat patient model [20]. Abstract—In modern clinical practice, planning access paths to volumetric target structures {{remains one of the most}} important and most complex tasks, and a physician’s insufficient experience in this can lead to severe complications or even the death of the patient. In this paper, we present a method for safety evaluation and the visualization of access paths to assist physicians during preoperative planning. As a metaphor for our method, we employ a well-known, and thus intuitively perceivable, natural phenomenon that is usually called <b>crepuscular</b> <b>rays.</b> Using this metaphor, we propose several ways to compute the safety of paths from the region of interest to all tumor voxels and show how this information can be visualized in real-time using a multi-volume rendering system. Furthermore, we show how to estimate the extent of connected safe areas to improve common medical 2 D multi-planar reconstruction (MPR...|$|R

5000|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the Moon may have a tenuous atmosphere of moving dust particles constantly leaping up from and falling back to the Moon's surface, giving rise to a [...] "dust atmosphere" [...] that looks static but is composed of dust particles in constant motion. The term [...] "Moon fountain" [...] has been used to describe this effect by analogy with the stream of molecules of water in a fountain following a ballistic trajectory while appearing static due to the constancy of the stream. According to a model proposed in 2005 by the Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, this is caused by electrostatic levitation. On the daylit side of the Moon, solar ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is energetic enough to knock electrons out of atoms and molecules in the lunar soil. Positive charges build up until the tiniest particles of lunar dust (measuring 1 micrometre and smaller) are repelled from the surface and lofted anywhere from metres to kilometres high, with the smallest particles reaching the highest altitudes. Eventually they fall back toward the surface where the process is repeated. On the night side, the dust is negatively charged by electrons in the solar wind. Indeed, the fountain model suggests that the night side would achieve greater voltage differences than the day side, possibly launching dust particles to higher velocities and altitudes. This effect could be further enhanced during the portion of the Moon's orbit where it passes through Earth's magnetotail; see Magnetic field of the Moon for more detail. On the terminator there could be significant horizontal electric fields forming between the day and night areas, resulting in horizontal dust transport - a form of [...] "moon storm".This effect was anticipated in 1956 by science fiction author Hal Clement in his short story [...] "Dust Rag", published in Astounding Science Fiction.There is {{some evidence}} for this effect. In the early 1960s, Surveyor 7 and several prior Surveyor spacecraft that soft-landed on the Moon returned photographs showing an unmistakable twilight glow low over the lunar horizon persisting after the Sun had set. Moreover, the distant horizon between land and sky did not look razor-sharp, as would have been expected in a vacuum where there was no atmospheric haze. Apollo 17 astronauts orbiting the Moon in 1972 repeatedly saw and sketched what they variously called [...] "bands," [...] "streamers" [...] or [...] "twilight rays" [...] for about 10 seconds before lunar sunrise or lunar sunset. Such rays were also reported by astronauts aboard Apollo 8, 10, and 15. These may have been similar to <b>crepuscular</b> <b>rays</b> on Earth.|$|R

40|$|The global {{decline of}} large sharks has fuelled a rapidly {{expanding}} {{field of research}} into their ecological role within coastal and pelagic systems, yet the ecological importance of smaller mesopredatory elasmobranchs is largely unknown. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the functional ecology of the southern stingray in a system of known predator abundance using wildlife surveys, acoustic tracking and stable isotope analysis. Elasmobranch community composition (number of species) and population size were estimated at Glovers Reef Atoll, Belize, and distribution was quantified according to habitat type and prey density. Dasyatis americana was the most abundant elasmobranch in lagoon and shallow forereef habitats with an overall atoll population of 5500 individuals; the lagoon population was dominated by female rays (3 : 1), and stingray habitat use was influenced by individual size and diel stage. Benthic prey availability correlated with depth and habitat complexity in lagoon margins, yet large female and juvenile rays were abundant in the depauperate shallow sand flat areas during daylight, suggesting the use of this habitat for thermal and safety advantages respectively. Active tracking of <b>rays</b> illustrated heightened <b>crepuscular</b> activity by <b>rays</b> in all life stages, with intermittent activity through day and night. Activity space was larger during daylight and increased with ontogeny, with large (> 70 cm) individuals remaining active at night suggesting use of a size refuge. Analysis of movement path structure showed stingray response to two distinct spatial scales, corresponding to topographical features of their landscape. Rays orientate and utilise foraging patches up to a scale of >- 100 m, but move randomly at greater spatial scales > 3 km, suggesting rays may use the distribution of patch reefs as a network of refuges, connected by pathways of potential foraging areas as seen in some terrestrial animals. Stable isotope analysis revealed stingrays are reliant upon a diverse prey base and forage opportunistically on a number of prey groups, causing little overlap in isotopic niche space with sympatric shark species. Mixing models showed bivalves and invertebrate worms proportionately more important in diet compared to crustaceans and teleost fish. The combined findings of this study indicate that predation risk has a strong influence on stingray behaviour, causing a trade-off of energy for safety in juveniles in terms of movement periodicity and habitat preference. The dietary breadth of stingrays implies their key importance in stabilising benthic communities to trophic perturbations, however population and habitat use changes resulting from a release of predation pressure may significantly impact benthic community structure. This study represents an important step towards a greater understanding of the basic ecology of these organisms, which is crucial to making informed management decisions for species and ecosystem conservation.
