5|$|On September 6, 1915, {{police detective}} Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is {{summoned to the}} siege of a {{decrepit}} manor house in Boston. The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with {{no option but to}} investigate. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham Asylum, where he stays for six years.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} {{different}} now. The poor fellow hardly takes anything. He will sit all the afternoon smoking cigarettes and sipping tea. It is quite sad to see him. Then he <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>and</b> is always asking me to make Ayala have him." ...|$|R
60|$|Olive {{was very}} much {{disappointed}} at breakfast time, {{and as soon as}} she had finished that meal she stationed herself at a point on the grounds which commanded the entrance.

60|$|They stood aside. A native {{opened a}} door for her and closed it behind her. They sat down and waited. One or two white men <b>came</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them in undertones. Dr Macphail told them again what he knew of the tragedy. At last the door was quietly opened <b>and</b> Mrs Davidson <b>came</b> out. Silence fell upon them.|$|R

6000|$|... 'To me!' and Violet {{followed}} her, blushed and bent, {{then found}} her hand cordially shaken, and a most comfortable voice addressing her.

60|$|He was ill {{for some}} days and they nursed him kindly. That refined his submission. But they insisted on his {{lying in the}} dark, {{and that was a}} great misery. <b>And</b> blind {{philosophers}} <b>came</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him of the wicked levity of his mind, and reproved him so impressively for his doubts about the lid of rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he almost doubted whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it overhead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{say that}} I do," [...] he laughed. [...] "What a plucky girl you are. Now that we're in a quieter sea, I think that I may venture to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{the time}} passed by, {{and with each}} year Wildrose grew taller and more beautiful, and she lived happily in her nest and never {{wanted to go out}} of it, only {{standing}} at the edge in the sunset, and looking upon the beautiful world. For company she had all the birds in the forest, who <b>came</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, <b>and</b> for playthings the strange flowers which they brought her from far, and the butterflies which danced with her.
