5|$|Argon is a <b>chemically</b> inert gas.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus was {{prepared}} from urine, by Hennig Brand, in 1669. It {{was the first}} element to be <b>chemically</b> discovered.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{is created}} from rock {{that has been}} <b>chemically</b> or {{physically}} weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated.|$|E
5|$|The current {{practices}} of synthesis of <b>chemically</b> modified oligonucleotides on large scale have been recently reviewed.|$|E
5|$|The product, chloryl fluoride, {{is one of}} {{the five}} known {{chlorine}} oxide fluorides. These range from the thermally unstable FClO to the <b>chemically</b> unreactive perchloryl fluoride (FClO3), the other three being FClO2, F3ClO, and F3ClO2. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both structurally and <b>chemically,</b> and may act as Lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.|$|E
5|$|Agent Orange dries {{quickly after}} {{spraying}} and breaks down within hours to days {{when exposed to}} sunlight (if not bound <b>chemically</b> to a biological surface such as soil, leaves and grass) {{and is no longer}} harmful.|$|E
5|$|Animals use {{muscles to}} move; {{even if we}} don't {{understand}} how they work, we can see they work mechanically, argues Paley, moving joints to and fro. Other organs such as the stomach work <b>chemically</b> to digest food.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{pollution}}. Water {{pollution is}} primarily seen in turtles and crocodilians and can affect their eggs and sex characteristics. Male American alligators (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi) {{have been found}} with lowered testosterone and altered gonads in a <b>chemically</b> contaminated lake.|$|E
5|$|Sesquiterpene lactones are {{a diverse}} group of biologically active {{compounds}} that are being investigated for their antiinflammatory and antitumor activities. Some of these compounds have been isolated and <b>chemically</b> characterized from Russula brevipes: russulactarorufin, lactarorufin-A, and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,22E-diene-3β,5α,6β-triol.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum, always {{together}} with the <b>chemically</b> similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).|$|E
5|$|The next mission (Scud Buster) entails {{locating}} {{and destroying}} a chemical weapons plant {{and a number}} of scud launchers wielding <b>chemically</b> charged missiles, and evacuate local and American non-combatants and P.O.W.s.|$|E
5|$|A more area-selective {{method is}} {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a {{transmission electron microscope}} when it interacts with {{a portion of a}} sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can <b>chemically</b> identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed <b>chemically,</b> by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more <b>chemically</b> reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1920s, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt {{and later}} Linus Pauling {{developed}} rules for eliminating <b>chemically</b> unlikely structures and {{for determining the}} relative sizes of atoms. These rules led {{to the structure of}} brookite (1928) and an understanding of the relative stability of the rutile, brookite and anatase forms of titanium dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Although {{unpalatable}} when consumed raw, when boiled {{the leaves}} of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be potentially harmful to humans, and as of 1993 {{it had not been}} fully analyzed <b>chemically</b> to assess the wider impact it could have on health.|$|E
5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to <b>chemically</b> active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is <b>chemically</b> inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|As cubic {{boron nitride}} {{consists}} of light atoms {{and is very}} robust <b>chemically</b> and mechanically, {{it is one of}} the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is <b>chemically</b> not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more <b>chemically</b> similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Bladderpod oil, pressed {{from the}} seeds of Physaria fendleri, native to North America. Rich in lesquerolic acid, which is <b>chemically</b> similar to the ricinoleic acid found in castor oil. Many {{industrial}} uses. Possible substitute for castor oil as it requires much less moisture than castor beans.|$|E
5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} moist air forms a {{protective}} layer of varying composition. Lead carbonate {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively <b>chemically</b> inert in the air. Finely powdered lead, as with many metals, is pyrophoric, and burns with a bluish-white flame.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion {{does not appear to have}} significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. <b>Chemically,</b> bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. <b>Chemically,</b> their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E
5|$|Cestodes have no mouths or guts, and the syncitial skin absorbs {{nutrients}} – mainly {{carbohydrates and}} amino acids – from the host, and also disguises it <b>chemically</b> to avoid attacks by the host's immune system. Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts {{the growth of}} the parasites and kills some. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to their size.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chemically,</b> {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt {{is found in}} the Earth's crust only in <b>chemically</b> combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.|$|E
5|$|Curium was <b>chemically</b> {{identified}} at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) at the University of Chicago. It was {{the third}} transuranium element to be discovered {{even though it is}} the fourth in the series – the lighter element americium was unknown at the time.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae {{produces}} {{a series of}} diterpenoid chemical compounds known as cyathins, which have antibiotic properties against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The capacity to produce cyathins—similar to C.striatus and C.africanus—is limited to haploid strains. The basic chemical structure of the cyathins, known as the cyathane skeleton, is <b>chemically</b> unique and has been investigated using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR); molecules with this structure have also been created synthetically.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are <b>chemically</b> modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be <b>chemically</b> compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} table {{are a series of}} linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. <b>Chemically,</b> the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, s block metals but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals. Lutetium and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves <b>chemically</b> as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are <b>chemically</b> capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13. The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.|$|E
5|$|Gem-quality {{diamonds}} {{grown in}} a lab can be <b>chemically,</b> physically and optically identical to naturally occurring ones. The mined diamond industry has undertaken legal, marketing and distribution countermeasures to protect its market from the emerging presence of synthetic diamonds. Synthetic diamonds can be distinguished by spectroscopy in the infrared, ultraviolet, or X-ray wavelengths. The DiamondView tester from De Beers uses UV fluorescence to detect trace impurities of nitrogen, nickel or other metals in HPHT or CVD diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolGe and atomic number32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, <b>chemically</b> similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic <b>chemically</b> reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E
