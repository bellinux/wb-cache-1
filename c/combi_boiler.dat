50|$|Heating at {{this time}} was by means of {{coal-fired}} stoves. In large houses these would {{be placed in a}} basement, allowing thermosiphon circulation throughout the house. Nearly a century after Fowler, British practice for typical small houses in the post-World War I period developed the back boiler, where a living room fireplace would also have a simple tank boiler built into it. Large diameter pipes from this boiler circulated through a coil heat exchanger in an indirect hot water storage cylinder upstairs. This hot water supplied both bathroom, increasingly fitted upstairs in houses of this period, and the kitchen or scullery downstairs. The height difference between boiler and storage allowed thermosiphon circulation in this simple large bore primary circuit. By the 1960s, the space heating circulation system was assisted by an electric pump. Switching from coal heating to gas boilers also drove a switch to reliable pumped circulation in the 1970s. With the disappearance of stored hot water in favour of the <b>combi</b> <b>boiler,</b> from the 1980s onwards, the thermosiphon disappeared from British plumbing.|$|E

The dimensions of a commercially available heat exchanger of a <b>combi</b> <b>boiler</b> apparatus are taken as basic dimensions and various parameters about plate fin and three different protrusions, namely balcony, winglet and imprint, are examined step by step. The study is realized within the geometrical dimension range used in actual applications. The numerical analyses of several heat exchangers are performed using Fluent CFD software. The boundary conditions used in the numerical investigation are taken from the actual operating conditions of the <b>combi</b> <b>boiler</b> heater apparatus. Firstly, the best plate fin geometry is determined. Secondly, the best protrusion dimensions are obtained. Finally, the effects of three protrusion placement on plate fin surface are examined. The fin I 5 B 2 W 3 is determined as the best among the investigated fins. The use of actual operating conditions as boundary conditions and {{the investigation of the}} individual and cumulative effects of three different protrusions are the novelties of the study. In order to validate the numerical models, a comparison with a computational and experimental study performed by Wu and Tao is also made. The results of the models created for comparison purpose show good agreement with the results given by Wu and Tao. It is also observed that results obtained from the two alternatives for the modeling, one with symmetrical and the other with periodic boundary condition, are very close. According to these results, it is concluded that the numerical outcomes obtained in the present study are reliable...|$|E
40|$|High costs often {{prevent the}} market {{diffusion}} of novel and efficient energy technologies. Monitoring cost and price decline for these technologies is thus important {{in order to}} establish effective energy policy. Here, we present experience curves and cost-benefit analyses for condensing gas boilers produced and sold in the Netherlands between 1981 and 2006. For the most dominant boiler type on the Dutch market, i. e., condensing gas <b>combi</b> <b>boilers,</b> we identify learning rates of 14 ± 1 % for the average price and 16 ± 8 % for the additional price relative to non-condensing devices. Economies of scale, competitive sourcing of boiler components, and improvements in boiler assembly are among the main drivers behind the observed price decline. The net present value of condensing gas <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> shows an overall increasing trend. Purchasing in 2006 a gas boiler of this type instead of a non-condensing device generates a net present value of 970 EUR (Euro) and realizes CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emission savings at negative costs of − 120 EUR per tonne CO 2. We attribute two-thirds of the improvements in the cost-benefit performance of condensing gas <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> to technological learning and one-third to a combination of external effects and governmental policies...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Natural gas <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> {{are one of the}} most common branches of the household goods used for space and domestic hot water (DHW) heating. Although most of the <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> in the market have reached considerably high space heating efficiency values via condensing technology, there is still a huge demand on increasing their DHW comfort level and efficiency. Broad definition of the comfort level in the <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> is the expectation of an end-user to have hot water in a very short time and without fluctuations. DHW expectancy differs from market to market, therefore resulting in wide product diversity and a challenging competition between the manufacturers. The present study has mainly focused on the investigation of one of the parameters which are particularly effective on the DHW comfort level. As the first step, 1 D mathematical model is constructed for DHW function with the transient energy equations of the concerning components. The differential energy equations of the model are discretized implicitly with Finite Difference Scheme in order to solve them numerically in Matlab. Boundary and initial conditions are defined as closely as possible to the exact working conditions. Thermodynamic properties of the flue gas mixture and water are obtained via open source software Cantera [1]. Then, the numerical results are compared with the experimental data to validate the model. After obtaining a model for basic applications and rough results to estimate the behavior of an appliance, one of the software parameters affecting the comfort level of the end-users, late ignition time is investigated numerically. cf 201...|$|R
50|$|Combination or <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> {{combine the}} central heating with {{domestic}} hot water (DHW) in one device. When DHW is used, a combination boiler stops pumping water to the heating circuit and diverts all the boiler's power to heating DHW. Some combis have small internal water storage vessels combining {{the energy of the}} stored water and the gas or oil burner to give faster DHW at the taps or to increase the DHW flow rate.|$|R

In this study, a solar heating system is designed and installed to a seperate house located at the Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University in Karaman, Turkey. Main components of the solar heating system is solar collectors and {{hot water storage tank}} which are connected each other through pipes. In addition, a natural gas-fired <b>combi</b> <b>boiler</b> is installed for meeting the heating demand in the periods when solar collectors can not cover the heating need.

40|$|The {{influence}} of plate fin, fin tube and protrusion parameters on heat transfer and pressure drop {{characteristics of a}} finned tube gas to liquid heat exchanger is examined in this study. The optimization of plate fin, fin tube and protrusion dimensions as well as protrusion locations on plate fin surface is performed numerically using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program named "Fluent". The dimensions of the plate fin of a commercially available <b>combi</b> <b>boiler</b> apparatus heat exchanger are taken as basic dimensions. As the first step, the best plate fin and fin tube geometry is determined. Secondly, the best dimensions for three different protrusions (balcony, winglet and imprint) and their most suitable locations on the plate fin surface are found. Finally, the cumulative effects of several combinations of these three protrusions on the plate fin surface are analyzed. The placement combinations of protrusions are decided according to the results obtained for the individual effect of each protrusion. The fin named as I 5 B 2 W 3 {{is found to be}} the most efficient fin among the investigated cases. A comparison with a numerical and computational study is also performed to validate the numerical results of the present study. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

Appliances that can supply both space-heating and domestic hot water are called combination (or <b>combi)</b> <b>boilers.</b> Though on-demand heaters provide a continuous supply of domestic hot water, {{the rate at which}} they can produce it is limited by the thermodynamics of heating water from the available fuel supplies.|$|R

While some  decisions are so simple; most of them require making analysis because of the interactions between the influencial on factors  the decision. In this manner, the concept of multi criteria decision making is emerged. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is one of the multi criteria decision making method. The ANP is a general form of AHP and expresses as network by identifying relations between parts and directions. In this study, ithas been emphasized on the ANP method which is a multi criteria decion making and on the selection prolem of <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> developed for burning natural gas and also becoming common day by day in Denizli where the natural gas was introduced in 206.

40|$|In {{the context}} of energy use and {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, the manufacturing industry plays a dual role, namely (i) as consumer of energy and (ii) as producer of energy-consuming technologies. Although the manufacturing industry has been subject to extensive research, knowledge gaps still exist regarding (i) a detailed and accurate accounting {{of the use of}} fossil fuels for non-energy purposes (e. g., as feedstock in the chemical industry) and the resulting emissions as well as (ii) with respect to the rate at which cost decline occurs for novel and efficient energy demand technologies. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we develop bottom-up models that quantify non-energy use of fossil fuels and related emissions at various levels of detail. We quantify in Chapter 2 worldwide non-energy use in the year 2000 to be 20 2 EJ, thereby accounting for 5 % of the global total primary energy supply. In Chapter 3, we estimate that in the year 2000, non-energy use leads on a global scale to emissions of 700 90 Mt CO 2. The forty industrialized Annex I countries account for 51 % (360 50 Mt CO 2) of this total, where as the remaining non-Annex I countries account for 49 % (340 70 Mt CO 2). Chapter 4 shows that yearly non-energy use emissions in Germany increased on average by 1. 8 % per year between 1990 and 2003. Our non-energy use emission estimates help closing major gaps in the German GHG inventory. We conclude that our bottom-up models allow a more detailed, complete, and accurate accounting of non-energy use emissions in comparison to existing methodologies. To address the second research question, we apply the experience curve approach to model prices (as proxy for actual production costs) of energy demand technologies as power-law function of cumulative production. We quantify the change in productions costs by so-called learning rates (LR), which represent the percentage of cost decline with each doubling of cumulative production. In Chapter 5, we estimate that prices of condensing gas <b>combi</b> <b>boilers</b> decline at a learning rate of 14 1 %. For large appliances, we find in Chapter 6 a robust long-term price decline for wet and cold appliances at learning rates of, on average, 29 8 % and 9 4 %, respectively. These results are in line with the findings of our literature review (Chapter 7), where we identify that learning rates of energy demand technologies are approximately normally distributed around a mean of 18 9 %. By modelling the specific energy consumption of large appliances as function of cumulative production, we extend the conventional experience curve approach and quantify technological learning from a broader perspective. The resulting energy experience curves indicate a robust decline in the specific energy consumption of wet appliances (LR of 18 3 % to 35 3 %) and cold appliances (LR of 13 3 % to 17 2 %). We conclude that our results indicate that technological learning helps to achieve a more efficient use of energy at declining costs...|$|R
