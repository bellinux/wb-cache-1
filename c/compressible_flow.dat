25|$|<b>Compressible</b> <b>flow</b> {{accounts}} for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density {{is assumed to}} be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.|$|E
50|$|The {{variation}} of fluid density for <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> requires attention to density and other fluid property relationships. The fluid equation of state, often unimportant for incompressible flows, is vital {{in the analysis}} of <b>compressible</b> <b>flows.</b> Also, temperature variations for <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> are usually significant and thus the energy equation is important. Curious phenomena can occur with <b>compressible</b> <b>flows.</b>|$|R

However, {{in many situations}} the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an incompressible flow. Otherwise the more general <b>compressible</b> <b>flow</b> equations must be used.|$|E

First, by comparing the magnitudes of different forces in the <b>compressible</b> gas <b>flow,</b> we obtain proper estimations for the Reynolds and Mach numbers at the outlets. Second, based on these estimations, we obtain asymptotic analytical solutions of velocities, pressure and temperature distributions of <b>compressible</b> gas <b>flow</b> inside the microchannels and microtubes with a relaxation of the isothermal assumption, which was previously used in many studies. Numerical simulations of <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> through a microchannel and a microtube are performed by solving the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, with velocity slip and temperature jump wall boundary conditions.

40|$|Work {{was carried}} out to {{formulate}} near-wall models for the equations governing the transport of the temperature-variance and its dissipation rate. With these equations properly modeled, a foundation is laid for their extension together with the heat-flux equations to <b>compressible</b> <b>flows.</b> This extension is carried out {{in a manner similar}} to that used to extend the incompressible near-wall Reynolds-stress models to <b>compressible</b> <b>flows.</b> The methodology used to accomplish the extension of the near-wall Reynolds-stress models is examined and the actual extension of the models for the Reynolds-stress equations and the near-wall dissipation-rate equation to <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> is given. Then the formulation of the near-wall models for the equations governing the transport of the temperature variance and its dissipation rate is discussed. Finally, a sample calculation of a flat plate <b>compressible</b> turbulent boundary-layer <b>flow</b> with adiabatic wall boundary condition and a free-stream Mach number of 2. 5 using a two-equation near-wall closure is presented. The results show that the near-wall two-equation closure formulated for <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> is quite valid and the calculated properties are in good agreement with measurements.

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} hot wire anemometry for <b>compressible</b> <b>flows,</b> giving {{particular attention to the}} transonic flow problem. It is pointed out that the first and most important definitive work in hot wire anemometry for <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> was reported by Kovasznay (1953). The existence of three independent fluctuating modes in <b>compressible</b> <b>flows</b> for small perturbations was found, taking into account the vorticity mode, the entropy mode, and the sound-wave mode.

However, there are considerable data, much taken in the 1950 's, which indicate that under some conditions the velocity and density sensitivities are not equal in subsonic <b>compressible</b> <b>flows.</b> Therefore, possible fluctuation diagrams are described for the cases where the velocity and density sensitivities are equal and the more general cases where they are unequal...|$|R
