5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Belaur, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in Vidin, {{probably}} {{in support of his}} deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's claim to the throne. The advance of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Andronikos III at Rusokastro.|$|E
5|$|In January 1915 Maunsell {{received}} {{authority to}} build six examples, but, {{as with the}} Nclass, production was delayed due {{to the use of}} the Ashford works for wartime armaments manufacture.

Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the maintenance backlog caused by the war.|$|E

5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they were}} exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting.

Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Led Zeppelin {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E
5|$|City's season {{opened with}} a 0–0 draw at home to Liverpool. City were awarded a penalty, but new captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats followed, at Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played wide on the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the league leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E

5|$|During his spell in Sauber, in the 1991 Sportscar World Championship, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a serious incident with Derek Warwick in that year's 430 km of Nürburgring.

He eventually <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Schumacher, and it took intervention from Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E

Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the archduke, he and his 10,000men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing.
