5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital <b>captions)</b> to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed <b>captions</b> when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video <b>captions</b> are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the <b>captions</b> for greater accuracy.|$|E

By 1993, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission requires that all newly manufactured televisions have the decoding chip.|$|R

5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script. The {{calligraphy}} {{is similar to that}} of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains <b>captions</b> in hieroglyphic.|$|E
5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are minutely detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions.

5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the <b>captions</b> which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though a few are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{sources say}} that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and acupuncture. The first {{mentioning}} of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the Huangdi neijing. Acupuncture needles made of gold {{were found in the}} tomb of the Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE). Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of calisthenics. In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and <b>captions.</b> Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and qigong are derived from Han-era calisthenics.|$|E
5|$|The What If? book {{contains}} {{a selection of}} questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small <b>captions</b> underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added footnotes to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being lowered into a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E

The writer, Hester Hyman, had written the letter to explain why she had decided to {{sacrifice}} her life for the cause of democracy.

5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written <b>captions</b> underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the <b>captions</b> to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E

5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! {{calendars}} {{have been released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional <b>captions,</b> {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for {{at the time he}} was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the <b>captions</b> written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E
5|$|Os Delfins is a {{professional}} lifeguard service and school which patrols the beaches of Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde, it currently has activities elsewhere in Northern Portugal. This Póvoa-based association uses the dolphin as mascot and in naming. The lifeguards can be identified in the beaches by their yellow t-shirts with red <b>captions.</b> Póvoa {{is one of the}} twelve national sea borders controlled by the Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF) and it as an ISN Lifeboat recue station. The Póvoa de Varzim Maritime Police patrols Póvoa de Varzim seafront, including the seaport, beaches and maritime waters under the national sovereignty and jurisdiction. It often acts against illegal fisheries, unruly harvest of shellfish, and smuggling. The Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde Maritime Police Picket are headquartered in Largo Dr. Vasques Calafate, sharing resources with the Captaincy of the Port of Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E
