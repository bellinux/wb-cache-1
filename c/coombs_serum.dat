40|$|More than {{a decade}} ago it was {{recognized}} that ACTH and cortisone ameliorate some hemolytic anemias in man (1 - 6). Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for their therapeutic effect have not been elucidated. It is generally believed that cortisone and its analogues benefit only those hemolytic anemias in which the red cells can be agglutinated by Coombs (antiglobulin) serum. Indeed, of the many published case reports (7, 8) there is but one well documented study (9) indicating that cortisone administration may benefit a "Coombs-negative " hemolytic disease, hereditary spherocytosis. Agglutination of red cells by <b>Coombs</b> <b>serum</b> indicates the presence of protein, usually a globulin, attached to the cell surface. Although it has been demonstrated that red cells may be agglutinable in <b>Coombs</b> <b>serum</b> {{as a result of the}} non-immunologic adherence of protein (10 [...] 13), it is probable that the globulins attached to red cells in most cases of "Coombs-positive " hemolytic anemia are specific antibodies directed against either exogenous haptens such as drugs (14, 15) or endogenous stromal antigens (16 - 19). This adherence of antibody t...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of a feline <b>Coombs</b> <b>serum</b> (rabbit antifeline gamma globulin) is described. The direct antiglobulin test using this serum {{was performed on}} 20 anemic and 20 healthy control cats. Red cell membrane antibodies were detected in cats with feline leukemia virus infection and in others with inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. A low titre of cold agglutinating antibody was present in {{a high proportion of}} the control cats. Positive direct antiglobulin tests were noted in cats without overt hemolytic disease. It was concluded that the direct antiglobulin test in anemic cats has certain diagnostic limitations. A positive reaction should be interpreted cautiously especially when there is no clinical or laboratory evidence to support a diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Pancytopenia is {{a common}} problem in {{clinical}} practice. Pancytopenia is defined as haemoglobin less than 9 gm/dL, total leucocyte count less than 4, 000 /dL and platelet count less than 1 lakhs/dL. Causes of pancytopenia vary from nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow failure status and malignancies. Pancytopenia {{is a common}} problem in geriatric population also. In this study, we try to find common causes of pancytopenia in geriatric population in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS 40 consecutive patients who are more than 60 years of age attending General Medicine Outpatient Department {{were included in the}} study. Pancytopenia due to acute infections like viral fever and sepsis were excluded. Patients suspected to be having malignancies like lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly were also excluded. These patients were subjected to detailed history taking and clinical examination. Routine investigations like complete blood count, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, <b>Coombs</b> test, <b>serum</b> cobalamin levels, renal function tests and liver function tests were done. Bone marrow examination was done in cases where indicated. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and anti-intrinsic factor antibody and antiparietal cell antibody were done where indicated. RESULTS Out of 40 patients included in the study, 25 were males and 15 were females. 28 patients were aged between 60 - 70 years, 10 patients between 70 - 80 years and 2 were more than 80 years old. Mean age of the patients was 68 years. Fatigue was the most common symptom (70...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the etiology in neonates admitted with prolonged jaundice. Materials and Method: Neonates with prolonged jaundice were included to this prospective study designed between January 2007 and December 2007. Prolonged jaundice was defined as total bilirubin level > 5 mg/dL in newborns older than 14 days of age. After detailed history and physical examination, blood tests including blood groups of baby and mother, total, direct and indirect bilirubin, complete blood count (CBC), blood smear, reticulocyte count, <b>Coombs</b> test, <b>serum</b> aspartat transaminase (AST) level, serum alanin transaminase (ALT) level, viral markers, thyroid function tests, and glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 PD) level and routine urine analysis with urine culture were performed in all newborns. Results: A total of 154 neonates were enrolled to the study. The most frequent cause of prolonged jaundice was breast milk jaundice (53 %). It was followed by urinary tract infections and clinical sepsis (29 %), hemolytic causes due to blood group incompetency (10 %) and congenital hypothyroidism (8 %). However,there were no significant differences between etiology and mean bilirubin levels. Conclusion: It is important to determine the etiology and to plan therapy according to etiology is important in newborns with prolonged jaundice. Breast milk jaundice, urinary tract infection and sepsis, hypothyroidism and hemolytic causes must be considered as the main etiology in newborns with prolonged jaundice.
