30|$|Integration of {{kindergarten}} and childcare facility service. To integrate service functions {{of kindergarten}}s and <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities,</b> <b>service</b> {{operation of the}} {{two different types of}} institutions must be coordinated and eventually identical. Kindergartens, which mostly provide half-day programs, are to be gradually expanded into full-day programs to become available for working mothers. Also, service days at kindergartens, which are currently set at 180 days per year, should be increased in order for children of working mothers to access the services all year.|$|E

40|$|Accessibility to <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> and {{reconciliation}} {{of work and}} family life, gender differences in employment in Lithuania are analysed in this article. The article discusses accessibility to <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> in Lithuania, policy issues, describes availability of <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities,</b> women and men participation rates in labour market in Lithuania. Over the last decades, childcare services have become an important matter of public concern. Affordable and good quality <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> may improve the reconciliation of work and family roles and foster labour market participation and gender equality. Despite existing mechanisms, family-friendly policies, successful integration of women with preteen children into labour market is limited by shortage of <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities,</b> issues relating to reconciliation of work and family roles, and poor fexible employment system...|$|R
40|$|Affordable and {{reliable}} transportation {{to work is}} a critical requirement for successful employment outcomes of low-wage workers. Employment Transportation services are specially funded services to transport low-income individuals to employment locations and other destinations that support work, such as job-training centers and <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities.</b> ET <b>services</b> have been funded {{by a variety of}} sources including the Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) program administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U. S. Department of Transportation, with match from other sources. ET services in a region are developed by means of Coordinated Human Services Transportation Plan (CHSTP), a planning mechanism to identify the transportation needs of mobility-disadvantaged individuals, including low-wage workers, seniors, persons with disabilities, and other disadvantaged groups, in coordination with public, private and non-profit organizations involved in their well-being. The objective of this report is to examine the role of workforce development agencies in the CHSTP process and to present findings regarding the labor market and mobility outcomes of low-wage workers who use ET services to access jobs and job training sites. The analysis is based on primary data collected from surveys of lead organizations responsible for developing the CHSTP and partner organizations (including workforce development agencies), in 24 urban, small urban and rural areas located in 10 federal regions. Representatives of these organizations provided insights regarding their activities relating to plan and project development. Program managers and users of a total of 26 transit-based ET services operating in these areas were also surveyed, providing insights into the nature of service operations and labor market and transportation outcomes experienced...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{shortage}} of <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> to accommodate at least 23,000 Japanese children who are in waiting lists. In light of this deficit, Prime Minister Abe’s Womenomics plan included a goal of zero children in waiting lists. This will be done by a combination of renting <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities,</b> subsidizing <b>childcare</b> businesses, supporting new childcare providers to attain registration, and hiring new childcare workers. The goal set for this aspect of the policy is to provide <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> for 400,000 children by 2017.|$|R

30|$|In Korea, {{where most}} of the <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> are under private management, the Government {{encourages}} <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> to voluntarily participate in the accreditation process and grants an accreditation certificate. An individual childcare center applies for quality accreditation on a voluntary basis, and conducts a self-evaluation of five to seven categories, consisting of 60 to 80 items selected by the Government, followed by the reporting of the results. Trained experts then visit the center and conduct an assessment. Through expert consultation on the self-evaluation and the on-the-spot assessment, a final decision is made whether the center will be accredited or not. Since its initiation as a trial operation in 2005, 3, 300 <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> have been accredited, as of August 2007. Taking into account the total number of 29, 000 facilities throughout Korea, the number of accredited <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> is relatively small, but it is expected that this figure will increase.|$|R
30|$|The policy {{aimed at}} {{enhancing}} access to childcare services aims primarily at increasing the actual supply of childcare. In particular, {{it aims to}} establish childcare centers near the child’s area of residence at appropriate levels. Korea implemented an intensive policy to expand <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> over the three years from 1995 to 1997. During this period, {{a great number of}} private run centers were established, resulting in the current sufficiency of <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities.</b> However, there exist additional demands on such centers according to regions, and, in particular, there is additional demand on care for infants below the age of 3 years 8. Therefore, at this point in time, the most urgent policy requirement is to expand public <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> which are preferred by parents in terms of service quality and cost. Currently, about 75 percent out of all children using <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities</b> and kindergartens attend private institutions.|$|R

Non-ECC controls were recruited from the same <b>childcare</b> <b>facilities.</b> A multinomial logistic modelling approach was used for statistical analysis.
