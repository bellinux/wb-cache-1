40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Glimek AB, {{a company that has}} chosen to decentralize its <b>central</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> in order to increase production efficiencies. The {{purpose of the study was}} to identify the problems in the production cycle that lead to the decision to decentralize the <b>central</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> as well as identifying what the decentralization entails. The effects of the decentralization have not been analyzed in the study, and consequently neither financial nor production disadvantages have been considered. Appropriate questions were formulated based on the chosen underlying theories, and were asked to selected individuals with relevant knowledge. The study is based on the information that was gathered from interviews with management as well as staff within the company. In addition, supporting information such as flowcharts, drawings, orders and decision support documents were supplied by the company. The {{study was conducted}} in close cooperation with the employees of the company. The bases from which the conclusions were derived are the information gathered from the interviews and the authors’ documentation efforts. The assessment concludes that the problems that arose in the production cycle were the results of insufficient supply of input material. These shortcomings arose from several different underlying factors, such as degree of work in the <b>central</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> and relocation of material. Previously existing problems within the production cycle could not be resolved with the implementation of a JIT-methodology. The decentralization of the <b>central</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> implied that all specific material would be present at each manufacturing plant. The decentralization also resulted in the fact that the manufacturing personnel would get the main responsibility for selecting and reserving input material from the computer system. The study also showed that no one among the production staff had been assigned the ultimate management responsibility for this process...|$|R

30|$|Statistical {{learning}} for big data analysis: There {{is no doubt}} this is an era of data deluge where learning from these large volumes of data by <b>central</b> processors and <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> seems infeasible. Therefore, the SP and statistical learning tools have to be re-examined. It is preferable to perform learning in real time for the advent of streaming data sources, typically without a chance to revisit past entries. In [14], the authors mainly focused on the modeling and optimization for big data analysis by using statistical learning tools. We can conclude from [14] that, from the SP and learning perspective, big data themes in terms of tasks, challenges, models, and optimization can be revealed as follows. SP-relevant big data tasks mainly comprise massive scale, outliers and missing values, real-time constraints, and cloud storage. There are great big data challenges we have to face, such as prediction and forecasting, cleansing and imputation, dimensionality reduction, regression, classification, and clustering. In terms of these tasks and challenges, outstanding models and optimization with the SP and learning techniques for big data include parallel and decentralized, time or data adaptive, robust, succinct, and sparse technologies.|$|R

The focus {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that the arbitrage value can be highly sensitive with respect to the dimensioning of an electricity <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> A simulation model is explored to calculate the arbitrage value of different <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> by finding the optimal hourly operating strategy during one-year period. The results of simulation show that optimizing the dimensioning of a <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> is as important as choosing the fittest technology. Furthermore we provide evidence that the optimal set-up of a <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> can adapt to exogenous factors such as grid tariff and local electricity price characteristics.

40|$|In {{order to}} more {{economically}} use energy in industrial processes, <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> {{can be integrated}} into processes. Latent heat <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> enable an isothermal energy storage and release, which is applicable in two-phase industrial processes. This concept has been demonstrated in low-temperature applications such as heating and refrigeration; however experience in the high temperature range is limited. Cost effective implementation of <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> demands cost effective designs of the <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> Due to the usually low thermal conductivity in the phase change materials, a fin design has been developed to counter this deficiency. However, a balance has to be found between the added fin materials and their costs {{and the increase in}} heat transfer. To more effectively design <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> for high temperature applications, the rate of heat transfer in the storage material has to be better quantified and a layout tool can be created. In this paper, the first results of a design of experiments parametric study of the fin and tube spacing in a latent heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Electric <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> {{constitute}} {{a key element}} in the emerging smart grid system. In this paper, the interactions and energy trading decisions of a number of geographically distributed <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> are studied using a novel framework based on game theory. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> such as PHEVs, or an array of batteries that are trading their stored energy. Here, each <b>storage</b> <b>unit's</b> owner can decide on the maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the revenues from energy trading and the accompanying costs. Then in this energy exchange market between the <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> and the smart grid elements, the price at which energy is traded is determined via an auction mechanism. The game is shown to admit at least one Nash equilibrium and a novel proposed algorithm that is guaranteed to reach such an equilibrium point is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant performance improvements, in terms of the average utility per <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> reaching up to 130. 2 % compared to a conventional greedy approach.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate heat storage in a heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM heat storage model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the heat <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> heated from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> heated from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall heat storage model was developed to combine heat supply, heat storage and heat distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> and the heat transfer rate to the surroundings. The heat supplied to the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was based on calculations of batch combustion of wood. The results showed that none of the tests for the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> or the optimization of the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> reached the requirements of heat transfer to the surroundings set for the model. The length of the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was also proved to be excessive...|$|R
