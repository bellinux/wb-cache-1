Burundi’s social indicators {{reflect the}} effects of poverty compounded by decades of violence. The government’s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) is based on broad consultations, but limited in some provinces by security conditions.

We quantify the relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1920 - 1939, focusing on the defaults on official (government to government) debt in advanced economies after World War I; and 1978 - 2010, focusing on emerging market debt crises with private external <b>creditors.</b> Debt <b>relief</b> was substantial in both eras, averaging 21 % of GDP in the 1930 s and 16 % of GDP in recent decades. We then analyze the aftermath of debt relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war debt defaults of 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980 s/ 1990 s.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to quantify the relationship between the global economic environment and the number of Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs). The results suggest that oil prices, world interest rates, and the global business cycle are the most influential indicators that affect the number of SBAs being requested. In addition, the empirical model seems to have reasonable accuracy when predicting SBAs. Furthermore, when oil prices, interest rates, and the global business cycle are adversely shocked by one standard deviation, the conditional probability of a SBA nearly doubles, implying an increase from about six to 12 SBAs. More critically, the model suggests that even a steady deterioration of the global economic climate would imply increasingly harsher conditions for developing and emerging market countries which may in turn significantly increase the demand for IMF resources.

40|$|In recent years, {{debt relief}} {{has once again}} been pushed to the {{forefront}} of political and economic interest. The general consensus is that with less debt burden poor countries suffering from debt overhang will be able devote more resources towards investment thereby promoting their own growth and thus benefit their creditors in the long run. An open question is which mechanism is best to relieve debt burden. In this paper, we adopt experimental methods to study the effectiveness and efficiency of debt forgiveness and debt buyback. We find that creditors tend to reduce more debt under Forgiveness than Buyback. Debtors under Forgiveness are not significantly more reciprocal than under Buyback. After controlling for the amount of debt <b>relief,</b> <b>creditors</b> are significantly worse off under Forgiveness whereas debtors are indifferent between the two schemes. From the viewpoint of promoting debt relief, debt forgiveness appears to be a more effective tool to achieve this goal.

40|$|Following {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union in 1992, several low-income {{countries}} in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) accumulated substantial external debt in a short time span, about half of which is owed to multilateral financial institutions. Three factors contributed to the current debt burden. First, the initial years of transition brought large systemic economic disruptions, loss of transfers from the center and collapse of trade relations among Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries, and negative terms of trade shocks. Second, fiscal and other reforms, and consequently, growth revival, took longer than expected. Third, overoptimism by multilaterals contributed to the high debt levels. If external financial assistance, which was needed because of high social costs of the transition, had {{come in the form of}} grants in the first two or three years of the transition, the debt burden would have been lower and sustainable.

40|$|A {{large share}} of the debt claims owed by the world’s poorest {{countries}} has been cancelled through the HIPC (highly indebted poor countries) debt relief initiative. It is believed that, with less debt burden, the HIPC {{will be able to}} devote more resources to investment and thus promote their own growth and benefit their creditors in the long run. But does debt forgiveness really provide the best incentive for those countries who suffers from debt overhang? In this paper, we adopt experimental methods to study the impact of two different schemes for relieving debt. The two schemes we consider here are debt forgiveness and debt buyback, with the latter being more market-based since it allows indebted countries to repurchase their own debt on the secondary market at a discount. We find that creditors tend to reduce more debt when the relief takes the form of debt forgiveness than that of buyback. Debtors under the scheme of forgiveness are not significantly more reciprocal than those of buyback.

Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of a small open economy with a minimum consumption requirement and an endogenous relief probability, we show that excessive debt accumulation is consistent with an anticipation of a future debt relief. Simulations of the calibrated model using 1982 - 2006 Ugandan data suggest that debt-relief episodes {{are likely to have}} only a temporary impact on the level of debt in low-income countries, while being associated with more consumption and less invesment.

40|$|Do Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) {{suffer from}} a debt overhang? Is debt relief going to improve their growth rates? To answer these {{important}} questions, we {{look at how the}} debt-growth relationship varies with indebtedness levels and other country characteristics in a panel of developing countries. Our findings suggest that there is a negative marginal relationship between debt and growth at intermediate levels of debt, but not at very low debt levels, below the “debt overhang” threshold, or at very high levels, above the “debt irrelevance” threshold. Countries with good policies and institutions face overhang when debt rises above 15 - 30 percent of GDP, but the marginal effect of debt on growth becomes irrelevant above 70 - 80 percent. In countries with bad policies and institutions, overhang and irrelevance thresholds seem to be lower, but we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} debt does not matter at all.

The {{staff of the}} IMF and IDA considers that Guyana’s performance {{with respect to the}} conditions for reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative has been satisfactory. The authorities were able to establish a track record of satisfactory policy implementation under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) -supported program, evidenced by the completion of the first program review in early September and good progress toward meeting the conditions of the second review due in February 2004.

40|$|The Fourth Review Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Requests for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criteria for Rwanda are analyzed. The {{implementation}} of policies improved considerably in 2004, although economic performance has been adversely affected by exogenous shocks. Strong activity in construction, transport, and communication raised growth to 4 percent, despite major electricity shortages. Macroeconomic and structural policies will aim at enhancing private sector development and accelerating productivity-enhancing strategies. Fiscal policies will focus on supporting macroeconomic stability and {{improving the quality of}} spending through a sizable reallocation to priority areas.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Congo’s 2004 Article IV Consultation and New Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). In {{the context}} of improved security, the pace of economic activity in the non-oil sector has increased. Non-oil real GDP increased by about 10 percent per year on average during 2000 – 03. Consumer price inflation decelerated significantly in the postwar period. The fiscal position in 2003 improved from the exceptionally poor performance of 2002, but the underlying fiscal effort was weak relative to the 2003 budget.
