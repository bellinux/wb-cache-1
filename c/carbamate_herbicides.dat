40|$|General Production Information NY {{produces}} 2700 {{acres of}} beets annually, virtually all for processing. Root rot, pocket rot, damping-off and seed rots, caused by Rhizoctonia, Pythium, Phoma and other fungi, are serious diseases of beets. Control of annual and perennial weeds is another significant pest management challenge. Insect damage to beets {{is not usually}} an economic problem. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of thiram, captan, and mefenoxam (all as seed treatments); cycloate and pyrazon preplant herbicides; and the postemergence <b>carbamate</b> <b>herbicides</b> phenmedipham and desmedipham would have significant impacts on production and profitability...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{described}} for the simultaneous determination of residues of 2 <b>carbamate</b> <b>herbicides</b> (phenmedipham and desmedipham) and related metabolites (m-aminophenol, aniline, and m-toluidine) in soil. The analytes are extracted from spiked soils with methanol. The solvent/soil suspension is centrifuged, and the supernatant is directly injected, without any further cleanup, into a reversed-phase liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry apparatus {{equipped with a}} TurbolonSpray interface. The method was tested on 5 soils having different physicochemical properties. Recoveries from the soil types, spiked over the range of 50 - 200 ppb, were essentially quantitative for each analyte.

40|$|An excess {{incidence}} of brain cancer in male farmers {{has been noted}} in several studies, but few {{studies have focused on}} women. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Upper Midwest Health Study evaluated effects of rural exposures for 341 female glioma cases and 528 controls, all adult (18 – 80 years of age) nonmetropolitan residents of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. On average, controls lived longer on farms than did cases. After adjusting for age, age group, education, and farm residence, no association with glioma was observed for exposure to arsenicals, benzoic acids, carbamates, chloroacetanilides, dinitroanilines, inorganics, organochlorines, organophosphates, phenoxys, triazines, or urea-based or estrogenic pesticides. An increased risk of glioma was observed for <b>carbamate</b> <b>herbicides</b> but was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 9 – 9. 5). No association was observed between glioma and exposure to 12 widely used specific pesticides, after adjustment for age, age group, education, and any other pesticide exposure. These results were not affected after exclusion of proxy respondents (43 % of cases, 2 % of controls). Women were less likely than men to have applied pesticides, but more likely to have laundered pesticide-contaminated clothes. Storing pesticides in the house was associated with a statistically non-significan...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for propolis {{has caused a}} raise in its production. However, an increasingly pesticide-dependent agriculture is a great concern with regard to bees, their produce and environmental contamination. Current analysis evaluates the presence of pesticides (organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, <b>carbamates,</b> <b>herbicides,</b> fungicides and acaricides) in samples of propolis {{from the state of}} São Paulo, Brazil. Beekeepers from several localities in the state provided samples of propolis (50), which were collected, stored in non-toxic plastic bags and maintained in a freezer for analyses. Possible pesticide residues were examined by gas chromatography method but no pesticide residues were detected in the examined propolis samples.

40|$|In this study, {{about fifty}} otters from the basin of the Loire River (France) were {{analyzed}} {{in the context}} of a toxicological study funded by the Plan Loire Grandeur Nature. Individuals were recovered non-invasively, using a network of collection of otters killed by traffic collisions with vehicles. The chemical elements analyzed were the organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, <b>carbamates,</b> pyrethroids, <b>herbicides,</b> anticoagulants, PCBs and metals. Detectable levels of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs characterized all otters analyzed, with mean values reaching 2 - 15 mg kg- 1, respectively. Concentrations of other analyzed pesticides remained very low. For metals, contamination of otters was systematic for lead and mercury, the latter being relatively abundant in tissues of several individuals. A significant trend to increasing concentrations of pesticides and PCBs by going towards the downstream parts of basins was shown. The inter-individual variations in concentrations were marked. Global values of contamination were below the toxicological threshold defined for the conservation of the species, and the current dynamics of populations within the basin of the Loire seems to confirm this. However, the potential effects of mixtures of compounds remain poorly studied...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{diagnosis}} and management of drug overdose and poisonings in a two-part presentation. Data sources: A review of articles reported on drug overdose and poisonings. Summary of review: In patients who attempt suicide it is usual for the overdose to be a therapeutic agent, although in the severely mentally disturbed patient the agent may be an unusual poison. As with any overdose, the most important aspects in the management is {{the maintenance of the}} patient’s airway, ventilation and circulation, while the toxin is metabolised and excreted. Adsorbents, gastric lavage and haemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy and specific antidotes may be beneficial in individual cases. The diagnosis and management of uncommon poisonings, including pesticides and herbicides (e. g. organophosphates, <b>carbamates,</b> paraquat, chlorophenoxy <b>herbicides),</b> carbon monoxide, cyanide, strychnine, halogenated hydrocarbons, elemental poisons (e. g. iron, arsenic, lead, mercury, selenium...|$|R
40|$|A dinitroaniline-resistant (R) biotype of Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertner. (goosegrass) is {{demonstrated}} to be cross-resistant to a structurally non-related herbicide, amiprophosmethyl, and supersensitive to two other classes of compounds which disrupt mitosis. These {{characteristics of the}} R biotype were discovered in a comparative test {{of the effects of}} 24 different antimitotic compounds on the R biotype and susceptible (S) wild-type Eleusine. The compounds tested could be classified into three groups based upon their effects on mitosis in root tips of the susceptible (S) biotype. Class I compounds induced effects like the well known mitotic disrupter colchicine: absence of cortical and spindle microtubules, mitosis arrested at prometaphase, and the formation of polymorphic nuclei after arrested mitosis. The R biotype was resistant to treatment with some class I inhibitors (all dinitroaniline herbicides and amiprophosmethyl) but not all (e. g. colchicine, podophyllotoxin, vinblastine, and pronamide). Roots of the R biotype, when treated with either dinitroaniline herbicides or amiprophosmethyl, exhibited no or only small increases in the mitotic index nor were the spindle and cortical microtubules affected. Compounds of class II (<b>carbamate</b> <b>herbicides</b> and griseofulvin) cause misorientation of microtubules which results in multinucleated cells. Compounds of class III (caffeine and structually related alkaloids) cause imcomplete cell walls to form at telophase. Each of these last two classes of compounds affected the R biotype more than the S biotype (supersensitivity). The cross-resistance and high levels of resistance of the R biotype of Eleusine to the dinitroaniline herbicides and the structurally distinct herbicide, amiprophosmethyl, indicate that a mechanism of resistance based upon metabolic modification, translocation, or compartmentation of the herbicides is probably not operative...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results from}} a systematic review {{and a series of}} meta-analyses of nearly three decades worth of epidemiologic research on the relationship between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and occupational exposure to agricultural pesticide active ingredients and chemical groups. Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported {{results from a}}nalyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy <b>herbicides,</b> <b>carbamate</b> insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing {{a large portion of the}} world’s agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, gas {{chromatography}} coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC–TOF MS) {{has been applied}} to evaluate organic pollution in a hyper-saline aquatic environment. Firstly, a target screening was made for a list of 150 GC-amenable organic micro-contaminants, including PAHs, octyl/nonyl phenols, PCBs, PBDEs, and a notable number of pesticides, such us insecticides (organochlorines, organophosphorus, <b>carbamates</b> and pyrethroids), <b>herbicides</b> (triazines and chloroacetanilides), fungicides and several transformation products. This methodology was applied to brine samples, with a salt content from 112 g/L to saturation, and to samples from Artemia populations (crustacean Anostraca) collected during 1 year from three sampling stations in saltworks bodies sited in the Ebro river delta. Around 50 target contaminants, belong to chemical families included in the list of priority substances within the framework on European water policy. Additionally, a non-target analysis was performed in both types of samples with the objective of investigating the presence of other non-selected organic compounds taking advantage of the potential of GC–TOF MS (high sensitivity in full-spectrum acquisition mode, accurate mass measurements) for searching unknowns. Organophosphorus pesticides were the contaminants more frequently detected in brine samples. Other compounds usually present in urban and industrial wastewaters, like caffeine, methylparaben, butylated-hydroxytoluene and N-butylbenzenesulfonamide were also detected in brines. The herbicide simazine and the insecticide chlorpyrifos were among the contaminants detected in Artemia samples. Results of this work reveal a potential threat to vulnerable populations inhabiting the hyper-saline ecosystem. The valuable contribution of GC–TOF MS in environmental analysis, allowing the rapid screening {{of a large number of}} organic contaminants, is also demonstrated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a multiclass {{screening}} method for organic contaminants in natural and wastewater {{has been developed}} and validated for qualitative purposes, i. e. to ensure the reliable and sensitive identification of compounds detected in samples at {{a certain level of}} concentration. The screening is based on the use of GC-TOF MS, and the sample procedure involves solid phase extraction with C 18 cartridges. Around 150 organic contaminants from different chemical families were investigated, including PAHs, octyl/nonyl phenols, PCBs, PBDEs and a notable number of pesticides, such as insecticides (organochlorines, organophosphorus, <b>carbamates</b> and pyrethroids), <b>herbicides</b> (triazines and chloroacetanilides), fungicides and several relevant metabolites. Surface water, ground water and effluent wastewater were spiked with all target analytes at three concentration levels (0. 02, 0. 1 and 1 μg/L). Influent wastewater and raw leachate from a municipal solid waste treatment plant were spiked at two levels (0. 1 and 1 μg/L). Up to five m/z ions were evaluated for every compound. The identification criterion was the presence of, at least, two m/z ions at the expected retention time, measured at their accurate mass, and the accomplishment of the Q/qi intensity ratio within specified tolerances. The vast majority of compounds investigated were correctly identified in the samples spiked at 1 μg/L. When analyte concentration was lowered down to 0. 1 μg/L the identification was more problematic, especially in complex-matrix samples like influent wastewater. On the contrary, many contaminants could be properly identified at the lowest level 0. 02 μg/L in cleaner matrices. The procedure was applied to the screening of water samples of different origin and matrix composition and allowed the detection of several target contaminants. A highly reliable identification could be carried out thanks to the sensitive full-spectrum acquisition at accurate mass, the high selectivity reached with the use of narrow-mass window extracted ion chromatograms, the low mass errors observed in the positive detections and the Q/q ratio accomplishment...|$|R
