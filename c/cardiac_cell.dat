Five of five animals re-tested in a follow-up control test (i.e. without treatment) had VF.

Previous studies of direct mixing of AFSC and neonatal rat ventricle myocytes indicated evidence of AFSC cardiogenesis. In this study, we examined human AFSC cardiogenic potential in indirect co-culture with human <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells</b> in conditions that eliminated the possibility of cell fusion. Human AFSC in contact with human <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells</b> showed expression of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in immunohistochemistry, and no evidence of cell fusion were found through fluorescent in situ hybridization. When indirectly co-cultured with <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells,</b> human AFSC in contact with <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells</b> across a thin porous membrane showed a statistically significant increase in cTnT expression compared to non-contact conditions but lacked upregulation of calcium modulating proteins and did not have functional or morphological characteristics of mature cardiomyocytes.

In order to achieve this aim we tested two different suicide gene-based systems and used lentivectors as means of transgene delivery into the genome of undifferentiated mESC. One transgenic enrichment approach {{was based on the}} use of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase 1 (HSV 1 -TK). An enrichment of ~ 20 fold was obtained and demonstrated using flow cytometry after targeting cardiac troponin T. Enriched <b>cells</b> showed retained <b>cardiac</b> phenotypes as shown via RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Spontaneous beating and reactivity to pharmacological stimulation was observed via confocal microscopy after fluo- 2 incubation. The second approach based on the suicide gene system composed by cytosine deaminase (CD) and the prodrug 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC). Cardiac enrichment monitored by flow cytometry after staining for cardiac Troponin T reached ~ 9 fold. Also in this case, enriched <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells</b> retained their <b>cardiac</b> phenotype.

50|$|A 2014 {{study of}} the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna, {{published}} in the journal Science, clarifying the mechanics by which PAH kill fish, found that the toxins from oil spills can cause irregular heartbeats leading to cardiac arrest. It found that PAHs block signaling pathways that allow potassium and calcium ions to flow in and out of <b>cardiac</b> <b>cell</b> membranes and sustain normal heart rates, and that even very low concentrations of crude oil can disrupt these signaling pathways, slowing fish heartbeats. The study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill.|$|E
50|$|Every <b>cardiac</b> <b>cell</b> {{is able to}} {{transmit}} impulses of excitation in every direction but will do so only once within a short time. Normally, the action potential impulse will spread through the heart quickly enough that each cell will respond only once. However, {{if there is some}} essential heterogeneity of refractory period or if conduction is abnormally slow in some areas (for example in heart damage) so the myocardial cells are unable to activate the fast sodium channel, part of the impulse will arrive late and potentially be treated as a new impulse. Depending on the timing, this can produce a sustained abnormal circuit rhythm.|$|E
50|$|There {{are roughly}} 10,000 {{clusters}} of ryanodine receptors {{within a single}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>cell,</b> with each cluster containing around 100 ryanodine receptors. During a single spontaneous spark, when Ca2+ is released from the SR, the Ca2+ begins to move around the cell, {{in the same way}} that the smell of perfume spreads across a room when sprayed (see diffusion for more details). As the RyRs in the heart are activated by Ca2+, the movement of the Ca2+ released during a spontaneous spark, can activate other neighbouring RyRs within the same cluster. However, there usually isn't enough Ca2+ present in a single spark to reach a neighbouring cluster of receptors. The calcium can, however, signal back to the DHPR causing it to close and preventing further influx of calcium. This is known as negative feedback.|$|E

50|$|Hypoxia provokes {{potassium}} efflux from <b>cardiac</b> muscles <b>cells</b> via {{the activation}} of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). Potassium efflux from <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells</b> decreases action potential duration {{and results in}} non-uniform repolerization of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cells.</b> The heterogeneous repolarization of the cardiac tissue permits reentry of action potentials into conducting pathways, which manifests as malignant arrhythmias in the heart. HMR 1883 is a cardioselective ATP-sensitive potassium channel antagonist that prevents the potassium efflux, hence corrects the non-uniform refractory period in the ischemic tissue. A uniform refractory period corrects the conductance problems in the heart and prevents the re-entry arrhythmias.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{the very}} effect that allows beta-antiarin to be a poison also gives it {{medicinal}} properties. It limits the sodium ion (Na+) concentration by blocking the Na+ pump, which then promotes calcium ions (Ca2+) {{to increase in}} concentration in the extracellular cardiac muscle domain, therein permitting the heart to contract. The mechanism through which sodium and calcium ions are exchanged, known as the sodium-calcium exchanger, allows for the exchange of ions to occur {{at a rate of}} 3:1 respectively. The <b>cardiac</b> <b>cell</b> exhibits a positive potential during ventricular systole, becomes depolarized, and permits calcium ions to rush in by the sodium-calcium exchanger. From here, the contraction occurs when the calcium ions leave and the cell re-polarizes. [...] If the dosage of cardiac glycoside (i.e. beta-antiarin) doubles, then the substance becomes a poison.|$|E

Existing XML-based languages were leveraged to describe the mathematics (content MathML), metadata (RDF), and links between resources (XLink).
