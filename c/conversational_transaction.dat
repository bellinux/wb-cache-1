To conduct a business task, an e-service undertakes {{a conversation that}} often spans across multiple e-services, and is often asynchronous and asymmetric. Within a conversation, the unit of business at each e-service is called a component transaction. The component transactions within a conversation form a <b>conversational</b> <b>transaction.</b> Each component transaction is autonomous and independent while it is relative to each other only {{in the context of}} a specific conversation. A <b>conversational</b> <b>transaction</b> is committed if each component is committed, or recommitted after compensation. If one or more component transactions abort, the <b>conversational</b> <b>transaction,</b> depending on the business logic, may need to be canceled the committed component transactions need to be canceled though not every transaction is cancellable after a certain point. In this paper, we argue that the traditional transaction semantics and mechanisms do not apply well in the e-service world, and propose an optimistic commit protocol to provide transaction support, i. e., all-or-nothing semantics, for conversational transactions...|$|E
40|$|Web based services, also termed E-services {{are either}} {{stand-alone}} or use other web services for performing their tasks. To conduct a business task, an e-service undertakes {{a conversation that}} spans across multiple e-services, which is often asynchronous and asymmetric.

The component transactions within a conversation form a <b>conversational</b> <b>transaction.</b> Each component transaction is autonomous and independent while it is relative to each other only {{in the context of}} a specific conversation.

40|$|Message-oriented-middleware (MOM) {{has become}} an small industry. MOM offers queued {{transaction}} processing as an advance over pure client-server transaction processing. This note makes four points: Queued transaction processing is less general than direct transaction processing. Queued systems are built on top of direct systems. You cannot build a direct system atop a queued system. It is difficult to build direct, <b>conversational,</b> or distributed <b>transactions</b> atop a queued system. Queues are interesting databases with interesting concurrency control. It is best to build these mechanisms into a standard database system so other applications can use these interesting features. Queue systems need DBMS functionality. Queues need security, configuration, performance monitoring, recovery, and reorganization utilities. Database systems already have these features. A full-function MOM system duplicates these database features. Queue managers are simple TP-monitors managing server pools dr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} {{building}} process of psychological contract within a training program, pro- moted for professionals {{of a complex}} organization that manages networks of services and centres for child education in nursery school providing training, consultancy, support and innovation stra- tegies. People were asked to go forward their specific field of traditional competencies, {{in order to build}} a broader approach in their work, according with more integrated work processes, with less superimposition and with better proximity with the stakeholders and the direct clients of the service. Our work will point out the challenge of putting into dialogue the “oneself” and the “them- selves”, crossing oppositions, refusals, organizational and institutional involvements, affiliations and conflict dynamics. Particularly, analyzing conversational pieces stemmed from training sessions, the paper under- lines the dialogue configuration as conflict, strengthening the constructive vs destructive modes of its expression, assuming both the dialogue between trainees and their relationship with trainers. The paper proceeds in reading dialogism through the lens of cultural organizational psychology approach, discussing how the conjoint building of the recognition of the embedded relation be- tween “you” and “other” passes through various dimensions: e. g. role, institutional bonds, power dynamics, interests opposition and composition, managing <b>transaction,</b> <b>conversational</b> practices and communicative negotiations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Health Professions, Dept. of Communication Sciences and DisordersThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if a difference existed in the efficacy of "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" (SCA) strategies between persons in the acute and chronic stages of aphasia. Additionally, did any change occur in the personal satisfaction of conversational interaction when SCA strategies were implemented and if so, was there a relationship between the degree of change and the stage of aphasia. Four dyads representing two persons with acute aphasia and their conversation partners and two persons with chronic aphasia and their conversation partners participated in the study. Data was obtained from three 5 -minute videotaped conversations for each dyad at pre-, post-, and 1 -month post-training phases. A half-day group training session in SCA strategies, in addition to a short individualized training session was provided to the conversation partners of each dyad prior to the post-training videotaping. Measures were used to assess the skill of the PWA for <b>conversational</b> interaction and <b>transaction</b> and the ability of the conversation partner to both acknowledge and reveal the competence of the PWA during a communicative interaction. A five-point analog scale was used to assess the personal satisfaction of dyad members after each videotaped session. Informal interviews were held with the participants of each dyad at the end of the study to provide qualitative data and additional study support. At the end of the study, no difference was suggested in the results between persons with acute and chronic aphasia at the post-training phase when the use of SCA strategies was implemented. Additionally, although all dyads showed a trend towards a positive change in personal conversation satisfaction at post-training and 1 -month post-training, the acute dyads displayed a greater degree of change at these phases...|$|R
