40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic study of <b>coproducts.</b> This {{is carried out}} principally, but not exclusively, for finitely generated quasivarieties A that admit a (term) reduct in the variety D of bounded distributive lattices. In this setting we present necessary and sufficient conditions on A for the forgetful functor U from A to D to preserve <b>coproducts.</b> We also investigate the possible behaviours of U as regards <b>coproducts</b> in A under weaker assumptions. Depending on the properties exhibited by the functor, different procedures are then available for describing these <b>coproducts.</b> We classify a selection of well-known varieties within our scheme, thereby unifying earlier results and obtaining some new ones. The paper's methodology draws heavily on duality theory. We use Priestley duality as a tool and our descriptions of <b>coproducts</b> are given {{in terms of this}} duality. We also exploit natural duality theory, specifically multisorted piggyback dualities, in our analysis of the behaviour of the forgetful functor into D. In the opposite direction, we reveal that the type of natural duality that the class A can possess is governed by properties of <b>coproducts</b> in A {{and the way in which}} the classes A and U(A) nteract...|$|R
