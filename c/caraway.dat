5|$|General Fury <b>Caraway</b> is {{a member}} of the Galbadian {{military}} who advises the main characters on their mission to assassinate Sorceress Edea. When Laguna left Galbadia, <b>Caraway</b> comforted Julia; eventually, they married and had a child, Rinoa. <b>Caraway</b> and Rinoa have a problematic relationship; he attempts to prevent her from participating in the assassination attempt. However, he later arranges her freedom from the D-District Prison.|$|E
5|$|Volume III covers roots, {{seeds and}} herbs. These include plants {{that may be}} rhubarb, gentian, liquorice, <b>caraway,</b> cumin, parsley, lovage, fennel and many others.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of <b>caraway,</b> coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E

50|$|Wardwarf - A robot {{introduced}} as <b>Caraway's</b> bodyguard. He {{speaks in a}} British accent. Wardwarf uses a laser pistol in combat. He blows himself up later on after combat along with General.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{the youth}} camp had 8,874 guests with 85 {{different}} groups and 13 individuals were baptized in <b>Caraway's</b> back lake throughout the year. The camp is accredited by the American Camp Association.|$|R
5|$|The {{ingredients}} include meat (either goat meat, beef or chicken); pounded wheat; ghee—(milk fat rendered from butter, {{also called}} clarified butter); milk; lentils; ginger and garlic paste; turmeric; spices such as cumin seeds, <b>caraway</b> seeds (shah zeera), cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron, jaggery, natural gum, allspice (kabab cheeni); and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot {{topped with a}} ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander, sliced boiled egg and fried onions as garnish.|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were <b>caraway,</b> mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|Several foods have an {{association}} with the city. Sally Lunn buns (a type of teacake) have long been baked in Bath. They were first mentioned by name in verses printed in the Bath Chronicle, in 1772. At that time they were eaten hot at public breakfasts in Spring Gardens. They can be eaten with sweet or savoury toppings and are sometimes confused with Bath buns, which are smaller, round, very sweet and very rich. They {{were associated with the}} city following The Great Exhibition. Bath buns were originally topped with crushed comfits created by dipping <b>caraway</b> seeds repeatedly in boiling sugar; but today seeds are added to a 'London Bath Bun' (a reference to the bun's promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition). The seeds may be replaced by crushed sugar granules or 'nibs'.|$|E
5000|$|In The Silver Chair by C.S. Lewis, {{the queen}} of Harfang asks {{that one of the}} protagonists, Jill Pole, be given [...] "...all you can think of—possets and comfits and <b>caraways</b> and lullabies and toys." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Caraway's</b> most {{remarkable}} day came in 1930, when {{he struck out}} Joe Sewell twice. Sewell {{was the most difficult}} batter in baseball history to strike out, and he struck out only three times all that season.|$|R
50|$|Two of <b>Caraway's</b> Pokémon. Roko the Vulpix (Rokon is the Japanese name of Vulpix) has a {{thing for}} Arashi the Cyndaquil (Hinoarashi is the Japanese name of Cyndaquil), despite his being {{somewhat}} dim-witted. They meet Coconut while searching for a Fire Stone.|$|R
25|$|<b>Caraway</b> {{was born}} on December 23, 1905 in Jonesboro, Arkansas to Hattie <b>Caraway,</b> {{the first woman to}} be elected to the United States Senate and Thaddeus H. <b>Caraway,</b> also a Senator. He {{graduated}} from Georgetown University and was admitted to the bar in 1933. He practiced law in Heber Springs, Arkansas from 1965 to 1968 and then taught at Benjamin Franklin University in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caraway</b> {{graduated}} from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1929. He received his commission as a Second Lieutenant the same year. From 1935 to 1937, he served with the 15th Infantry Regiment in Tientsin, China. From 1938 to 1942, <b>Caraway</b> taught law at West Point.|$|E

50|$|Johnson was handily re-nominated in the Democratic primary {{election}} held on March 4, 2014. She polled 23,688 votes (69.9 percent) to former state Representative Barbara Mallory <b>Caraway's</b> 10,185 (30.1 percent) {{in the general}} election. Johnson was re-elected in the general elections in 2014 and 2016.|$|R
50|$|Through the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and North Carolina Baptist Men, <b>Caraway's</b> {{original}} {{tract of}} land was purchased in 1961 to host the summer camp program for Royal Ambassadors (RA's). Five additional pieces of land were purchased since then, bringing the property to almost eleven hundred acres in total.|$|R
25|$|<b>Caraway</b> {{commanded}} the 7th Infantry Division from August 1955 to April 1956 in Korea. From 1957 to 1958, he {{chief of staff}} {{at the headquarters of}} the United States Forces in Japan. He received a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Distinguished Service Medal in 1964 as a lieutenant general. Following the Korean War, <b>Caraway</b> became the head of Army research and development. He retired as a lieutenant general.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Caraway</b> {{suggested}} in a March 1963 speech that residents who desired autonomy for the Ryukyu Islands were incompetent {{to run a}} government for themselves, {{a large group of}} government workers began calling for his removal from office. A severe drought the same year forced <b>Caraway</b> to begin rationing water when reserves fell before 40 percent of capacity. He retired from the position on August 1, 1964 and Lieutenant General Albert Watson II succeeded him.|$|E
25|$|Goosnargh cakes: small flat shortbread {{biscuits}} with coriander or <b>caraway</b> seeds {{pressed into}} the biscuit before baking. Traditionally baked on feast days like Shrove Tuesday.|$|E
5000|$|Despite <b>Caraway's</b> admirable accomplishments, {{during his}} early days as a senator he also gained {{national}} prominence for being a [...] "modest and self-contained" [...] man; a politician with [...] "the shortest sketch in the Congressional Directory." [...] And the headline of a story detailing this distinction was later found pasted in the personal scrapbooks kept by iconic American author F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose masterwork The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway, a protagonist whose surname was originally spelled [...] "Caraway" [...] in Fitzgerald's earliest draft of the Gatsby novel.|$|R
60|$|The {{idea was}} graciously received, {{and the class}} decorously seated in a row. But before a single verse was given out, Gusty, being of a house-wifely turn of mind, {{suggested}} that the patty-cake might burn. Instant alarm pervaded the party, and a precipitate rush was made for the cooking-stove, where Christie proved by ocular demonstration that the cake {{showed no signs of}} baking, much less of burning. The family pronounced themselves satisfied, after each member had poked a grimy little finger into the doughy delicacy, whereon one large raisin reposed in proud pre-eminence over the vulgar herd of <b>caraways.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} serum sodium, {{potassium}} and calciu m were measured {{by means of}} the flame photometer and that of urea-nitrogen was estimated by the <b>Caraway's</b> Xanthydrol method, in 15 normal healthy subjects whose ages ranged between 20 and 35 years. 1) The serum sodium levels ranged between 136. 5 and 145. 9 mEq/ 1, ave r a ging 141. 1 ± 2. 64 mEq/ 1. 2) The mean serum potassium level was 4. 51 ± 0. 21 mEq/ 1 ranging between 4. 29 and 4. 92 mEq/ 1. 3) The mean serum calcium level was 4. 72 ± 0. 21 mEq/ 1 ranging between 4. 22 and 5. 75 mEq/ 1. 4) The serum urea-nitrogen levels were below 20 mg% in 14 out of 15 cases and the level was 20 - 24 mg% in the rest of one case, both of which were within normal limit...|$|R
25|$|<b>Caraway</b> {{served as}} High Commissioner of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from February 16, 1961 to July 31, 1964. When <b>Caraway</b> {{arrived on the}} island, he wore the three-star {{insignia}} of a lieutenant general, {{despite the fact that}} the United States Senate had not yet approved his promotion to that rank. However, he felt that his need to establish immediate authority with the Okinawa public warranted his assumption of advancement; the Senate did not learn of this episode and confirmed him shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} commonly seen along {{water courses}} includes seabuckthorn (Hippophae spp.), wild roses of pink or yellow varieties, tamarisk (Myricaria spp.), <b>caraway,</b> stinging nettles, mint, Physochlaina praealta, and various grasses.|$|E
25|$|Carvone is {{a member}} of a family of {{chemicals}} called terpenoids. Carvone is found naturally in many essential oils, but is most abundant in the oils from seeds of <b>caraway</b> (Carum carvi), spearmint (Mentha spicata), and dill.|$|E
60|$|Thus, a {{stranger}} to the ordinary motives which lead young men to make the army their choice, and without the least desire to become either a hero or a dandy, I really {{do not know what}} determined my thoughts that way, unless it were the happy state of half-pay indolence enjoyed by Captain Doolittle, who had set up his staff of rest in my native village. Every other person had, or seemed to have, something to do, less or more. They did not, indeed, precisely go to school and learn tasks, that last of evils in my estimation; but it did not escape my boyish observation, that they were all bothered with something or other like duty or labour--all but the happy Captain Doolittle. The minister had his parish to visit, and his preaching to prepare, though perhaps he made more fuss than he needed about both. The laird had his farming and improving operations to superintend; and, besides, he had to attend trustee meetings, and lieutenancy meetings, and head-courts, and meetings of justices, and what not--was as early up, (that I detested,) and as much in the open air, wet and dry, as his own grieve. The shopkeeper (the village boasted but one of eminence) stood indeed pretty much at his ease behind his counter, for his custom was by no means overburdensome; but still he enjoyed his status, as the Bailie calls it, upon condition of tumbling all the wares in his booth over and over, when any one chose to want a yard of muslin, a mousetrap, an ounce of <b>caraways,</b> a paper of pins, the Sermons of Mr. Peden, or the Life of Jack the Giant-Queller, (not Killer, as usually erroneously written and pronounced.--See my essay on the true history of this worthy, where real facts have in a peculiar degree been obscured by fable.) In short, all in the village were under the necessity of doing something which they would rather have left undone, excepting Captain Doolittle, who walked every morning in the open street, which formed the high mall of our village, in a blue coat with a red neck, and played at whist the whole evening, when he could make up a party. This happy vacuity of all employment appeared to me so delicious, that it became the primary hint, which, according to the system of Helvetius, as the minister says, determined my infant talents towards the profession I was destined to illustrate.|$|R
25|$|Harissa is hot chili sauce {{commonly}} {{eaten in}} North Africa. Main ingredients include chili peppers, such as bird's eye chili and serrano peppers, and spices such as garlic paste, coriander, red chili powder, <b>caraway</b> and olive oil.|$|E
25|$|Lithuanian {{herbs and}} {{seasonings}} include mustard seed, dill (krapai), <b>caraway</b> seed (kmynai), garlic, bay leaf, juniper berries, and fruit essences. Vanilla and pepper were scarce during the Soviet era, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.|$|E
25|$|The plateau also {{produces}} wheat, barley, millet, beans, opium, cotton, lucerne, and tobacco. The barley is fed mainly to horses. Sesame is grown and made into sesame oil. Mushrooms and manna were also {{seen in the}} plateau area as of 1920. <b>Caraway</b> is grown in the Kerman Province.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Asia, {{coriander}} seed is used widely {{in the process}} for pickling vegetables. In Germany and South Africa (see boerewors), the seeds are used while making sausages. In Russia and Central Europe, {{coriander seed}} is an occasional ingredient in rye bread (e.g. Borodinsky bread), {{as an alternative to}} <b>caraway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mitchell Wayne Katzman was {{promoted}} to co-producer as of season 12, while Frank Katzman (the other son of Leonard Katzman) and John Rettino (Leonard Katzman's son-in-law), served as associate producers during season 13 and season 14. Additionally, writer Louella Lee <b>Caraway</b> also served as executive coordinator for the final three seasons.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of Austria, {{ring-shaped}} pastries called Beugel are sold {{in the weeks before}} Easter. Like a bagel, the yeasted wheat dough, usually flavored with <b>caraway,</b> is boiled before baking. However, the Beugel is crispy and can be stored for weeks. Traditionally it has to be torn apart by two individuals before eating.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania kvass {{is known}} as gira and is widely {{available}} in bottles and draft. Many restaurants in Vilnius make their own gira, which they sell on the premises. Strictly speaking, gira {{can be made from}} anything fermentable — such as <b>caraway</b> tea, beetroot juice, or berries — but it is made mainly from black bread or barley/rye malt.|$|E
