Every municipality in the regional county community is also required to adopt a planning program, a zoning by-law, a subdivision by-law and a building by-law. This program and those by-laws must be in <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> {{the objectives of the}} development plan. In some cases, the local by-laws also must be in <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> the local planning program. In the first part, this essay establishes the difference between the obligation of <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> the regional plan and the obligation of <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> the local planning program. In the second part, the essay analyses the principles of conformity ; first the principles of interpretation and second the principles of application...|$|R

40|$|Tobacco stress-induced 1 (Tsi 1) is an ethylene-responsive-element binding protein/APETALA 2 –type {{transcription}} factor that {{plays an important}} role in both biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways. We show that Tsi 1 -interacting protein 1 (Tsip 1), a DnaJ-type Zn finger protein, interacts <b>with</b> <b>Tsi</b> 1 in vitro and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The transcript level of Tsip 1 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) increased upon treatment with salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, gibberellic acid, NaCl, and virus challenge. Tsip 1 appeared to be physically associated with the chloroplast surface but dissociated from it after SA treatment. Tsip 1 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated <b>with</b> <b>Tsi</b> 1 in plant cells following SA treatment. Tsip 1 expression increased Tsi 1 -mediated transcription and was able to functionally compensate for loss of the Tsi 1 transcriptional activation domain through a direct interaction <b>with</b> <b>Tsi</b> 1. Transgenic plants simultaneously coexpressing Tsi 1 and Tsip 1 displayed stronger pathogen resistance and salt tolerance than did transgenic plants expressing either Tsi 1 or Tsip 1 alone. Concurrent with this, the expression of a subset of stress-related genes was induced in a cooperative manner in Tsi 1 /Tsip 1 transgenic plants. These results together implied that Tsi 1 recruits Tsip 1 to the promoters of stress-related genes to potentiate Tsi 1 -mediated transcriptional activation...|$|R
