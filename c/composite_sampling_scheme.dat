40|$|Reliable and {{effective}} verification of soil carbon sequestration {{is required for}} quantification of project-based greenhouse gas mitigation. Direct soil sampling is necessary for measurements at field level. In this study, soil samples from a semiarid agroecosystem of the Sudan were statistically analyzed to evaluate if changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) over time or space were detectable or not, given a certain sample size. One hundred samples were taken from each of three fields. The data collected did not respect normality, and parametric methods, such as the minimum detectable difference (MDD), {{could not be used}} to relate, with confidence, the number of samples required to detect specific changes. For this reason, a method incorporating a nonparametric test into a bootstrap routine was developed to calculate the probabilities that a test will detect the differences between treatment groups for specified sample sizes. The nonparametric approach used is a simple way of relating sample sizes, detectable differences, and the probabilities of detection, making it flexible for any study affected by data nonnormality. Data from different simulated <b>composite</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>schemes</b> were also combined with a bootstrap routine in order to quantify the averages and 95 % confidence intervals of the variability estimates (variance), necessary for parametric sample size calculations. The variance decreased almost by half each time the number of cores per samples doubled...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates and {{develops}} a {{stratified random sampling}} design for sediments in an offshore oil field environment. The sampling area was partitioned equally into 16 Zones, stratification {{were based on the}} near field and far field areas, and the number of samples in each Zone was chosen by proportional allocation, i. e. proportional to the available appropriate area (far field). Measurement techniques applied to the samples included laser granulometry, ultraviolet fluorescence, gas chromatography using mass selective detection or flame ionisation detection and elemental analysis. The total PAH concentrations (2 - to 6 -ring parent and alkylated PAHs, including the 16 US EPA PAHs) in sediments were relatively low (< 100 pg kg" dry weight). The PAH concentrations, Forties crude oil equivalent and diesel oil equivalent concentrations were generally higher in sediment of fine grain size and higher organic carbon loading. PAH distributions and concentration ratios Indicated a predominantly pyrolytic input, being dominated by the heavier, more persistent, 5 - and 6 -ring compounds, and with a high proportion of parent PAHs. The nalkane profiles of a number of the sediments contained small, high boiling, UCMs, indicative of weathered oil arising from a limited petrogenic input. Spatial structure analysis shows the existence of a trend in the variogram, and also the spatial pattern in the contour maps of the parameters measured, shows that the regionalized variable exhibited non-stationarity and were non-ergodic. The stratified random <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> showed significant advantages over a classical grid <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> when applied to the same area. Specifically, the stratified random sampling design gave much more reliable mean concentrations for all the parameters, achieving a much lower variance than the grid <b>sampling.</b> A further <b>composite</b> random <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> was designed for sediments in the near-shore. The aim is to estimate a within-stratum mean value for each of the chosen measurement parameters with more thorough coverage (better representation), better precision and less variance at lower analytical cost. This scheme was trialed in two near-shore environments, the Clyde Estuary and the Firth of Forth. The results show {{no significant differences between the}} mean and distribution profile of the individual <b>samples</b> and the <b>composite</b> <b>samples</b> for all the parameters measured. This work utilised the best modern chemical analytical methods for the quantification of a range of hydrocarbon species, and utilised the results in a modem risk-based approach to environmental assessment. The new stratified random sampling design has been accepted for use in the national marine monitoring programme (NMMP) In the United Kingdom.

In grazed grasslands, {{the heterogeneity of}} urine patches distribution needs adapted <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> in order to evaluate N-NO 3 - leaching risks. In such context, {{the aim of this}} paper is to define the accuracy that could be expected from the <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> applied in this agro-ecosystem (one average sample including 30 core samples taken in the 0 - 30 cm soil layer) and the <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> to be applied in order to reach a pre-defined level of standard error. The data bases mobilized were mainly 78 grasslands sampled in 2004 or in 2005 in 24 dairy farms and 8 grasslands sampled during four years (2004 to 2007) in the experimental site in Gembloux. Our results underlined the significant increase of the standard deviation with the concentration mean. So, the mean explained 63 and 49 % of the standard deviation increase observed, respectively, in 2004 and 2005. In such context, the <b>sampling</b> <b>scheme</b> applied in the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program (one <b>composite</b> <b>sample</b> of 30 core samples taken in the 0 - 30 cm soil layer) allowed to reach a precision of 10 kg N-NO 3 -. ha- 1 in 35 % of the grazed grasslands sampled. To shift to three <b>composite</b> <b>samples</b> per hectare allows reaching such an accuracy in 90 % of the parcels showing an average nitrite nitrogen content lower than 20 kg N-NO 3 -. ha- 1. For highest values, the samples number necessary to reach such a precision level increases quickly. In such context and in order to identify false positive parcels in audited farms, an important tolerance margin is defined around the threshold value. This value is defined yearly in farms integrating good practices in terms of nitrogen resources management.

Ranchi during 2004 - 05 to study the amount of intra-plant variation in different fruit quality parameters as influenced by sample size and method of sampling in litchi cv. Shahi. Fully mature randomly collected litchi fruits of different sample sizes (T, = 5 fruits/sample. T 1 = JO fruits per sample, T 1 = 15 fruits per sample, T, = 20 fruits per sample andTj= 25 fruits per sample) and sampling · types {T 6 =composite sample consisting of two set of 5 fruits each, T,=composite sample consisting of two set of 10 fruits each, T 8 = <b>composite</b> <b>sample</b> consisting of two set of 15 fruits each. T 9 = <b>composite</b> <b>sample</b> consisting of three set of 5 fruits each, T 10 = <b>composite</b> <b>sample</b> consisting of three set of I 0 fruits each and T 11 =composite sample consisting of four set of 5 fruits each) were analyzed for different quality parameters like fruit weight. TSS, total sugar and tit ratable acidity. Significant differences among the treatments were observed in the values of average fruit weight and ti/ratable acidity. An in-general higher value of intra-plant coefficient of variation in fruit quality was observed in case of simple sampling (T,-T/ than that in case of <b>composite</b> <b>sampling</b> (T,-T,/ <b>Composite</b> <b>sample</b> consisting of three set of 10 fruits each (T 1,) exhibited the minimum values of intra-plant coefficient of variation (O/o) in case of fruit weight, TSS and total sugar content which was at par with that in case o/T 7 T, and Tlf Keeping in view the ease in fruit sample collection and volume of work for quality analysis. <b>composite</b> <b>sampling</b> consisting of two set of 10 fruits each (T.) can be considered effective/or minimizing the error due to intra-plant variation in fruit quality of litchi.
