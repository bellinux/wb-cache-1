[...] She toured with the companies of Daniel Frohman and Mrs. Fiske, appearing in [...] "The Little Blond Lady", a piece by George M. Cohan.

However, Chet's children were present in the backseat. Since Chet had connections, he had the District Attorney file charges for indecent exposure, which could get Jimmy tried as a sex offender. Fortunately, Chuck managed to have the charges dropped, but Jimmy attributes that one event for his current situation.

40|$|The term “Access to Justice” (AtJ) {{refers to}} the {{fundamental}} notion that all people – even disadvantaged groups of society – should enjoy effective legal/judicial protection, ultimately through the courts. Accordingly, the principal targets of the AtJ-movement’s criticism have been so called “Access Barriers”, i. e. different legal and/or practical obstacles that make it difficult, or even impossible, {{for the general public}} to turn to the courts in order to vindicate their rights. The most significant barrier is legal fees in general, and <b>counsel</b> <b>fees</b> in particular. In a vast number of cases, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has concluded that law – substantive as well as procedural – is a rather complicated matter, which is often unintelligible to the layperson. Consequently, many self-represented litigants are neither accorded effective access to court (AtC), nor a fair trial – simply because they lack the skills necessary to present their case properly and competently. Therefore, the right to counsel has gradually evolved into a fundamental human right – not just in criminal cases, but also under the civil head of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Before Swedish courts, the parties to a dispute are always free to hire an attorney to conduct their case. In this narrow sense, the “right to counsel” is unconditional under Swedish law – both before the general courts and the administrative courts. In practice, however, the right to be assisted by counsel is conditional, since hiring a lawyer is always associated with a cost. In this way, a right that is theoretically bestowed on all is de facto denied many by the realities of economics. Or as the saying goes: “Justice is open to all; like the Ritz Hotel. ” It is an undeniable fact that most litigants {{will not be able to}} obtain <b>counsel,</b> if <b>counsel</b> <b>fees</b> are not covered by a legal aid and/or legal protection insurance scheme, or at least reimbursed through cost shifting rules. Against this background, this thesis examines how <b>counsel</b> <b>fees</b> are handled before Swedish courts in relation to the imbricated notions of AtJ and AtC. More specifically, the thesis discusses (1) “party funding” (i. e. cost shifting), (2) “public funding” (i. e. legal aid) and (3) “third-party funding” (i. e. legal insurance), with a comparative perspective on the Swedish civil, criminal and administrative procedure. Since a right to counsel can be derived from Article 6 of the ECHR, Swedish law is also compared with the case law of the ECtHR. Lastly, the thesis criticises “simplification of procedure” as an unrealistic alternative to lawyer-conducted litigation, at least in court proceedings which are adversarial in structure. The thesis argues that all people are not guaranteed equal AtJ in Sweden and that Swedish law – in some respects – is not even in compliance with the standards set by the ECtHR. With regard to the general courts, it is argued that the rules concerning assignment of public defence counsel are constructed in a way that infringes the suspect’s fair trial rights under Article 6. Before administrative courts, moreover, it is argued that the absence of legal aid (as well as legal insurances), combined with a default application of the American (“no-way” fee shifting) rule give rise to Access Barriers, since most individual parties (usually “one shot litigants”) are forced to proceed pro se in disputes against highly skilled adversaries, viz. state and municipal agencies (“repeat player litigants”). In view of this asymmetry, it is asserted that self-represented litigants are not always guaranteed effective access to a court/a fair trial...|$|R

40|$|The {{attorneys}} 2 ̆ 7 fees {{awarded to}} plaintiffs’ counsel in securities fraud class actions have generated controversy for years. Critics {{have claimed that}} enormous fee awards {{come at the expense}} of defrauded investors and simply spur extortionate lawsuits against issuers and other potential deep pocket defendants. Commentators also have raised concerns that plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 class action lawyers manipulated class representatives, persons who had little incentive to monitor class counsel’s activities. To address these concerns, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (2 ̆ 2 PSLRA 2 ̆ 2). Among other things, the statute sought to protect absent class members by giving control of the litigation to lead plaintiffs with substantial holdings in the securities at issue. Pursuant to the PSLRA, these lead plaintiffs may select and retain counsel for the class, subject to court approval. The statute further required courts to limit lead <b>counsel’s</b> <b>fees</b> to a reasonable percentage of the damages awarded to the class. In practice, however, it has not been clear that the PSLRA has had its desired effect. Regulation of fees by courts has been erratic and unpredictable. Some courts have claimed the mantle of 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary 2 ̆ 2 of the absent class and created various extra-statutory mechanisms to scrutinize lead plaintiff’s choice of <b>counsel</b> and cut <b>fee</b> requests. This activist judicial role has raised important questions about the proper exercise of judicial authority under the PSLRA. Can and should judges assume for themselves fiduciary obligations to absent class members? This article argues judges cannot act as fiduciaries to the class without abandoning their role as neutral arbiter. The article examines the agency problems inherent in representative litigation. It discusses the potential sources of a court 2 ̆ 7 s authority to award attorney’s fees, and the limitations placed on that authority, both before and after the PSLRA. It further examines the origins and nature of the claim that judges should act as 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary 2 ̆ 2 of absent class members...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} ways of calculating prevailing-party {{attorney}} fees. Most courts recognize that actual costs may be disproportionate and inequitable. Thus, many jurisdictions rely on other calculations. Many courts or laws invoke a lodestar calculation: reasonably expected billable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, sometimes multiplied by a factor reflecting the risk or complexity of the case. Courts in class actions frequently award fees proportionate to the damages recovered. In 2013, a federal court awarded class <b>counsel</b> attorneys <b>fees</b> totaling over $90 million for a $1.25 billion settlement in In Re Black Farmers Discrimination Litigation. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which, among other provisions, regulates the fees that can be awarded in a class action, was passed in response to concerns that courts were not adequately overseeing the award of such fees.|$|R
40|$|In {{both the}} United States and England, {{accident}} victims are often entitled to compensation from negligent defendants and the defendants’ liability insurers. Accident claimants {{in the two}} countries, however, have different ways of funding their claims and litigation. In the United States, claimants use the American-style contingent fee agreement to pay for lawyers. In England, claimants have relied on legal aid and the two-way costshifting “English Rule,” pursuant to which a prevailing party can recover his solicitor’s fees and litigation costs, including <b>counsel’s</b> <b>fees,</b> from the losing litigant. Over the last decade, dramatic changes {{have been made to}} the English litigation funding system for many areas of law, particularly personal injury (with the exception, to date, of clinical negligence). The English eliminated legal aid and suddenly introduced the conditional fee agreement, without changing the English Rule. Between 2000 and 2003, disputes were continual, as claimants and their representatives pushed the new rules to the outer limits, and defendant liability insurance companies resisted in any way they could. This article will explain the contentious debate. Part II will compare the American and the traditional English way of funding personal injury litigation, particularly minor road accident cases. Part III will discuss some background factors that influenced the recent changes in England. Part IV will examine the first revised litigation funding system, and Part V will demonstrate how the development of after-the-event insurance and the second revised litigation funding system ameliorated some problems but also generated new ones. Part VI will discuss the consequences of the second revised litigation funding system, with particular emphasis on the development of claims management companies, the extensive satellite litigation and, where appropriate, comparisons to the U. S. Supreme Court’s resolution of similar problems. Part VII will conclude by noting that there is now a moment of repose in the struggle but no guarantee that dramatic disagreement will not reappear...|$|R

40|$|With {{only a small}} risk of overstatement, {{one could}} say that {{sanctions}} in civil litigation exploded during the 1980 s, with the 1983 amendment to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 acting as the principal catalyst. From 1938 until the 1983 amendment, only two dozen or so cases on Rule 11 were reported, with courts rarely imposing sanctions. Although a few cases were notable by virtue of sanction size, prestige of the firm sanctioned, or publicity attending the underlying case, the legal profession largely regarded Rule 11 as a dead letter. In addition, other sanctions provisions, such as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 (regarding discovery) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (g) (regarding summary judgment affidavits made in bad faith), were seldom used or of great consequence. The statute authorizing imposition of <b>counsel</b> <b>fees</b> upon lawyers who unreasonably protract court proceedings, 28 U. S. C. § 1927, was employed even less often. As almost every attorney knows, things changed radically with the 1983 amendment to Rule 11. 2 ̆ 2 New 2 ̆ 2 Rule 11 resulted in approximately 700 reported Rule 11 opinions in just four and a half years, a tremendous increase from the previous 43 years. Suddenly, sanctions were the rage. Section 1927 sanctions also saw an upsurge, often inappropriately, as courts equated Section 1927, which requires intentional bad faith, with new Rule 11, which does not. Ironically, however, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 (g) and 16 (f), which Congress also strengthened in 1983, saw relatively little use. Because Rule 11 empowered courts to sanction any 2 ̆ 2 paper 2 ̆ 2 it found to violate the Rule and because the complaint was the paper most frequently sanctioned, critics of new Rule 11 argued that it was manifestly pro-defendant in impact, disproportionately burdened some types of claims more than others, discouraged innovative lawyering, or had all of these undesirable effects. Defenders of new Rule 11, on the other hand, extolled the Rule or responded to the criticisms. Controversy over Rule 11 remained heated enough to prompt the Advisory Committee on the Civil Rules to issue a Call for Comments in July 1990. By November 1990, more than 100 bar associations, judges, scholars, practitioners, and other interested parties had responded. In essence, judges expressed support for Rule 11 while practitioners leveled strong criticism. In February 1991, the Advisory Committee held a day of hearings on Rule 11 and in May 1991 it issued a proposed revised Rule 11...|$|R

40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 {{was enacted}} {{in the wake}} of highly publicized pension {{disasters}} in order to protect employee pension rights. Born as a piece of pro-worker legislation, it initially was criticized by business groups as a cause of bureaucratic arteriosclerosis that was worse than the disease of pension failures. Even worse, it prompted many employers to consider dispensing with pension plans altogether rather than struggle with the administrative and financial obligations of ERISA. Business, labor, and the public all complained about the law 2 ̆ 7 s complexity. It even became something of a national joke as regulators took years to promulgate regulations for administering the statute. In short, ERISA seemed to have something to annoy everyone. A silver lining of sorts was that, at least for the first ten years of the law 2 ̆ 7 s existence, most discussions were confined—as was virtually all congressional discussion at the time of ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s enactment—to pensions. At first, no one considered that ERISA related to the delivery of medical services or to the collection of employer-provided insurance benefits. Eventually, alert defense lawyers argued that the broad preemption language in ERISA prevented pension plans from being subject to inconsistent state regulation. Pressing a broad literal reading of the preemption language, they found a willing audience in the U. S. Supreme Court. For example, Pilot Life Insurance Co. v. Dedeaux held that an aggrieved worker attempting to collect disability insurance benefits was unable to make a state law-based claim of insurer bad faith because it was preempted by ERISA. Two years earlier, in Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, the Court held that ERISA, which created a private right of action against ERISA fiduciaries under the statute, entitled the successful claimant only to the benefits owed plus reasonable counsel fees; there was no right of consequential, extra-contractual, or punitive damages arising from the improper or untimely processing of benefit claims. In the ten years following Pilot Life, lower courts in large part continued to take a broad view of ERISA preemption as applied not only to insurers but to managed care organizations such as health maintenance organizations and to physicians working under the auspices of managed care, in many cases insulating them from state law tort claims. In 1993, the U. S. Supreme Court extended ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s limited remedy for improper claims handling to suits against nonfiduciaries as well. A covered employee might obtain denied benefits and <b>counsel</b> <b>fees</b> through litigation under ERISA but was barred from consequential and punitive damages. The traditional business-based grumbling about ERISA was replaced by consumer-oriented complaints, as many were stunned to find that a statute ostensibly enacted to protect workers was being used by the courts to strip them of rights that they possessed prior to ERISA...|$|R
25|$|Within Chapter 11 of the Virginia Act of Assembly, {{a number}} of acts were made law in order to {{consolidate}} and strengthen the regulations associated with a slave's right to petition for freedom in the state. Any person who believed himself or herself to be illegally detained was given {{the right to make}} a complaint in court, order the clerk to issue a warrant summoning the owner, and be provided with an appointed legal <b>counsel</b> who, without <b>fee,</b> would prosecute the suit. In addition to further outlining the right of enslaved persons in the courts, the new laws also enacted stricter penalties against persons who were found illegally aiding slaves in trying to achieve freedom. Any person in the state of Virginia found abetting, making, forging, or counterfeiting materials for use in court by a slave attempting to win their freedom was sentenced to suffer one year's imprisonment without bail. While the laws did create a space for the illegally enslaved to file suits for freedom, it isolated the enslaved from persons with the power and means to assist their cases.|$|R
