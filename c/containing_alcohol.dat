2500|$|E10 {{and other}} blends of ethanol are {{considered}} to be useful in decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, and can reduce carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 20 to 30% under the right conditions. Although E10 does decrease emissions of CO and greenhouse gases such as CO2 by an estimated 2% over regular gasoline, it can cause increases in evaporative emissions and some pollutants depending on factors such as the age of the vehicle and weather conditions. [...] According to the Philippine Department of Energy, the use of not more than a 10% ethanol-gasoline mixture is not harmful to cars' fuel systems. Generally, automobile gasoline <b>containing</b> <b>alcohol</b> (ethanol or methanol) is not recommended to be used in aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the use of sugar alcohols (sorbitol, erythritol, and xylitol) as alternative sweeteners for replacing sucrose in Yukwa (traditional Korean oil-puffed rice snack). The moisture contents of Bandegi (dried Yukwa dough) and Yukwa <b>containing</b> sugar <b>alcohols</b> were higher than that of control (containing only sucrose). The microstructures of control and Bandegi <b>containing</b> sugar <b>alcohols</b> showed uniformly and finely distributed air holes. Expansion ratio and oil absorption of Yukwa containing sorbitol and 30 % erythritol were higher than those of control. Appearance and cross section of control and Yukwa containing sorbitol, 30 % erythritol, and 30 % xylitol showed a good shape. The lightness (L) of control was significantly lower than Yukwa <b>containing</b> sugar <b>alcohols,</b> whereas redness (a) and yellowness (b) were higher than those in Yukwa <b>containing</b> sugar <b>alcohols.</b> Hardness of Yukwa <b>containing</b> sugar <b>alcohols</b> was significantly lower than that of control, and that of Yukwa containing sorbitol was the lowest. Peak number of Yukwa <b>containing</b> sugar <b>alcohols</b> was significantly lower than that of control, and that of Yukwa containing 60 % erythritol and 60 % xylitol was the lowest among all samples.
