50|$|According to Judge Julio Roberto Ballén Silva, the AUC reacted {{against his}} {{involvement}} in negotiations {{for the release of}} guerrilla-held hostages on behalf of their family members. There are several versions of what happened in the days preceding his murder. In one of them Garzón was informed of an order to assassinate him; he then contacted Castaño, who scheduled a meeting with him to take place just the day after his murder and sent a <b>counter</b> <b>order</b> to abort the assassination. The order apparently either never reached the actual killers, or came after it was too late. This led some to speculate that the meeting was a trap.|$|E
50|$|Despite al-Douri's succession, another high ranking Ba'athist, Younis al-Ahmed, {{called for}} a General Conference of the Iraqi Ba'ath party in Syria to elect a new {{leadership}} (the faction's armed wing is The Return). This move caused {{a significant amount of}} controversy within the party, with al-Douri issuing a statement criticizing Syria for what al-Douri claimed was an American-supported attempt to undermine the Iraqi Ba'ath party, although this statement was later downplayed. The conference elected al-Ahmed as secretary-general, and al-Ahmed issued an order expelling al-Douri from the party, resulting in al-Douri issuing a <b>counter</b> <b>order</b> expelling al-Ahmed and 150 other party members. These events led to the existence, in effect, of two Iraqi Ba'ath Parties: the main party led by al-Douri, and a splinter party led by al-Ahmed.|$|E

50|$|Punk's Backyard Grill was a {{contemporary}} {{version of the}} classic American backyard cookout. Formerly open at the Westfield Annapolis Mall in Annapolis, Maryland, Punk's Backyard Grill is a fast casual style restaurant, with <b>counter</b> <b>ordering</b> and food runners and bussers. The restaurant had a full liquor license, serving beer, wine, and specialty cocktails. The menu was created by Dean Maupin, currently the executive chef at the Clifton Inn in Charlottesville, VA.

40|$|A {{study of}} 372 U. S. {{restaurant}} operators (of all sizes) that accept takeout orders found that {{about one-quarter of}} those surveyed have adopted online ordering. Just over one-fourth of those surveyed use some form of online ordering. These restaurateurs have been pleased with the technology, {{and all of them}} indicated that online ordering has met or exceeded their expectations on ROI. Although convenience and control are both drivers of the move toward online ordering, this study found that consumers and operators differed on the ranking of those two factors. Operators thought that consumers like online ordering for its convenience, but an earlier study of consumers found that what they like is control over the ordering process. Contrary to some reports, the restaurants in this study did not find substantial increases in average check, but they did report considerable increase in order frequency. For this sample, the top benefit of online ordering was a savings in labor, since employees are not tied up on the phone or at the <b>counter.</b> <b>Order</b> accuracy was another benefit cited by these restaurant operators...|$|E
40|$|Under uncertainty, {{human and}} animal collectives often respond stochastically to events they encounter. Human or animal {{individuals}} behave depending on others' actions, and sometimes follow choices that are sub-optimal for individuals. Such mimetic behaviors are enhanced during emergencies, creating collective behavior of a group. A stock market that is about to crash, as markets did immediately after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, provides illustrative examples of such behaviors. We provide empirical evidence proving the existence of collective behavior among stock market participants in emergent situations. We investigated the resolution of extreme supply-and-demand order imbalances by increased balancing counter orders: buy and sell orders for excess supply and demand respectively, during times of price adjustment, so-called special quotes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Counter orders increase positively depending on the quantity of revealed counter orders: the accumulated orders in the book until then. Statistics of the coming <b>counter</b> <b>order</b> are well described using a logistic regression model with the ratio of revealed orders until then to the finally revealed orders as the explanatory variable. Results given here show that the market participants make Bayesian estimations of optimal choices to ascertain whether to order using information about orders of other participants...|$|E
50|$|After {{securing}} a U.S. patent (#2,656,508) for the Coulter Principle in 1953, Wallace {{and his brother}} Joseph R. Coulter (d. 1998) began {{the production of the}} new cell and particle analyzer, the Coulter <b>Counter.</b> <b>Orders</b> and sales continued to increase and, in 1958, the brothers incorporated their company as Coulter Electronics, Inc. and relocated operations to Hialeah, Florida in 1961. Coulter positioned the Coulter Corporation as the leader in the diagnostic industry. In October 1997, the Coulter Corporation was acquired by Beckman Instruments, Inc., and is now known as Beckman Coulter, Inc.

50|$|Nandos {{opened its}} first UK {{restaurant}} in 1992 {{in the west}} London suburbs of Ealing and Earls Court, initially focusing on takeaway food. The UK arm, owned by the Enthoven family via a private equity company, struggled until chairman Dick Enthoven put his son Robert in control. The focus then moved from takeaways to a mixed service (<b>counter</b> <b>ordering</b> and table service) model. Branches also chose individual design and decor {{to move away from}} a restaurant-chain image. The company employs around 8,000 staff in the UK and, as of 2013, had over 280 branches in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with some 60 being halal.|$|R

Immediately {{after reading the}} despatch {{of which he was}} the bearer, there was a great bustle in the house; Lady Marney was sent for to her husband's library and there enjoined immediately to write various letters which were to prevent certain expected visitors from arriving; Captain Grouse was in and out the same library every five minutes, receiving <b>orders</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>orders,</b> and finally mounting his horse was flying about the neighbourhood with messages and commands. All this stir signified that the Marney regiment of Yeomanry were to be called out directly.|$|R

50|$|Capt. Thomas {{claimed that}} after his {{discussion}} with Capt. Mylchreest his initial orders {{were to take}} the Fenella to the north east of the George Hotel, which he proceeded to do. However, he then claimed he received <b>counter</b> <b>orders</b> {{to take her to}} the Anglesey shore astern of the Prince Arthur. Capt. Thomas stated that consequently they got caught in a strong counter current which caused the Fenella to start drifting down towards the Prince Arthur, at which time he received the order to let go the tow rope and consequently the Fenella struck the Prince Arthur. Capt. Thomas said the strong current was causing the Satanella problems, as she became embroiled at the far end of the pier and ended up striking several of the barges and a barque.|$|R

In the confusion of <b>orders</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>orders,</b> the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|R
