5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward into the cab. The passengers' <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> made to RCMP about the {{comments}} {{by one of}} the parade organizers, Inderjit Singh Bains, on Sher-E-Punjab radio. During part of the show hosted by Gurvinder Dhaliwal, Bains spoke about the importance of honouring the Sikh faith and some logistics of the Surrey, B.C., parade that draws tens of thousands of people.|$|E
5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E

5|$|In May 2005, a {{veterinarian}} named Kris Nelson filed {{a series of}} complaints against the zoo regarding animal care and management. Her <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> backed by two former zoo employees: a chief veterinarian and an animal nutritionist. The complaints stated that dozens of animals had been harmed or {{died as a result}} of poor management, feeding practices, and quarantine procedures. Another veterinarian, 15-year zoo employee Kathy Orr, discounted many of Nelson's claims as being either invalid, or having been corrected already.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{authorities}} {{investigating the}} charges said the alleged victims {{were not being}} fully cooperative, whereas former members were suspicious of the Mexican legal system, arguing that it favored the church. Ten years later {{a spokesman for the}} state prosecutor said the criminal <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful because, in addition to the statute of limitations, the accusations were incomplete.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> submitted anonymously.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> {{not found}} to <b>be</b> {{admissible}} the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> not made public and nothing comes from it.

50|$|In July 2007, a <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> {{made against}} Free Dominion before the Canadian Human Rights Commission for posting {{material}} {{perceived to be}} discriminatory against Muslims. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> subsequently withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|A further <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> laid in 1999 citing {{four of his}} columns, {{including}} the column raised in the previous <b>complaint.</b> This one <b>was</b> upheld, and Collins and his publisher were ordered to pay $2,000 in damages. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> upheld upon appeal.|$|R
5|$|Some <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> {{raised by}} others during the {{construction}} of the freeway south of SR 94. A proposed drainage basin raised concerns about a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes being located near homes. Caltrans was later ordered by local courts to pay settlements in the millions of dollars to local business owners for undervaluing property taken by eminent domain.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.87 million {{following}} its broadcast on BBC One, however, despite the measures used to provide the balanced view, it was met with considerable controversy from Muslims, among them the Muslim Council of Britain, for fear that the episode would incite Islamophobia. Nearly a thousand <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> made, although cast and crew members argued that the Muslims who opposed the episode {{did not understand the}} context.|$|E
5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage {{that had previously been}} edited out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with the}} school district asking that an edited version be used instead. Horalek, who described the passage as pornographic, said the school should have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> lodged.|$|E
25|$|The House of Representatives' Committee on Justice {{voted on}} September 1, 2010 {{that the two}} <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> {{sufficient}} in form. With the result, further hearings would be held {{to determine if the}} two <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> sufficient in substance.|$|R
50|$|The {{unit was}} highly criticized, {{when it had}} used the vehicle {{registration}} number of a revenue department officer without obtaining proper permissions. A <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed with the police against director Cheran, however no official <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> later lodged.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Archbishop Julian Porteous was {{notified}} that a <b>complaint</b> had <b>been</b> {{filed with the}} office of Tasmania's Anti-discrimination Commissioner in relation to the distribution in all Tasmanian Catholic schools of a booklet, Don't Mess with Marriage, stating marriage should be a [...] "heterosexual union {{between a man and a}} woman" [...] and changing the law would endanger a child's upbringing. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed by a transgender activist and Federal Greens candidate Martine Delaney. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> called [...] "'an attempt to silence' the Church over same-sex marriage" [...] by Archbishop Porteous. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> treated as a possible breach of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas), and sparked fierce debate on the issues of freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and tolerance. The frivolous <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> ultimately withdrawn.|$|R
5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 had {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception, {{although it was}} criticized for problems with its controls. The game received some initial complaints of racism, but {{an investigation by the}} British Board of Film Classification found the <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> unsubstantiated. Resident Evil 5 was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. As of June 2017 it has sold over 7.2 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling game and the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise. A special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, has sold an additional 2.3 million units. A sequel, Resident Evil 6, was released in 2012.|$|E
50|$|A <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> sent in June 2013 against France to the {{investigators}} of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> dealt with by the Professional Standards department of the police force the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> about. The IPCC's independent investigators investigate the most serious complaints, for example where someone has died following contact with the police.|$|R

5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E
5|$|The World Ends with You {{received}} positive reviews, {{praising the}} graphics, soundtrack, {{and integration of}} gameplay into the Shibuya setting. The few common <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> related to the steep learning curve of the battle system {{as well as the}} imprecise touch-screen controls. In the week of its release, the game was the second best-selling DS title in Japan, and the top selling DS title in North America. Shiro Amano, writer and artist of the Kingdom Hearts manga, later created a manga based on the video game.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E

50|$|On 17 July 2000, {{a second}} {{criminal}} <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> brought against Slyusarchuk in Lviv. According to complainants Oleg and Bogdana Gamalii, they paid him $1,500 {{to treat their}} two young children; the children worsened following his treatment. After five years, the <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> dropped.|$|R
50|$|Wheeler told {{constituents}} that {{he would}} vote to reinstitute slavery if his constituents wanted him to.

5|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, no <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. <b>Complaints</b> <b>were</b> made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E
30|$|Chief <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> right upper {{abdominal}} pain.|$|R
