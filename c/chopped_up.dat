5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in San Francisco in the United States {{for the murder}} of {{homosexual}} prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was <b>chopped</b> <b>up</b> and drained of blood; it was found in a garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as a suspect after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house {{at the time of the}} murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, <b>chopped</b> <b>up,</b> transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the <b>chopped</b> <b>up</b> corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E

The body of choice on the dirt circuit was the Gremlin and AMC Eagle.

Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E
25|$|Frank and Charles Menches {{claim to}} have sold a ground beef {{sandwich}} at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in Hamburg, New York. During the fair, {{they ran out of}} pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef. Kunzog, who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased <b>chopped</b> <b>up</b> beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874. The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York not Hamburg Germany. Frank Menches's obituary in The New York Times states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.|$|E

25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she <b>chopped</b> <b>up</b> the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E

Maurice's [...] "Nu Soul Remix" [...] speeds up the beat, taking it from hip-hop to house territory.

500|$|You Can Dance is {{the first}} remix album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on November 17, 1987, by Sire Records. The album contains remixes of tracks from her first three studio albums—Madonna (1983), Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986)— and a new track, [...] "Spotlight". In the 1980s, remixing was still a new concept and technology, by which a particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, <b>chopped</b> <b>up,</b> transposed {{up and down in}} pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass. Madonna became interested in the concept, noting that she hated when others remixed her songs and wanted to do it by herself.|$|E
500|$|In {{its last}} act before {{disbanding}} in 1991 and {{being replaced by}} the Press Complaints Commission, the Press Council produced a comprehensive report into the press coverage during the Strangeways riot.

Though there was inter-prisoner violence in the first hours of the riot, torture on the scale suggested by many of the early reports did not take place."

After seeing this place, they changed the film's ending to take place at this mill where the doctor dies by suffocating under the milled flour.|$|E

30|$|This is, Utpaladeva tells us, {{because this}} kind of {{imagination}} ultimately relies {{on a kind of}} negation and contrast, knowing things by <b>chopping</b> <b>up</b> the world into various opposing conceptions, even if one then puts them back together in novel ways (Torella 2002 : 129). He then gives us a prescription which is designed to undercut his Buddhist philosophical opponents’ ideas of no-self, the Buddhist idea of identity as a product of difference, apoha. 3 Namely, Utpaladeva tells us that Recognition, in contrast, does not need the violence of exclusion, does not need that kind of thought predicated on <b>chopping</b> <b>up</b> the world, because instead it relies on the awareness of the ever-present reality of consciousness, a consciousness that undergirds the unifying sense of self. So we see imagination (by the way, along with memory) as a secondary operation enacted by a self hopelessly mired in a duality. This <b>chopping</b> <b>up</b> the world to fashion new things does not actually help, in Utpala’s estimation, on a path towards really recognizing one's own real self.|$|R

[...] Bradstreet also claimed that the Native Americans had accepted British sovereignty {{as a result of}} his negotiations, but Johnson believed that this had not been fully explained to the Native Americans and that further councils would be needed. Although Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region, his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive.|$|E

The song contains haunting backing vocals and an accompanying tambourine with the two rappers trading verses with the vocal riff playing over them.
