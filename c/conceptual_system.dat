Rather, it is a <b>conceptual</b> <b>system</b> possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."

This paper presents {{a theory of}} how conceptual structure may be acquired by an intelligent agent interacting with its environment in an unsupervised way. Categories of activities are learned, then abstractions over these categories result in concepts. The entire conceptual structure is based on activities. The meanings of concepts and of conceptualizations of activities are discussed.

David Hull’s {{analysis}} of conceptual change in science, as presented in his book, Science as a Process (1988), {{provides a useful}} framework for understanding one of the scien-tific controversies in which he actively and constructively intervened, the units of selection debates in evolutionary biology. What follows is {{a brief overview of}} those debates and some reflections on them. 1. Hull’s framework According to Hull’s view, conceptual change in science is best seen as a selection process among <b>conceptual</b> <b>systems</b> (1988). There must be variation among <b>conceptual</b> <b>systems,</b> and change in <b>conceptual</b> <b>systems</b> “is a function of the differential perpetuation of the elements that make up these systems” (p. 513). While it may be tempting to envision this selection process in terms of individual scientists, Hull claims that the regularities in the scientific process are best understood through social division of researchers into demes. That is, the structure of the scientific community participating in this selection process is one of nesting and overlapping informal groups (p. 366). Hul...|$|R
