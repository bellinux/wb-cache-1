40|$|AbstractThe force density method (FDM) is a {{classical}} method used in linear and nonlinear form. The linear approach presents a quick tool for finding <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> new shapes by solving {{a set of}} linear equilibrium equations for certain topology, boundary conditions and assumed cables force density. The nonlinear approach was introduced to solve <b>cable</b> <b>nets</b> under constraints (assigned certain distance between nodes, limit force or unstressed length in some elements). Any type of constraint introduces nonlinearity. This paper studied the prestressed <b>cable</b> <b>nets</b> and the loaded <b>cable</b> <b>nets.</b> For prestressed <b>cable</b> <b>nets,</b> coordinate constraints to all nodes of the <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> are introduced to modify the shape after graphically examining the preliminary shape. This preliminary shape resulted from linear analysis of assumed distribution of cable force densities. For analyzing <b>cable</b> <b>nets</b> under different load cases, the first load case is analyzed to achieve the coordinate constraints assigned to nodes. Analysis results are node coordinates, cable forces and lengths. Young’s modulus and areas of cables are {{used to calculate the}} unstressed length of all cables using materialization equations, those lengths are used as constraint in the analysis of other load cases. Forces in all cables under different load cases/combinations are calculated. By using this approach, design of <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> under static load is simplified...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of saddle-form <b>cable</b> <b>nets</b> is investigated in this paper. Even though they consist of cables, which {{are well known}} for their geometric nonlinearity, such systems could be characterized as weakly nonlinear due to {{the high levels of}} pretensioning of their cables and to their hyperbolic paraboloid surface, having opposite curvatures at all points and thus increased stiffness. Nevertheless, resonance phenomena that are typical of highly nonlinear systems are detected here, for common geometries and levels of pretension, even for low levels of load amplitude. First, a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> is studied analytically and numerically, and nonlinear resonances are confirmed. Then, the {{response of}} multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) <b>cable</b> <b>nets,</b> subjected to harmonic dynamic excitation, is investigated. Although the static response is proved to be almost linear, the dynamic nonlinearity is intense, as verified by jump phenomena, bending of the response curve, superharmonic resonances, and dependence on the initial conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the geometrically nonlinear dynamic behavior of a saddle form <b>cable</b> <b>net,</b> using an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom model. First, a symmetric simple <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> is assumed, consisting of two crossing cables, considering the vertical displacement of the central node as the only degree of freedom. The equation of motion is found to be similar to the one of the Duffing oscillator with a hardening cubic term. Next, a MDOF symmetric <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> model is considered, with fixed cable ends, having a circular plan view and forming a surface of a hyperbolic paraboloid. Harmonic external loads act vertically on every node of the net, with the same amplitude and time variation. Modal analyses are conducted in order to calculate the linear eigenfrequencies and the corresponding eigenmodes of the network. The nonlinear dynamic response of the <b>cable</b> <b>net</b> is obtained by performing time history analysis. Detecting nonlinear phenomena, such as bending of the response curve, jump phenomena, different response amplitudes according to the initial conditions, superharmonic or subharmonic resonances, demands much computational effort for different load amplitudes and ratios of loading frequency. Based on a method of approximate analysis for prediction of the response of <b>cable</b> <b>nets,</b> the MDOF model is transformed to an equivalent SDOF one, using similarity relations. The analytical solution of the single-degree-of-freedom model can provide, with minimum computational time, the basic information needed for nonlinear dynamic response, i. e. secondary resonances, jump phenomena, dependence on the initial conditions and the exact loading frequency for which the maximum steady state oscillation amplitude is obtained. The comparison between the two models by means of the steady state amplitude of the central node, demonstrates that the behavior of the SDOF model describes satisfactorily the one of the MDOF model, predicting the dominant nonlinear phenomena...|$|R
