5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Minoan eruption, {{the walls of the}} <b>caldera</b> formed a nearly {{continuous}} ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of Aspronisi. This cataclysmic eruption was centered on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the then-existing <b>caldera.</b> The northern part of the <b>caldera</b> was refilled by the volcanic ash and lava, then collapsed again.|$|E
5|$|Monte Burney {{is formed}} by a <b>caldera</b> with a glaciated {{stratovolcano}} on its rim. This stratovolcano in turn has a smaller <b>caldera.</b> An eruption is reported for 1910, with less certain eruptions in 1970 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{activity}} at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~3422mya, 2214mya and 95mya. Dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks <b>caldera,</b> 24myo Big John <b>caldera</b> and 23myo Monroe Peak <b>caldera</b> hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19myo Mount Belknap <b>caldera.</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that volcanoes are {{morphological}} expressions of magma composition, eruption processes, and regional tectonics. Thus, the lack of unambiguous silicic volcanoes and pyroclastic flows on Mars implies that compared to earth, its crust is deficient in volatiles and/or the planet lacks a thick granitic crust. Such deductions are examples of comparative planetology, in which knowledge of landforms and processes on one planet are utilized to interpret features and histories on others. In the present study <b>calderas</b> are considered in a comparative planetology context to provide perspective for students who investigate only terrestrial <b>calderas</b> and to search for broadscale relationships between <b>calderas</b> and planetary characteristics. Attention is given to terrestrial <b>calderas,</b> lunar <b>calderas,</b> Martian <b>calderas,</b> <b>calderas</b> on Jupiter's satellite Io, and <b>calderas</b> on Venus. A planetary definition of <b>calderas</b> is proposed...|$|R

The three main edifices are scoria cones, shield volcanoes, and stratovolcanoes. A chart shows {{the outline of}} each along with its composition and eruption type. The <b>calderas</b> described include Crater-Lake type <b>calderas</b> associated {{with the collapse of}} stratovolcanoes, basaltic <b>calderas</b> associated with the summit collapse of shield volcanoes, and resurgent <b>calderas</b> which lack an association with a single centralized vent.

5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the <b>caldera</b> floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. Sometime between 1850 and 1910, Tambora erupted again but only inside the <b>caldera.</b> Small lava flows and lava dome extrusions were formed. This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone inside the <b>caldera.</b> A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; Another very small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the alert level for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increasing activity was reported in the <b>caldera,</b> including earthquakes and smoke emissions.|$|E
5|$|The Purulla/El MÃ©dano ignimbrites have a precaldera {{lower layer}} that various methods have dated 20,000 to 5,000 years ago. This stage was effusive and {{accompanied}} by the emplacement of lava domes. A postcaldera stage is represented by lava domes on the southeast edge of the <b>caldera,</b> as well as block and ash flows inside the <b>caldera.</b> These are rhyolitic in composition. Their age is unknown, but postdates the <b>caldera</b> formation.|$|E
5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, which probably arose from magma ascending through the <b>caldera</b> forming conduits, seeing as these domes are found only inside the <b>caldera.</b> The elevated temperatures of the <b>caldera</b> lake suggest that hydrothermal activity still occurs beneath Incapillo.|$|E
50|$|The {{highest of}} these centres exceed 4500 m of altitude. Some of these volcanoes still display craters. Extrusive bodies such as lava domes are also found, {{as well as}} two <b>calderas</b> {{associated}} with stratovolcanoes. Smaller centres sometimes also have central <b>calderas</b> with extrusive domes, some of these <b>calderas</b> reach diameters of 2 - 3 km.|$|R
50|$|<b>Calderas</b> are {{a common}} feature on shield volcanoes. They are formed and {{reformed}} over the volcano's lifespan. Long eruptive periods form cinder cones, which then collapse over time to form <b>calderas.</b> The <b>calderas</b> are often filled up by future eruptions, or formed elsewhere, and this cycle of collapse and regeneration takes place throughout the volcano's lifespan.|$|R
50|$|Nemo Peak {{has formed}} several <b>calderas.</b> Two older ones reach diameters of 11 km and overlap each other, {{with an average}} {{elevation}} of the floor of 50 - 100 m. The Sovetskii ridge limits these <b>calderas</b> to the east. A pre-Nemo volcano is known as Mednyi. Glacial erosion has affected the older volcanic centres. Ignimbrites fill these <b>calderas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a <b>caldera</b> lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the <b>caldera</b> was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are {{visible in the}} lake. The Tandukbenua cone on the northwestern edge of the <b>caldera</b> has only sparse vegetation, {{suggesting}} a young age of several hundred years. Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1971 metres above sea level) on the south edge of the <b>caldera</b> is solfatarically active.|$|E
5|$|Geological {{evidence}} shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over {{several hundred thousand}} years before the Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled <b>caldera,</b> with numerous small islands forming the circle. The <b>caldera</b> would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of the large granite <b>calderas</b> to the 1050-1080 Ma volcanics has been postulated as {{one in which the}} granite <b>calderas</b> were the source for the intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks.|$|R
40|$|The Ethiopian Rift is {{characterized}} by several Quaternary <b>calderas.</b> Remote sensing and field analyses were used to investigate the regional structural control on three <b>calderas</b> (Fantale, Gariboldi, Gedemsa) in the axial part of the rift. These <b>calderas</b> are located along the Wonji Fault Belt (WFB), a zone of Quaternary NNE-SSW normal faults and extensional fractures. The three <b>calderas</b> show E-W elongation and major E-W vent alignments, oblique {{with regard to the}} mean NW-SE extension direction. No significant evidence of E-W tectonic structures has been found near the <b>calderas,</b> the only relevant systems being those of the WFB. Conversely, left-lateral E-W-trending faults are present at the rift borders and on the Nubia and Somalia plateaus, implying a predominant pre-rift activity. The E-W fractures were partly reactivated during rifting, possibly controlling the development of the magma chambers. Thus, the E-W elongation of the <b>calderas</b> would be the surface expression of such a control, rather than the result of regional extension. An evolutionary model on the role of different structures on magmatism at different crustal levels within the rift is proposed...|$|R
5|$|Since {{the major}} {{eruption}} ~70,000 years ago, eruptions of smaller magnitude have also occurred at Toba. The small cone of Pusukbukit formed on the southwestern {{margin of the}} <b>caldera</b> and lava domes. The most recent eruption may have been at Tandukbenua on the northwestern <b>caldera</b> edge, suggested {{by a lack of}} vegetation that could be due to an eruption within the last few hundred years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{orientations and}} ages of {{elongate}} summit <b>calderas</b> on major polygenetic volcanoes were compiled to document Miocene to Pleistocene Sh (minimum horizontal stress) directions {{on the western}} and northern flanks of the West Antarctic rift system. Miocene to Pleistocene summit <b>calderas</b> along the western Ross Sea show relatively consistent ENE long axis trends, which are at a high angle to the Transantarctic Mountain Front and parallel to the N 77 ÂºE Sh direction at Cape Roberts. The elongation directions of many Miocene to Pleistocene summit <b>calderas</b> in Marie Byrd Land parallel the alignment of polygenetic volcanoes in which they occur, except several Pleistocene <b>calderas</b> with consistent NNE to NE trends. The overall pattern of elongate <b>calderas</b> in Marie Byrd Land is probably due {{to a combination of}} structurally controlled orientations and regional stress fields in which Sh is oriented NNE to NE at a moderate to high angle to the trace of the West Antarctic rift system...|$|R

5|$|The volcano {{was active}} again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918, before its next major {{eruption}} in 1918â1919. Halemaumau, then a small upwelling in the <b>caldera</b> floor, was {{topped by a}} lava lake that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching {{the top edge of}} the <b>caldera</b> before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the <b>caldera</b> over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.|$|E
5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at KÄ«lauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit <b>caldera,</b> its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of KÄ«lauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near KÄ«lauea's summit <b>caldera.</b> Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to KÄ«lauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E

5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its <b>caldera.</b> The <b>caldera</b> is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the <b>caldera,</b> and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a <b>caldera</b> nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley <b>Caldera</b> 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and {{explosion}} pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber {{like the one that}} produced the massive Long Valley <b>Caldera</b> eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley <b>Caldera</b> indicated renewed activity in the area.|$|E
