5|$|<b>Cloverleaf</b> {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. <b>Cloverleaf</b> Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, <b>Cloverleaf</b> filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|MD 10 {{continues}} {{north from}} MD 177 through {{the east side}} of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road) north then meets the latter highway at a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The sweeping ramp from MD 10 to westbound I-695 merges into a collector-distributor lane that allows access from MD 10 to northbound MD 2 in Brooklyn Park.|$|E
5|$|The MD58 {{interchange}} may {{be converted}} from a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange to a diamond interchange.|$|E

5|$|As {{the highway}} heads north from the {{channels}} surrounding {{the west end}} of South Oyster Bay, it runs along {{the west side of the}} Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve and the Merrick Road Park Golf Course, both of which are separated from the Meadowbrook by a small creek. The golf course leads to nearby exitM9, a <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Merrick Road (unsigned County Route27 or CR27) in the Freeport section of Hempstead. Not far to the north is exitM8, another <b>cloverleaf</b> serving NY27 (East Sunrise Highway). After crossing the adjacent Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the parkway continues north across East Meadow Park to reach exitM7, a <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with the Babylon Turnpike (unsigned CR7A). After exitM7, the Meadowbrook makes a slight turn to the northwest as it traverses Roosevelt Preserve County Park.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west, the Meadowbrook State Parkway enters exitM2, a <b>cloverleaf</b> {{interchange}} with Zeckendorf Boulevard (unsigned CR260) {{adjacent to}} nearby Roosevelt Field Mall. Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exitM2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound {{direction of the}} parkway has only one exit, exitM2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the <b>cloverleaf,</b> the parkway winds back to the northwest as it approaches exitM1, a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Old Country Road (unsigned CR25) {{on the border between}} the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place. Just north of the community, the Meadowbrook reaches exit31A of the Northern State Parkway, a semi-directional T interchange that serves as {{the north end of the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway.|$|E
5|$|I-97 {{continues}} {{north as}} a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled {{on the east}} by Veterans Highway on {{the western edge of}} Severna Park. The highways cross Severn Run within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate's partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Benfield Boulevard; access from northbound I-97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway. I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway's northern end at I-97's partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway) and New Cut Road. The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Business. The freeway continues north along the west side of Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 (Quarterfield Road) at a four-ramp partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange and MD 100 at a cloverstack interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I-97.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, the state {{highways}} running concurrent with US 1/9 were removed, while Route 25T became US 1/9 Truck and Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel became US 1/9 Business (now Route 139). In 1964, the US 1/9 {{approaches to the}} George Washington Bridge, which were shared with US 46 on the New Jersey side, were rebuilt into a freeway that {{became a part of}} I-95. Between February 2006 and November 2008, the <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Route 35 in Woodbridge Township, which was the first <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of US 1/9 was a part of Route 25, was replaced with a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange, costing $34 million.|$|E
5|$|MD32's {{interchange}} with I-70 will {{be transformed}} from a diamond interchange to a partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with free-flowing ramps from MD32 to I-70.|$|E
5|$|Repeated American attacks {{resulted}} in a stalemate. By the morning of 7 August, North Koreans were able to press forward and capture the <b>Cloverleaf</b> Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, a newly arrived unit, {{was sent to the}} region. 24th Infantry Division commander Major General John H. Church immediately ordered it to attack the Naktong Bulge salient. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of <b>Cloverleaf</b> Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E

50|$|In April 2002, it was {{announced}} that Selma was the recipient of a team in the newly formed Southeastern League of Professional Baseball. For their inaugural season Merritt Bowden served as the manager. On May 27, 2002, the <b>Cloverleafs</b> played the Montgomery Wings in an exhibition game, marking the first professional baseball game to be played within the city since the original <b>Cloverleafs</b> folded in 1962. The season would officially begin on May 31, 2002, against the Americus Arrows on opening night, with Selma mayor James Perkins, Jr. throwing out the opening pitch. Dennis Gomez was the starting pitcher for the 'Leafs. Throwing 6 innings with 8 K's and giving up 1 earned run, picking up the win and closer Tony Macon pitched the top of the ninth inning to earn the save. Both feats were firsts for the <b>Cloverleafs</b> since the 1960s..The opening series drew over 2,000 fans to the stadium before the teams would embark on an 18-game roadtrip.|$|R
50|$|As Sunrise Highway was {{upgraded}} {{during the}} 1970s and 1980s many interchanges were redesigned and replaced. The original interchange with the Robert Moses Causeway in West Islip had two parkway-style arch bridges over two lanes of NY 27. When the service roads {{were built in}} Western Islip Township between 1969 and 1972, parkway-style bridges were added for them as well. The interchanges at Fifth Ave and Brentwood Road in Bay Shore had parkway-style arch bridges and <b>cloverleafs.</b> When the service roads were added, the parkway-style bridges were removed and replaced with the modern structures that exist today and the original <b>cloverleafs</b> were modified to align with the new service roads.|$|R
5|$|Route55 {{continues}} between {{rural areas}} near the Maurice River {{to the west}} and development to the east, coming to a <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Route56. Past this interchange, the route passes over a Winchester & Western Railroad line before crossing over CR540. Farther north, a modified <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange serves CR674 (Garden Road), which provides access to the northern part of Vineland. Past the Garden Road interchange, Route55 continues through farmland and woodland, passing to the east of Rudys Airport. The freeway crosses Scotland Run and briefly runs through Pittsgrove Township in Salem County.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{crossing}} into Oneida County, NY8 intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Bridgewater. The route continues northward, {{passing through}} Cassville and Clayville {{before becoming a}} limited-access highway just north of Clayville. Near Sauquoit, NY8 has exits for Pinnacle Road and Elm Street prior to entering the Utica suburbs. In New Hartford, the route has an exit with Genesee Street prior to meeting NY5 and NY12 at a <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange southwest of downtown Utica. While the right-of-way of NY8 continues to the northeast through the <b>cloverleaf</b> as NY840, NY8 joins NY5 and NY12 as the three routes enter downtown on the NorthSouth Arterial.|$|E
5|$|The US40 and Showalter Road {{interchanges}} {{would be}} {{changed from a}} full <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange to a partial interchange by removing the two loop ramps from the crossroad onto I-81.|$|E
50|$|Its {{lineup of}} teams {{in its final}} season {{included}} the champion Pensacola Fliers, Meridian Millers, Montgomery Rebels, Jackson Senators, Vicksburg Billies, Selma <b>Cloverleafs,</b> Gadsden Pilots and Anniston Rams.

50|$|He also {{assisted}} in making Deerfoot Trail a safer road by implementing plans for proper intersections and <b>cloverleafs.</b> Since returning to private life, Leslie has resumed his real estate appraisal business {{and lived in}} Calgary with his wife, the former Jean Logan, whom he married in 1942.|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{compilation}} of known tRNA, and tRNA gene sequences from archaebacteria, eubac-teria, and eukaryotes permits {{the construction of}} tRNA <b>cloverleafs</b> which show conserved structural elements for each tRNA family. Positions conserved across the three kingdoms are thought o represent archetypical features of tRNAs which preceded the divergence of these kingdoms...|$|R
5|$|The nearby Hurontario Street {{interchange}} was upgraded from a <b>cloverleaf</b> to a parclo A4 on {{the south}} side and a diamond interchange on the north side. Work was completed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1995, Rosecroft {{was forced}} to cut costs. Its owners lowered the amount of purse money, {{eliminated}} stake races, and {{reduced the number of}} racing days. They decided to sell both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs to <b>Cloverleaf</b> Enterprises, a horseman's organization, in mid-1995 for $11 million. Weisman's Colt Enterprises reported that if the racetrack could not be sold, the company would have to file for bankruptcy. <b>Cloverleaf</b> accepted a $10.6 million loan from Bally Entertainment in hopes that a casino would be allowed at Rosecroft.|$|E
5|$|American counterattacks {{continued}} into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather {{and a lack of}} food and water. The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the <b>Cloverleaf</b> Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the bulge. 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of <b>Cloverleaf</b> Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{deficient}} interchange along I-264 was the I-65, Kentucky Exposition Center and Louisville International Airport exit. Before the reconstruction, two <b>cloverleafs</b> with no {{collector and}} distributor lanes existed and posed serious weaving issues. The interchange today has been rebuilt and features numerous flyovers and collector and distributor lanes, making it safer, {{though not necessarily}} easier to navigate.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 a {{new version}} of the team was charter members of the Southeastern League of Professional Baseball. They played their home games in Selma, Alabama, at Bloch Park. The team left Selma after playing only three games in 2003 and playing the {{remainder}} of that season as the Southeastern <b>Cloverleafs</b> before folding at season's end.|$|R
50|$|The Arrows {{would begin}} their {{season on the}} road against the Selma <b>Cloverleafs</b> on May 31, 2002, on opening night. The first home game would take place later that week on June 4. However, after only about 30 games the team was disbanded due to {{financial}} problems and low attendance. The team officially folded on July 2.|$|R
5|$|In West Friendship, {{northbound}} MD32 {{would have}} {{half of a}} partial <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD144. Access between MD144 and southbound MD32 would be via a right-in/right-out interchange with a frontage road. MD144's intersections with the frontage road and the ramps to and from northbound MD32 will be roundabouts.|$|E
5|$|In early Fall 2014 VDOT {{will start}} work at Route 37's {{southern}} terminus' exit at I-81. They will extend Route 37 north {{to a new}} diamond interchange with Front Royal Pike (US 522). Then Route 37 will continue northward to Millwood Pike (US 50/ US 17) and have another diamond interchange. The next exit will be at Senseny Road (State Route 657) with another diamond interchange. The next and final exit will be a half <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half <b>cloverleaf</b> because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). The problem with this is that the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, <b>Cloverleaf</b> {{tried to}} sell Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested in the}} track, but <b>Cloverleaf</b> was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One bidder was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining bidder was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft was not one of the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law. As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E
50|$|Bloch Park is a {{baseball}} stadium in Selma, Alabama, United States. The Selma <b>Cloverleafs</b> {{of the independent}} Southeastern League of Professional Baseball played here before folding prior to the 2003 season. Professional baseball was also played here in the 1940s-60s {{as part of the}} Alabama-Florida League. Then venue was also home to the summer collegiate Selma Toros from 2002-2005. The team will resume play in May 2013.|$|R
25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{congested}} roads are Hooper Avenue and Route 37. Route 37 sees extra traffic from travelers to the Jersey shore during the summertime, due to it being a main artery to the shore from the Garden State Parkway at interchange 82. The township {{is also home to}} one of the state's only at-grade <b>cloverleafs,</b> at the intersection of Hooper Avenue and County Route 571 (Bay Avenue).|$|R
50|$|Caltrans favors {{this form}} for some recent projects, {{for example the}} {{reconstruction}} of I-880 and other highways in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area. They often replaced previous full <b>cloverleafs.</b> All exiting traffic for both directions has a relatively straight ramp and is controlled by a traffic light. Running off the road on an entering ramp is much less likely than on an exiting ramp. Metering lights are a common feature on the entering ramps.|$|R
