5|$|European studies {{conducted}} after the 1986 <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster {{have shown that}} the fruit bodies have a high rate of accumulation of the radioactive isotope cesium.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Byelorussian SSR {{was exposed}} to {{significant}} nuclear fallout from the explosion at the <b>Chernobyl</b> power plant in the neighboring Ukrainian SSR.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the price of}} uranium had fallen, {{and the costs of}} nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} seemed to have won its case. The Campaign Against Nuclear Energy disbanded itself in 1988, two years after the <b>Chernobyl</b> Disaster.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{used the}} music to {{illustrate}} stories on the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster the following year. Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen performed the movie's main theme with the National Philharmonic Orchestra during the 24 Nights period in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
5|$|Caesium-137, with a {{half-life}} of 30.17years, {{is one of}} the {{two principal}} medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the <b>Chernobyl</b> accident. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 {{has been used as a}} tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of tritium. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear power plant. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|During her career, Ono {{also has}} collaborated with Earl Slick, David Tudor, Fred DeAsis, and Richard Maxfield. As a dance music artist, Ono {{has worked with}} re-mixers/producers {{including}} Basement Jaxx, Bill Kates, Keiji Haino, Nick Vernier Band, Billy Martin, DJ Spooky, Apples in Stereo, Damien Price, DJ <b>Chernobyl,</b> Bimbo Jones, DJ Dan, Craig Armstrong, Jorge Artajo, Shuji Nabara, and Konrad Behr.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2010 President Yanukovych {{appointed}} Viktor Baloha (United Centre) Minister of Emergencies and Minister of the Protection of the Population {{from the}} <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster. According to Baloha {{this did not}} mean his party would join the coalition. Early 2010 United Centre had rejected any possibility of joining a parliamentary coalition with the Communist Party of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This {{has been the case}} worldwide because of accidents like the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a body found in sewage after being reassigned to different departments. Their inquiry results in {{the discovery of a}} bizarre fluke-like man—the product of the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster—that soon goes on a rampage in the sewers of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{resources}} include peat deposits, {{small quantities}} {{of oil and}} natural gas, granite, dolomite (limestone), marl, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory, and {{about a fifth of}} Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of caesium-137.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, {{berkelium}} {{is mostly}} concentrated in certain areas, which {{were used for}} the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, {{as well as at the}} sites of nuclear incidents, such as the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the <b>Chernobyl</b> incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, {{and it is}} still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|In October 1985, Mézières was {{contacted}} by the German director Peter Fleischmann who proposed to adapt Russians Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's 1964 novel Hard to Be a God into a film. This {{was to be the}} first major German-Soviet co-production. Mézières travelled to Moscow to join the production team and also to Uzbekistan where it was proposed to shoot the film. Travelling from there to Munich, he produced several concept drawings and paintings over a three-month period before the project was suspended due to funding difficulties. At this point Mézières left the production and returned to France. Filming was eventually scheduled to begin in April 1986 in Kiev and Mézières re-joined the production, creating storyboards for some scenes. However, at this time the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster occurred only 100km from Kiev and production was again halted. The film was eventually finished in 1989, but Mézières' concepts were barely used. Again, many of Mézières' designs were later published in Les Extras de Mézières.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{strontium}} is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their abundance increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E
5|$|That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal's van unrestrained, but {{it kills}} {{the driver and}} escapes to a local campsite. The flukeman hides in a {{portable}} toilet and is suctioned into a truck's tank {{the next day when}} the toilet is drained. Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing it in half. Scully concludes her investigation, thinking that the creature was brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage material from <b>Chernobyl,</b> and that the creature was created in a 'soup' of radioactive sewage. Elsewhere, the flukeman's remains open its eyes.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from <b>Chernobyl,</b> Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied <b>Chernobyl</b> and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} {{evacuated}} on 27 April 1986, 30 {{hours after the}} <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster at the <b>Chernobyl</b> Nuclear Power Plant which was the most disastrous nuclear accident in history. The power plant was within the <b>Chernobyl</b> Raion district. Pripyat, a city larger {{and closer to the}} power plant than <b>Chernobyl,</b> had been built as home for the power plant workers. After the accident, administration of the <b>Chernobyl</b> Raion district was transferred to the neighboring Ivankiv Raion. The city of Slavutych, built for those evacuated from Pripyat, received the population relocated from <b>Chernobyl.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chernobyl</b> {{city was}} {{evacuated}} {{soon after the}} disaster. The base {{of operations for the}} administration and monitoring of the <b>Chernobyl</b> Exclusion Zone was moved from Pripyat to <b>Chernobyl.</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> currently contains offices for the State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management and accommodations for visitors. Apartment blocks have been repurposed as accommodations for employees of the State Agency. The length of time that workers may spend within the <b>Chernobyl</b> Exclusion Zone is restricted by regulations that have been implemented to limit exposure to radiation.|$|E
25|$|Disasters {{have played}} a part in the {{abandonment}} of settlements within Europe. After the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster of 1986, the cities of Pripyat and <b>Chernobyl</b> were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and <b>Chernobyl</b> has around 500 remaining inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{radioactivity}} released {{ranged from}} 10–40% of that of <b>Chernobyl.</b> The significantly contaminated area was 10-12% of that of <b>Chernobyl.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to one expert, {{the release}} of {{radioactivity}} is about one-tenth that from the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster and the contaminated area is also about one-tenth that of <b>Chernobyl.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chernobyl</b> had a {{population}} of 10,800 in 1898, including 7,200 Jews. <b>Chernobyl</b> was occupied in World War I; Ukrainians and Bolsheviks fought over {{the city in the}} ensuing Civil War. In the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–20, <b>Chernobyl</b> was taken first by the Polish Army and then by cavalry of the Red Army. From 1921 onwards, it was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR.|$|E
25|$|The isotope {{signature}} of the release looks {{very different from that}} of the <b>Chernobyl</b> accident: the Japanese accident has released much less of the involatile plutonium, minor actinides and fission products than <b>Chernobyl</b> did.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} for hydro scarification is for decontamination, as for example is {{planned to be}} used in the <b>Chernobyl</b> New Safe Confinement for the concrete of Unit 4 of the <b>Chernobyl</b> Nuclear Power Plant.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the United Nations Development Programme {{launched}} a project, called the <b>Chernobyl</b> Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP), for {{the recovery of}} the affected areas. The program, initiated in February 2002, based its activities on the Human Consequences of the <b>Chernobyl</b> Nuclear Accident report recommendations. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to mitigate the long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster. CRDP works in the four areas of Ukraine that have been most affected by the <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear accident: Kiev Oblast, Zhytomyrska Oblast, partially Kiev, Chernihivska Oblast, and Rivne Oblast.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chernobyl</b> was {{originally}} {{part of the}} land of Kievan Rus′. The first known mention of <b>Chernobyl</b> is from a 1193 charter, which describes it as a hunting-lodge of Knyaz Rurik Rostislavich. In the 13th century, it was a crown village of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The village was granted to Filon Kmita, a captain of the royal cavalry, as a fiefdom in 1566. The province where <b>Chernobyl</b> is located was transferred to the Kingdom of Poland in 1569, and later annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. Prior to the 20th century, <b>Chernobyl</b> was inhabited by Ukrainian, some Polish peasants and a relatively large number of Jewish people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, <b>Chernobyl</b> became a major center of Hasidic Judaism. The <b>Chernobyl</b> Hasidic dynasty had been founded by Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky. The Jewish {{population}} suffered greatly from pogroms in October 1905 and in March–April 1919; many Jews were killed or robbed at the instigation of the Russian nationalist Black Hundreds. When the Twersky Dynasty left <b>Chernobyl</b> in 1920, it ceased to exist as a centre of Hasidism.|$|E
25|$|Between 1929 and 1933, <b>Chernobyl</b> {{suffered}} from killings during Stalin's collectivization campaign. It was also {{affected by the}} famine that resulted from Stalin's policies. The Polish community of <b>Chernobyl</b> was deported to Kazakhstan in 1936, during the Frontier Clearances.|$|E
