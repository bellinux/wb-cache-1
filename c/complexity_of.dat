5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> these diverse phenomena, where a gene {{is defined as a}} union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E
30|$|The <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the direct, RBS and UOV-R {{attacks were}} {{discussed}} by Petzoldt et al.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the state <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> union and {{intersection}} combined with star and reversal, respectively.

5|$|Due to the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> {{building}} a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching {{them how to}} assemble special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks.

40|$|A right {{ideal is}} a {{language}} L over an alphabet A that satisfies L = LA*. We {{show that there}} exists a stream (sequence) (R_n : n > 3) of regular right ideal languages, where R_n has n left quotients and is most complex under the following measures of complexity: the state <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the left quotients, the number of atoms (intersections of complemented and uncomplemented left quotients), the state <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the atoms, {{the size of the}} syntactic semigroup, the state <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the operations of reversal, star, and product, and the state <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> all binary boolean operations. In that sense, this stream of right ideals is a universal witness. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
30|$|We {{have also}} {{compared}} the <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the proposed methods {{with those of}} M-CLMS when M= 2, 4, 8, and D-CLMS schemes in [49]. Note that the <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes are 3 MN+ 5 M+ 1 and 10 N+ 3 respectively and that these complexities also increase by an amount of 2 MN+ 5 M−N+ 3 when the transfer and momentum terms are implemented. In these figures, {{it can be seen}} that the <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes are advantageous comparing to the R-CMLF and D-CMLF schemes mainly due to the well known simplicity of LMS filters, and this advantage becomes larger with increasing number of combining filters (M). However, it can be also noted that the <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> transfer and momentum terms are comparable to those of the core M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes, and therefore, the addition of transfer and momentum terms influences the <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes more noticeably.|$|R
