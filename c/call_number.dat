25|$|Before World War Two the US {{had long}} used {{colorful}} unit marking on both its Army and Navy aircraft. In {{mid to late}} 1941, both services increased the use of camouflage colors and decreased its use of colorful markings. Tail designators on Army planes standardized on a radio <b>call</b> <b>number</b> (RCN) derived from the military serial number. Some aircraft were identified by numbers painted on their fuselage. Local radio procedures sometimes added additional numbers or lettering somewhere visible on the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Badges of rank {{are usually}} worn on the epaulettes. However, when in formal uniform sergeants wear their rank {{insignia}} on their upper sleeves. When police tunics had closed collars (not open collars as worn with ties), constables and sergeants did not wear epaulettes but had their divisional <b>call</b> <b>number</b> on their collar (whence {{they are still}} {{often referred to as}} collar numbers). Sergeants wore their stripes on their upper sleeve. Inspectors and more senior ranks wore epaulettes at a much earlier stage, although they once wore their rank insignia on their collars. Most forces no longer use divisional call numbers, and retain only the collar number and rank insignia.|$|E

Different numbering schemes work differently, for example Zetron uses the first two digits of the Ident as the fleet number, and the last two digits as the unit number. Idents in the 6,000-6,999 range are typically used to establish group calls. After it has been entered the <b>call</b> <b>number</b> will be converted in the mobile to a 20-bit address.
