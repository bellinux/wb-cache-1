25|$|Until {{the decline}} of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, {{performance}} art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.|$|E
25|$|Samuel {{initially}} appointed his {{two sons}} as his successors; however, just like Eli's sons, Samuel's proved unworthy. The Israelites rejected them. Because of the external threat from other tribes, such as the Philistines, the tribal leaders decided {{that there was a}} need for a more unified, central government, and demanded Samuel appoint a king so that they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> other nations. Samuel interpreted this as a personal rejection, and at first was reluctant to oblige, until reassured by a divine revelation. He warned the people of the potential negative consequences of such a decision. When Saul and his servant were searching for his father's lost asses, the servant suggested consulting the nearby Samuel. Samuel recognized Saul as the future king.|$|E

The article speculated that the potential cultural impact of Gravity <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> that of Kanye West after his 2007 competition with 50 Cent. The writer, Steven Patton, stated that [...] "we may be on the cusp of another watershed moment this coming September. Two artists living in Atlanta and largely the front runners of two different ideologies are releasing a new album on the same day." [...] A few hours after being posted, the article was updated stating that the release date for Trouble Man was being pushed back to September 19. However, the release date was subsequently returned to September 4, before T.I. announced that he was pushing the album back indefinitely. Trouble Man ultimately was released on December 18, 2012, and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 179,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt like it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, {{it is kind of}} hard to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me {{what you want me to}} buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
500|$|Since his {{appearance}} in Final Fantasy XII, Balthier has received mostly positive reception. When {{he was first}} revealed, the fan response was very positive. GameSpy's Justin Speer described him as a [...] "clever-bastard type", praising his wry delivery. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called Balthier the best character in the game, describing him as the [...] "Auron of the cast". 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish called Final Fantasy XII protagonist Vaan annoying, placing the duo of Balthier and Fran above him. 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister stated Balthiers presence in Final Fantasy XII helped ease some fans dislike of the [...] "angsty teen" [...] behavior of the main character Vaan. PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that while Vaan is the main character, he usually takes a back seat, adding that Balthier {{is the closest thing}} to a male lead. For similar reasons, GameZone listed Balthier as the tenth best Final Fantasy character, emphasizing how Balthier becomes [...] "as much the leading man as Vaan." [...] PALGN's Phil Larsen commented that though a lofty prediction, he expected that the duo of Balthier and Fran would [...] "go down in history as one of the greatest duos of modern narrative storytelling". Balthier ranked ninth on IGN's top 25 best Final Fantasy characters, ranking higher than any other character from Final Fantasy XII. Editor Dave Smith commented that he makes a [...] "convincing case" [...] that he is the main hero, upstaging fellow playable characters due to his [...] "sharp looks and even sharper wit." [...] GamesRadar'sAJ Glasser listed Balthier and Fran as one of her favourite Final Fantasy couples, describing theirs as being a well-balanced relationship. Destructoid's Aaron Linde noted that few video game characters had both his intelligence and his common sense, and wished more male characters in gaming <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> him.|$|E

500|$|Snezhnevsky, {{the most}} {{prominent}} theorist of Soviet psychiatry {{and director of the}} Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria. A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of psychopathy, hypochondria, depersonalization or anxiety were central to it. Symptoms referred to as part of the [...] "negative axis" [...] included pessimism, poor social adaptation, and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of [...] "sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms." [...] According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye. Thereby patients with non-psychotic mental disorders, or even persons who were not mentally sick, could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia. Along with paranoia, sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters. As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since the illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards. As a consequence, schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries, as the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia reported in 1973. The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow. In particular, the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense. Their symptoms <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character. The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society. Thereby, sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as [...] "reform delusions," [...] "perseverance," [...] and [...] "struggle for the truth." [...] As Viktor Styazhkin reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient [...] "develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an academy of human happiness, and many other projects for the benefit of mankind." ...|$|E

2500|$|The infamous {{exchange}} between McCartney and Harrison occurred on Monday, January 6. Around lunchtime on Friday, January 10, tensions {{came to a}} head and Harrison told the others that he was leaving the band. [...] This entire episode is omitted from the film. He later recalled: [...] "I thought, 'I'm quite capable of being happy on my own, and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation I'm getting out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'." [...] Rehearsals and filming continued for a few more sessions; the finished film only used a small amount of footage from this period, namely a boogie-woogie piano duet by McCartney and Starr, although it was included in a way such that Harrison's absence was not apparent. [...] While he was gone, the others considered replacing him with guitarist Eric Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to Lennon, who was captured on tape saying that if: [...] "George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play”, and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that the Beatles, unlike Clapton's previous band Cream, “would give him full scope to play his guitar.” [...] Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: “There may have been [...] The problem with that was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, as if I was the fastest gun. So, I don’t think I could have been brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George’s.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Official synopsis: [...] "After one of {{his friends}} is killed in Iraq, Geoffrey Waters prays for help in {{understanding}} God's purpose for humanity. He is whisked forward in time to witness what a world <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> when the prophesies from Isaiah bring about peace on earth, and the lines 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' come to fruition. The people on the planet he visits explain that God's kingdom will be established on Earth no matter what, even if a horrible calamity must occur." [...] The Bahá'í author notes that this book is her impression of what the future may be like based on the premise of fulfilled Biblical prophecy, with specifics from Bahá'í sources. There are several quotes and paraphrases from the Bahá'í Writings as well as examples of attitudes among various characters that believe as guided by these references, and the book was approved by the Special Materials Review Committee. Directly it only refers to the Bahá'í Faith as one of many religions mentioned in the foreword (which also mentions that it is meant to be the first of a trilogy.) Internally the strongest reference perhaps {{is the name of the}} Book of the religion of the future - [...] "Qadas", which is similar to [...] "Aqdas" [...] - the central Book of Laws, of the Bahá'í Faith. However [...] "Qadas" [...] could also be rather more obscure references ("the holiness of God", or a Muslim style of prayer for example.) The overall feel of the story is much like Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time - of grand themes being played out not through technological achievements, but of spiritual beings and achievements. Ralya has also published children’s stories, two full-length musicals, a weekly newspaper column in a Minnesota paper for about 2 years, and a novel for 9- to 15-year-olds which also has significant reference to the Bahá'í Faith.|$|E
