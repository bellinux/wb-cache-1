40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} thermal maturity {{pattern has}} been investigated and the hydrocarbon generation potential assessed for the Permian and Triassic sequences of the southern Bowen and northern Gunnedah Basins and {{the lower part of}} the overlying Jurassic Cretaceous Surat Basin sequence in northern New South Wales. An oil-source rock correlation also {{has been investigated}} in the Gunnedah Basin. Vitrinite reflectance measurements were conducted on 256 samples from 28 boreholes. A total of 50 of these samples were subjected to Rock-Eval pyrolysis analysis, and 28 samples extracted for additional organic geochemical studies (GCMS). A re-evaluation of the stratigraphy in the southern Bowen Basin and a stratigraphic correlation between that area and the northern Gunnedah Basin was also included in the study. An overpressured shaly interval has been identified as a marker bed within the lower parts of the Triassic Moolayember and Napperby Formations, in the Bowen and Gunnedah Basins respectively. Suppressed vitrinite reflectance in the Permian sequence was used as another marker for mapping the stratigraphic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin. The Permian sequence in the Bowen Basin thins to the south, and probably pinches out over the Moree High and also to the west. The coal-bearing Kianga Formation is present in the north and northeastern parts of the study area. A disconformity surface between Digby and Napperby Formations in the Gunnedah Basin is probably time-equivalent to deposition of the Clematis Group and Showgrounds Sandstone in the Bowen Basin. The Clematis Group is absent in the study area, and the Moolayember Formation considered equivalent to the Napperby Formation. Although in many cases core samples were not available, handpicking of coal or shaly materials from cuttings samples where geophysical log signatures identify these materials helped in reducing contamination from <b>caved</b> <b>debris.</b> Histogram plots of reflectance also helped where the target and <b>caved</b> <b>debris</b> were of similar lithology. Vertical profiles of the vitrinite reflectance identified suppressed intervals in the study area due to marine influence (Back Creek Group and Maules Creek Formation) and liptinite rich source organic matter (Goonbri Formation). The suppression occurs due to the perhydrous character of the preserved organic matter. High reflectance values were noted within intrusion-affected intervals, and two types of igneous intrusion profiles were identified; these are simple and complex profiles. An isoreflectance map for the non-suppressed interval at the base of the Triassic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin shows that the organic matter is mature more towards the east close to the Goondiwindi Fault, and also towards the west where the Triassic sequence directly overlies the basement. High values also occur over the Gil Gil Ridge in the middle, to the south over the Moree High, and to the north where the sequence is thicker. The reflectance gradient in the suppressed intervals is higher than in the overlying non-suppressed sequences, especially when the rank has resulted from burial depth. Tmax from Rock-Eval pyrolysis was found to be lower in the perhydrous intervals, and was high in mature and igneous intrusion-affected intervals. Based on the source potential parameters, the Permian Back Creek Group is a better source than the Kianga Formation, while the Goonbri Formation is better than the Maules Creek Formation. The Triassic Napperby Formation has a fair capacity to generate oil, and is considered a better source rock than the equivalent Moolayember Formation. The Jurassic Walloon Coal Measures is a better source than Evergreen Formation, and has the best source rock characteristics, but is immature. The Rock-Eval S 1 value shows better correlation with extracted hydrocarbon compounds (saturated and aromatics) than the total extractable organic matter. This suggests that solvent extraction has a greater ability to extract NSO compounds than temperature distillation over the Rock-Eval S 1 interval. Terrestrial organic matter is the main source input for the sequences studied. This has been identified from organic petrology and from the n-alkane distributions and the relatively high C 29 steranes and low sterane/hopane ratios. The absence of marine biomarker signatures in the Permian marine influenced sequence, could be attributed to their dilution by overwhelming amounts of non-marine organic matter. A mainly oxic to suboxic depositional environment is inferred from trace amounts of 25 -NH, BNH and TNH. This is further supported by relatively high pr/ph ratios. Although C 29 /C 30 is generally regarded as an environmental indicator, high values were noted in intrusion-affected samples. The 22 S and 20 S ratios were inverted ¡¥reaches pseudo-equilibrium¡¦ in such rapidly heated, high maturity samples. The ratio of C 24 tetracyclic terpane to C 21 -C 26 tricyclic terpanes decreases, instead of increasing, within the Napperby Formation close to a major igneous intrusive body. The 22 S ratio, which is faster in reaction than the other terpane and sterane maturity parameters, shows that the Permian sequence lies within the oil generation stage in the Bowen Basin, except for a Kianga Formation sample. The Triassic sequence is marginally mature, and the Jurassic sequence is considered immature. In the Gunnedah Basin, the Permian sequence in Bellata- 1 and Bohena- 1, and the Triassic sequence in Coonarah- 1 A, lie within the oil generation range. In the intrusion-affected high maturity samples, the ratio is reaches pseudo-equilibrium. This and other terpane and sterane maturity parameters are not lowered (suppressed) in the perhydrous intervals. The ÒÒ sterane ratio, however, is slowest in reaction to maturity, and variations in low maturity samples are mainly due to facies changes. Diasterane/sterane ratios, in the current study, increase with increasing TOC content up to 5 % TOC, but decrease in rocks with higher TOC contents including coals. Highly mature samples, as expected, in both cases are anomalous with high ratios. Calculated vitrinite reflectance based on the method of Radke and Welte (1983), as well as MPI 1 and MPI 2, shows the best comparison to observed values. These aromatic maturity parameters are lowered within the reflectance-suppressed intervals. Oil stains in the Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone in the Bellata- 1 well have been identified as being indigenous and not due to contamination. The vitrinite reflectance calculated to the oil stain suggests that the source rock should be within a late mature zone. Such high maturity levels are only recognised within intrusion-affected intervals. A close similarity between the oil stain sample and the intruded interval of the Napperby Formation is evident from the thermal maturity and biomarker content. Hydrocarbon generation and expulsion from {{the lower part of the}} Napperby Formation as a result of igneous intrusion effects is suggested as the source of the oil in this particular occurrence. Terpane and sterane maturity parameters increase with increasing burial depth in the intervals with suppressed (perhydrous) vitrinite reflectance. The generation maturity parameters also increase through intervals with perhydrous vitrinite, which suggests that hydrocarbons continue to be generated and the actual amount is increasing even though traditional rank ¡¥stress¡¦ maturity parameters are lowered. Accordingly, the Permian sequences in the lower part of the Bowen Basin are at least within the peak oil generation zone, and probably within late oil generation in the north and northeast of the study area. To generate significant amounts of hydrocarbon, however, the thickness of the shaly and coaly intervals in the Permian sequence is probably a critical parameter. In the Gunnedah Basin, a significant amount of hydrocarbon generation is probably only possible as a result of igneous intrusions...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} 12 {{histoplasmosis}} outbreaks {{that occurred in}} the Colombian Andean region, are presented. According to their location, 3 were detected in each of the following states: Tolima, Caldas and Antioquia and 1 each in Cundinamarca, Boyacá and Risaralda. In 9 of the outbreaks it was possible to trace the following activities which led to the infection: visits to bat-inhabited <b>caves,</b> removing <b>debris</b> incide a hollowed tree, demolition of an old house, use of contaminated lime for fertilization, handling chickenmanure fettilised soil and the severe pruning of coffee trees. Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum was isolated from environmental samples in 5 of the 8 outbreaks where it was feasible to obtain material for culture and animal inoculation. It was found that 332 persons had been in contact with the various infectious sources, including the 11 index cases (2 outbreaks had the same index case). All of them were studied by means of immunological tests designed to detect antibodies; based on the findings of reactive tests, al 1 the index cases and 140 (42 %) of those exposed had antibodies indicative of infection by the fungus. The above cases reveal the importance of histoplasmosis in immunocompetent individuals who, for occupational or recreational reasons, are exposed to infectious aerosols generated when disturbing the natural habitat of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum...|$|R
40|$|Sub-level caving (SLC) is an {{important}} mass mining method which {{is based upon the}} utilization of gravity flow of waste material and blasted ore. The method function on the principle that ore is fragmented by blasting, while the overlying host rock fractures and caves by the action of mine induced stresses and gravity. The <b>caved</b> rock or <b>debris</b> from the previous blasted rings reduces the fragmentation and the swelling of the blasted ring as it absorbs some of the explosive energy and preventing all energy of the explosive to break the ore. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate a new concept for timing double ring blasts in terms of fragmentation. For this purpose, a series of tests has been made in small-scale SLC blocks. The idea is to blast two rings at the same time, but with a short delay time between the rings. In this case, the second ring will be blasted first which will create a slot between the blasted burden and the remaining rock which will eventually provide a free face for the first ring. This may result in improved fragmentation. Validerat; 20130501 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
