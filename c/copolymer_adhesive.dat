40|$|Meniscus {{tears are}} one of the most {{commonly}} occurring injuries of the knee joint. Current meniscus repair techniques are challenging and do not bring fully satisfactory results. Tissue adhesives are a promising alternative, since they are easy to apply and cause minimal tissue trauma. In this study, a series of amphiphilic copolymers based on polyethylene glycol, trimethylene carbonate and citric acid were synthesized and subsequently end-functionalized with hexamethylene diisocyanate to form reactive adhesive materials. The shear adhesive strength of the networks to bovine meniscus tissue measured in a lap-shear adhesion test ranged between 20 and 80 kPa, which was better than for fibrin glue (10 kPa). The elastic modulus of the networks depended on composition and was in the same range as that of human meniscus. Cell compatibility was assessed using Alamar Blue staining after incubation of the bovine meniscus cells with different concentrations of the glues for 7 days. Cell viability was not affected after adding up to 3 mg of the adhesive/mL of medium. The proposed materials are suitable candidates to be used as resorbable tissue adhesives for meniscus repair. They have excellent mechanical and adhesive properties that can be adjusted by varying the composition of the copolymers. Statement of Significance Meniscal tears often occur and current treatment strategies do not bring fully satisfactory results. Use of biodegradable tissue adhesives would be an interesting option, but currently available adhesives are not suited due to toxicity or poor mechanical properties. Here, we describe the development of novel biodegradable, hyper-branched, <b>adhesive</b> <b>copolymers.</b> These <b>adhesives</b> cure upon contact with water forming flexible networks. Their adhesion to bovine meniscus tissue was significantly better than that of clinically used fibrin glue. The tensile properties of the cured networks were in the same range of values of the human meniscus. When physiologically relevant amounts were added to cells in culture, not toxic effects were observed. Therefore, the proposed materials are interesting resorbable tissue adhesives for meniscus repair. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Bonding of historical metal objects with adhesives is here examined. A literature survey is done. Another goal with the work is to get {{an indication of the}} suitability of various adhesives by means of simple test methods. Two test objects (candle holders) of tin, were chosen as basis for the investigation. Six adhesives were selected for testing: Paraloid B- 72, (a thermoplastic acrylic copolymer), two different epoxies, (Araldite 2011 A + B and Bostik Epoxy Rapid) an ethyl cyanoacrylate product, (Loctite Super Glue Precision), Bostik contact, a contact adhesive based on polychloroprene rubber, Dana limstänger, (a hot melt adhesive consisting of an EVA <b>copolymer).</b> These <b>adhesives</b> were subjected to simple tests, a pH test, a so-called Oddy test and a simple tensile test with specimens of tin to investigate strength. In addition, a test for removability of the adhesive and a very simple contact test were carried out. pH tests showed that many of the adhesives are quite acidic when wet. After curing the pH of the epoxies are about pH 9 - 10. The others were more neutral after curing. Oddy test showed that all but Paraloid B- 72 affected lead slightly. ”Epoxy Rapid” affected silver and copper with a dark colour. The results of strength tests were somewhat difficult to interpret. The strength differed greatly between the adhesives. For example the specimens bonded by the hot-melt adhesive fell apart by themselves. The cyanoacrylate was so strong that in one sample the joint was not broken at all, instead the tin specimen broke. When the tests were done the two candlesticks were treated.

40|$|Adhesives {{are defined}} as {{substances}} capable of holding at least two surfaces together. A class of adhesives called pressure-sensitive adhesives (or PSAs) is characterized by instantaneous adhesion upon application of light pressure. In order to develop new application-specific products and improve existing processes, {{there is a need}} to identify the factors that influence the performance of PSAs. Operating conditions like feed composition, temperature, and solid content will affect latex properties such as copolymer composition, molecular weight distribution (MWD) and particle size distribution (PSD). Those latex properties can in turn affect the performance of the adhesive. Because of environmental concerns and government regulations to substitute solvent-based systems by water-borne products, there is a growing interest in producing such PSAs by emulsion (or mini-emulsion) polymerization. Mini-emulsions allow for improved control over the PSD compared to conventional emulsion polymerizations. Coupled with control over the MWD and copolymer composition, mini-emulsions could offer the possibility of tailoring the desired properties of PSAs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to isolate and determine the molecular structures of certain polyphenols in Douglas-fir and red alder barks. The compounds of interest in Douglas-fir were the lignans which are eventually incorporated into the outer bark phlobaphenes. Phlobaphenes are the red colored, alcohol soluble, water insoluble phenolic polymers in conifer outer bark. They are commonly believed to be formed by oxidative coupling reactions of polyphenols in the bark. Four neolignan glycosides were isolated and identified from the methanol extract of Douglas-fir inner and outer bark. In addition several other non-lignan type polyphenols were isolated and identified which likely {{play a role in}} phlobaphene formation. The compounds of interest in red alder bark were the diarylheptanoid glycosides which have potential medicinal and adhesive value. The methanol extract yielded five new diarylheptanoids glycosides compounds. The isolations were carried out by column chromatography and the molecular structures determined by use of ¹H and ¹³C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectroscopy, and enzymic hydrolysis of the parent glycosides. These results showed that a variety of polyphenol types, including neolignans which may be phlobaphene precursors, are present in Douglas-fir bark. This information suggests that most of the polyphenols in Douglas-fir bark {{can be used to make}} water-proof, formaldehyde free, wood adhesive polymers once we understand the molecular structures and reactions of these natural renewable substances. The diarylheptanoid compounds isolated from red alder bark belong to a class of compounds which have a history of biological activity.

A new approach was introduced for incorporating renewable biomass into existing commercial pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) polymers {{in the form}} of acrylated macromonomers (MM). MM were prepared with L-lactide and caprolactone via a bulk ring-opening polymerization initiated by N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEAA). Acrylic <b>adhesive</b> <b>copolymers</b> were synthesized by free-radical solution polymerization in presence of 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), acrylamide and macromonomers. This approach was achieved without sacrificing adhesive performance. Incorporation of the MM into the polymers was confirmed via proton NMR. Properties and adhesive performance of the new polymer were compared with its 100 % acrylic commercial version. When synthesized using the same approach, the biomass-containing PSA had a lower molecular weight, higher glass transition temperature (Tg) and lower melt viscosity. Introduction of MM had little impact of tack force, shear time and shear adhesion failure temperature and peel strength increased substantially. Influence of HEAA capped L-lactide/caprolactone MM composition on acrylic hot-melts was also reviewed. A series of MMs, synthesized using catalyzed ring-opening polymerizations, were produced containing a broad range of lactic acid and caprolactone repeat units. Results indicate that the properties and performance of adhesive polymers are strongly dependent on lactide composition. In general, increasing lactide content increases polymer hardness enhancing cohesive strength, while reducing it (i. e., increasing caprolactone content) softens the polymer. Optimal adhesion is found to require a balance between these tendencies as indicated by the existence of a clear maximum in both tack and peel data. The results demonstrate that a broad range of properties is achievable through relatively minor modifications to MM composition. It is expected that these hybrid materials can be optimized for a variety of self-adhesive applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review of dental plaque biofilms formation, progression and detachment mechanisms {{is presented in}} this thesis. Various strategies that have been employed to reduce or eliminate dental biofilms are discussed. The focus of the thesis was on the mechanical properties and disruption of dental biofilms, especially from hard-to-access areas of the oral cavity, such as the interproximal (IP) sites between the teeth. Various methods to measure mechanical properties of dental biofilms were investigated, and physical and chemical strategies to disrupt these biofilms were employed. Streptococcus mutans, the bacterium responsible for initiation of dental plaque biofilms, was used in our studies. A uniaxial compressive test was utilized to characterize the mechanical behaviour of biofilms, while manipulating the chemical microenvironment. Initially, the mechanical properties of a dextran gel were characterized. The gel {{was used as an}} artificial dental plaque biofilm (Chapter 5). The elastic modulus of the gel was 17 kPa (± 12; n = 3), and the stress relaxation time was 25 seconds (± 18; n = 3), demonstrating a viscoelastic behaviour similar to that reported for real biofilms. After optimizing the technique with the gel, the mechanical properties of S. mutans biofilms were studied, the elastic modulus was 380 Pa (± 350; n = 30), and the stress relaxation time was 12 seconds (± 11; n = 10). The elastic modulus increased by increasing the sucrose percentage in the media, and decreased when the biofilms were treated with increasing concentrations of ethylene di-amine tetra acetic acid, EDTA. Treating the biofilms with different solutions of poly (ethylene glycol), PEG, resulted in behaviour similar to that previously observed for synthetic polymers. The flow field and local hydrodynamics of high velocity water microdrops impacting the interproximal (IP) space of typodont teeth, and their influence on the structure and detachment of both surrogate dental plaque and Streptococcus mutans biofilms, were studied experimentally and computationally. Water droplets of 115 ?L were produced by a prototype AirFloss (PT-AirFloss) device provided by Philips Oral Healthcare, bursting water at a velocity of 60 m/s into the IP space between the maxillary central incisors. High-speed imaging, was used to characterise the PT-AirFloss microburst of pressurized air and water micodrops, and demonstrated the removal mechanism of a dental plaque biofilm substitute and the S. mutans biofilms. Using various microscopy and image analysis techniques, quantitative measurements of the removal rate and the percentage removal of biofilms from different locations in the IP space were obtained. Microcomputed Tomography (?-CT) imaging was used to obtain 3 D images of the typodont and the IP spaces. The shear stress distribution generated by the drop impacting the tooth surface was calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations based on the finite element method (FEM). There was good agreement between experimentally measured biofilm removal and the pattern of predicted wall shear stress (?w) generated in the IP space by the microburst. High velocity water microdrops, with minimal fluid volume and time, effectively removed both the surrogate and the biofilm. The shear stress generated by the PT-AirFloss and its spatial distribution on the teeth surface {{played a key role in}} dictating the efficacy of biofilm removal. In addition, CFD models were used to predict optimal water drop or burst design with respect to more effective biofilm removal performance. Furthermore, the influence of fluid shear flow on the detachment of Streptococcus mutans biofilms inside microfluidic channels was studied using a commercially available flow-cell system. A critical biofilm detachment shear stress was estimated for the large biofilm-aggregates (CDSSagg). The CDSSagg value was used in the CFD model to predict the spatial distribution of biofilm aggregates detachment from the IP surface caused by the PT-AirFloss microburst. Next the effect of three biofilm matrix-degrading enzymes on the structure and detachment of Streptococcus mutans biofilms inside microtiter plates and on typodont teeth was studied experimentally. The enzymes used were: Bromelain (a protease), DNase, and RNase. The biofilms were treated with different enzymatic preparations, stained with Live/Dead and Crystal Violet, and the corresponding optical density (OD) and fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured by a microplate reader. The results detailed the degradation effect of each enzyme, separately and in combination. The three enzymes demonstrated different efficacies in degrading the biofilm in 6, 24 and 96 well-plates, as well as on the typodont teeth. Also, there was a large variability which could be explained by the heterogeneity of the biofilm. Using epifluorescence microscopy and image analysis, quantitative measurements of the percentage surface area coverage were obtained, and the preliminary results were consistent with the datafrom the plate reader. Furthermore, pre-coating the plates with the three enzymes did not inhibit biofilm from formation and accumulation. Lastly the use of a biocompatible copolymer of methylvinyl ether and maleic anhydride, with excellent mucosal adhesive properties and biocompatibility to improve enzymatic digestion by offering a prolonged contact of the enzymes with the teeth and oral tissues, was investigated. The rationale was to eliminate a major obstacle facing the efficacy of the enzymatic therapy which was the relatively short residence time of the enzymes at the site of administration. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>copolymer</b> could possibly enhance enzyme biofilm degradation. Combining the <b>adhesive</b> <b>copolymer</b> with the enzymes could potentially allow near total degradation of the laboratory-grown S. mutans biofilms...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), {{which is}} {{available}} in different degrees of substitution and viscosity designations, {{is one of the}} most commonly used cellulosic polymers in aqueous film coating. It is relatively easy to process due to its non-tacky nature and has been known to produce smooth and clear films. For aqueous film coating, it is cost effective to use a coating formulation containing a high concentration of polymer without affecting the viscosity or spray rate and compromising on the quality of the film coat. Hence, it is ideal to use a polymer of low viscosity grade. The rheological properties of HPMC with various viscosity grades were determined. It was found that HPMC Methocel E 3 had the lowest viscosity and was the least affected by the increase in polymer concentration. Additives can modify the film properties, including the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer. Glass transition temperature influences the viscosity of the coating solution and the mechanical properties, adhesion and permeability of the film coat. Various concentrations of different additives were incorporated in HPMC formulations to study the effect on these properties. Some long-chain fatty acids were included in the study to investigate if their hydrophobic carbon chains could retard moisture permeation of HPMC films. It was observed that HPMC films containing water-soluble additives produce films with clarity similar to those without additives, whereas those with hydrophobic additives tend to be patchy or hazy in appearance. A vinyl pyrrolidone / vinyl acetate copolymer (S 630) was investigated for its influence on HPMC films, comparing the results with a commonly used plasticizer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and another copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Intrinsic properties of the solutions, such as viscosity and glass transition temperature, were evaluated. The effect of S 630 on the film properties, such as physical appearance, surface roughness, moisture permeation and mechanical properties, as well as its ability to promote better adhesion of the film coat to the core surface, were compared. S 630 was found to be effective both as a film-former and plasticizer, reducing the glass transition temperature and viscosity, but enhancing the tensile strength, elongation and work of failure of the cast film. The water vapour permeability was slightly increased but not to the same extent as with polyethylene glycol PEG). A 10 % concentration of this <b>copolymer</b> increased the <b>adhesive</b> strength and toughness of the HPMC film coat. Aqueous film coating was carried out in the ultra-coater, using HPMC coating formulations containing 8 % w/w of solids, without or with 10 % concentration (based on dry weight of total solids) of the additives, PEG, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and S 630, for coating the tablets. Capsule-shaped lactose tablet cores of specific surface area, hardness, weight, friability and disintegration time were used to study the process variables. Process variables, including air flow rate, temperature and humidity, coating application rate or pump flow rate, atomising air pressure and speed of the rotating disk, were investigated in order to obtain the optimum operating conditions for these solutions. It was found that the process parameters were similar for all the coating formulations containing 8 % solid. The additives used in the coating formulations had little influence on the coating process.
