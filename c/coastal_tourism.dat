25|$|With a {{long history}} of {{physical}} and economic isolation from mainland North Carolina, residents of Harkers Island and other Outer Banks islands, such as Ocracoke, have developed a distinct dialect of English, commonly referred to as High tider, that {{can be traced back to}} that of the Elizabethan period. The dialect of Harkers Island developed in almost complete isolation for over 250 years. Harkers Island English shares features with other regional dialects of the US Atlantic coast. Pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical constructions can be traced to eastern and southwestern England. The dialect has survived because the community continues to depend on traditional trades, like fishing, boat building, and decoy carving, and the <b>coastal</b> <b>tourism</b> trade developed on Harkers Island much later than islands like Ocracoke.|$|E

However, the effect of substitution between <b>coastal</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> industries and other geographically-connected tourist attractions across a broad region is typically neglected. We value a <b>coastal</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> industry by considering the influence of substitution between wildlife tourism and other attractions, locally and regionally. Using surveys, we found that dolphin-watching at Chilika Lagoon was partially substituted by other attractions locally, and geographically neighbouring attractions in the region of Odisha (India). If dolphins are extirpated, stakeholders in Chilika and Odisha will lose, but neighbouring stakeholders gain. This approach is useful for: (1) estimating the value of <b>coastal</b> wildlife <b>tourism</b> where neighbouring attractions also draw tourists to a region, (2) identifying which stakeholders to target through conservation and management interventions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the similarities and}} differences in demand for <b>coastal</b> and marine <b>tourism</b> activities and experiences from three European markets. Long-haul travellers from the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands were studied using archival survey data. The research explored the similarity of the demand from these markets in order to address the question of whether proposals to shift mass tourism towards smaller scale alternative types of <b>coastal</b> and marine <b>tourism</b> are consistent with the size of the ecotourism market. The results demonstrated that nationality was an important variable shaping the size of the ecotourism markets with budget-oriented German ecotourists (46 %) providing the largest market share of German coastal and marine tourists. By way of contrast UK ecotourists were the least cost conscious, but were only 19 % of the total UK <b>coastal</b> and marine <b>tourism</b> sector. The paper is supplemented with a commentary on the impacts of the anticipated ecotourism activities. In particular, the German ecotourism market appears likely to enhance pressures on the environment rather than being a benign alternative to mass tourism activities. In addition, it was argued that cross-national studies of tourist demand represent an important check on the consistency of tourism trends for destination marketers and managers...|$|R
