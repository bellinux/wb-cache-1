50|$|The Twenty-Ninth Canadian Ministry is the <b>combined</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> {{chaired by}} Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Ministers that began {{governing}} Canada {{shortly before the}} opening of the 42nd Parliament. The original members were sworn in during a ceremony held at Rideau Hall on November 4, 2015. Those who were not already members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada were sworn into the Privy Council in the same ceremony. The Cabinet currently consists of 30 members, including the prime minister. When the ministry was first sworn in, with fifteen men and fifteen women (aside from Trudeau), it became the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canadian history.|$|E

50|$|One of Parfitt's guitars {{was a white}} 1965 Fender Telecaster. In {{addition}} he {{also played}} a Gibson SG Junior, a 1981 Zemaitis tuned to a B, a Schecter Telecaster, a Fender Esquire, a custom-made Fender Telecaster Thinline, a Gibson Melody Maker and a Chet Atkins acoustic guitar. He also used Status Slipstream guitars in different configurations. For amplification, Parfitt used Marshall JCM800kk (Kerry King signature) or JCM900 amplifiers with 4x12 <b>cabinets,</b> <b>combined</b> with VOX AC30 amplifiers and a Roland GP8 signal processor and a Boss CE-7 as his clean boost pedal.|$|R
50|$|It has to {{be noted}} that the Cabinet of the Republic of Korea {{performs}} somewhat different roles than those of many other nations with similar forms. As the Korean political system is basically a presidential system yet with certain aspects of parliamentary <b>cabinet</b> system <b>combined,</b> the <b>Cabinet</b> of the Republic of Korea also is a combination of both systems. More specifically, the Korean Cabinet performs policy resolutions as well as policy consultations to the President. Reflecting that the Republic of Korea is basically a presidential republic the Cabinet resolutions cannot bind the president's decision, and in this regard the Korean Cabinet is similar to those advisory counsels in strict presidential republics. At the same time, however, the Constitution of the Republic of Korea specifies in details 17 categories including budgetary and military matters, which necessitates the resolution of the Cabinet in addition to the President's approval, and in this regard the Korean Cabinet is similar to those cabinets in strict parliamentary cabinet systems.|$|R

For his 'dirtier' sounds in Stone Gods, he played a Marshall JCM 800 Re-Issue head through Marshall 1960AX/BX <b>cabinets,</b> <b>combined</b> with a Diezel Herbert head. He has also been seen recently using both a Vox AC30 combo and a Wizard Modern Classic head to compliment his several Marshall stacks. Effects wise, a vintage Ibanez TS-808 Tube Screamer pedal is his mainstay for overdrive, but recent photos of his 2012/2013 touring rig show additional pedals from Electro Harmonix, MXR, Strymon and Devi Ever among others.|$|R
5000|$|A fire {{swept through}} Whiskey Row in 1900. During the fire, the {{patrons of the}} bar picked up the fancy hand-carved Brunswick bar and carried {{it out of the}} burning building. Setting it down across the street, they {{continued}} their drinking as {{the other side of the}} street burned. The saloon was rebuilt at a cost of $50,000, <b>combining</b> with the <b>Cabinet</b> Saloon next-door, and re-opened in 1901 under the name The Palace Hotel. After its re-opening was called [...] "the most beautiful saloon in all of Arizona". It was now a two-story masonry building, consisting of grey granite, iron and pressed ornamental bricks, and measuring 75 feet wide and 125 feet front to back. The central pediment on the front façade contained the seal of the Arizona Territory, flanked by a mountain lion and a bear. In addition to the bar, the saloon also contained gaming tables for faro, poker, roulette, kino and craps.|$|R
25|$|After early {{elections}} in 2003 Balkenende formed his second government with: Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal D66. Once again {{leader of a}} centre-right coalition, Balkenende's policies centred on reform of the Dutch public services, social security, pre-pension facilities, public health, reducing crime, a tough immigration policy and historically large cuts in public spending. The measures gave rise to large public anger and bad results in opinion polls for his CDA party. While his party remained the largest Dutch delegation in the European Parliament after the European Elections, beating the general expectation of a huge loss in parliamentary seats, the party suffered strong losses during Dutch municipal elections of 2006, losing their position as the largest party in many municipalities. Despite his unpopularity among Dutch voters (polls in 2006 showed that only 26–33% of the voters had confidence in him as prime minister), his position {{as leader of the}} CDA remained stable. In the beginning of 2006, some CDA members tried to replace Balkenende as leader with minister Cees Veerman. Veerman did not accept this and offered his support to Balkenende. Balkenende's popularity recovered since then, surpassing that of his main competitor Wouter Bos in the autumn of 2006. By then, 53% preferred Balkenende as Prime Minister while 40% preferred Bos. This switch in public opinion is sometimes explained by the steady recovery of the Dutch economy during {{the last year of his}} administration and the positive effects of the reformed policy of the Balkenende <b>cabinet,</b> <b>combined</b> with declining confidence in Bos as a good alternative for the position of prime-minister.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} European Capital of Culture 2005 {{celebrations}} for Cork, {{the exhibition}} (budget £ 350, 000) showcased work of Cork’s silversmiths and goldsmiths over four centuries. It contained over 165 pieces some of which came from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Breaking the rules of conventional exhibition methods for silver and gold, the showcase materials, artefact organisation and lighting were reanalysed {{as a part of}} the design process. The cabinets, 47 in total and varied in size and shape, were all free-standing, to allow for the mobility requested in the brief. They were constructed from untreated Corten steel to amplify the spectacle of the objects, by providing them with a contemporary counterpoint. Traditionally blue-toned light is used to display silver but, with the development and availability of new lighting, the opportunity to innovate resulted in the use of white light, a first in the displaying of precious metals. Fluorescent tubes (with colour designation ‘white light’ and a correlated colour temperature of 4000 Kelvin) combined with PMMA fibre optics tailed from a halogen light generator (white light - 4200 Kelvin) were <b>combined</b> within the <b>cabinets</b> behind a pearl acrylic to generate a ‘pure white’ environment for the silver and gold to be viewed.

40|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 2004 and commenced in April 2005. A mobile exhibition {{held in the}} Crawford Municipal Gallery, Cork, {{as a part of}} the European Capital of Culture 2005, commissioned and curated by Mr. John Bowen of Bowen Construction. The exhibition showcased an incredible display of the work of Corks silversmiths and goldsmiths over four centuries, an extensive collection, many pieces never exhibited publicly before. The brief specified that the exhibition needed to be adaptable to other galleries, also the silverware (some of which came from the Victoria and Albert Museum) needed to be totally secure and the showcases needed to be versatile due to the number and size of the pieces on exhibit. In total there were approx 165 pieces. Breaking the rules of conventional exhibition methods for silver and gold the showcase materials, artefact organisation and lighting were reanalysed {{as a part of the}} design process. Alternative lighting techniques played a key role in the aesthetic and success of the display of silver. Traditionally blue toned light and environment is used to display silver to bring out the natural characteristics, but with the availability and development of new lighting, the opportunity to experiment with convention exposed other possibilities. Fluorescent tubes (with colour designation ‘white light’ and a correlated colour temperature of 4000 Kelvin) combined with PMMA fibre optics tailed from a halogen light generator (white light - 4200 Kelvin) were <b>combined</b> within the <b>cabinets</b> behind a pearl acrylic to generate a ‘pure white environment for the silver to be displayed in. The juxtaposition of material, the almost sanitised pearl acrylic and glass against the dark Corten steel skin made for a dramatic combination. The circulation and orientation of the exhibition was defined by the arrangement of the cabinets and the contrasting light levels throughout the exhibition. The exhibition proved to have the highest number of visitors to the Crawford Gallery for a single exhibition and in April 2007 the exhibition is being reconfigured to work in the Hunt Museum, Limerick, Ireland...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{offices are}} put into [...] "commission"; that is, {{multiple}} commissioners are appointed to collectively exercise the office. The office of Lord High Treasurer has been in commission since 1612, although not filled continuously until 1714: the First Lord of the Treasury is the Prime Minister, the Second Lord is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the remaining Lords Commissioners are Government Whips. The office of Lord High Admiral was for many years also in commission, but merged with the crown in 1964 and is now an honorary appointment in {{the gift of the}} reigning monarch. HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (consort of the current monarch) was granted the title on his 90th birthday. The remaining officers became governmental officers: Lord Chancellor, Lord President and Lord Privy Seal are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister. The posts of Lord President and Lord Privy Seal are normally <b>combined</b> with a <b>cabinet</b> ministerearlier, those of Leader of the House of Commons and Leader of the House of Lords, respectively, but from 2003 the posts have been reversed, and since 2009, the Lord President has been another Cabinet minister. The Great Officers had and have varying duties. The Lord High Steward was originally a holder of significant political power, but gradually became a ceremonial office, as have the Lord Great Chamberlain, Lord High Constable, and the Earl Marshal, all of them traditionally hereditary. The Lord High Treasurer, Lord High Constable, and Lord High Admiral were originally responsible for monetary, military, and naval matters respectively. The Lord President of the Council is responsible for presiding over the meetings of the Privy Council. The office of Lord Privy Seal is a sinecure, though he is technically the Keeper of the Privy Seal. The Lord Chancellor is the most important of the Great Officers: he is the cabinet minister responsible for the Ministry of Justice, formerly the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Department for Constitutional Affairs) and formally Keeper of the Great Seal.|$|R
40|$|Esta tesis {{doctoral}} desarrolla una investigación original sobre las torres defensivas de Menorca y las torres Martello de las costas sur y este de Inglaterra. Con respecto a las torres menorquinas, se distinguen las de Alcaufar y Punta Prima, construidas por ingenieros militares españoles, en 1786; de las levantadas por el ejército británico durante su último periodo de dominación de la isla, entre 1798 y 1802. Estos ingenieros reales británicos construyen las torres Martello en las costas inglesas, entre 1805 y 1812; y otras, semejantes a ellas, en el resto de su Imperio, hasta mediados del siglo XIX. La falta de estudios que relacionen las torres defensivas de Menorca y las Martello inglesas dentro del marco disciplinario de la construcción, ha constituido la justificación de esta investigación. La hipótesis de trabajo plantea un objetivo principal: el estudio y análisis comparativo entre ellas, que se desarrolla en varios niveles de análisis: morfológico, físico-constructivo, de visibilidades; pero también territorial, histórico y poliorcético. Esta tesis cuestiona, en consecuencia, la idea tradicionalmente aceptada de que las torres Martello tomaran la torre de Mortella, en Córcega, o cualquiera de las denominadas torres "preMartello", como referencia para crear su prototipo. La metodología empleada combina los trabajos de gabinete con una intensa labor de campo, en la que se documentaron cincuenta y siete torres, catorce en Menorca y cuarenta y tres en Inglaterra. Se han redactado sus correspondientes fichas de datos, que incluyen aspectos generales - morfológicos y constructivos -, así como documentación fotográfica. Se han elaborado los levantamientos morfológicos de siete de estas torres, aquellas que por sus particularidades constructivas, o bien representan un determinado tipo de torre, o bien se distinguen del resto. Del mismo modo, se han desarrollado los levantamientos físico-constructivos y la caracterización de materiales de las cuatro torres más relevantes para este estudio: las menorquinas Alcaufar y Punta Prima, y las torres 24 y C, que ejemplifican, respectivamente, las levantadas en las costas sur y este de Inglaterra. El sistemático método de trabajo llevado a cabo ha favorecido la investigación y ha ayudado a obtener conclusiones que verifican la hipótesis planteada en la tesis y cumplen los objetivos establecidos al comienzo de la misma. ABSTRACT This {{doctoral thesis}} develops an original {{research on the}} defensive towers of Minorca, and the Martello towers on {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Regarding the Minorcan towers, Alcaufar and Punta Prima, built by the Spanish military engineers in 1786, must be distinguished from those erected by the British Army during its last period of domination of the island between 1798 and 1802. These Royal Engineers build the Martello towers on the English coasts between 1805 and 1812; and others, similar to them, in the rest of their Empire until the middle of the 19 th century. The lack of studies linking these Minorcan and English towers, within the disciplinary framework of construction, has been the justification for this research. The hypothesis poses a main goal: the study and comparative analysis of them, which takes place at several levels of analysis: morphological, constructive, of visibilities; but also territorial, historical and poliorcetic. Consequently, this thesis questions the traditionally accepted notion that the Martello towers took the Corsican Mortella Tower, or any of the so-called “preMartello” towers as a reference to create their prototype. The methodology <b>combines</b> the <b>cabinet</b> works with significant fieldwork, in which fifty seven towers were documented, fourteen in Minorca and forty three in England. The corresponding data sheets were drafted including general aspects - morphological and constructive-, and photographic documentation. Morphological survey plans were developed for seven of these towers due to their construction peculiarities, which either denote a specific type of tower or makes it stand out from the rest. Likewise, constructive survey plans and material characterisation sheets of the four more relevant towers in this study were developed: the Minorcan Alcaufar and Punta Prima, and towers 24 and C, both respectively exemplifying those built on the south and east coasts of England. The systematic method of work encouraged the research and helped to draw conclusions that both confirm the hypothesis raised in the thesis and meet the objectives established at the beginning of it...|$|R
