The register ring has interference fit in top plate and transmission fit with the injection molding machine pattern, aligning the machine pattern and top plate.|$|E
40|$|Subsampling of {{sediment}} cores {{is the important}} first step of almost every study. Sampling procedures were developed within IODP/ODP/DSDP to ensure the reproducibility of core treatment {{as well as its}} documentation. In contrast, procedures for lacustrine sediment cores are as manifold as the corresponding scientific questions and communities. A sampling assembly and a flexible sampling protocol are described in their version adapted to the PASADO project. This protocol introduces a core splitter and a sampling assembly consisting of a divider and a D-scoop for fast and efficient subsampling. Detailed information can be found in our recently published paper (Ohlendorf et al., 2011). The core splitter cuts plastic core liners without contamination of the sediment by liner material. The core sampling assembly is used to sample one <b>core</b> <b>half</b> completely in contiguously steps. The <b>core</b> <b>half</b> is split into slices of similar thickness by inserting thin discs through a comb-like divider (Fig. 1). The D-scoop (Fig. 1) is used to sample these sediment discs. The utilisation of the sediment is optimised because all sediment is sampled in one step. Subsamples with known volume can then be taken from the exact same stratigraphic level in the core. Quality flags are defined to document the condition of every (sub) sample, and to allow a first classification of the sediment character. ...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} project is to analyze the hexagonal floor tile design by simulation with Moldflow Plastic Insight software (MPI) and to optimize the mould design parameter using Taguchi method. The product is designed in hexagonal shape build with interlocking features and {{will be used for}} application in indoor sports activities such as futsal, badminton, takraw and other sports. The material used for this design is thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) that increased the slipping resistance due to active and fast movement on it. The design of the product will be analyzed using MoldFlow Plastic Insight software (MPI) to reduce the warpage problem that appears during injecting the product. Warpage is the deflection of the part on the product design from its original shape. Taguchi method is used to optimize the parameter of the mould design for injecting the product with less warpage. In addition, the signal to noise ratio and analysis of variance is utilized to optimize the parameter for the product. The Taguchi method is conducted to minimize the warpage in both +z deflection and -z deflection. The result shown that, the most significance parameter of the mold design that tend to minimized the warpage values are from the cooling channel diameter at cavity half, cooling channel distance at <b>core</b> <b>half</b> and cooling channel diameter at <b>core</b> <b>half.</b> Also, from the result the summarized of the mold design parameter that reduces the warpage problem has been identified for the further process which is fabrication of mold...|$|E

The residuals of the surface brightness distribution from the azimuthal average for RXJ 2014 show a prominent swirling excess feature extending out to an abrupt surface brightness discontinuity at 800 kpc from the cluster <b>core</b> (<b>half</b> the virial radius) to the south, which the XMM-Newton observations confirm to be cold, low entropy gas. The gas temperature is significantly higher outside this southern surface brightness discontinuity, indicating {{that this is a}} cold front 800 kpc from the cluster core. Chandra observations of the central 200 kpc show two clear younger cold fronts {{on opposite sides of the}} cluster. The scenario appears qualitatively consistent with simulations of gas sloshing due to minor mergers which raise cold, low entropy gas from the core to higher radius, resulting in a swirling distribution of opposing cold fronts at increasing radii. However the scale of the observed sloshing is much larger than that which has been simulated at present, and is similar to the large scale sloshing recently observed in the Perseus cluster and Abell 2142.

40|$|Signal {{transducers}} and activators of transcription (STAT proteins) bind to {{palindromic sequence}} elements related to interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) activation sites, which were first {{identified in the}} promoters of IFN-gamma-inducible genes. Although the sequences of the natural palindromic STAT-binding elements vary considerably, they conform to the general structure TT(N) 5 AA. We have systematically {{examined the effects of}} the spacing between the TT and AA <b>core</b> <b>half</b> sites on the binding of the STAT complexes activated by IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL) 6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL- 4.

We have examined natural elements in the promoters of cytokine-responsive genes that differ in half-site spacing and found that they display binding properties predicted from the synthetic binding sites. Furthermore, the observed differential selective binding characteristics for the most part correlate with the ability to mediate transcriptional activation of transfected test genes in response to the cytokines tested. Our results thus demonstrate that the specificity of STAT-directed transcription in response to particular cytokines or cytokine families depends in part on the spacing of half sites within the conserved response element sequence...|$|E

If being underwater has significant safety advantages, especially using passive safety systems, it leads to two main challenges for core design. The first one is to control reactivity in operation without soluble boron because of its prohibitive drawbacks for a submerged reactor (system size, maintenance, effluents, and safety considerations). The second one is to achieve a long cycle in order to maximise {{the availability of the}} reactor, because Flexblue® refuelling and maintenance will be performed in a shared support facility away from the production site. In this paper, these two topics are dealt with, from a neutronic point of view. Firstly, an overview of the main challenges of operating without soluble boron is proposed (cold shutdown, reactivity swing during cycle, load following, xenon stability). Secondly, an economic optimisation of the Flexblue® core size and cycle length is performed, using the QUABOX/CUBBOX code.

50|$|Even {{with these}} {{limitations}} SPI {{can be an}} extremely powerful analytical, reconnaissance, and monitoring tool. Sediment-type maps have often been constructed by retrieving grab or core samples followed by days or weeks of laboratory-based processing. After an SPI device is lowered into the sediment and the image recorded, it can be hauled up and lowered repetitively without fully recovering the device. Such a vessel ‘stitching’ an SPI device along a prescribed route can survey an area with unprecedented economy compared to physical sample recovery. There is, of course, a trade-off between sampling data quality and quantity. SPI allows much greater spatial coverage for a given amount of field time {{at the cost of}} the detailed sediment descriptors typically produced from physical <b>cores</b> (<b>half</b> phi interval texture analysis, carbon content, etc.). Managing this balance is the essence of good SPI use and highlights its strengths. For example, Hewitt et al. (2002), Thrush et al. (1999), and Zajac (1999) call attention to the value of integrating macrofaunal community observations collected at different scales and their application in describing processes occurring at different scales within a heterogeneous benthic landscape. When evaluating landscape-scale questions it is rarely feasible to simply and comprehensively sample the total spatial extent with dense, equivalently detailed sampling points. The researcher must compromise between data collection grain, dimensions of the actual sampling unit (typically 0.1 m2 grab or similar), and lag- distance between sample units over which results will be interpolated (often tens to hundreds of metres for grab samples). Sediment profile imagery can be an efficient monitoring tool when coupled with more detailed sampling techniques such as macrofaunal core sampling, or continuous sediment survey transects (Gowing et al. 1997). It offers point data that can be economically collected at sufficient frequency to connect more resource-intensive samples in an ecologically meaningful way. A study can therefore operate at nested spatio-temporal scales with SPI providing overall maps and connectivity while other sampling techniques are used to characterise assemblages and variability within habitat types. This type of integration is necessary for developing our understanding and predictability of soft-sediment processes (Thrush et al. 1999; Noda 2004).|$|R
