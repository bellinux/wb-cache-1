5|$|During the 1860s, Parker {{continued}} {{both his}} {{legal and political}} careers. In 1864, he formally split from the Democratic Party over conflicting opinions on slavery. He ran as a Republican for <b>county</b> <b>prosecutor</b> of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District.

5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a <b>county</b> <b>prosecutor</b> tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the <b>county</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, {{the section}} of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway. This {{designation}} included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula, all {{named in honor of}} Philip Colgrove, the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association. Colgrove was also the Barry <b>County</b> <b>prosecutor</b> and a state senator in the late 19th century. No maps documents the name, although the original law remains in records. The Michigan Legislature proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, sparing the name.|$|E

5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas <b>County</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E
