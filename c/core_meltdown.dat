5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E

25|$|In the {{nighttime}} hours preceding the incident, the TMI-2 reactor was running at 97% of full power, while the companion TMI-1 reactor {{was shut down}} for refueling. The main chain of events leading to the partial <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> began at 4:37am EST on March 28, 1979, in TMI-2's secondary loop, {{one of the three}} main water/steam loops in a pressurized water reactor (PWR).|$|E
25|$|Nuclear-powered {{submarine}} <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> {{and other}} mishaps include the K-19 (1961), K-11 (1965), K-27 (1968), K-140 (1968), K-429 (1970), K-222 (1980), and K-431 (1985). Serious radiation accidents include the Kyshtym disaster, Windscale fire, radiotherapy accident in Costa Rica, radiotherapy accident in Zaragoza, radiation accident in Morocco, Goiania accident, radiation accident in Mexico City, radiotherapy unit accident in Thailand, and the Mayapuri radiological accident in India.|$|E
25|$|Most LMFBRs are of this type. The sodium is {{relatively}} easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be vastly more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a SCWR or PWR. EBR-I, the first reactor to have a <b>core</b> <b>meltdown,</b> was of this type.|$|E
5000|$|The Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} illustrated {{the dangers of}} building multiple nuclear reactor units close to one another. Because of {{the closeness of the}} reactors, Plant Director Masao Yoshida [...] "was put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units".|$|R
5000|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 {{encouraged}} private {{corporations in}} the United States to build nuclear reactors {{and a significant}} learning phase followed with many early partial <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities.

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved {{insufficient}} in its {{objective of}} encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors. A series of accidents with research reactors, including partial <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns,</b> made private companies cautious, and reluctant {{to become involved}} with nuclear energy without protection from liability. This led to the Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act of 1957, which capped private liability for nuclear accidents, while providing for adequate compensations for accident victims.|$|R
25|$|TEPCO {{said the}} {{radiation}} {{level in the}} containment vessel of reactor 2 at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 power plant was 530 sieverts per hour, the highest recorded level since the triple <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> in March 2011. This is however the first measurement of the radiation level within the reactor area and as such is likely lower than in the initial period after the meltdown. TEPCO also announced {{that there is a}} 2-meter hole under the pressure vessel in the reactor’s primary containment vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{vulnerability}} of nuclear plants to deliberate attack {{is of concern}} {{in the area of}} nuclear safety and security. Nuclear power plants, civilian research reactors, certain naval fuel facilities, uranium enrichment plants, fuel fabrication plants, and even potentially uranium mines are vulnerable to attacks which could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The attack threat is of several general types: commando-like ground-based attacks on equipment which if disabled could lead to a reactor <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> or widespread dispersal of radioactivity; and external attacks such as an aircraft crash into a reactor complex, or cyber attacks.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{generated}} by fission products would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The CANDU designs have several emergency cooling systems, {{as well as}} having limited self-pumping capability through thermal means (the steam generator is well above the reactor). Even {{in the event of}} a catastrophic accident and <b>core</b> <b>meltdown,</b> it is important to remember that the fuel is not critical in light water. This means that cooling the core with water from nearby sources will not add to the reactivity of the fuel mass.|$|E
5000|$|Unexpectedly {{high costs}} in the nuclear weapons program, along with {{competition}} with the Soviet Union {{and a desire to}} spread democracy through the world, created [...] "...pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures." [...] The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 encouraged private corporations to build nuclear reactors and a significant learning phase followed with many early partial <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities.|$|R
2500|$|The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear {{disaster}} revealed {{the dangers of}} building multiple nuclear reactor units close to one another. This proximity triggered the parallel, chain-reaction accidents that led to hydrogen explosions blowing the roofs off reactor buildings and water evaporating from open-air spent fuel pools—a situation that was potentially more dangerous than the loss of reactor cooling itself. Because of {{the proximity of the}} reactors, Plant Director Masao Yoshida [...] "was put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units".|$|R
50|$|The Fukushima {{disaster}} cleanup is {{an ongoing}} attempt to limit radioactive contamination from the three nuclear reactors involved in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster which followed the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011.The affected reactors were adjacent {{to one another and}} accident management was made much more difficult {{because of the number of}} simultaneous hazards concentrated in a small area. Failure of emergency power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air spent fuel pools. Plant workers were put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units.|$|R
25|$|On 14 March, TEPCO {{reported}} the shutdown of the RCIC system presumably due to low reactor pressure. Operators had for days taken measures {{to prevent the}} reactor pressure from dropping below {{the level at which}} the RCIC can operate to keep it running as long as possible. The system was never designed to be used for an extended period. Fuel rods had been fully exposed for 140 minutes and there was a risk of a <b>core</b> <b>meltdown.</b> Reactor water level indicators were reported to be showing minimum-possible values at 19:30 JST on 14 March.|$|E
25|$|Core damage {{frequency}} (CDF) is a {{term used}} in probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) that indicates the likelihood of an accident that would cause severe damage to a nuclear fuel in nuclear reactor core. Core (severe) damage accidents are considered extremely serious because severe damage to the fuel in the core prevents adequate heat removal or even safe shutdown, {{which can lead to}} a nuclear meltdown. Some sources on CDF consider core (severe) damage and <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> to be the same thing, and different methods of measurement are used between industries and nations, so the primary value of the CDF number is in managing the risk of core accidents within a system and not necessarily to provide large-scale statistics.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{nuclear reactor}} designs have had {{numerous}} safety improvements {{since the first}} generation nuclear reactors. Nuclear power plants cannot explode like a nuclear bomb because the fuel for uranium reactors is not enriched enough, and nuclear weapons require precision explosives to force fuel into a small enough volume to go supercritical. Most reactors require continuous temperature control to prevent a <b>core</b> <b>meltdown,</b> which has occurred on a few occasions through accident or natural disaster, releasing radiation and making the surrounding area uninhabitable. Plants must be defended against theft of nuclear material (for example to make a dirty bomb) and attack by enemy military (which has occurred) planes or missiles, or planes hijacked by terrorists.|$|E
2500|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 {{encouraged}} private {{corporations to}} build nuclear reactors {{and a significant}} learning phase followed with many early partial <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities. This led {{to the introduction of}} the Price-Anderson Act in 1957, which was, [...] "...an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing." [...] The Price-Anderson Act [...] "...shields nuclear utilities, vendors and suppliers against liability claims {{in the event of a}} catastrophic accident by imposing an upper limit on private sector liability." [...] Without such protection, private companies were unwilling to become involved. No other technology in the history of American industry has enjoyed such continuing blanket protection.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{situation}} {{occurred during the}} Chernobyl disaster: after the reactor was destroyed and began to burn, a liquid corium mass from the melting core began to breach the concrete floor of the reactor vessel, which was situated above the bubbler pool (a large water reservoir for emergency pumps, also designed to safely contain steam pipe ruptures). The RBMK had no allowance or planning for <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns,</b> and the imminent interaction of the core mass with the bubbler pool would have produced a massive steam explosion, likely destroying the entire plant (vastly increasing the spread and magnitude of the radioactive plume). It was therefore necessary to drain the bubbler pool before the corium reached it. However, the initial explosion had broken the control circuitry which allowed the pool to be emptied. Three volunteer divers were required to manually operate the valves necessary to drain this pool, and later images of the corium mass in the pipes of the bubbler pool's basement reinforced the heroic necessity of their actions.|$|R
40|$|Reactor <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> {{of nuclear}} power plants are rare, yet the {{consequences}} are catastrophic. But {{what is meant by}} "rare"? And what can be learned from the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents? Here we assess the risk of exposure to radioactivity due to atmospheric dispersion of gases and particles following severe nuclear accidents, using particulate 137 Cs and gaseous 131 I as proxies for the fallout. It appears that previously the occurrence of major accidents and the risks of radioactive contamination have been underestimated. Using a global model of the atmosphere we compute that on average, {{in the event of a}} core melt of any nuclear power plant worldwide, more than 90 % of emitted 137 Cs would be transported beyond 50 km and about 50 % beyond 1000 km distance. This corroborates that such accidents have large-scale and trans-boundary impacts. Although the emission strengths and atmospheric removal processes of 137 Cs and 131 I are quite different, the radioactive contamination patterns over land and the human deposition exposure are computed to be similar. High human exposure risks occur around reactors in densely populated regions, notably in southern Asia where a core melt can subject 55 million people to radioactive contamination. The recent decision by Germany to phase out its nuclear reactors will reduce the national risk, though a large risk will still remain from the reactors in neighbouring countries...|$|R
500|$|In the end, the Three Mile Island accident, {{though it}} [...] "caused a grave crisis, {{did not produce}} a public health disaster". The {{pressure}} vessel held {{when faced with a}} <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> and there was no breach of the [...] power plant's containment structure. Only [...] "tiny amounts of the most dangerous forms of volatile radiation escaped to the atmosphere". It took 11 years to clean up TMI-2 and this cost about US$1 billion.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for New Scientist, Rob Edwards states that Walker {{provides}} a lucid {{account of the}} Three Mile Island accident, which is [...] "riveting because of its detail". It gives a graphic insight into the chaos and confusion of the five-day crisis, and shows how the nuclear industry, the regulators and the government all [...] "initially played down the risks, then had to eat their words". Some 144,000 people were evacuated, but Walker points out that [...] "if {{the full extent of}} the <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> had been known at the time, hundreds of thousands more would have been told to go". Edwards says a [...] "catastrophe was avoided — but only by luck".|$|E

50|$|A nuclear <b>meltdown</b> (<b>core</b> melt {{accident}} or partial core melt) is a severe nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} core damage from overheating.

2500|$|The Three Mile Island {{accident}} was a <b>core</b> <b>meltdown</b> in Unit2 (a {{pressurized water reactor}} manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox) of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania near Harrisburg, United States in 1979.

40|$|Even {{before the}} nuclear <b>core</b> <b>meltdowns</b> at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear {{reactors}} in Japan re-stoked public anxiety about nuclear energy, Vermont’s Senate, {{under the auspices}} of Vermont Act No. 160, voted to block continued operation of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant after the expiration of its forty-year operating license. This article examines whether a state can legislatively override a permit issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission extending the license of a power plant. The author places this question within a broader federalism context, in which states assert their sovereign rights to regulate the environment in the shadow of federal mandates. She finds persuasive the absence of an express preemption provision in the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) or language mandating the use of nuclear power, the AEA’s reservation of state authority over the generation, sale, and transmission of energy produced by nuclear power plants, and the passage of environmental laws giving states regulatory authority over some aspects of nuclear power plant operation. Additionally, the author argues that policy arguments favoring preemption, such as the need for uniformity and coordination of shared resources, superior federal resources and technical knowledge, and prevention of spillover effects do not apply in this situation; while arguments against preemption, such as preserving states as robust centers of governance and regulatory experimentation and as checks on federal government excesses and errors, and avoidance of regulatory gaps and regulatory capture, do. Even collective action problems, which arise when a state thinks solely of its own interests to the detriment of other states or {{the nation as a whole}} and often favor preemption, are weak. An argument that Vermont’s initiative may derail recent national efforts to “restart” the nuclear power industry as a way to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign oil and its global carbon footprint also gains little traction. For these and other reasons, the author concludes that Vermont Act. No. 160 should withstand a preemption challenge...|$|R
