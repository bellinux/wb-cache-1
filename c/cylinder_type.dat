"The ATSB {{undertook}} {{a close and}} detailed study of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>type,</b> including a review of all possible failure scenarios and an engineering evaluation of other cylinders from the same production batch and of the type in general. It was evident that the cylinder had failed by bursting through, or around the base – allowing the release of pressurised contents to project it vertically upwards. While it was hypothesised that the cylinder may have contained a defect or flaw, or been damaged {{in a way that}} promoted failure, there was no evidence found to support such a finding. Nor was there any evidence found to suggest the cylinders from the subject production batch, or the type in general, were in any way predisposed to premature failure." ...|$|E

[6] Explosives as {{a motive}} power were first {{attempted}} by Huyghens {{and one or}} two others in the seventeenth century, and, just as with the turbine type of apparatus, it was probably the impetus given to the development of steam by the convenient collocation of coal and water and the need of an engine, that arrested the advance of this parallel inquiry until our own time. Explosive engines, in which gas and petroleum are employed, are now abundant, but for all that we can regard the explosive engine as still in its experimental stages. So far, research in explosives has been directed chiefly to the possibilities of higher and still higher explosives for use in war, the neglect of the mechanical application of this class of substance being largely due to the fact, that chemists are not as a rule engineers, nor engineers chemists. But an easily portable substance, the decomposition of which would evolve energy, or--what is, from the practical point of view, much the same thing--an easily portable substance, which could be decomposed electrically by wind or water power, and which would then recombine and supply force, either in intermittent thrusts at a piston, or as an electric current, would be infinitely more convenient for all locomotive purposes than the cumbersome bunkers and boilers required by steam. The presumption is altogether in favour of the possibility of such substances. Their advent will be {{the beginning of the end}} for steam traction on land and of the steam ship at sea: the end indeed of the Age of Coal and Steam. And even with regard to steam there may be a curious change of method before the end. It is beginning to appear that, after all, the piston and <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> of engine is, for locomotive purposes--on water at least, if not on land--by no means the most perfect. Another, and fundamentally different type, the turbine type, in which the impulse of the steam spins a wheel instead of shoving a piston, would appear to be altogether better than the adapted pumping engine, at any rate, for the purposes of steam navigation. Hero, of Alexandria, describes an elementary form of such an engine, and the early experimenters of the seventeenth century tried and abandoned the rotary principle. It was not adapted to pumping, and pumping was the only application that then offered sufficient immediate encouragement to persistence. The thing marked time for quite two centuries and a half, therefore, while the piston engines perfected themselves; and only in the eighties did the requirements of the dynamo-electric machine open a [...] "practicable" [...] way of advance. The motors of the dynamo-electric machine in the nineteenth century, in fact, played exactly the rôle of the pumping engine in the eighteenth, and by 1894 so many difficulties of detail had been settled, that a syndicate of capitalists and scientific men could face the construction of an experimental ship. This ship, the Turbinia, after a considerable amount of trial and modification, attained the unprecedented speed of 34½ knots an hour, and His Majesty's navy has possessed, in the Turbinia's younger and greater sister, the Viper, now unhappily lost, a torpedo-destroyer capable of 41 miles an hour. There can be little doubt that the sea speeds of 50 and even 60 miles an hour will be attained within the next few years. But I do not think that these developments will do more than delay the advent of the [...] "explosive" [...] or [...] "storage of force" [...] engine.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of a wall}} {{impingement}} jet on atomization {{characteristics of}} a jet engine fuel injector were investigated experimentally. Liquid is injected from 0. 2 mm-diam nozzles and the liquid columns impinge onto a wall. The liquid forms thin films on the impingement wall and fine droplets can be produced. Several kinds of impingement wall geometries, such as slope, parallel and <b>cylinder</b> <b>types,</b> were examined and the droplet size and atomization mode were investigated. The droplet size was measured with an LDSA. For the slope type, two kinds of atomization mode, namely, ""air blast atomization"" and ""pressure atomization"" modes were observed. The pressure atomization mode is preferable, since it leads to the atomization improvement of a jet engine in low load operations. For parallel types, the atomization characteristics were similar to that for the slope <b>type.</b> For <b>cylinder</b> <b>types,</b> pressure atomization mode can be realized with a small liquid injection pressure.

Reduction of lift force, by any means, is shown to reduce radiated sound intensity, and local lift force is found to vary monotonically with the two dimensionality of the vortex wake.
