The three antibodies show motions that range in time scale from tens of femtoseconds to nanoseconds. Relative to the others, one antibody, 4 - 4 - 20, possesses a rigid binding site that likely results from a short and inflexible heavy chain <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 (HCDR 3) loop and a critical Tyr that acts as a “molecular splint,” rigidifying the antigen across its most flexible internal degree of freedom. The remaining two antibodies, 34 F 10 and 40 G 4, despite being generated against the same antigen, possess binding sites that are considerably more flexible. The more flexible combining sites likely result from longer HCDR 3 loops and a deletion in the light chain <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 1 (LCDR 1) that removes the critical Tyr residue.

Here, we report 2. 2 - and 2. 8 -Å structures of the type 2 IgNAR variable domains 12 Y- 1 and 12 Y- 2. Structural features include, first, an Ig superfamily topology transitional between cell adhesion molecules, antibodies, and T cell receptors; and, second, a vestigial <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 2 at the “bottom” of the molecule, apparently discontinuous from the antigen-binding paratope and similar to that observed in cell adhesion molecules. Thus, we suggest that IgNARs originated as cell-surface adhesion molecules coopted to the immune repertoire and represent an evolutionary lineage independent of variable heavy chain/variable light chain type antibodies. Additionally, both 12 Y- 1 and 12 Y- 2 form unique crystallographic dimers, predominantly mediated by main-chain framework interactions, which represent a possible model for primordial cell-based interactions.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of multiple}} sclerosis (MS) {{is thought to}} involve a T-cell-mediated autoimmune process. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model resembling MS, can be induced by immunization with myelin antigens such as myelin basic protein. The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) usage in EAE is highly restricted in some strains of animals and experimental treatments targeting the TCR {{have been successful in}} EAE. Examination of the TCR beta-chain variable-region (V beta) usage of MBP-specific T-cell lines in MS patients has produced conflicting results. Our previous studies of TCR alpha-chain variable-region usage in monozygotic twins demonstrated a general skewing of the TCR repertoire in individuals with MS. This skewing became apparent only after stimulation with antigens; in peripheral blood lymphocyte preparations from individuals with MS V alpha 8 -bearing T cells were preferentially selected by stimulation with myelin basic protein. In the present study we examined <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 of those V alpha 8 -positive TCRs. Marked sequence heterogeneity was found in all individuals with severe MS. In contrast, restricted areas of <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 were found in healthy control individuals and in individuals with a mild form of MS. Sequences from tetanus toxoid-specific V alpha 8 -positive T cells generated from the same individuals were relatively homogeneous within individuals regardless of disease activity and were distinct from the sequences of <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 in myelin basic protein-stimulated lines. These findings suggest that disease severity may be associated with increased heterogeneity of myelin antigen-specific T cells and could reflect an impaired ability of the immune system to down-regulate these anti-self responses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAntibody {{molecules}} {{are able}} to recognize any antigen with high affinity and specificity. To get insight into the molecular diversity at {{the source of this}} functional diversity, we compiled and analyzed a non-redundant aligned collection of 227 structures of antibody–antigen complexes. Free energy of binding of all the residue side chains was quantified by computational alanine scanning, allowing the first large-scale quantitative description of antibody paratopes. This demonstrated that as few as 8 residues among 30 key positions are sufficient to explain 80 % of the binding free energy in most complexes. At these positions, the residue distribution is not only different from that of other surface residues but also dependent on the role played by the side chain in the interaction, residues participating in the binding energy being mainly aromatic residues, and Gly or Ser otherwise. To question the generality of these binding characteristics, we isolated an antibody fragment by phage display using a biased synthetic repertoire with only two diversified <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>regions</b> and solved its structure in complex with its antigen. Despite this restricted diversity, the structure demonstrated that all <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>regions</b> were involved in the interaction with the antigen and that the rules derived from the natural antibody repertoire apply to this synthetic binder, thus demonstrating the robustness and universality of our results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) and IgA {{nephropathy}} (IgAN) {{are characterized}} by mesangial deposition of polyclonal IgA eventually showing aberrant glycosylation, affinity for mesangial cells and/or co-precipitation with antigen, bacterial peptides, autoantibodies or soluble receptors. IgA were also suggested to be negatively charged and predominantly of λ type but rarely in a monoclonal form. METHODS: A gammopathy case with HSP provided us with a unique molecularly defined nephritogenic IgA 1 λ. Immunological analysis, biological activities, glycosylation analysis and finally IgA sequence were determined. RESULTS: Compared to IgA 1 from healthy subjects or IgAN patients, IgA 1 CAT showed hyposialylation but no hypogalactosylation, in agreement with underexpression of sialyltransferase genes by the plasma cell clone. IgA variable domains had low pIs with negatively charged <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>regions.</b> Weak reactivity appeared against the cationic autoantigen lactoferrin, which was, however, absent from kidney deposits. Deposition also occurred in mice upon injection of only the polymeric form of IgA 1 CAT, despite whether or not co-injected with lactoferrin. CONCLUSIONS: This monoclonal model of IgA nephritogenicity strongly suggests that beside hinge region glycosylation, V domains {{play a role in}} IgA stability and pathogenicity and supports the hypothesis that responses against cationic epitopes from pathogens or autoantigens may select negatively charged <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>regions</b> prone either to bind charged structures of the mesangium or to promote by themselves IgA aggregation and deposition...|$|E

The clonal expansion of self-reactive T cells {{is known to be}} limited during initial antigen encounter by apoptotic or anergic mechanisms, regulatory CD 4 + T cells, and cytokines. Here we report that superimposed on these mechanisms, during the evolution of autoimmunity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CD 8 + T cells are induced, which fine-tune the peripheral self-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. We assayed the myelin basic protein-reactive TCR repertoire in naive, EAE-recovered mice as well as EAE-recovered mice depleted of CD 8 + T cells by TCRVβ surface expression, <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 length distribution, and <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 sequencing analysis. In EAE-recovered mice, certain myelin basic protein-reactive CD 4 +Vβ 8. 2 + clones are significantly decreased and this decrease is not observed if CD 8 + T cells were depleted from these mice. The clones that persist in CD 8 + T cell-intact mice are highly diverse in contrast to the clones expanded in CD 8 + T cell-depleted mice, which are dominated by the significant outgrowth of a few clones.

Using those peptides, we have observed that the replacement at positions 324 F, 325 V, 326 T, and 327 I with each corresponding d-amino acid induced marked reduction of the potency to sensitize targets for P 18 -I 10 -specific murine CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), LINE-IIIB, recognition. To analyze further the role of amino acid at position 325, the most critical site for determining epitope specificity, we have developed a CTL line [LINE-IIIB(325 D) ] and its offspring clones specific for the epitope I- 10 (325 v) having a d-valine (v) at position 325. Taking advantage of two distinct sets of CD 8 + CTLs restricted by the same Dd, three-dimensional structural analysis on TCR and peptide/MHC complexes by molecular modeling was performed, which indicates that the critical amino acids within the TCRs for interacting with 325 V or 325 v appear {{to belong to the}} <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 1 but not to the <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 of Vβ chain...|$|R

Functional cell-based assay could better reflect the mechanism of action of a therapeutic mAb than a ligand binding assay (Hansel et al., 2010; Tada et al., 2014). Moreover, compared to binding assay, cell-based bioassay could detect the impact of chemical modifications, such as deamidation in the <b>complementarity-determining</b> <b>region</b> or the Fc region of the molecule on its potency.
