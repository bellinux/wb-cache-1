In most cases, {{the type of}} leather used is not fashion leather but protective leather, which is thicker, stronger, and only moderately flexible. Today, kangaroo leather is becoming popular for its suppleness, light weight, and strength compared to cowhide. Not all leathers used in garments perform equally; products made from full grain, top grain, <b>corrected</b> <b>grain,</b> and suede can have different levels of resistance to abrasion, as well as tearing and bursting forces.|$|E

40|$|The Interstitial Free (IF) {{grade steel}} sheets {{are used for}} auto body {{applications}} where these sheets require good formability/drawability property. To achieve this property the cold rolled sheets are annealed to obtain desirable texture in the recrystallised grains to avoid material failure during forming operation. The paper deals with an ultrasonic technique to determine {{the condition of the}} recrystallised grains after annealing operation. 79 % cold rolled IF grade steel sheets were annealed at 650 deg. C for different times. After annealing the scale was completely eliminated from the surface by pickling to make the surface conducive for transmission of ultrasonic surface waves. Ultrasonic transit time for a fixed distance in µs was measured in rolling as well as 45 0 to rolling direction using 4 MHz transmitting and receiving transducers. Unrecrystallised, partially recrystallised and fully recrystallised regions in this case were determined by measuring hardness in Rockwell B scale. In fully recrystallised grains the above transit time difference was found to be more than 2. 20 µs in partially recrystallised grains it was within 1. 52 - 2. 20 whereas that for unrecrystallised grains, it was less than 1. 52 µs.

40|$|Foliar {{diseases}} {{are the main}} biotic restriction reducing yield in wheat crops affecting both, grain number and/or grain weight, depending on developmental stage at which infection occurs (pre- or post-anthesis, respectively). Grain weight reductions due to foliar diseases were widely {{reported in the literature}} mostly associated with decreases on radiation interception during the grain filling period. However, different evidences in wheat showed variations on grain weight responses when fungicide was applied during the grain filling period, probably associated with the timing of fungicide application or with the amount of available resources per grain set when fungicides are applied. The present study was designed to determine the causes of grain weight reduction due to foliar diseases complex (including leaf rust, Septoria leaf blotch and tan spot) in wheat crops growing under contrasting agronomic and environmental conditions (i. e. different years, locations, cultivars and N supply). The experiments were carried out during 4 years under field conditions in different locations of Argentine and France. Five different commercial wheat cultivars were sown on early and late sowing dates; and two contrasting N availability and two fungicide treatments (protected and unprotected) were applied. Grain number was not affected by foliar diseases as their appeared after anthesis. Grain weight was strongly, poorly or not affected by foliar diseases and was not associated individually with both, the sink size and the source size. However, when the grain weight response due to fungicide application was plotted against the healthy area absorption per grain (HAAG), a significant negative association (r 2 = 0. 81; p < 0. 0001) was found for the Argentine experiments. When the HAAG was <b>corrected</b> by the <b>grain</b> weight potential (HAAGW) all experiments conduced in Argentine and in France fit well to a common negative linear regression (r 2 = 0. 74, p < 0. 0001) for the relationship between grain weight variation and HAAGW demonstrating that grain weight potential is an important feature to consider in diseases control programs. Foliar diseases forced the crop to use the accumulated reserved increasing the utilization rate of the water soluble carbohydrates (WSCUR), depleting as a consequence the water soluble content at physiological maturity (WSCPM) in all experiments. The association between WSCUR and the healthy area absorption per <b>grain</b> <b>corrected</b> by <b>grain</b> weight of healthy crops (HAAGW) suggest that foliar diseases in wheat cause source limitation, forcing to the crop to use the WSC reserve which could be insufficient to fill the grains previously formed...|$|R

Five bricks were sampled from the medieval churches (10 th– 11 th centuries A. D.) of Rugles and Condé-sur-Risle in Normandy. The samples were divided and tested in the luminescence laboratories of the University of Durham (UK) and of Iramat-CRP 2 A, University of Bordeaux 3 (France). The fine grain and quartz inclusion techniques were applied, and tests included an examination of the anomalous fading of the luminescence signal from fine grain samples and coarse grains of feldspar. With one exception, the dates produced using the fine <b>grain</b> technique, although <b>corrected</b> for fading, were significantly younger than those produced with quartz inclusions. Although most of the <b>corrected</b> fine <b>grain</b> dates were consistent with the medieval construction of the churches, the brick fabric is of Roman type by archaeological assessment, and this is supported by the quartz coarse grain dates.

Conventional methods of measuring {{angle of repose}} are based on manual measurements of angle by protractor or calculation from measured diameter and height of the pile using the trigonometric equation. These methods {{are based on the}} assumption that the stacked grains form a symmetrical cone, and the left and right contact angles are equal, which is not <b>correct</b> as <b>grain</b> piles are rarely of an ideal cone shape with perfectly straight surfaces. To address the limitations of these standard methods we are introducing a new method based on the real shape of a grain pile taken by photographic image.

For this work a low cost web camera connected to the note book computer and freely available software Image J were used. Measurements of the angle of repose for several wheat grain piles using existing and the new method were performed. Our results indicate slight disagreement between these two methods showing 10 degrees to 15 degrees higher values for the new optical method proving it to be more accurate. Mahaveer D.

40|$|Eight {{techniques}} {{to quantify the}} deposition of aeolian dust on horizontal surfaces were tested in a wind tunnel. The tests included three theoretical techniques and five measurement techniques. The theoretical techniques investigated were: the gradient technique, the inferential technique without grain-shape correction, and the inferential technique <b>corrected</b> for <b>grain</b> shape. The measuring techniques included the following surrogate surfaces: a water surface, a glass surface, a metal surface, a vertical array of metal plates, and an inverted frisbee filled with glass marbles. The efficiency of the techniques was investigated for the sediment as a whole (all grain sizes together) {{as well as for}} a large number of grain sizes extending from 1 to 104 m. The surrogate surfaces showed more or less comparable catch efficiencies, although the water surface nearly always caught the highest quantities of dust and the marble-filled frisbee and the vertical array of metal plates the lowest quantities of dust. The dust fluxes calculated by theoretical methods were markedly different from those obtained by direct measurements. The fluxes calculated by the inferential technique approximated those of the direct measurements only for grain sizes between 30 and 40 m. For smaller and coarser grains, deviations from the measured fluxes were high. The gradient method, in its turn, provided extremely low calculated fluxes for grains in all size classes investigated. The latter technique was not considered very reliable for the dust used in the test...|$|R

The latest maturity hybrid (B 73 Ht x Mo 17 Ht) was higher and the earliest maturing hybrid (A 619 Ht x A 632 Ht) was lower in dry matter yield; an average increase of 20. 3 % in dry matter yield would be possible with the latest hybrid;Differences among harvest dates in the combined analyses were significant for green stover weight, dried ear weight, dried grain weight, and harvest index, indicating linear effects;Phenotypic and genotypic correlations between traits for all hybrids, such as between mature <b>grain</b> yield <b>corrected</b> for moisture and dried stover weight (0. 605 and 0. 597), mature <b>grain</b> <b>corrected</b> for moisture and days to mid-silk (0. 763 and 0. 804), and dried plant weight and days to mid-silk (0. 992 and 1. 00), were estimated;Relatively later maturing hybrids had acceptable levels of dry matter, crude protein, and digestible dry matter and could possibly be used for forage corn production in short season areas.

A paper in 2007 by Lutsey et al. looked at the relationship between whole grains and CVD biomarkers. The {{results of this study}} found an inverse association between whole grain intake and diabetes risk but were unable to find significant results with CVD biomarkers. In the time since the publication of this paper, MESA corrected an error in how dark bread was counted in total whole grain intake. The {{purpose of this study was}} to replicate the analysis in Lutsey et al. using the <b>corrected</b> whole <b>grain</b> intake. Methods: Whole grain intake was assessed using a 127 -item food frequency questionnaire collected between 2000 and 2002 during MESA exam 1. We applied the same exclusion criteria as Lutsey, et al (n= 5493) and compared them against the five original outcomes; obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, newly diagnosed diabetes, and subclinical CVD. Results: In our analysis, the whole grain data modification greatly altered mean intake and shifted subjects around within the five study quintiles (mean intake of Q 1 = 0. 04 g; Q 2 = 0. 32 g; Q 3 = 0. 65 g; Q 4 = 1. 03 g; Q 5 = 1. 79 g). However, our replication of the paper did not change key outcomes of Lutsey et al. Conclusion: Our re-analysis supports the association between whole grain intake and diabetes and no relationship was found with subclinical CVD in the MESA cohort.

40|$|This paper explores several paths {{by which}} the {{extended}} cognition (EC) thesis may overcome the coupling-constitution fallacy. In so doing, I address a couple of shortcomings in the contemporary literature. First, on the dimension of first-wave EC, I argue that constitutive arguments based on functional parity suffer from either a threat of cognitive bloat or an impasse with respect to determining the <b>correct</b> level of <b>grain</b> in the attribution of causal-functional roles. Second, on the dimension of second-wave EC, I argue that especially the complementarity approach suffers from a similar sort of dilemma as first-wave EC: an inability to justify just what entails the ontological claim of EC over the scaffolding claim of weaker approaches in cognitive science. In this paper I show that two much more promising explanations by which to ground the ontological claim of EC are available, both starting from {{an exploration of the}} coordination dynamics between environmental resources and neural resources. On the one hand, I argue that second-wave EC based on cognitive integration, with its focus on bodily manipulations constrained by cognitive norms, is capable of resolving the coupling-constitution fallacy. On the other hand, I argue that the framework of cognitive integration can be supplemented by philosophical accounts of mechanistic explanation, because such accounts enable us to explain the emergence of higher-level cognitive properties due to a system 2 ̆ 7 s organization-dependent structure...|$|R

The measurement of low-energy gamma photons is complicated in heterogeneous samples containing high-density mineral phases {{and in such}} situations activity concentrations will be underestimated. This is because attenuation corrections, calculated based on sample mean density, do not properly <b>correct</b> where dense <b>grains</b> are dispersed within a less dense matrix (analogous to a nugget effect). The current method overcomes these problems using a lithium tetraborate fusion that readily dissolves all components including high-density, self-attenuating minerals/compounds. This is the ideal method for dissolving complex, non-volatile components in soils, rocks, mineral concentrates, and other materials where density reduction is required. Lithium borate fusion avoids the need for theoretical efficiency corrections or measurement of matrix matched calibration standards. The resulting homogeneous quenched glass produced can be quickly dissolved in nitric acid producing low-density solutions that can be counted by gamma spectrometry. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated using uranium-bearing Certified Reference Materials and provides accurate activity concentration determinations compared to the underestimated activity concentrations derived from direct measurements of a bulk sample. The procedure offers an effective solution for initial nuclear forensic studies where complex refractory minerals or matrices exist. It is also significantly faster, safer and simpler than alternative approaches...|$|R

The three stimuli were: the sample (correct comparison) location for that trial, the incorrect comparison location for that trial, or one of the seven unused locations for that trial. Relative to blank trials, accuracy improved slightly on sample-interpolated trials, decreased slightly on unused location-interpolated trials, and decreased considerably on incorrect comparison-interpolated trials.

Conversion efficiency affects the amount of electricity a solar cell can generate. Due to the relatively recent discovery of this problem, not much {{research has been done}} on this topic. It is not currently known if the trapping of electrons and holes is a good or bad thing, current research is ongoing to answer these questions [...] Grain {{boundaries are}} the cracks between two grains of a material and often occur when two grains are misaligned where they meet, they are a type of defect in the cell. Defects are areas in which the crystal lattice of the atomic structure of a material is not in the <b>correct</b> orientation. [...] <b>Grain</b> boundaries are usually in the size range of a few nm in depth and length. Grain interior is a term often associated with grain boundaries and stands for the interior of the grain itself. The trapping of electrons in a grain boundary could potentially create localized pn junctions and make that area of the cell positively charged as holes will be attracted to the region to facilitate recombination. Recombination is the recombining of electrons and holes when the electrons fall out of the conduction band recombine with a hole [...] On the other hand, if holes are trapped in a grain boundary, this creates a negatively charged local pn junction due to the holes in the area being repelled. It is believed that these local pn junctions affect the overall pn junction of the cell, thus affecting conversion efficiency. This could potentially cause the efficiency of the cell to drop significantly, which would in turn cause the amount of electricity coming out of the cell to drop.|$|R

40|$|The Xigaze forearc basin in {{southern}} Tibet, {{one of the}} largest and best-preserved forearc basins on Earth, records upper-plate processes active prior to and following the inter-continental collision between India and Asia. However, the understanding of the timing and mechanisms of forearc development and its evolution following collision is spatially and temporally limited. Fundamental questions remain concerning how the basin formed, its paleogeography prior to collision, its subsidence history and the thermal history of the basin following the initial and ongoing continent-continent collision. Answering these questions is important to reconstructing upper plate dynamics during active subduction of oceanic and continental lithosphere. This dissertation addresses the Early Cretaceous to Pliocene history of the Xigaze forearc, using field mapping, sedimentology, sandstone modal petrography, geohistory analysis, U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology, and low-temperature thermochronology (apatite and zircon (U-Th/He)). Appendix A documents the sedimentology and stratigraphy of Lower Cretaceous to Paleocene strata to identify the relationship between the Yarlung-Tsangpo ophiolite and Xigaze forearc basin, reconstruct the sedimentary environments of the southern margin of Asia during the initial to middle stages of forearc deposition, and use the basin history to evaluate the mechanisms controlling forearc subsidence. In Appendix B, analysis of Eocene sedimentary strata, the youngest preserved in the forearc basin, constrains the timing of collision between Asia and the Tethyan Himalaya (India) to be no later than 58 - 54 Ma based on the similarity of the U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra and sandstone compositions between the Xigaze forearc and strata deposited atop the passive margin of the Tethyan Himalayan at that time. Apatite and zircon (U-Th) /He thermochronologic results in Appendix C constrain the maximum burial temperature of the basin following collision to ~ 140 - 200 °C, which corresponds to depths attainable by sedimentation in the forearc and a Paleogene forearc successor basin. This integrated dataset also identifies the initial stage of post-collisional exhumation during the Early Miocene (~ 20 - 15 Ma), followed by accelerated cooling during the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene (~ 10 - 4 Ma). These results suggest the presence of a paleo-Yarlung River and/or intensification of the Asian monsoon during the Early to Late Miocene. The Pliocene cooling signal is the youngest reported to date along the IYSZ and likely reflects increased river incision of the Yarlung-Tsangpo driven by accelerated orogen-parallel extension across structures which cross-cut the IYSZ. Robust interpretation of thermochronologic data requires knowledge about the geologic factors and intrinsic properties of the minerals. Appendix D of this dissertation examines intragranular zonation as a source of anomalously young zircon (U-Th) /He ages from leucogranites that intrude Greater Himalayan Sequence rocks at Ronbguk Valley, north of Mt. Everest. Depth profile laser ablation ICP-MS analysis was used to quantify the U-Th concentration profiles of a series of zoned, single, whole zircon grains and to apply a grain specific zonation-dependent age correction. Zircon <b>grains</b> <b>corrected</b> for zonation yield zircon He ages of 15 - 17 Ma, in agreement with AFT, ZFT and mica ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar ages from the region. This study highlights the importance of characterizing intragranular zonation, especially in complex, zoned zircons that are typical of crustal melts and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Appendix E synthesis the results from Appendices A-C in the context of a global comparison with other ancient and preserved forearc basins. Results from the Xigaze forearc basin are compared to general models for forearc basin formation, subsidence trends, and preservation. The results show similarities between the Xigaze forearc basin and modern forearc basins, such as the Japan forearc off Honshu Island. The mechanisms driving tectonic subsidence are addressed, but remain an area of frontier research in continental dynamics...|$|R
