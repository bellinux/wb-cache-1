5|$|A seven-mile (11km) journey over {{increasingly}} {{rolling and}} open terrain takes the two highways {{into the town}} of North East and towards Millerton. Just south of the village, NY199 reaches its eastern terminus. The road enters Millerton on South Elm Street, making a sharp turn north that necessitates a <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier</b> and a lower speed limit just south of downtown.|$|E

The crew safely evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft was carrying several bombs at the time, most of which detonated in succession during the fire. The aircraft was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, I-196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|E
40|$|On-site {{collision}} tests of full-scale <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are an important}} method to understand what happens to <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> when vehicles collide with them. However, such tests require both time and money, so modeling and simulation of collisions by computer have been developed as an alternative in this research. First, spring subgrade models were developed to formulate the ground boundary of <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> based on previous experiments. Then, the finite element method models were developed for both heavy trucks and <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> to simulate their dynamic collision performances. Comparison of the results generated from computer simulations and on-site experiments demonstrates that the developed models {{can be applied to}} simulate the collision of heavy trucks with <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers,</b> to replicate the movement of the truck at the collision, and to investigate the performance of the <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers.</b> The developed research methodology can be widely used to support the design of new <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> and the safety analysis of existing ones...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{developments}} {{in the use of}} steel and <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers,</b> this study investigates again (for the earlier research see B 30413 (IRRD 833009) the safety aspects of steel and <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers.</b> The aim is to come to precise statements concerning injury severity in collisions with steel or <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers,</b> in particular when these barriers are placed in the median strip. The angle of the collision, the speed of the collision and the frequency of occurrence is taken into account.

40|$|Real vehicle {{collision}} {{experiments on}} full-scale road safety barriers {{are important to}} determine {{the outcome of a}} vehicle versus barrier impact accident. However, such experiments require large investment of time and money. Numerical simulation has therefore been imperative as an alternative method for testing <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers.</b> In this research, spring subgrade models were first developed to simulate the ground boundary of <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers.</b> Both heavy trucks and <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> were modeled using finite element methods (FEM) to simulate dynamic collision performances. Comparison of the results generated from computer simulations and on-site full-scale experiments demonstrated that the developed models could be applied to simulate the collision of heavy trucks with <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> to provide the data to design new road safety barriers and analyze existing ones...|$|R
5|$|Twenty {{minutes into}} the final {{qualifying}} session, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger failed to negotiate the Villeneuve curva in his Simtek; he subsequently hit the opposing <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier</b> wall almost head-on and was critically injured. Although the survival cell remained largely intact, {{the force of the}} impact inflicted a basal skull fracture. Ratzenberger, in his first season as a Formula One driver, had run over a kerb at the Acque Minerali chicane on his previous lap, the impact of which is believed to have damaged his front wing. Rather than return to the pitlane, he continued on another fast lap. Travelling at 190mph (306km/h) his car suffered a front wing failure leaving him unable to control it.|$|E
5|$|Within Overlake, SR520 turns {{north and}} passes through several office parks, {{including}} the headquarters campus of Microsoft and the Nintendo of America branch office. To serve exits at Northeast 40th Street and Northeast 51st Street, SR520 gains {{a set of}} collector–distributor lanes, separated from other lanes by a <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier.</b> The freeway crosses the Sammamish River and turns east, passing {{to the south of}} the Redmond Town Center mall and Bear Creek and to the north of Marymoor Park. East of downtown Redmond, SR520 intersects SR202 and terminates; the road continues north as Avondale Road towards Cottage Lake. Portions of the corridor from Evergreen Point to Downtown Redmond are also paralleled by a shared-use trail for bicycles and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier</b> to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

5|$|Roald Goethe {{was caught}} off guard as Hülkenberg lapped his No. 96 Aston Martin in Corvette Corner, causing Goethe to spin and heavily impact a <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier</b> leaving the turn. Goethe was {{conscious}} but needed aid in {{getting out of the}} Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the pit lane during the safety car period to change brakes, but was unable to get back out of pit lane in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome pulled off the track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were in the slow zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck in the gravel, losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the pit lane but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} general types of guardrail, ranging from weakest and {{inexpensive}} to strongest and expensive; cable and wood posts, steel and wood/metal posts, steel box-beam, and <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers.</b> While cheaper guardrail is the weakest, often being destroyed {{from the impact}} of a light vehicle, it is inexpensive and quick to repair, so this is frequently used in low-traffic rural areas. On the other hand, <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> can usually withstand direct hits from a larger variety of vehicle types, making them well suited for use on high volume routes such as freeways. While rarely damaged, they would be considerably more expensive and time-consuming to repair. <b>Concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> are frequently installed in the median, being expected to withstand frequent impacts from both sides, while the shoulders of the road often have cheaper guardrail. Although the use of <b>concrete</b> <b>barriers</b> {{on the right side of}} highway is becoming a much for frequent occurrence in areas where guardrail may be sustaining frequent impacts and the ability for maintenance repairs may be restricted by the general area or work windows due to high traffic volumes for most of the day.|$|R

The route is a four lane arterial, winding through the Glen Head section of Oyster Bay. A short distance later, NY107 intersects with another portion of Cedar Swamp Road, which forks to the northeast. After this junction, NY107 becomes a four-lane freeway through Glen Head, with the median being replaced by a <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier.</b> Along this stretch, NY107 crosses under the Long Island Rail Road's Oyster Bay Branch, just west of the Glen Street station.

25|$|Weatherly was {{considering}} retirement going into 1964, and he drove {{only a couple}} of races for Moore, until tragedy struck. While racing Moore's No. 8 Mercury at Riverside International Raceway, Weatherly began setting up for Turn 6 when he lost control and struck the <b>concrete</b> <b>barrier,</b> then slid across the racetrack where his car came to a stop. Weatherly was dead when workers got to his car. He died when his car hit the barrier, as his head slid out the window and hit the wall, suffering major head injuries. Moore retired No. 8 and switched to No. 1, and hired Billy Wade, the 1963 NASCAR Rookie of the Year, to drive. Wade had a strong year, winning four consecutive races and finishing fourth in points. Bobby Johns, Johnny Rutherford, and Darel Dieringer also saw time in the car, with Dieringer winning at Augusta Speedway.|$|E

40|$|Prior to the mid 1980 s, asphalt {{barriers}} {{were primarily}} {{used to control}} water seepage from facilities such as ponds, impoundments and earth dams.

The establishment of rules for hazardous and solid waste landfill designs focused the industry toward composite liners consisting of geomembranes and compacted soil. However, in the mid- 1980 s, resurgence into the use of asphalt concrete for waste isolation was initiated by the US Department of Energy {{in their quest for}} very-long-term (1000 + years) hydraulic barriers for radioactive and mixed waste sites.
