50|$|Operational <b>Control</b> <b>Language</b> (OCL) is the <b>control</b> <b>language</b> of the IBM System/34 and System/36 {{minicomputer}} family. Other <b>control</b> <b>languages</b> include CL (System/38 and AS/400), JCL (System/370), and REXX (AS/400). The facility of DOS to use batch files is also <b>control</b> <b>language.</b>|$|R
50|$|The System/3 came {{standard}} with a RPG II compiler, {{and used}} a simple job <b>control</b> <b>language</b> called OCL, which was superficially similar to the famous (or infamous) Job <b>Control</b> <b>Language.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{languages}} selected {{are called}} <b>control</b> <b>languages.</b> The primary <b>controls</b> are English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, with Spanish and Portuguese taken as one <b>language.</b> The secondary <b>controls</b> are German and Russian. According {{to the rule}} of three, a word is eligible for Interlingua if it occurs in at least three of the four primary <b>control</b> <b>languages,</b> with either or both of the secondary <b>control</b> <b>languages</b> acting as possible substitutes.|$|R

25|$|A word, {{that is a}} {{form with}} meaning, is {{eligible}} for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by {{at least three of}} the four primary <b>control</b> <b>languages.</b> Either secondary <b>control</b> <b>language</b> can substitute for a primary language. Any word of Indo-European origin found in a <b>control</b> <b>language</b> can contribute to the eligibility of an international word. In some cases, the archaic or potential presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} {{generating function}} of a language enumerates the number of distinct words contained in the language {{with respect to their}} length. Given any language generated unambiguously by a grammar with context-free <b>control</b> <b>language</b> or generated n-unambiguously by a state grammar with context-free <b>control</b> <b>language</b> or generated unambiguously by a tuple grammar with contextfree <b>control</b> <b>language,</b> a method is described which yields a system of equations, whose unique solution is the structure generating function...|$|R
50|$|A <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> {{designed}} for machine translation will significantly {{improve the quality}} of machine-generated translation proposals and it will reduce the time and cost of human translators editing.|$|E
5000|$|More {{restrictive}} and <b>controlled</b> <b>language,</b> more {{uniform and}} standardized resulting source document and higher the match rate in a translation memory system, and the translation cost is cheaper.|$|E
50|$|In certain applications, however, e.g., product {{descriptions}} {{written in}} a <b>controlled</b> <b>language,</b> a dictionary-based machine-translation system has produced satisfactory translations that require no human intervention save for quality inspection.|$|E
50|$|Data <b>Control</b> <b>Language</b> (DCL).A data <b>control</b> <b>language</b> (DCL) is a syntax {{similar to}} a {{computer}} programming <b>language</b> used to <b>control</b> access to data stored in a database (Authorization). In particular, it is a component of Structured Query Language (SQL).|$|R
25|$|New {{words can}} be derived {{internally}} – that is, from existing Interlingua words – or extracted from the <b>control</b> <b>languages</b> {{in the manner of}} the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the <b>control</b> <b>languages,</b> is more limited than in schematic languages.|$|R
50|$|The job <b>control</b> <b>language</b> was {{the same}} on {{terminals}} or in batch jobs and included conditional operations and macro operations. In contrast to Unix systems the job <b>control</b> <b>language</b> {{was part of the}} operating system rather than being a user level shell process.|$|R

50|$|Basic English is an English-based <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> {{created by}} {{linguist}} and philosopher Charles Kay Ogden {{as an international}} auxiliary language, and as an aid for teaching English as a second language. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar (1930).|$|E

2500|$|Interlingua {{has been}} {{developed}} to omit any grammatical feature that is absent from any one primary <b>control</b> <b>language.</b> Thus, Interlingua has no noun–adjective agreement by gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese gatas negras or Italian gatte nere, 'black female cats'), because this is absent from English, and it has no progressive verb tenses (English I am reading), because they are absent from French. Conversely, Interlingua distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns because all the <b>control</b> <b>languages</b> do. [...] With respect to the secondary <b>control</b> <b>languages,</b> Interlingua has articles, unlike Russian.|$|R

As an FBM dialect, DOGMA supports both graphical notations and textual presentation in a <b>controlled</b> <b>language.</b> Semantic decision tables, for example, {{is a means}} to visualize processes in a DOGMA commitment. SDRule-L [...] is to visualize and publish ontology-based decision support models.|$|E
5000|$|As a <b>controlled</b> <b>language,</b> Newspeak {{influences}} and limits thought by decreasing {{the range of}} expressiveness of the English language, wherein words serve as nouns and as verbs; thus, the word crimethink denotes [...] "a thoughtcrime" [...] (noun) and the action [...] "to commit thoughtcrime" [...] (verb). The adjective is formed with the suffix [...] "-ful" [...] (crimethinkful) and the adverb is formed with the suffix [...] "-wise" [...] (crimethinkwise).|$|E
50|$|ASD STE-100 Simplified Technical English, or Simplified English, is the {{original}} name of a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> specification originally developed for aerospace industry maintenance manuals. It is a carefully limited and standardized subset of English. It is now officially known under its trademarked name as Simplified Technical English (STE). STE is regulated {{for use in the}} aerospace and defense industries, but other industries have used it as a basis for their own controlled English standards.|$|E

50|$|Controlled vocabularies {{are also}} quickly out-dated and in fast {{developing}} fields of knowledge, the authorized terms available {{might not be}} available {{if they are not}} updated regularly. Even in the best case scenario, <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> is often not as specific as using the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while a free text search is in no danger of doing so, because it uses the author's own words.|$|E
50|$|Newspeak is the {{language}} of Oceania, a fictional totalitarian state ruled by the Party, who created {{the language}} to meet the ideological requirements of English Socialism (Ingsoc). In George Orwell's world of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Newspeak is a <b>controlled</b> <b>language,</b> of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, a linguistic design meant to limit the freedom of thought—personal identity, self-expression, free will—that ideologically threatens the régime of Big Brother and the Party, who thus criminalised such concepts as thoughtcrime, contradictions of Ingsoc orthodoxy.|$|E
