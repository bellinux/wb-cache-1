40|$|The surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) is effective for the manipulation of fluids and particles at microscale. The current approach of integrating interdigitated transducers (IDTs) for SAW generation into microfluidic channels involves complex and laborious microfabrication steps.

This work presents an affordable and innovative method for fabricating SAW-based microfluidic devices {{without the need for}} <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> <b>facilities</b> and alignment. The IDTs and microfluidic channels are fabricated using the same process and thus are precisely self-aligned in accordance with the device design.

50|$|The {{search for}} the meteorites is done visually. A team of four to ten explorers, {{typically}} meteorite scientists, lives for 5-7 weeks on the ice field. Using snowmobiles spaced 30 m apart they scan the blue ice for meteorites. Once a specimen has been located its position is found using GPS and it is given an identification number. It is then placed in a sterile Teflon bag. The teams {{make sure that the}} specimen remains frozen throughout its journey back to the Antarctic Meteorite Curation Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Since 1976, ANSMET has returned over 20,000 meteorites. Meteorites of greater interest and undergoing detailed study are kept at JSC for distribution to the scientific community, though, ultimately, all samples collected by ANSMET are transferred to the Smithsonian Institution for permanent storage and curation. These meteorites are housed at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center <b>clean</b> <b>room</b> <b>facility</b> at Suitland, Maryland, which is modeled after the Lunar Processing Laboratory at NASA’s Lyndon B.

Findings We have used the API Staph identification kit (bioMérieux, France) which depends on the expression of metabolic activities and or morphological features to identify the Staphylococcus isolates. The API staphylococci showed low sensitivity in the identification of some species, so we performed molecular methods based on PCR based fingerprinting of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene as useful taxonomic tool for examining Staphylococcus isolates. Conclusions Our results showed that PCR protocol used in this study which depends on genotypic features was relatively accurate, rapid, sensitive and superior in the identification of at least 7 species of Staphylococcus than API Staph which depends on phenotypic features. </p...|$|E
