Thus, magnesium in its pure form or as a conventional alloy is not suited for permanently conveying high loads and forces of the kind typically encountered in central components of the engine. Therefore, BMW combined the N52 block to use magnesium alloy for the crankcase shell, with an aluminum “inner block” to complement the magnesium disadvantages.|$|E

Crosslinked polymers {{are resistant to}} most organic solvents such as acetone, alcohols, hydrocarbons, methylene, chloride, chloroform, and other halogenated hydrocarbons, to common fuels and to hydraulic fluids in contrast to readily soluble uncrosslinked polymers. In addition, the degree of crosslinking of the polymers depends upon {{the percentage of the}} connecting groups which are methylene which ranges from 5 to 50 pct and preferably from 25 to 50 pct of the connecting groups, and is also controlled by the level of irradiation which ranges from 25 to 1000 Mrads and preferably from 25 to 250 Mrads. The temperature of the reaction conditions ranges from 25 to 200 C and preferably at or slightly above the glass transition temperature of the polymer.

40|$|In geomechanics one often {{encounters}} large deformations, {{soil-structure interaction}} and dynamical problems, e. g., in pile driving and installation of anchors. Moreover, geomechanical phenomena that include excessive movement of soil masses like landslides can pose {{a danger to}} human life and property. The numerical simulation of the physics is challenging, particularly if a saturated soil is subjected to dynamic loading, leading to propagation of different waves in the soil. Because of the reliance of Lagrangian finite element methods (FEM) on a mesh, they are not well suited {{for the treatment of}} extremely large deformations of solids. The need for overcoming this limitation urged researchers throughout the last decades to devote considerable effort to the development of more advanced computational techniques. Such techniques include the combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian finite element methods, meshless methods and mesh-based particle methods. The intent of this thesis is to further develop and extend the material point method (MPM), which is a mesh-based particle method, for use in geomechanics. MPM can be conceived as an extension of FEM, in which soil and structural bodies are represented by Lagrangian particles that move through an Eulerian fixed mesh. The physical properties of the continuum reside with particles throughout the computations (deformations), whereas the Eulerian mesh and its Gauss points carry no permanent information. Hence, MPM combines the best aspects of both Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations and avoids as much as possible the shortcomings of them. Three novel MPM development are described in this thesis. In the analysis of geomechanical problems that involve dynamics, absorbing boundaries are introduced to prevent the reflection ofwaves at the selected boundary of the domain. The well-known viscous boundaries, which will continuously <b>creep</b> <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> are modified to viscoelastic boundaries by introducing Kelvin-Voigt elements to limit such non-physical displacements. The novel extension of MPM to model the behavior of saturated soils under dynamic loading is formulated. Enhancement of volumetric strains is adopted to mitigate the spurious pressure oscillations which plague low-order finite element implementations. The algorithm is applied to predict the generation and dissipation of pore pressures in a sea dike under heavy dynamic loading by wave attack. Numerical simulation of pile driving is investigated. Results of shallow and deep penetration are presented. Due to the complex behavior of sand in pile driving, a highly non-linear advanced hypoplastic model is to be used for sand. Explicit Euler forward scheme with sub-stepping technique is used in the integration of this model. MPM is applied to analyze different geomechanical problems, including the collapse of a tunnel face, the instability of a slope and the deep installation of a dynamic anchor. The dynamic MPM can be applied to quasi-static problems. To this end, a local damping procedure for single and two-phase materials is discussed, being applied to reach fast convergence to quasi-static equilibrium. Such convergence is detected by two proposed criteria on force and energy. Mass scaling is presented as a procedure that allows the use of large time step size for problems, in which inertia effect can be disregarded. In der Geotechnik ergeben sich häufig Problemstellungen bei denen große Verformungen auftreten, wie etwa Hangrutschungen oder das Einrammen von Pfählen. Die Analyze solcher Fragestellungen stellt eine erhebliche Herausforderung für heutige numerische Methoden dar. Die klassische Finite-Elemente-Methode (FEM) liefert infolge großer Verzerrungen des FE-Netzes oft keine zuverlässigen Ergebnisse.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the endurance of cemented femoral reconstructions in total hip arthroplasty is affected by the creep of acrylic cement, but it is not known to what extent cement <b>creeps</b> <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions in vivo, or how this affects load transfer. We have simulated the long-term creep properties of acrylic cement in finite-element models of femoral stem constructs and analysed their effects. We investigated whether subsidence rates measured in vivo could be explained by creep of acrylic cement, and if polished, unbonded, stems accommodated creep better than bonded stems. Our findings showed that polished prostheses subsided only about 50 µm as a result of cement creep. The long-term prosthetic subsidence rates caused by creep of acrylic cement are therefore very small and do not explain the excessive migration rates which have sometimes been reported. Cement creep did, however, relax cement stresses and create a more favourable stress distribution at the interfaces. These trends were found around both the bonded and unbonded stems. Our results did not confirm that polished, unbonded, stems accommodated creep better than bonded stems in terms of cement and interface stress patterns...|$|R

Later on, a new model, Extended Drucker-Prager Cap Yielding Function, is suggested to describe the three axial compression stress state of mortar in masonry in case deformation properties of mortar are larger than the ones of mortar, and to describe the three axial compression stress state of brick in the other case.

The experimental curves of hardened specimens <b>creep</b> <b>under</b> the axial <b>loads</b> 353, 385, 406. 2, 420 MPa and test duration of 100 – 160 hours are obtained. The axial and circumferential residual stresses after the hardening and the creep at the given temperature and load conditions are constructed by the method of circles and strips. The significant qualitative and quantitative changes of residual stresses take place <b>under</b> the tension <b>load</b> σ¯ in comparison with the thermal exposure (heat exposal with no load). The relaxation of residual stresses is essentially independent of the thermal exposure. In contrast, the loading leads to the significant residual stresses relaxation and to the changes in the distribution type.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} network model for mechano-sorptive creep is presented, {{which is a}} further development of an earlier paper [Strömbro, J., Gudmundson, P., 2008. Mechano-sorptive <b>creep</b> <b>under</b> compressive <b>loading</b> – a micromechanical model. International Journal of Solids and Structures 45 (9), 2420 – 2450. ]. It is assumed that the anisotropic hygroexpansion of the fibres leads to large stresses at the fibre bonds when the moisture content changes. The resulting stress state will accelerate creep if the fibre material obeys a constitutive law that is non-linear. Fibre kinks are included in order to capture experimental observations of larger mechano-sorptive effects in compression than in tension. Moisture dependent material parameters and anisotropy in the fibre distribution have been introduced.

40|$|Creep of a neck {{between two}} rigid spherical {{particles}} {{of the same}} size by coupled grain-boundary and surface diffusion has been simulated. Both tension and compression are considered. In general, the calculations confirm that the rates of particle approach and neck growth <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> are linear functions of the level of loading. The linearity holds even during non-equilibrium regimes of deformation when curvature of the particle surfaces in the neck area depends on the external loading. Special attention was devoted to the exceptions from the linear behaviour. As a first example of non-linear behaviour, <b>creep</b> <b>under</b> tensile <b>loading</b> is considered. It is shown that tensile loading can lead to the formation of crack-like cavities in the neck between particles. The crack growth rate is a non-linear function of the level of external loading. Initially, it was assumed that loss of pore stability <b>under</b> high compressive <b>loading</b> could also lead to a non-linear creep regime. However, the calculations do not reveal unstable collapse of pores. For the lower levels of stress of the order of the sintering stress, non-linear behaviour is detected both for tension and compression at the moment of transition from one stage of pressure-assisted sintering to another. Despite their transient nature, nonlinear regimes {{play an important role in}} creep because they connect together different stages of linear behaviour. (C) 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.
