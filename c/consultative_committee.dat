5|$|The <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> for Thermometry, {{part of the}} International Committee for Weights and Measures {{publishes a}} mise en {{pratique}} (practical technique), last updated in 1990, for measuring temperature which, at very low and at very high temperatures, makes great use of linking energy to temperature via the Boltzmann constant.|$|E
5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E

40|$|Police-community <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> {{illustrate}} the enhanced community responsibility {{and participation in}} policing efforts. The primary objectives of these groups are to increase communication between {{the police and the}} community, to improve police/community relations, and serve as a forum where the community and police can share information and mutually identify concerns. In this study, the emergence of police-community <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> in Ottawa-Carleton is examined within the context of police partnerships. This thesis focuses on five police community <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> in the Ottawa-Carleton region. The findings suggest that police representatives on the committees have made commendable efforts to establish partnerships between the police and the community, but obstacles appear to hinder the process. These obstacles include a perception among many of the police representatives that {{there is a lack of}} organizational support for community policing, that committee members may not be clear as to their roles and responsibilities on <b>consultative</b> <b>committees,</b> and that committees may not be representative of the community they represent.

5|$|In 1921 the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to cover all units of measure, not just length and mass and in 1933 the 8th CGPM resolved {{to work with other}} international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement, the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> for Units, has representatives from many international organisations including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the chairmanship of the CIPM.|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing civil society.

These institutions were merged in 1967 {{with those of the}} European Community, which then governed the ECSC, except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Underground State {{represented}} most, {{though not}} all, political factions of the Second Polish Republic. The Political <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> (PKP) represented four major Polish parties: the Socialist Party (PPS-WRN), the People's Party (SL), the SN, and the Labor Party (SP). The SP joined the PKP in June 1940, {{four months after}} the PKP was created; and the PPS-WRN withdrew from the PKP between October 1941 and March 1943. Those parties, known as the Big Four, were also represented in the Home Political Representation (KRP). Compared to PKP and KRP, the Council of National Unity was much more representative, and included representatives of several smaller political groupings. Several other groups lacked significant representation in PKP and KRP, but nonetheless had supported the Underground State. Non-Polish ethnic minorities, primarily the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, were not represented in the Underground State; however the Jews were.|$|E
