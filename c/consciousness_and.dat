5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> Kali {{as power}} or energy. <b>Consciousness</b> <b>and</b> energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E
5|$|Andhatamisra (blind-darkness): Here, a man – who deceives {{another man}} and enjoys {{his wife or}} {{children}} – is tormented to the extent he loses his <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> sight. The torture is described as cutting the tree at its roots.|$|E

5|$|There are six main {{types of}} {{generalized}} seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures. They all involve loss of <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> typically happen without warning.|$|E
5|$|Cooper allies with Mr. Ribs to {{free the}} imprisoned {{children}} before finally reaching the exit of the mansion. Once outside, imps knock Cooper and Mr. Ribs out, but Ma Soupswill arrives and defeats them. Cooper regains <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> he and Amber leave the mansion, but the household staff prefer to stay. As Cooper and Amber walk towards a small town, the Baron can be seen flying his plane towards it.|$|E
5|$|Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) {{journey to}} the Greene home. There, Glenn begins to pray for the {{well-being}} of his fellow survivors, while T-Dog receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. Meanwhile Carl goes in and out of <b>consciousness,</b> <b>and</b> briefly recalls his encounter with the deer before going into a seizure.

50|$|The Thirty verses also {{outlines}} the Yogacara {{theory of the}} Eight <b>Consciousnesses</b> <b>and</b> how each one can be overcome on the stages of enlightenment, turning consciousness (vijnana) into unmediated cognition (jnana) by cleansing the stream of <b>consciousness</b> from ‘contaminations' <b>and</b> ‘defilements.’ The Treatise on Buddha Nature was extremely influential in East Asian Buddhism by propounding the concept of tathagatagarbha (Buddha Nature).|$|R
5|$|In culture, the {{philosophy}} of mind has for centuries attempted {{to address the question}} of the nature of <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> the mind-body problem. The pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of the cortex in the 19th century. In science fiction, brain transplants are imagined in tales such as the 1942 Donovan's Brain.|$|E
5|$|Scarpia {{orders the}} torture of Cavaradossi to cease and the wounded painter is brought back in. He recovers <b>consciousness</b> <b>and,</b> {{learning}} of Tosca's betrayal, is furious with her. Sciarrone, a police agent, enters with news of Napoleon's victory at Marengo; Cavaradossi gloats, telling Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end, before being dragged away by Scarpia's men.|$|E
5|$|Some {{speculative}} {{theories have}} proposed that our Universe {{is but one of}} a set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.

50|$|The twofold {{proficiency}} has {{the characteristic}} of healthiness {{of the mental}} body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness,</b> respectively. Its function is to crush unhealthiness of the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness.</b> It is manifested as absence of disability. Its proximate cause is the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness.</b> It {{should be regarded as}} opposed to lack of faith, etc., which cause unhealthiness of the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|R

50|$|The twofold wieldiness has the {{characteristic}} of the subsiding of unwieldiness (akammaññabhāva) in the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness,</b> respectively. Its function is to crush unwieldiness. It is manifested as success of the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness</b> in making something an object. Its proximate cause is the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness.</b> It {{should be regarded as}} opposed to the remaining hindrances, which create unwieldiness of the mental body <b>and</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|R
5|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} {{may also}} occur {{in people who}} have had a head injury. Symptoms may include headache, decreased level of <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body). SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury, and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 horror fiction novel Parasite Eve by Hideaki Sena depicts {{mitochondria}} {{as having}} some <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> mind control abilities, attempting {{to use these}} to overtake eukaryotes as the dominant life form. This text was adapted into an eponymous film, video game, and video game sequel all involving a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|The {{comatose}} {{king was}} returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. After Charles regained <b>consciousness,</b> <b>and</b> his fever subsided, he {{was returned to}} Paris by Harsigny, moving slowly from castle to castle, with periods of rest in between. Late in September Charles was well {{enough to make a}} pilgrimage of thanks to Notre Dame de Liesse near Laon after which he returned again to Paris.|$|E
50|$|The Mandukya Upanishad {{describes}} {{four states}} of consciousness, namely waking <b>consciousness,</b> dream, <b>and</b> deep sleep, and turiya, the base-consciousness. Waking <b>consciousness,</b> dream, <b>and</b> deep sleep are equated {{with the three}} bodies, while turiya is a fourth state, which is equated with atman and purusha.|$|R
5000|$|The September 2001 {{attacks on}} the Twin Towers in New York left a deep impression, {{prompting}} a critical inquiry into the relationship between <b>consciousness,</b> ethics <b>and</b> injustice. This inquiry ultimately led to {{the publication of a}} book, [...] "Entheogens, Society & Law: Towards a Politics of <b>Consciousness,</b> Autonomy <b>and</b> Responsibility".|$|R
5000|$|The store-house {{consciousness}} receives impressions {{from all}} {{functions of the}} other <b>consciousnesses,</b> <b>and</b> retains them as potential energy, bija or [...] "seeds", for their further manifestations and activities. Since it serves as the container for all experiential impressions it is also called the [...] "seed consciousness" [...] (種子識) or container consciousness.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} type (60%) of {{seizures}} are convulsive. Of these, one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain. Two-thirds begin as focal seizures (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may then progress to generalized seizures. The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absence seizure, which presents as a decreased level of <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> usually lasts about 10 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Themes {{of class}} <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> {{conflict}} are {{also present in}} the book. Critics interpreted the stance the novel took against French class-based discrimination and hypocrisy as quite radical, although some French critics found that this made the novel an unsubtle satire of fading social stereotypes. There are also literary allusions in the novel, referencing comic books, movies, music, and paintings.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of <b>consciousness,</b> <b>and</b> indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E

5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or <b>consciousness,</b> <b>and</b> of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains <b>consciousness</b> <b>and,</b> too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is {{recognised}} as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the Horn of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to the Horn of the Yak.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of <b>consciousness,</b> <b>and</b> abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
