40|$|Objective To explore {{experiences}} of <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillo</b> smokers under Australian laws requiring plain packaging (PP) and strengthened graphic health warnings (GHWs). Methods In February/March 2014, we conducted: in-depth interviews with 10 regular premium cigar smokers; two focus groups with occasional premium <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> premium <b>cigarillo</b> smokers (n= 14); four focus groups with non-premium cigarillo smokers (n= 28); {{and a national}} online survey of cigar and/or cigarillo smokers (n= 268). Results Premium cigar smokers had limited exposure to PP, with many purchasing fully branded cigars in boxes duty free or online and singles in non-compliant packaging. Those who were exposed noticed and were concerned by the warnings, tried to avoid them and felt more like 'dirty smokers'. Changes in perceived taste, harm and value were minimal for experienced premium cigar smokers. Occasional premium <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> premium <b>cigarillo</b> smokers with higher PP exposure (gained by purchasing boxes rather than singles) perceived cigar/ package appeal and value had declined and noticed the GHWs. Non-premium cigarillo smokers reported high PP exposure, reduced perceived appeal, quality, taste, enjoyment and value, somewhat increased perceived harm, greater noticeability of GHWs and concealment of packs and more contemplation of quitting. Online survey participants reported increased noticeability of GHWs (33 %), decreased appeal of packaging (53 %) and reduced consumption of <b>cigars</b> (42 %) <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> (44 %) since PP implementation. Conclusions Non-premium cigarillo smokers {{appear to have been}} most exposed and influenced by PP, with cigar smokers less so, especially regular premium cigar smokers who have maintained access to fully branded products.

50|$|A {{cigarillo}} is a machine-made cigar that is {{shorter and}} narrower than a traditional cigar but larger than little <b>cigars,</b> filtered <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> cigarettes, thus similar {{in size and}} composition to small panatela sized <b>cigars,</b> cheroots, <b>and</b> traditional blunts. <b>Cigarillos</b> are usually not filtered, although some have plastic or wood tips, and {{are not meant to}} be inhaled. They are sold in varying quantities: singles, two-packs, three-packs, <b>and</b> five-packs. <b>Cigarillos</b> are very inexpensive: in the United States, usually sold for less than a dollar. Sometimes they are informally called small cigars, mini cigars, or club cigars. Some famous cigar brands, such as Cohiba or Davidoff, also make cigarillos---Cohiba Mini <b>and</b> Davidoff Club <b>Cigarillos,</b> for example. <b>And</b> there are purely cigarillo brands, such as Café Crème, Dannemann Moods, Mehari's, Al Capone, <b>and</b> Swisher Sweets. <b>Cigarillos</b> have a secondary use: they are often used for the making of marijuana cigars.|$|R
5000|$|Little cigars (sometimes called small cigars or miniatures in the UK) differ {{greatly from}} regular cigars. They weigh less than <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos,</b> but, more importantly, they {{resemble}} cigarettes in size, shape, packaging, and filters. Sales of little cigars quadrupled in the U.S. from 1971 to 1973 {{in response to}} the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned the broadcast of cigarette advertisements and required stronger health warnings on cigarette packs. Cigars were exempt from the ban, and perhaps more importantly, were taxed at a far lower rate. Little cigars are sometimes called [...] "cigarettes in disguise", and unsuccessful {{attempts have been made to}} reclassify them as cigarettes. In the United States, sales of little cigars reached an all-time high in 2006, fueled in great part by favorable taxation.In some states, however, little cigars have successfully been taxed at the rate of cigarettes, such as Illinois, as well as multiple other states. This has caused yet another loophole, in which manufacturers classify their products as [...] "filtered cigars" [...] instead to avoid the higher tax rate. Yet, many continue to argue that there is in fact a distinction between little cigars and filtered cigars. Little cigars offer a similar draw and overall feel to cigarettes, but with aged and fermented tobaccos, while filtered cigars are said to be more closely related to traditional cigars, and are not meant to be inhaled.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: The use {{of little}} <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> (LCCs) is rising {{but a few}} {{educational}} efforts focus on preventing their use (Sterling et al., 2016) (Richardson et al., 2013). Marketing and advertising of LCCs have been targeted toward individuals who are of a low socioeconomic status and African American (Cantrell et al., 2013). Individual users can upload videos on YouTube featuring little <b>cigars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos.</b> The flavoring of little <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> is a draw to adolescences and young adults to start smoking (Nyman et al. 2016). Characterizing flavors of LCCs YouTube videos needs to be examined because it may influence adolescents to smoke LCCs. Aim: To examine the frequency of characterizing flavors little cigar and cigarillo in YouTube videos. Methods: Data from YouTube were analyzed for this study. We used Google Insights which shows the most frequently searched terms, to examine what should be searched. “Cigarillo” and “Black and Mild” {{were found to be}} the most common as of January 22, 2017. Results: Of the 80 videos collected a total of 54 videos were analyzed. Half (50 %, n= 27) of the videos contained a mention of characterizing flavors. On average, videos that contained both characterizing flavors were viewed 249, 753 times. Discussion: Half of the videos contained a description of characterizing flavors. However, the videos with characterizing flavors were viewed 249, 753 times on average, which may entice youths to begin smoking tobacco products. Understanding LCC content on YouTube may have implications for developing health messages to reduce the likelihood that adolescents will begin smoking LCCs...|$|E
40|$|Little <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> {{are gaining}} in {{popularity}} as cigarette use wanes, mainly due to relaxed regulatory standards {{that make them}} cheaper, easier to buy individually, and available {{in a variety of}} flavors not allowed in cigarettes. To address whether they should be regulated as strictly as cigarettes, we investigated whether little cigar secondhand smoke (SHS) decreases vascular endothelial function like that of cigarettes. We exposed rats to SHS from little cigars, cigarettes, or chamber air, for 10 minutes and measured the resulting acute impairment of arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD). SHS from both little cigars and cigarettes impaired FMD. Impairment was greater after exposure to little cigar SHS than by cigarette SHS relative to pre-exposure values, although the post-exposure FMD values were not significantly different from each other. Exposure to little cigar SHS leads to impairment of FMD that is at least equal to that resulting from similar levels of cigarette SHS. Our findings support the need to prevent even brief exposure to little cigar SHS, and support tobacco control policies that regulate little cigars as strictly as cigarettes...|$|E

40|$|A cigar is {{a product}} made of tobacco leaves or parts of leaves rolled {{together}} {{and covered with a}} binder (a firm tobacco leaf which holds the filler together <b>and</b> gives the <b>cigar</b> its shape) <b>and</b> an outer wrapper made of natural or reconstituted tobacco. The term includes cheroots <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> (small or miniature cigars). Some small cigars are similar in size to a cigarette and may include a filter. Those with a filter usually have a wrapper of processed tobacco which looks similar to brown paper, while small cigars without a filter are generally wrapped in tobacco leaf. 1, 2 Prevalence In Great Britain there has been a steady decline in pipe <b>and</b> <b>cigar</b> smoking among men since the 1970 s.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a comparative analysis of ‘‘harm,’ ’ ‘‘harm reduction,’ ’ and ‘‘little cigar’ ’ information about cigars on 10 major English-language health Web sites. The sites were from governmental {{and nongovernmental organizations}} based in seven different countries and included ‘‘harm’ ’ and ‘‘harm reduction’ ’ information, discussions of little cigars, quantitative estimates of health risks, and qualifying behavioral characteristics (inhalation, number per day). Of the 10 Web sites, 7 offered statements explicitly indicating that cigars may be safer than cigarettes. None of the Web sites reviewed described that little cigars are likely as dangerous as cigarettes. Some Web sites provided quantitative estimates of health risks and extensive discussions of qualifying factors. Reading grade levels were higher than desirable. Extensive and complex information on the reduced risks of cigars compared with cigarettes is available on Web sites affiliated with prominent health organizations. Yet these sites fail to warn consumers that popular cigarette-like little <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> {{are likely to be}} just as dangerous as cigarettes, even for those who have never smoked cigarettes.

40|$|Objectives:Little <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> may {{resemble}} cigarettes, {{but may be}} {{less expensive}} and can be purchased singly and in flavored varieties. We used two major U. S. surveys to investigate use of cigarillos and cigarettes. Methods:The 2010 / 2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey ascertained cigar use by brand and type (little cigars/cigarillos or large/regular). The annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) assessed cigar use by brand, 2002 – 2011. We used the available data to classify cigars by type among males in the NSDUH. Results:Estimated prevalence of little cigar use among male cigar smokers was similar using the two surveys. From 2002 to 2011, past- 30 -day cigarette smoking declined for all age groups and genders, but among young adult men (aged 18 – 25) little cigar smoking remained steady at nearly 9 %. “Cigarette and/or cigar” smoking was 44 % among young adult men in 2011, and was consistently 6 percentage points higher than cigarette-only smoking, from 2002 to 2011. Over 60 % of male and 70 % of female adolescent/young adult cigar smokers also smoked cigarettes in 2011. Most male adolescents preferred little cigars to traditional cigars. Among males, most lower income or less educated cigar smokers preferred little cigars, compared to only 16 % of those with higher education. Conclusions:These patterns indicate that little cigar/cigarillo use may promote initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking, particularly among younger and less advantaged populations. Population-level data are urgently needed to better assess type of cigar smoked and reasons for use...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} exists that little <b>cigars</b> <b>and</b> <b>cigarillos</b> are popular among young adults {{and that the}} prevalence is higher among African American young adults. 1, 2, 4 Two brands of little cigars appear most appealing to young smokers - Swisher Sweets and Black and Mild. 2, 3 This cigar product have been designed by the tobacco industry to appeal specifically for African Americans. In a survey of tobacco use among freshman at a historically black university, there were high rates of little cigar use. 4 Little cigar sales have also benefited from the high visibility offered by many celebrities quoted and photographed with cigars, {{and the success of}} Cigar Aficionado and Smoke magazine. 5 Perceptions include that smoking little cigars is less addictive and less harmful than smoking cigarettes, and these perceptions may be enforced by students rationalizing that because they smoke fewer cigars than cigarettes, there is less exposure to toxic chemicals. Other perceptions uncovered include that little cigars are less harmful than cigarettes because little cigars are not addressed in antismoking messages. 4 A collaboration between Georgia State University Institute of Public Health, Southside Medical Center Accountable Communities Health Together, and the American Legacy Foundation has produced an effort to reduce little cigar and cigarillo use in the NPU-V. The program is known as the Little Cigar Prevention Initiative (LCPI). The primary objective of the collaboration is to engage the community into focus groups, forums, and action teams to: 1) Understand perceptions and use patterns of little cigars/cigarillos among African American young adults and youth 2) Educate the community about dangers of little cigars/cigarillos 3) Understand marketing mechanisms influencing use of little cigars/cigarillos 4) engage NPU-V neighborhoods for action to address marketing, use, and sale of little cigars/cigarillos towards young African Americans 5) Understand important implications for prevention and health promotion in this underserved community. The first objective of this capstone is to examine the effectiveness of several tobacco control policies in curbing smoking among young people. The second objective of this capstone is to provide information on how communities can increase awareness of key little cigar issues using current tobacco practices in communities. The third objective of this capstone is to provide information how to engage the community in the policy process by providing current successful policies and communities that have enacted policy. Lastly, the final objective is to identify ways to promote cessation efforts. This capstone will serve as a guide for community action in regards to little cigar/cigarillo prevention in the NPU-V. This capstone will produce two products. The first product will be a paper that will cover topics of youth tobacco use, little cigar and cigarillo use, the current state and nature of prevention activities, and recommendations. The second product will be a policy brief to inform the community on the urgency of little cigar/cigarillo prevention and the need to adopt a plan of action. 1. 	Maxwell JC..

50|$|In the United States, <b>cigarillos</b> (<b>and</b> <b>cigars)</b> were {{taxed at}} a lower rate than cigarettes. In February 2009 an {{increase}} from 5 cents to 40 cents per pack {{as part of the}} SCHIP expansion bill set a tax rate similar to that for cigarettes.|$|R
40|$|Background: Environmental {{tobacco smoke}} (ETS) -associated {{particulate}} matter (PM) constitutes a considerable health risk for passive smokers. It {{ought to be}} assessed separately from the other known toxic compounds of tobacco smoke. Brand-specific differences between cigarettes and particularly between cigarettes <b>and</b> favorably taxed <b>cigarillos,</b> are of public interest and therefore worth being investigated. Methods: An automatic environmental tobacco smoke emitter (AETSE) was developed to generate cigarette <b>and</b> <b>cigarillo</b> smoke in a reliable and reproducible way. John Player Special (JPS) Red cigarettes, JPS filter <b>cigarillos</b> <b>and</b> 3 R 4 F standard research cigarettes were smoked automatically in a 2. 88 m 3 glass chamber according to a standardized protocol until 5 cm from the top were burned down. Results: Mean concentrations (Cmean) and area of the curve (AUC) of PM 2. 5 were measured and compared.

40|$|Introduction: While {{cigarette}} use is declining, {{smoking tobacco}} with a waterpipe is an emerging trend. We aimed {{to determine the}} prevalence of waterpipe use in a large diverse sample of U. S. university students and to assess the association of waterpipe use with individual and institution-related characteristics. Methods: We assessed students from 152 U. S. universities participating in the National College Health Assessment during 2008 - 2009. We used multivariable regression models to determine independent associations between individual and institutional characteristics and waterpipe tobacco use in the past 30 days and ever. Results: Of 105, 012 respondents included in the analysis, most were female (65. 7 %), White (71. 2 %), and attending public (59. 7 %) nonreligious (83. 1 %) institutions. Mean age was 22. 1 years. A total of 32, 013 (30. 5 %) reported ever using a waterpipe to smoke tobacco. Rates for current tobacco use were 8. 4 % for waterpipes, 16. 8 % for cigarettes, 7. 4 % for <b>cigars</b> (including <b>cigarillos),</b> <b>and</b> 3. 5 % for smokeless tobacco. Of current waterpipe users, 51. 4 % were not current cigarette smokers. Although current waterpipe use was reported across all individual and institutional characteristics, fully adjusted multivariable models showed that it was most strongly associated with younger age, male gender, White race, fraternity/sorority membership, and nonreligious institutions in large cities in the western United States. Conclusions: After cigarettes, waterpipe use {{was the most common}} form of tobacco use among university students. Because waterpipe use affects groups with a wide variety of individual and institutional characteristics, it should be included with other forms of tobacco in efforts related to tobacco surveillance and intervention. © The Author 2012.
