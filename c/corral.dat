5|$|Calgary {{had been}} served for 30 {{years by the}} Stampede <b>Corral</b> when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total {{capacity}} of 8,700, the <b>Corral</b> was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The <b>Corral</b> was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope {{to be a team}} selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E
5|$|From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys {{moved to}} the O.K. <b>Corral</b> where {{witnesses}} overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. For unknown reasons the Cowboys then walked {{out the back of}} the O.K. <b>Corral</b> and then west, stopping in a narrow, empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} Bose-Einstein condensates in a corral-like potential. Compared to the electronic quantum <b>corrals,</b> the atomic quantum <b>corrals</b> {{have the advantage of}} allowing direct and convenient observation of the wave dynamics. Our numerical study shows that this advantage not only allows people to explore the rich dynamical structures in the density distribution but also makes the <b>corrals</b> useful in many other aspects. In particular, the <b>corrals</b> for atoms can be arranged into a stadium shape for the experimental visualization of quantum chaos, which has been elusive with the electronic quantum <b>corrals.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "stal-hille" [...] means <b>corrals</b> {{and cattle}} on a hill. After marine transgressions {{in the early}} Middle Ages the higher located parts of Stalhille were more {{suitable}} to build houses and <b>corrals.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End <b>Corral</b> at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. <b>Corral</b> on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town.|$|E
5|$|The Stampede <b>Corral</b> {{has served}} as a second home for the odd home game when the Saddledome is unavailable. They used the <b>Corral</b> for regular season home games in 1995–1996 and playoff games in 1998 and 2016.|$|E
5|$|Among the lawmen {{involved}} in the O.K. <b>Corral</b> shooting, only Virgil had any real experience in combat, and he had far more experience {{than any of his}} brothers as a sheriff, constable, and marshal.|$|E
60|$|Several log cabins, rough hewn {{and gray}} with age, stood down inside the inclosure; and beyond there were large <b>corrals.</b> From {{the other side}} of these <b>corrals</b> came sounds of rough voices of men, a {{trampling}} of hoofs, heavy splashes, the beat of an engine, and the incessant baaing of the sheep.|$|R

5|$|A 2005 {{report issued}} {{jointly by the}} Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of bubonic plague in humans {{resulting}} from the ingestion of raw camel liver. Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. Yersinia pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's <b>corral.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Flames {{moved into}} their new home, the Olympic Saddledome (now {{known as the}} Scotiabank Saddledome). Located {{on the grounds of}} the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede, the Saddledome was built as a venue for the 1988 Winter Olympics. In three seasons in the <b>Corral,</b> the Flames lost only 32 home games. The Saddledome hosted the 37th NHL All-Star Game in 1985, a 6–4 victory by the Wales Conference.|$|E
40|$|Alaska. Reindeer {{were either}} rounded up by {{helicopter}} and then <b>corralled</b> or captured by net-gun {{fired from a}} helicop-ter. Outcome of both capture events showed that helicopter <b>corralling</b> of reindeer was more successful than catching them with a net-gun and that post-rut rounding up was more successful than rounding up during the rut itself...|$|R
40|$|Goat {{production}} {{is an important}} economic activity for rural communities in the Gran Chaco of Argentina. Goat <b>corrals</b> are important {{for the survival of}} peridomestic populations of Triatoma infestans. This study evaluated the impact of modifying the traditional structure of goat <b>corrals</b> on T. infestans populations and goat productivity in the region of Los Llanos (La Rioja). Thirty-nine experimental <b>corrals</b> were constructed and 57 traditional <b>corrals</b> were used as controls. We evaluated the infestations of the control and experimental <b>corrals</b> for five years following construction of the structures. The results showed that the new structures did not prevent the colonization, although it enhanced the detection of infestation at low densities of T. infestans. No significant difference was found in T. infestans population abundance between control and experimental <b>corrals,</b> probably because of the different detectability in the two types of structures, especially among the small nymphs. Although goat productivity average was higher in experimental than in control <b>corrals,</b> no significant difference was found because of high variability. The new structures {{can be used as a}} complement to promote the development of rural communities. Acceptability and adoption of the new <b>corrals</b> by the owners was high, as the enclosures offered better protection for the goats, increased growth of kids and facilitated herd handling.

5|$|In the 1870s and 1880s {{there was}} {{considerable}} tension in the region—between the rural residents, who were {{for the most part}} Democrats from the agricultural South, and town residents and business owners, who were largely Republicans from the industrial Northeast and Midwest. The tension culminated in what has been called the Cochise County feud, and the Earp-Clanton feud, which ended with the historic Gunfight at the O.K. <b>Corral</b> and Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Ride.|$|E
5|$|John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, who he {{regarded}} like a son, drew {{a sketch of}} the gunfight at the O.K. <b>Corral</b> in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision. The drawing placed participants and selected witnesses on Fremont Street in Tombstone, and Earp annotated it with lines indicating how the participants moved during the 30-second shootout. It was sold at auction by Alexander Autographs in early October 2010, for $380,000.|$|E
5|$|Scotiabank Saddledome is a multi-use indoor {{arena in}} Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

5|$|Stampede Park {{is located}} {{southeast}} of downtown Calgary in the Beltline District and is serviced by Calgary Transit's light rail system. Permanent structures {{at the site}} include the Saddledome and <b>Corral,</b> Big Four Building, BMO Centre– a convention and exhibition facility– a casino, the Stampede Grandstand, the agriculture building, {{and a number of}} facilities that support the exhibition and livestock shows.|$|E
5|$|The {{defenders}} in {{the cattle}} pen retreated into the horse <b>corral.</b> After discharging their weapons, the {{small band of}} Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind the church and raced on foot for the east prairie, which appeared empty. As the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed.|$|E
5|$|The popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. <b>Corral,</b> {{released}} in 1957, starring Burt Lancaster as Earp, cemented {{his place in}} Western history as a hero lawman. The movie also altered the public's perception of cowboys, who in Earp's time and locale were outlaws, but in the movies were reinvented as good guys, assisting the lawmen in their fight against the outlaws.|$|E

60|$|Next morning, rather late, Wade rode down to White Slides Ranch. It {{looked to}} him like the {{property}} of a rich rancher who held to the old and proven customs of his generation. The <b>corrals</b> were new, but their style was old. Wade reflected {{that it would be}} hard for rustlers or horse-thieves to steal out of those <b>corrals.</b> A long lane led from the pasture-land, following the brook that ran through the <b>corrals</b> and by the back door of the rambling, comfortable-looking cabin. A cowboy was leading horses across a wide square between the main ranch-house and a cluster of cabins and sheds. He saw the visitor and waited.|$|R
