40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{different}} HIV antigens {{have been}} successfully expressed in plants by either stable transformation or transient expression systems. Among HIV proteins, Nef is considered a promising target for the formulation of a multi-component vaccine due to its implication in the first steps of viral infection. Attempts to express Nef as a single protein product (not fused to a stabilizing protein) in transgenic plants resulted in disappointingly low yields (about 0. 5 % of total soluble protein). In this work we describe a transient expression system based on co-agroinfiltration of plant virus gene silencing suppressor proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana, followed by a two-step affinity purification protocol of plant-derived Nef. Results The effect of three gene silencing viral suppressor proteins (P 25 of Potato Virus X, P 19 of either Artichoke Mottled <b>Crinckle</b> virus and Tomato Bushy Stunt virus) on Nef transient expression yield was evaluated. The P 19 protein of Artichoke Mottled <b>Crinckle</b> virus (AMCV-P 19) gave the highest expression yield in vacuum co-agroinfiltration experiments reaching 1. 3 % of total soluble protein, a level almost three times higher than that previously reported in stable transgenic plants. The high yield observed in the co-agroinfiltrated plants was correlated to a remarkable decrease of Nef-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) indicating an effective modulation of RNA silencing mechanisms by AMCV-P 19. Interestingly, we also showed that expression levels in top leaves of vacuum co-agroinfiltrated plants were noticeably reduced compared to bottom leaves. Moreover, purification of Nef from agroinfiltrated tissue was achieved by a two-step immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography protocol with yields of 250 ng/g of fresh tissue. Conclusion We demonstrated that expression level of HIV- 1 Nef in plant can be improved using a transient expression system enhanced by the AMCV-P 19 gene silencing suppressor protein. Moreover, plant-derived Nef was purified, with enhanced yield, exploiting a two-step purification protocol. These results represent a first step towards {{the development of a}} plant-derived HIV vaccine. </p...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} described an efficient transient expression system mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{for the production}} of HIV- 1 Nef protein in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. In order to enhance the yield of recombinant protein we assayed the effect of three gene-silencing viral suppressor proteins (P 25 of Potato Virus X, P 19 of Artichoke Mottled <b>Crinckle</b> virus and Tomato Bushy Stunt virus) on Nef expression levels. Results demonstrated that AMCV-P 19 gave the highest Nef yield (1. 3 % of total soluble protein) and that this effect was correlated to a remarkable decrease of Nef-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) indicating an effective modulation of RNA silencing mechanisms. Here we report additional data on the production of different heterologous proteins including human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains and a virus coat protein that demonstrate the robustness of this co-agroinfiltration expression system boosted by the AMCV-P 19 gene-silencing suppressor...|$|E
40|$|The {{object was}} {{to study the}} {{relation}} between virus and the transmitting insect, especially the aphids Myzus persicae Sulz., Myzus pseudosolani Theob., Macrosiphum solanifold Ashm., Aphis rhamni Fonsc. and Aphis fabae Scop. The diseases studied were leafroll, common mosaic (virus A), <b>crinckle</b> (virus Y), stipple streak (virus Yc), interveinal mosaic (virus X), aucuba mosaic (virus F) and spindling sprout. The aphids transmitted these viruses, except aucuba mosaic virus. M. persicae was the best transmitter. The development stage of the aphid was of no influence. A specific relation between M. persicae and leafroll virus was found. Only after incubation of the virus in the insect for 2448 h was the aphid able to transmit leafroll virus. After living 10 days on a resistant plant the aphid {{was still able to}} infect the potato plant but the virus could not be transmitted from mother insect to offspring. When the virus-bearing aphid cast its skin the leafroll virus was not lost. The virus was transmitted downwards to the tubers in about 4 weeks. The susceptibility of young plants was very high, in contrast to older plants (old- age resistance) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{plants and}} invertebrates, viral-derived siRNAs {{processed}} by the RNaseIII Dicer guide Argonaute (AGO) proteins {{as part of}} antiviral RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC). As a counterdefense, viruses produce suppressor proteins (VSRs) that inhibit the host silencing machinery, but their mechanisms of action and cellular targets remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the Turnip <b>crinckle</b> virus (TCV) capsid, the P 38 protein, acts as a homodimer, or multiples thereof, to mimic host-encoded glycine/tryptophane (GW) -containing proteins normally required for RISC assembly/function in diverse organisms. The P 38 GW residues bind directly and specifically to Arabidopsis AGO 1, which, {{in addition to its}} role in endogenous microRNA-mediated silencing, is identified as a major effector of TCV-derived siRNAs. Point mutations in the P 38 GW residues are sufficient to abolish TCV virulence, which is restored in Arabidopsis ago 1 hypomorphic mutants, uncovering both physical and genetic interactions between the two proteins. We further show how AGO 1 quenching by P 38 profoundly impacts the cellular availability of the four Arabidopsis Dicers, uncovering an AGO 1 -dependent, homeostatic network that functionally connects these factors together. The likely widespread occurrence and expected consequences of GW protein mimicry on host silencing pathways are discussed in the context of innate and adaptive immunity in plants and metazoans...|$|E
40|$|English: In this project, {{the effect}} of expressing p 38, a viral {{suppressor}} of RNA silencing encoded by Turnip <b>Crinckle</b> Virus (TCV), in Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas was investigated. Transgenic Arabidopsis At RCHSp 38 plants, which co-express an IR-transgene designed to induce RNA silencing of the endogenous chalcone synthase (CHS) gene and the RNA silencing suppressor protein p 38, are known to accumulate high levels of anthocyanins. Our hypothesis was that the increased levels of anthocyanin in At RCHSp 38 plants was a consequence of p 38 expression leading to increased levels of the transcription factor MYB 75 /PAP 1, {{as a result of}} p 38 -induced impaired RNA silencing control of MYB 75 /PAP 1. To investigate our hypothesis, transcript levels of the flavonoid biosynthesis genes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL 1), CHS, dihydroflavonolreductase (DFR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and MYB 75 /PAP 1, were determined using quantitative real-time PCR in selected At RCHSp 38 lines and compared to the same transcript levels in wild-type and At PAP 1 plants, which over-expresses MYB 75 /PAP 1. The effect of stress exposure with high sucrose concentration and high intensity light treatment on At RCHSp 38 plants compared to wild-type and At PAP 1 plants was also studied, to investigate if stress could elucidate differences in the transcript levels of the investigated genes among the different plant lines. Finally, phenotypic investigations of leaves and flowers in At RCHSp 38 plants were undertaken. The results show that the transcript levels of MYB 75 /PAP 1, PAL 1, CHS, DFR, and GST are up-regulated both in transgenic At RCHSp 38 seedlings and adult plants compared to wild-type plants grown under the same experimental conditions, and in At RCHSp 38 seedlings and plants exposed to stress. At RCHSp 38 seedlings and adult plants also showed an altered phenotype with a more intense purple colouration compared to wild-type plants. The elevated level of MYB 75 /PAP 1 in At RCHSp 38 plants indicate that this transcription factor is under RNA silencing control, which becomes impaired under p 38 -expression. A tasiRNA targeting MYB 75 /PAP 1 has been identified in previous studies and further analyses to confirm tasiRNA regulation of MYB 75 /PAP 1 and whether p 38 -expression interferes with tasiRNA biogenesis should be performed. Low level of transgene expression is a problem in Chlamydomonas. If low transgene expression is the result of transgene silencing, a possible solution is to use suppressors of RNA silencing in vector constructs to insulate your favourite transgene from silencing. We wanted to investigate if expression of the p 38 protein in Chlamydomonas could suppress RNA silencing, more specifically if p 38 could suppress RNA silencing of the endogenous phytoene synthase (PSY) gene induced by artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs). After successful induction of RNA silencing in transformed cells, we wanted to introduce p 38 to investigate if {{the effect of}} RNA silencing of PSY was reduced or abolished. However, {{we were not able to}} successfully transform Chlamydomonas cells with the amiRNAs designed to silence PSY. Further studies to successfully transform Chlamydomonas cells, both with amiRNAs designed to silence PSY and with the p 38 -expression construct, are needed to answer the question whether p 38 expression is able to reduce or abolish RNA silencing induced by amiRNAs...|$|E
