40|$|A {{major concern}} {{in the design of}} an {{incomplete}} climate agreement is thatfirms that use fossil fuels intensively may respond to emission regulationsby relocating their plants from <b>cooperating</b> to non-cooperating <b>countries.</b> This paper analyses how the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> might deal with the issueof firm delocation through emission taxes, trade provisions and alocalisation subsidy to mobile firms. It is shown that firms should not beinduced to stay in the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> by lowering emission taxesbelow the Pigouvian tax rate. Incentives to stay should be given partlythrough trade provisions and partly through a localisation subsidy. A secondbest solution without localisation subsidies is also discussed. In thatcase, the efficient emission tax is lower than the Pigouvian tax rate. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the first best and thesecond best policy regimes for the pattern of firm localisation.

40|$|If some, but not all, <b>countries</b> are <b>cooperating</b> {{to reduce}} CO 2 emissions, {{it can be}} argued that: A high carbon tax on carbon-intensive {{tradable}} sectors in the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> will reduce the production of goods from these sectors, and therefore CO 2 emissions, in those countries. This will to a large extent be counteracted by increased production of such goods in the countries which have no such policy, however. Since it is total CO 2 emissions from all countries which is relevant for the climate, there is little advantage in a policy which simply shifts CO 2 emissions from the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> to other countries. Carbon-intensive tradable sectors should thus face a lower carbon tax than other sectors of the economy. The paper shows that a carbon tax should not be differentiated across sectors in the economy, provided import and export tariffs can be used on all traded goods. It is also shown that such a differentiation of carbon taxes is optimal for the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> if they are prevented from using tariffs on the traded goods. Informational or political factors constraining the use of tariffs are also likely to constrain the possibility of differentiating carbon taxes between sectors, however.

40|$|Several serious {{environmental}} problems have a global character. International cooperation {{to reduce emissions}} {{for this type of}} problems often takes the form of an agreement among the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> to cut back emissions by a uniform percent rate compared with some base year. This type of agreements has two disadvantages. In the first place, it is well known from environmental economics that equal percentage reductions of emissions from different sources usually gives an inefficient outcome, {{in the sense that the}} same environmental goals could be achieved at lower costs through a different distribution of emission reductions. A second problem with agreements of equal percentage reductions is that not all countries will find it in their interest to participate in such agreements. In the paper, it is assumed that the set of countries which participate in an agreement is endogenously determined, with a country participating in an agreement provided that this makes the country better off than it would have been in a situation without any agreement. The agreement among the participating countries is assumed to be a uniform percentage reduction of their emissions. The countries have different opinions about what this uniform percentage should be. In the paper, it is assumed that the outcome is determined by the median country of the participating countries. The assumptions above lead to a particular equilibrium, in which some but not all <b>countries</b> <b>cooperate.</b> The equilibrium reduction of emissions for the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> is also derived. This equilibrium compared with the first best optimum within the context of simple numerical example.

40|$|In 2005 - 2006 the Norwegian Mission Society (NMS) in {{cooperation}} with the Center for Intercultural Communication (SIK) carried out a project called Religious Change and Development Seen in a Gender Perspetive. The project group consisted of people from both NMS and SIK. The project was financed by NMS and the basis for the project was a desire to stimulate internal reflection in the organisation concerning current and central topics in the intersection between gender, religion and development. This reflection takes as its point of departure the ideational encounter between the NMS vision and set of values, and the contemporary ideological and political mainstreams in Norway and the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries.</b> The other aspect of this project is more in the line of practice and methodology in development and concerns the expertise and professionel knowledge needed in handling everyday challenges related to gender in Norway and the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries.</b> NMS wishes to systemize and evaluate experiences in this field and to identify and further develop good practices and in this way contribute to the building of the organisation’s competence and knowhow within the areas of religion, development and gender. The project Religious Change and Development Seen in a Gender Perspetive is an expression of NMS’ desire {{to take a closer look}} at the traces it has left and still leaves in the societies where it operates, as concerns gender relations, participation by women and men and their roles and positions in the church and the local society. It is acknowledged in NMS, as in other mission organisations and national and international relief organisations in general, that some of these changes will be unintended and unexpected. They may also be evaluated as both positive and negative or to have had no particular importance for the target group. The same applies to groups other than the target groups and for governments in the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries,</b> whose conditions of existance have changed through the activity of various development agencies. Another variable that must be taken into consideration is the relation between short term and long term effects of development co-operation programs. The short term effects may be experienced as postive, while the long term consequences may be unfortunate in relationship to equality of gender and/or development. The project group has tried to concider all levels of understanding, from micro to makro levels, and drawn on a wide range of encounters and relations between institutions in the North and the South in its emperical evalutaion. In this report, however, the project group have tried to concentrate on two main areas which are considered of special benefit for NMS in their future work with these issues– both within the organisation and in relation to the cooperation churches. These are the issues of a systematisation and analysis of the experiences of gender relations and gendered practice during generations of co-operation, the other is the issue of development of a gender mainstreaming methodology for the Norwegian Missionary Society...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} air route profitability in the European Union and the <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> of Norway and Switzerland. Building {{on the assumption that}} only profitable routes are served, I develop a set of probit models that specify route service as a function of route characteristics, airline networks' attributes, airline partnerships and competition. Estimation results show that route profitability increases with population size and decreases with flight distance and the time efficiency of car travel relative to air travel. An airline's airport presence, that is, its share of airport operations, exerts a significant, positive effect on its route profitability, and so does airport presence of its group or allied partners. Competitive effects are asymmetric across airline business types. This paper's contribution to existing airline-route profitability studies lies in accounting for airline cooperation, controlling for an alternative mode of transport, and using EU data for estimation...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether global cooperation for emission abatement {{can be improved}} if asymmetric countries can sign different parallel environmental agreements. The analysis assumes a two-stage game theoretical model. Conditions for self-enforcing sets of agreements and the resulting total emission abatement are determined. We allow for multiple coalitions with multiple types of asymmetric countries. We then analyze the effect of multiple coalitions for the case of increasing marginal costs of abatement {{as well as for}} decreasing marginal benefits of abatement more generally. The results are sensitive to the assumptions on the benefits from abatement. For constant marginal benefits, the possibility of multiple agreements increases the number of <b>cooperating</b> <b>countries</b> and total abatement (compared to the standard case with a single agreement). For decreasing marginal benefits, total emissions are independent of the number of admitted agreements.

Furthermore, Islamic banks generally tend to provide higher consumer confidence levels as they were more capitalized than conventional banks, although conventional banks had carried higher averages of liquidity compared to Islamic banks. Consumer confidence levels or depositors’ discipline as proxied by deposits and customer funding over liabilities generally appear to be higher in Islamic banks than conventional banks. ...|$|R
