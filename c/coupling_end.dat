40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 76 This paper {{describes}} the design modifications and active balancing on a 19, 000 hp integrally forged steam turbine rotor {{to improve its}} dynamic characteristics and reliability. The turbine was purchased {{as a replacement for}} an identical turbine used in a syn gas train. Ever since original installation, the turbine had been plagued with high vibration problems on the <b>coupling</b> <b>end,</b> excessive bearing temperatures, and reduced coupling life. A rotordynamic analysis proved that there was sufficient separation margin between the turbine's operating speed and any critical speed. However, at operating speed, the rotor had a high vibration response at the coupling, even with a very small unbalance. A design modification was thus incorporated on the rotor to make it less sensitive to unbalance. At operating speed, this modification lowered the predicted <b>coupling</b> <b>end</b> shaft deflection to approximately a third of its original value. An active balancer was then assembled on the rotor to provide the flexibility of online trim balancing. The replacement turbine has been installed and is operating with the lowest vibration and bearing temperatures in the compressor train's history. Presented in this paper is an overview of the rotordynamic analysis, the shaft welding technique used to accomplish the rotor design changes, and the balancing with the active balancer. The techniques presented in this paper can be used to improve the mechanical reliability of other machines with similar problems...|$|E

A series of differently structured images (10, 11, 12) is coupled into the fibre bundle (2). The structures are selected to form zones of different grey values. The grey values emanating from the output coupling ends of the fibres are recorded and {{used to determine the}} coordinates of the input end fibres, using the coordinates of the grey value zones. The input coupling coordinates and output coupling coordinates are stored in an association table.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of the main chemical and physico-chemical properties of a graft copolymer of amylose and poly(n-butyl methacrylate), Am-g-PBMA, amphiphilic and able to self-assemble in water, prepared by <b>coupling</b> <b>end</b> azide-functionalized PBMA and alkyne-functionalized amylose under convenient click conditions. A deep knowledge of these properties is necessary in the perspective of real applications of the copolymer. To this aim we combined a basic characterization through FT-IR, TGA, ICP-OES and SEM with an extensive EPR and Solid State NMR investigation. It was possible to characterize the main structural and dynamic properties of Am-g-PBMA and highlight the presence of residual copper (Cu(II)) from the catalyst, even after an extensive purification procedure. We could identify two main species of Cu(II) : Cu(II) complexes coordinated to the N,N,N',N",N"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) ligand from the catalyst and to the copolymer triazole nitrogens and multi-nuclear or clustered Cu(II) species likely coordinated to amylose hydroxyl groups...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} an interferometric fiber-optic bending/micro-displacement sensor {{based on}} a plastic dual-core fiber with one end coated with a silver mirror. The two fiber cores are first excited with the same laser beam, the light in each core is then back-reflected at the mirror-coated fiber-end, and, finally, {{the light from the}} two cores is made to interfere at the <b>coupling</b> <b>end.</b> Bending of the fiber leads to shifting interference fringes that can be interrogated with a slit and a single photodetector. We find experimentally that the resolution of our bending sensor is ~ 3 x 10 - 4 m- 1 for sensing of bending curvature, as well as ~ 70 nm for sensing of displacement of the fiber tip. We demonstrate operation of our sensor using two examples. One is weighting of the individual micro-crystals of salt, while the other one is monitoring dynamics of isopropanol evaporation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{comparison}} between two methods of <b>coupling,</b> <b>end</b> coupling and edge coupling, between microstrip line and cylindrical dielectric resonator (CDR) in a microwave integrated-circuit (MIC) environment is presented. The dielectric resonator is coupled to both open-circuited and short-circuited microstrip lines. The analysis is performed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. It was shown that the end coupling configuration excites the hybrid electromagnetic modes (HEMmnp) {{with respect to the}} axis of rotation of the resonator. The edge coupling configuration also excites these modes at almost the same resonant frequencies in addition to the axis symmetric mode TE 01 δ. The comparison between end coupling and edge coupling configurations shows that the edge coupling has better values for insertion loss when the ends of the microstrip lines are open-circuited, whereas the end coupling offers better mode separation and sharper resonance curves when the ends of the microstrip lines are short-circuited...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} Holstein model on a square lattice across the polaronic {{crossover}} {{by using an}} adiabatic approximation to compute the lattice distorted backgrounds and a Gaussian expansion in dynamical modes to compute phonon spectral properties. We capture phonon dynamics from the perturbatively renormalised weak <b>coupling</b> <b>end</b> to the `polaron insulator', addressing in particular the thermal evolution of spectral features in the crossover regime. In the weak coupling metal our results indicate validity of perturbation theory over a coupling dependent temperature window, with well-defined dispersive phonons. Deep in the polaronic insulator the phonon bandwidth is narrow and the detailed dispersion and damping depend {{on the degree of}} charge correlations. In the crossover regime, proximity to the polaronic instability leads to large fluctuation of the static distortions with increasing temperature. In this coupling window the electron system is pseudogapped, and phonons have the maximum bandwidth and damping - with the dispersion showing signature of short range charge order. We provide a detailed quantitative estimate of phonon properties in the adiabatic regime, suggest an universal `phonon phase diagram', and relate our results to recent neutron scattering observations in several oxides.

40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 78 A case is {{presented}} where significant unacceptable vibration levels were encountered during mechanical testing {{of a single}} stage overhung radial compressor used in a mechanical vapor recompression process. The contract high performance disc coupling (modified for use between a test gearbox and the overhung compressor) {{was one of the}} main focuses of attention in arriving at a solution to the problem. Presented is the logic and courses of action taken to eliminate the coupling as the cause of the excessive vibration, and the analysis used to modify the coupling to make it the major part of the solution. This resolution involved significantly increasing the coupling's weight to change the critical speeds of the compressor rotor/bearing/coupling system, while at the same time improving the damping and stability in the <b>coupling</b> <b>end</b> bearing; enough to allow the train to run successfully. However, this extra weight coupling solution was not normal, and, except for time considerations, would not have been attempted. So, also discussed is how the actual problem (running at a critical speed without adequate damping) could have been discovered in the design stage or, once the problem occurred, been solved more easily if API procedures and guidelines had been referenced and used...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> is {{the main}} {{component}} of the aluminum hot rolling process. The <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> used for transmission of rotational power with heavy-duty load. Fracture of the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> causes serious economic injury because an <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> is a very expensive component and {{takes a long time to}} repair. To prevent the destruction of the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> it is essential for mechanical life cycle to be known. In this paper, a parameter study on <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> was performed in order to minimize maximum stress of an <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> under static loads. To verify the interference of spindle assembly with modified <b>end</b> <b>coupling,</b> kinematic simulation was performed by applying the various combination type and dynamic boundary condition of the spindle assembly. The interference of an optimized model did not occur during combination process and driving process. As a result of an optimum design for life extension on <b>end</b> <b>coupling,</b> the maximum stress of <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> was reduced about 26 % compared with original model...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 43 - 50 A {{turbine shaft}} {{end at the}} {{coupling}} is exposed not only to constant torque load but to various variable loads as well. These externally imposed variable loads come from sources like compressor surge, misalignment between turbine shaft, and the driven machine, to name a few. These loads can be bending or torsional in nature. To assure reliability, the design method should include the influence of such loads on the final sizing of the shaft end. The design method should also include the effects of shrink fits, keyways, fillets, chrome plating and fretting on the fatigue properties of the shaft material. Due to variable nature of loads superimposed on the steady torque load, the design method {{must be based on}} fatigue behavior of materials. Many fatigue theories have been used in the design of components of turbomachinery. These depend {{on the nature of the}} load, type of material and component being designed. A designer should realize not only the nature of loads imposed on the. shaft and their source but also have an estimate of the magnitude of those loads. A design method is described which includes many of the factors governing the useful life of the shaft at the <b>coupling</b> <b>end.</b> This method is based on the von Mises reliability criteria, including the influence of the driven machine and the choice of coupling type. This design method has resulted in many successful designs throughout the years and has helped in selecting a less costly but reliable option in many rerate situations...|$|E
