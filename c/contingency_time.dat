40|$|Time {{schedule}} {{is an essential}} tool for construction project management. For instance, it can materially help to identify the expected financial requirements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Buffers {{are often}} used in Construction to prevent the {{negative}} impact of Variability and Uncertainty on projects. Inventories of materials, budget <b>contingencies,</b> <b>time</b> float, and excess of equipment capacity are examples of the type of Buffers found in construction. However, usually the design and management of Buffers is based mostly on intuition and performed informally. New production philosophies such as Lean Production, Lean Construction and Theory of Constraints allow a more systematic and rigorous approach to the Design and Management of Buffers. This paper discusses the role of production management philosophies in the Design and Management of Buffers, and how selected IT tools can support this process. The paper also provides some guidelines for the design of Buffers in repetitive construction projects using a proposed conceptual model...|$|R

40|$|The New York City Department of Finance (DOF) {{partnered with}} the Center for Urban Research (CUR) at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY) to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of handheld devices enhanced with geographic information system (GIS) maps to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data collection for property valuation and tax assessment purposes. This report describes actual project implementation compared with initial objectives and expected outcomes, offers lessons learned and summarizes feedback from the DOF assessment team that field tested the devices and software application. Our general assessment about the feasibility of using hand-held devices for field assessment work is that the relevant technologies available are advancing rapidly, but the effort to deploy them is still highly complex. Any plan to implement these solutions should provide for considerable <b>contingency</b> <b>time</b> and the project be structured with great flexibility so as to accommodate uncertainties. Although this project did not establish the certainty of increased efficiency and improved data quality, the results strongly suggest that can be the case. We conclude from this study that the technologies are effective, and that the key elements to a successful implementation are strong management support and focused attention on the cultural shifts required of organizations undertaking the adoption of hand-held devices...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The estimated cost to construct the CMRR has greatly increased since NNSAs initial plans, and the projects schedule has been significantly delayed. According to its most recent estimates prepared in April 2010, NNSA determined that the CMRR will cost between $ 3. 7 billion and $ 5. 8 billionnearly a six-fold increase from the initial estimate. Construction has also been repeatedly delayed and, in February 2012 after GAO provided its draft report to NNSA for comment, NNSA decided to defer CMRR construction by at least an additional 5 years, bringing the total delay to between 8 and 12 years from NNSAs original plans. Infrastructure-related design changes and longer-than-expected overall project duration have contributed to these cost increases and delays. GAOs review of NNSAs April 2010 cost and schedule estimates for CMRR found that the estimates were generally well prepared, but important weaknesses remain. For example, a high-quality schedule requires a schedule risk analysis that incorporates known risks to predict the level of confidence in meeting a projects completion date {{and the amount of}} <b>contingency</b> <b>time</b> needed to cover unexpected delays. CMRR project officials identified hundreds of risks to the project, but GAO found that these risks were not used in preparing a schedule risk analysis. As a result of these weaknesses, NNSA cannot be fully confident, once it decides to resume the CMRR project, that the project will be completed on time and within estimated costs. ...|$|E

This however, is seemingly extremely unlikey for the 2007 entrant. For image processing, a human-in-the-loop is aimed at for a baseline. The next phase is to try to identify the human (processing on the ground) in both IR and EO spectrums. The viability of an IR solution in daylight is currently being tested. The final Phase, but this may not be ready for 2007, is to statistically fuse these two filtered images and have completely automated identification. There are three communication links in the SRUAV system. The command and control link will be implemented using a 900 MHz FHSS 9. 2 kbps radio modems (MicroHardCorp). Additionally, a 2. 4 GHz transmission of PAL video is the baseline for the secondary link. A tracking antenna will track this link with the UAVs position being fed in via RS- 232 from the Ground Station. The platform in which testing of the system was conducted was essentially a trainer-style model aeroplane called a Big Lift and dubbed “Emigo”. Modifications were made, doubling the engine size, to attain speeds considered necessary to complete this mission with some <b>contingency</b> <b>time</b> (around 180 km/hr). Once designed and tested these systems were implemented on a more efficient structure based around the Burt Rutan Long-EZ. This is a 2. 4 m wingspan aeromodel, a pusher prop canard wing.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of cruise JR 298 was to collect marine {{geological}} and geophysical samples and data to support International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) proposal 732 - Full 2, “Sediment drifts off the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica” (Channell, Larter, Hillenbrand et al.). The ship time was allocated for this purpose {{on the basis of}} a Site Survey Investigation grant from the NERC UK-IODP Programme (NE/J 006548 / 1 : Depositional patterns and records in sediment drifts off the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica) to R. D. Larter, C. -D. Hillenbrand (both BAS), D. A. Hodell (University of Cambridge) and A. G. C. Graham (University of Exeter). The data and samples collected will also be used in two Collaborative Gearing Scheme projects, an Antarctic Science Bursary project, a University of Cambridge PhD studentship, and within the National Capability remit of the BAS Science Teams in “Geology and Geophysics” and “Palaeoenvironments and Climate Change”. These projects are: • Tracing and reconstructing the neodymium and carbon isotopic composition of circum-Antarctic waters (CGS- 100, PI: A. M. Piotrowski, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge; cruise participants: A. M. Piotrowski and T. J. Williams). • Structural characterisation of Late Quaternary sediments from West Antarctic contourite drifts using three dimensional X-ray imaging (CT-scanning) (CGS- 98, PI: C. Ó Cofaigh, Department of Geography, Durham University; cruise participant: J. Horrocks) • Tracing the Quaternary evolution of the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctic Ice Sheets using lead isotopes in ice-rafted feldspar mineral grains (Antarctic Science Bursary awarded to C. Cook). • Seismic imaging of oceanographic structures and processes in the Southern Ocean south of the Polar Front (component of University of Cambridge/BP Institute PhD studentship; primary supervisor: N. J. White, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge; PhD student and cruise participant: K. L. Gunn). • Modelling crustal structure across the Bellingshausen Gravity Anomaly and oceanic fracture zones formed at the Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge through integration of marine potential field and seismic data (Collaboration between two BAS Science Teams; cruise participant: T. A. R. M. Jordan). 2 The cruise also provided support for physical oceanography projects by deploying six Argo floats and rescuing a malfunctioning sea glider. Towards the end of the cruise, RRS James Clark Ross was diverted to Rothera to uplift 16 personnel who had been flown across from Halley in two ALCI Basler aircraft because the sea ice situation in the Weddell Sea was considered to pose a significant risk to the scheduled last call of the season at Halley by RRS Ernest Shackleton. This uplift resulted in a two-day delay to arrival at Punta Arenas at the end of the cruise, which was in addition to a two-day extension already agreed as a result of departure from Punta Arenas having been delayed by slow refuelling.
