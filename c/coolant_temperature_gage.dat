40|$|Engine thermal {{management}} systems (TMS) are gaining importance in engine development and calibration to achieve low fuel consumption and meet future emissions standards. To benefit from their full potential, {{a thorough understanding}} of the effects on engine behavior is necessary. Steady state tests were performed on a 2. 0 L direct injection diesel engine at different load points. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to conduct exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and injection timing swings at different <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The effect of the standard engine controller and calibration was observed during these tests. The injection timing strategy included a significant dependency on <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> retarding injection by about 3 °crank angle between <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 70 °C and 86 °C. In contrast, EGR strategy was essentially independent of <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> though physical interactions were present {{due in part to the}} EGR cooler. Of the three mechanisms investigated, EGR had the largest effect on Nitrous oxides (NO) and fuel consumption and also had the largest potential for NO reduction over the stable engine operating range. Despite this, a reduction in <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> from 86 °C to 50 °C reduced NO by 4. 5 % at high load condition. However, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> adjustments offer similar or better trade-offs than the other calibration parameters. For example, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> offers 10 % improvement NO per percentage increase in fuel consumption, compared to 4 % for injection timing and 13 % for EGR. Higher <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> reduce ignition delay and premix burn during combustion, but this effect is more pronounced at lower engine loads. Analysis of mean effective pressures (MEP) showed friction MEP (FMEP) and pumping MEP (PMEP) reduce with higher operating temperatures, which yielded lower gross indicated MEP (IMEP). FMEP was slightly higher at higher load, with a 1. 5 % to 5. 4 % increase depending on operating temperature. This increase was expected to be due to the increased loading between parts within the engine, but would be offset by potentially higher local oil temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} Navier Stokes code {{has been}} used to study the effect of <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> and <b>coolant</b> to mainstream mass flow ratio on the adiabatic effectiveness of a film-cooled turbine blade. The blade chosen is the VKI rotor with six rows of cooling holes including three rows on the shower head. The mainstream is akin to that under real engine conditions with stagnation temperature = 1900 K and stagnation pressure = 3 MPa. Generally, the adiabatic effectiveness is lower for a higher <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> due to nonlinear effects via the compressibility of air. However, over the suction side of shower-head holes, the effectiveness is higher for a higher <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> than that for a lower <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> when the <b>coolant</b> to mainstream mass flow ratio is 5 % or more. For a fixed <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> the effectiveness passes through a minima on the suction side of shower-head holes as the coolant to mainstream mass flow, ratio increases, while on the pressure side of shower-head holes, the effectiveness decreases with increase in coolant mass flow due to coolant jet lift-off. In all cases, the adiabatic effectiveness is highly three-dimensional...|$|R
50|$|If {{the design}} of the {{liquid-cooling}} system allows for high <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures,</b> energy can be saved or even reused, depending on the climate conditions and on the local infrastructure. For example, free cooling is possible if the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is higher than the ambient temperature. In that case the energy for chillers can be saved. If the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is even higher, the waste heat from the compute equipment could be used for heating purposes or to drive an adsorption chiller to generate chilled water. The former option is implemented, e.g., by theLeibniz-Rechenzentrum in Germany, where SuperMUC drives the heating of the data center during winter with roughly 1 MW recovered from the compute equipment. The latter option, which is the design target of iDataCool, requires a high quality of the heat, which can only be achieved by direct hot-water cooling. One example for direct hot-water cooling is the Aquasar project at ETH Zürich, which is operated at <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> around 60°C.The aim of iDataCool was to achieve <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of more than 65°C, at which commercially available adsorption chillers tend to become efficient, and to demonstrate the long-term stability of a large production machine under these conditions.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} flow {{assurance}} challenges {{in the oil industry}} is wax deposition. It can result in the restriction of crude oil flow in the pipeline, creating pressure abnormalities and causing an artificial blockage leading to a reduction in the production. Wax can precipitate as a solid phase on the pipe wall when its temperature drops below the Wax Appearance Temperature. The objective of this study is using spiral flow to mitigate wax deposition. An experimental flow loop system was built in the lab to study the variation of wax deposition thickness under the single phase transport. A series of experiments were carried out at different flow rates (2. 7 and 4. 8 L/min) to study wax deposition and measure the wax thickness. The effect of factors on wax formation such as spiral flow, inlet <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> pressure drop, temperature drop, flow rates, time and shear stress have been examined. The spiral flow created inside the pipe by inserting a twisted metal along the pipe, which will create high shear stress affecting to wax deposition. The results show that the wax inhibition percentage WI % by using the spiral flow at flow rate 2. 7 L/min, inlet <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> 14 ºC, was 65 %. At flow rate 4. 8 L/min, inlet <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> 14 ºC the wax inhibition percentage was 73 %. Experimentally, it was found the spiral flow more efficient than the chemical inhibitors. The WI % increased, by merging the effect of the spiral flow and the inhibitor at flow rate 2. 7 L/min, to 75, 92. 2 and 100 % at inlet <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> 14, 24 and 33 ºC, respectively.

The energy balance is discussed on the bases of first-law analysis and second-law analysis. The range of speed investigated was 1000 - 2000 RPM for the torque range of 25 - 152 N. m. The coolant emperature was varied from 50 to 95 °C. The present study shows that the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the volumetric efficiency.

The study shows that the coolant emperature has a significant effect on NOx emissions and minor effects on the volumetric percentages of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.
