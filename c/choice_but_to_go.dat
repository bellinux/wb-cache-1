5|$|In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid {{out of both}} of his {{portfolios}} {{and made}} him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets {{and that the government}} create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago's commodity market. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had little <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.|$|E

To her commander's disappointment, the 20mm guns jammed after the first shot, and the 40mm mounting after firing just six rounds. The 100mm gun became useless after the first shot. Completely exposed, the warship had no other <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead {{in order to put}} about. At 11:59, the corvette was hit by small arms fire and 84 mm Carl Gustav anti-tank shells.|$|E

Now with both ships in action, Centurions fire {{soon began to}} tell and the Spanish galleys were not getting {{anywhere}} near enough to board. Eventually after nearly six hours of fighting, the last of the Spanish galleys had been repelled with some in a sinking state. Doria's galleys had all suffered much damage and losses in galley slaves, soldiers and sailors had been heavy. With this in mind, he had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into port and so withdrew immediately to Algeciras after temporarily shadowing the English ships.|$|E

After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion. The death of {{the heir to the}} throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the Catholic League. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle Cardinal Charles de Bourbon on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the treaty of Joinville with Spain, and prepared to make war on the [...] "heretics". By 1585, Henry III had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war against the League. As Catherine put it, [...] "peace is carried on a stick" [...] (b√¢ton porte paix).

500|$|The cyclone caused no {{deaths and}} over [...] in damages, as it {{affected}} Fiji, Tonga, Niue and the Southern Cook Islands. Ahead {{of the system}} affecting Fiji, hundreds of holiday makers were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. High winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the main Nadi International Airport. As Sina moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu {{that was used to}} take sugar cane to Labasa's mills, growers had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the village of Korowiri. However, the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village, after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji's Sunday Observance Decree. Within Tonga only minor damage to weak structures, trees, banana plantations, electric and telephone lines was recorded. Within both Niue and the Southern Cook Islands only minor damage to crops and structures was reported.|$|E

David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E

Gleefully pondering his revenge, he and Hooks snap pictures of them and leave, unseen. After practice, Mary brings up that {{they have yet to}} find a fourth player, and Izzy agrees to join the team permanently, on the condition that they change the name to Hot Chili Steppers. They happily agree, and decide to enter a Double Dutch showcase that will be happening three days later. When Izzy tries to leave for the event that day, however, his dad intercepts him, showing that he had bought tickets {{for the two of them}} to watch a boxing match. Izzy is left with little <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> agree <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> leaving his team to put on a disappointing performance, and leading Mary to expel him from the team, despite his apologies.|$|R

500|$|On December 7, the Australian Government via the {{international}} development bureau and Air Pacific provided emergency shelter materials, including tarpaulins, plastic sheeting and rope, after an appeal for international assistance {{was made by}} the Fijian government. After the cyclone damaged resorts were quickly repaired, while the Fijian government launched an international advertisement campaign for the islands with discounted airfares. Overall Sina caused over [...] (...) worth of damage to the Fijian islands, with most of the damage accounted for by losses to agriculture, sugar cane, and pine forests. After Cyclone Sina had washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu that was used to take sugar cane to Labasa's mills, growers had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the village of Korowiri. However, the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village, after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji's Sunday Observance Decree. As a result, sugar cane that had been damaged by Sina was left rotting in Fiji's fields until the Fiji Sugar Corporation ordered that a temporary bridge be built to bypass the village.|$|E

Eventually, a transmission is received from a trio of Starfleet admirals: Savar (Henry Darrow), Arron (Ray Reinhardt) and Quinn (Ward Costello), {{an old friend of}} Picard's who recently made an inspection of the Enterprise (in [...] ""). They are surprised by the Enterprises presence, but invite Captain Picard and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) to dinner. Quinn requests to beam aboard the Enterprise for a tour. Captain Picard recalls being warned by Quinn about some kind of threat to Starfleet when the admiral was last aboard. Upon Quinn's arrival, Picard discusses matters with him and Quinn seems strangely evasive; Picard comes to believe that he is an impostor, or under some sort of alien influence. After warning Riker of his concerns and asking him to watch Quinn, the captain beams down to Starfleet headquarters to attend the dinner. On arrival, Picard is greeted by the other two Admirals who are accompanied by Quinn's assistant, Lt. Commander Remmick (Robert Schenkkan). Meanwhile, Riker visits Quinn's quarters on the Enterprise and questions him about what he has in the small box he brought with him. Quinn tells Riker of a superior life form within the box. Riker attempts to leave but Quinn throws Riker across the room. A security team arrives to subdue Quinn, who is able to withstand a great amount of phaser-fire before he collapses. The ship's chief medical officer, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), finds a small protrusion {{on the back of his}} neck. She discovers that a bug-like parasite has latched itself onto Quinn's brain and is controlling him. Dr. Crusher warns Picard of this incident when he contacts the ship in private. He is advised that the infected person can only be stopped by a phaser set to 'kill': the captain points out that he is unarmed. He then has no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in to dinner with his three superiors.|$|E

For pipes which are critical {{to the performance of}} the system or so called critical piping where noresidual stresses are to be transferred to the pipe it is a common practice to use CES.In a constant effort support the load remains constant when the pipe moves from its cold position to the hot position. Thus irrespective of travel the load remains constant over the complete range of movement. Therefore it is called a constant load hanger. Compared to a variable load hanger where with movement the load varies & the hot load & cold load are two different values governed by the travel & spring constant.

(When only the object's destination and not its full path is given these algorithms can still be used as subroutines in a larger algorithm to compute such a path.) The first algorithm assumes that the robot must maintain contact with the object at all times, and produces a shortest path.

Not only was the GO not handling these suits, the GO, and particularly Mary Sue Hubbard, even refused to answer our questions about the suits because they viewed themselves answerable only to persons within the GO...Our attempts to get information were thwarted by Mary Sue Hubbard. She informed us that she did not appreciate our investigation of the GO and that if one were needed she would do it. In March 1981 she cut all of our communication lines <b>to</b> the <b>GO,</b> except through herself. It must be noted that Mary Sue Hubbard believed her position as Controller and as the [...] "Founder's wife" [...] to be unassailable and beyond reproach by anyone but Mr. Hubbard -- who was not around at the time, a fact that she was well aware of. This, plus her absolute control of the GO, made it difficult for the Church missionaires Org staff dispatched to achieve a target or specific goal to get anything done.It was made clear that we had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> overthrow the <b>GO</b> and dismiss everyone who had violated Church policy or the law. These activities ultimately led to a complete disband of the GO. I gathered a couple of dozen of the most proven Church executives from around the world and briefed them on the criminal and other unethical conduct of the GO. Together, we planned a series of missions to take over the GO, investigate it and reform it thoroughly. On July 13, 1981, a matter of weeks after we had uncovered what was going on, and with no advance warning <b>to</b> the <b>GO,</b> a coordinated series of CMO missions were sent out concurrently to take over the GO. However, {{there were a number of}} obstacles to overcome before the termination of the GO could be accomplished. Mary Sue Hubbard was still asserting her authority over the GO from her position as Controller.Mary Sue Hubbard was removed from her post before she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> jail.

Mary Sue Hubbard and the GO, however, did not simply capitulate. Within a day of Mary Sue Hubbard's resignation, senior GO officials secretly met with Mary Sue Hubbard and conspired to regain control of the GO. Mary Sue Hubbard signed a letter revoking her resignation and condemning the actions of the CMO. Scores of GO staff responded, locking the missionaires out of their premises and were intending to hire armed guards to bar access by me and the other Church officials who had ousted them. I then confronted the mutineers, and persuaded Mary Sue Hubbard to again resign, which ended the last vestige of GO resistance.|$|R
