5000|$|The Model T engine's {{ignition}} system used a flywheel-mounted magneto {{to produce the}} current necessary to produce a spark to initiate combustion. This current was distributed by the timer (analogous to a distributor in a modern vehicle) {{to one of the}} four trembler coils, one for each cylinder. The coil stepped up the voltage and discharged it to the spark plug in the cylinder. Ignition timing was adjusted manually by using the spark advance lever mounted on the steering column, which rotated the timer, advancing or retarding the ignition timing. A battery could be used for starting current: at hand-cranking speed, the magneto did not always produce sufficient current. A starting battery was not standard equipment until sometime in 1926, though all T's had a [...] "BAT" [...] position ("battery") on the <b>coil</b> <b>box</b> switch. A certain amount of skill and experience was required to find the optimal spark timing for any speed and load.|$|E
40|$|In a <b>coil</b> <b>box</b> {{between the}} {{roughing}} and finishing {{stands on a}} hot strip mill, a problem has been encountered that the entry region of the plate touches the bending rolls and deforms. As a result, the defective coil occurs. The condition of plate bending, which forms a new deformation feature in coiling, is analyzed. In this paper, the authors focus on the {{research of the effects}} of coiling parameters, such as the thickness of plate, roll speed and feeding speed of plate in <b>coil</b> <b>box,</b> and on specific plate bending. A finite element method is developed to simulate this coiling process. Based on numerical simulation, the effects of the coiling parameters on the mechanics and deformation of the bending plate are obtained. Numerical simulation tests have verified the validity of the developed model...|$|E

This paper presents a finite element analysis of fluid-solid heat transfer on thermal shields for iter pf (poloidal field) feeders <b>coil</b> terminal <b>box</b> (ctb), especially for cooling-pipes and his connection with panel firstly. The main objective of this analysis is to evaluate the heat-shielding effects of design layout and operating parameters of helium cooling-pipes with cfd (computational fluid dynamics) techniques. The model and method do not only consider the temperature distribution as well as the pressure dropping, also the deformation caused by thermal stress. Based on the results, the heat transfer in the ctb thermal shields has been studied and the detail design confirmed...|$|R
25|$|An {{experiment}} of 1932 was {{the addition}} of a stamp vending machine {{to the end of the}} post box. This necessitated an oval planform for the box even though it was only provided with a single posting aperture. At one end of the oval is the stamp machine and at the other is the posting aperture. The boxes have two doors; one for clearance of mail and one for emptying the cash and reloading the stamp machines. The machines were set to vend two halfpenny stamps in exchange for one old penny, the stamps being supplied in a long continuously wound roll known as a <b>coil.</b> <b>Boxes</b> were again made in two sizes, designated Type D and Type E, and carried raised lettering on the castings indicating the position of the stamp vending machine, as well as an array of small enamel plates warning users of the danger of bent coins and the need to wait for stamps to be issued before inserting more money. Several of each have survived in use in England and in the Isle of Man.|$|R

60|$|But {{these two}} harpoons, each {{by its own}} cord, are both {{connected}} with the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare <b>coils</b> of <b>box</b> line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.|$|R
60|$|Before {{lowering}} the boat for the chase, {{the upper end}} of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being <b>coiled</b> upon the <b>box</b> in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp-- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.|$|R
40|$|In {{amphibian}} oocytes, {{the maternal}} nuclear factor NF 7 associates with the elongating pre-mRNAs {{present on the}} numerous lateral loops of the lampbrush chromosomes. Here, we have purified NF 7 from an oocyte extract by {{using a combination of}} ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography and demonstrated {{for the first time that}} nucleoplasmic NF 7 exists primarily as free homotrimers. We confirmed the in vivo homotrimerization of NF 7 by using a glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay, and we further showed that it only requires the coiled-coil domain of the NF 7 tripartite motif/RBCC motif. Interestingly, we also obtained evidence that NF 7 is recruited to the nucleus as a homotrimer, and expression of several mutated forms of NF 7 in oocytes demonstrated that both the coiled <b>coil</b> and B <b>box</b> of NF 7 are required for its chromosomal association. Together, these data strongly suggest that the interaction of NF 7 with the active transcriptional units of RNA polymerase II is mediated by a trimeric B box. Finally, and in agreement with a role for NF 7 in pre-mRNA maturation, we obtained evidence supporting the idea that NF 7 associates with Cajal bodies...|$|R
40|$|In the U. S. A Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{system is}} one of most {{commonly}} used air system for multiple-zone commercial buildings due to its capability to meet the varying heating and cooling loads of different building thermal zones. One of key component of VAV system is the terminal VAV box. There are an air damper and a reheat <b>coil</b> in the <b>box.</b> How to effectively and efficiently control the VAV box {{plays a significant role}} to reduce energy consumption and maintain acceptable indoor environment in buildings. Currently, there are two control logics used for controlling VAV box, namely, single maximum and dual maximum control logics. The single maximum logic is the most common, where the room temperature setpoint is maintained by only adjusting the reheat coil valve position in the heating model. The damper position is kept as the minimal to satisfy the ventilation requirement only. On the other hand, the more advanced dual maximum control logic realizes the room air temperature control by adjusting both damper position and reheat coil valve position in the heating model. For the cooling model, both control logics have the same action to maintain room air temperature setpoint through adjusting the damper position. Ã‚ In this study, a model-based optimal control is explored to minimize the energy consumption of the VAV box with a hot water reheat coil. Data driven approach based on an Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is investigated to represent dynamics of the room thermal response. The similar data-driven approach is used to develop an energy consumption model of the VAV box. Measured data for the VAV box from a real building is used to train and test data-driven model. Such data includes room air temperature, outdoor air temperature, supply air temperature, supply air flow rate, damper position, reheat coil valve position and VAV box energy consumption. A platform of AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming) is used to for mathematical modeling and links to different optimization solvers. Ã‚ In addition, uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis are conducted to help understand the model behaviors and performance. In this study, the Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate samples for model inputs including supply air temperature, outdoor conditions, etc. A quantified sensitivity index of Sobol is calculated to indicate the impact level from different inputs or disturbances...|$|R
