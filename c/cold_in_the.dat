5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a <b>cold.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Argentina {{is a complex}} subject: the vast size {{of the country and}} {{considerable}} variation in altitude make {{for a wide range of}} climate types. Argentina has four seasons: winter (June–August), spring (September–November), summer (December–February) and autumn (March–May), all featuring different weather conditions. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, cool in the center and <b>cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather.|$|E
5|$|The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per {{breeding}} cycle, {{with long}} intervals between laying of {{first and second}} eggs. She nests on the ground {{under the cover of}} plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of <b>cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6months.|$|E

5|$|The winter {{affected}} {{many other}} European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls {{were seen in}} much of Central Europe and the southern Baltic region. De Bilt, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the anticyclone {{to the north of}} the United Kingdom several incoming Atlantic depressions which would normally have hit Britain were forced south to the Mediterranean region, resulting in Portugal, Spain and Southern France having more rain than usual while remaining relatively warm. For example, the February rainfall at Gibraltar was , three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme <b>cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, and much rain in the south. The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack of food in Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It forced schools in the Netherlands to shut, led to a mob attack on a goods train carrying coal in Copenhagen, and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The {{conditions}} affecting {{homeless people}} are somewhat specialized and have {{opened a new}} area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including scabies, are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme <b>cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter and they have little access to bathing facilities.

25|$|The American {{physician}} Fred R.

25|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, most of {{the winters}} were milder and usually wetter than average with daytime {{temperatures}} going below freezing a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 {{was the only one}} which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall & January 1997 was <b>cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 have however seen a different pattern with these three winters being defined as below or well below average with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; {{this was the first time}} three consecutive cold winters in the UK have occurred since the 1960s. Since the winter of 2012/2013, winters have been mild (exceptionally so in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016), although exceptionally wet. The winter of 2014/2015 was an oddity, in that it was generally quiet and sunny. December 2014 & January 2015 were a little milder than the average, February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 was cool and January 2017 was <b>cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{spasticity}} {{related to}} stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly {{performed by a}} physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various positionings. Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb. After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb {{with the use of}} splints or other tools to stabilize the joint. <b>Cold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates.
