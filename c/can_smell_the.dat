In many Sephardi and Mizrahi communities, branches of aromatic plants are used for this purpose, while Ashkenazim have traditionally used cloves. A special braided Havdalah candle {{with more than one}} wick is lit, and a blessing is recited. If a special havdalah candle is not available, two candles can be used, and the two flames joined when reciting the blessing.|$|E
500|$|On {{retirement}} as a player, O'Reilly {{became a}} cricket columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, remaining {{in that position}} until his health declined in 1988. [...] His first engagement was England's tour of Australia in 1946–47, and during this season he began {{a partnership with the}} Daily Express of London, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O'Reilly's articles for The Sydney Morning Herald were reproduced in its sister publication, The Age of Melbourne. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by Wisden as [...] "muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery ('You <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> gum-leaves off him', he wrote of one country boy just starting with Queensland)." [...] Jack McHarg said that [...] "The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him", even as his health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated one-day cricket, describing it as [...] "hit and giggle". He condemned the omission of Keith Miller in 1949–50 and said that to call it [...] "a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch". Reacting to the selection of the dour batting all rounder Ken Mackay, he wrote [...] "words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler". In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive bouncers at Everton Weekes in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, [...] "while Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power O'Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher." [...] In 1956, O'Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain Ian Johnson, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the 1956 Ashes tour. The Age took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O'Reilly refused to shy away from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when Bob Simpson became the first coach of Australia, O'Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway World Series Cricket, the commercialisation of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.|$|E
